00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Thank you, Kiran.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,840
Keep up the good job. Look after her for me.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,560
Yes.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,640
You and Tan are dating?

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,600
Yes.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,480
The mood is so romantic here.

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,960
We have to make the best out of it.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,160
Come, I’ll give you a massage.

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,320
Congratulations to our new production engineer manager – Kiran

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,040
Poon. Your fiancé is back.

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,960
Are they back together now?

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
I’m going to tell everyone in and out of this company…

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,240
that Pheem is having an affair with her employee.

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,520
It’s only a few days before our company’s party.

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,160
I’m afraid he might show up there.

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,640
You don’t have to worry about Poon.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
In case of emergency,

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,600
Kie and I have a secret weapon waiting for him.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,560
♫I’ve been watching you for so long but you never know it♫

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,240
♫That someone is secretly admiring you ♫

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,800
♫From over here, as it has always been♫

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,040
♫But every time I try to approach you… And tell you how I feel♫

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
♫My heart starts beating fast. I start to get nervous ♫

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,520
♫And I seem to can’t find my tongue♫

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,120
♫Suddenly, I feel…Ooh! Don’t look into my eyes ♫

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,760
♫Please stop staring at me♫

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,400
♫Should I just tell you how I feel? But somehow it’s just…♫

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,600
♫I’d rather love you like this then♫

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,040
Have you two made it official now, Pheem?

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
Poon.

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,720
I don’t remember inviting you here.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,160
Why not, Pheem?

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
Why can’t I be here, huh?

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,760
Isn’t this a welcome party for the vice president?

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,200
I’m your fiancé, so I have to be here.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,080
Right?

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Congratulations, Pheem.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
Hey, back off.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Kie.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,240
Watch your manners.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,160
Wait.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Are you a guy?

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Oh.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
You’re a girl.

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
So…

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
How come a low-rank employee like you could talk so casually to the VP?

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,720
If you’re here to make a scene, just leave.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Or else, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Hang on.

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Sorry, so sorry. I was wrong earlier.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,840
You’re not a low-rank employee anymore.

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,840
I have to call you a manager.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,560
Right, Miss Kiran?

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,520
Hey, give me a glass of that.

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,320
Let’s congratulate her a bit. Here…

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,280
Miss Kiran. Please.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Cheers!

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,920
Look.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,360
What exactly do you want?

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,960
I just want to congratulate you.

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I just want to say congratulations.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,400
Okay?

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
Usually, for someone to get promoted as a manager at this kind of company…

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,520
it’s not easy at all.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,800
You’re fucking amazing.

66
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,240
Respect indeed.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,800
Usually…

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,160
What’s that word you use to call a person…

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Who quickly makes their way up in their career?

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Oh, a social climber! But you’re different.

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
You’re a tits climber.

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,880
No, wait. Both of you are tits climbers.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,160
Hey!

74
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,800
Kie.

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Look.

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,560
You can talk shitty all you want.

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,880
But you shouldn’t look down on women.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Who the fuck are you to shove me like that?

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,040
Oh!

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,400
That’s right, you’re a cheater.

81
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Fine.

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Hey, move!

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
Guys!

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,360
Listen up! Please come over here.

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
Come, come.

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,440
I have something to tell you.

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Have you ever seen a cheater?

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Have you?

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,920
Do you want to know what this person looks like?

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
Do you?

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,240
She looks like that.

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,000
That’s the face of a cheater.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,840
Of someone who cheats on her fiancé.

94
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,400
And has absolutely no experience in management.

95
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,080
This kind of woman...

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Do you still find her respectable enough to be a company president?

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
Do you find her respectable?

98
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Do you?

99
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
No, right?

100
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
You wouldn’t want to work for her.

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,840
A company president who is a woman like that.

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Who would fucking respect her?

103
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,160
It’s you who is cheating on her.

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,160
You’ve cheated on her since the first year you got engaged.

105
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
What?

106
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,360
Do you have proof?

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
You want proof?

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,680
Pock!

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,520
Guys, show them the photos.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
You’re so doomed now.

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Everyone, look at this.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,760
While we were apart, I was worried…

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,360
that Pheem might have to get married to a bad guy.

115
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
So, Pock and I did a thorough check on his profile…

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
and kept our eyes on Poon’s behaviour.

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
Gotcha, asshole.

118
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
We found out that…

119
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
right after Pheem went to England,

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
he dated women like changing his underwear.

121
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,440
Everyone, he even used to make a girl pregnant…

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
and told her to get rid of the baby.

123
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,040
But with Pock being so nosy, busybody…

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,600
and holding a vengeful grudge against him…

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,840
Hold on.

126
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
We’re exposing him, not me.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,040
Oh, okay.

128
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
Pock was so sure that wasn’t the only bad thing he did.

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
Pock decided to investigate more.

130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,360
And finally found out Poon is addicted to an online gambling.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Pocky!

132
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,160
We knew then…

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,480
that one day this would be useful to you, Pheem.

134
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
So, we decided to gather all evidence we could…

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,440
to make him accept the engagement cancellation…

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,400
and unable to blame it on you.

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,360
Thank you, Kie.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,080
I never thought you’d foresee all this.

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Thank you for doing it for me.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,960
You bitch!

141
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,400
Are you a DSI agent or what? Why do you have so much information about me?

142
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,760
No, I’m not.

143
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,840
I’m just nosy, and like to gather all evidence…

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
so that I could expose you!

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Asshole!

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Psycho bitch!

147
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,680
Sasaeng!

148
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
Shut it off now!

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
Hey, don’t!

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
Get off me!

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,280
- I said stop. / - Shut it off!

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
Get off me!

153
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
No, stop it, yeah?

154
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Yeah my ass, mother fucker!

155
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Hey, don’t call my boyfriend like that!

156
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Get off me!

157
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Tell them to shut it off right now!

158
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,520
No, I won’t. So what?

159
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,920
Hey!

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Just accept it and call off the engagement.

161
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
Or I’ll expose you even more.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,240
That’s right. If you don’t stop,

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
I’ll send everything to “Hunger for Fame” TV show.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Do you want that?

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
What the fuck?

166
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
It’s you who should be on that show!

167
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
You too!

168
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
You, you, you..

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,320
and also you!

170
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,880
Shut it!

171
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
No!

172
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes!

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,520
No!

174
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Get out of my way!

175
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Get off me! Shut it off!

176
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,160
- No! / - Shut it!

177
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,680
Shut it off!

178
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,120
No!

179
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
Enough, Poon!

180
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,400
Enough.

181
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Uncle Poj.

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,960
Uncle.

183
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
You can’t do this to me.

184
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,440
You’re the one who told us to get engaged.

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Or are you going to take back the promise you gave to my father?

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
That promise is long gone, Poon.

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,840
What? Gone?

188
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,120
Yes.

189
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,920
You said it yourself that day, that you promised…

190
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,400
to love and be honest with my daughter for the rest of your life.

191
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,000
But just a year later, I started hearing people talking about you cheating on her.

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
It’s not like that at all. I didn’t love those women.

193
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,240
I was just lonely.

194
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
Lonely?

195
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,360
Pheem treats me like a nobody.

196
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
I could never win over her heart. She never picks up my call.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,120
You’re nothing like Kiran, Poon.

198
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,440
All these 7 years, she has never dated or gone out with anyone…

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,800
despite having no title to claim, unlike you who’s the fiancé.

200
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,760
So, you just decided to get rid of me…

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,400
and choose Kiran instead?

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,880
This fucking woman…

203
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,160
to replace me?

204
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,920
So what if she’s a woman?

205
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,880
I think she’s more of a gentleman than you.

206
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
No, I won’t accept it.

207
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,160
I’m not going to break up with her!

208
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,400
That’s your problem, Poon.

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
But I am done with you now.

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,680
And I’m not going to blame you any further.

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,800
Fine.

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
Fine, Uncle Poj.

213
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,720
If you’re going to call off my engagement with Pheem,

214
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,080
I’ll tell my father to withdraw his investments from every project he’s doing with you!

215
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Poon!

216
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,640
Do you want that?

217
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,880
I’ll make you see…

218
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,880
that you as a captain of this company…

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
is nothing without my family!

220
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,720
Excuse me, you’re a grown-ass man now.

221
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
Stop throwing tantrums like you were a baby.

222
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Why don’t you just throw yourself down on the floor kicking and screaming too?

223
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,600
So that you’d look like a complete idiot.

224
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Fuck off!

225
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,320
Tan!

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,920
Fine.

227
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Do whatever you want.

228
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
If you want to withdraw your investments, then go ahead.

229
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,880
But I’ll never make the same mistake twice and destroy my daughter’s happiness...

230
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,000
for my own satisfaction again.

231
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,320
Dad.

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
I’m okay.

233
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Uncle Poj...

234
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,320
Are you really going to throw away this billion-dollar opportunity just for her?

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,320
Yes.

236
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,920
My company takes pride in their high efficiency and quality of work.

237
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
We also have plenty of talented employees.

238
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,960
It’s your father’s company that would be at a loss.

239
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,440
Dad, I’ll do my best to help you.

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Me too.

241
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,520
I think it’s better if you leave here right now.

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Security guards.

243
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,000
Please take this man away.

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,000
Please come with us. / - No.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,640
Don’t touch me!

246
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,360
Get off me! I said get off me!

247
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay.

248
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
Okay.

249
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
I’ll go with you.

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,240
But let me congratulate them first.

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,760
Let me congratulate them first.

252
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
Okay.

253
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,760
I wish…

254
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,880
each and everyone in this place…

255
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
a full load of shit!

256
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,560
I hope you’ll fuck up in everything!

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,240
A homo company!

258
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,400
Let’s go.

259
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,720
Wait, Poon.

260
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
I can’t stand it anymore!

261
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
Take me out of here!

262
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,160
Quickly! Go!

263
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,080
Let’s go!

264
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,880
Go, everyone! Get him!

265
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,200
Quick!

266
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,640
Go get him!

267
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Dad.

268
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
Are you okay?

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,840
I’m okay. Don’t worry.

270
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,000
I’m so sorry, Dad.

271
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,440
You can count on me.

272
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
We’ll go through this together.

273
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
Thank you, dear.

274
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Let’s go.

275
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
You look stressed, Dad.

276
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,520
Is it because you still can’t find a new investor?

277
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
It was all my fault.

278
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,560
I mixed business with personal life.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
Your tie is messy now.

280
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
Let me fix it for you.

281
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
There you go.

282
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
So handsome like usual.

283
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Don’t worry, Dad.

284
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,280
Let’s start over again together.

285
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,160
We’ll go through it together.

286
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,560
Thank you, dear.

287
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,480
I’m sorry.

288
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,960
[Door knocking]

289
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
Excuse me.

290
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,800
What is it?

291
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,800
Someone would like to talk to you, sir.

292
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,560
My face is a bit oily.

293
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,880
Is he on the phone yet?

294
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,520
Is he? Why so slow? Geez, damn slow!

295
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,160
That Poj dude is always slow like a turtle.

296
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,760
Hello, Poj speaking.

297
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,320
You didn’t hear it earlier, did you? Let’s say you didn’t.

298
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
Well, it’s like this.

299
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Yes?

300
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,640
I just talked to Kaokie. She told me your company…

301
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,680
is now looking for a new investor. Is that right?

302
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

303
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Would you be interested to have an auntie like me as your business partner?

304
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Are you serious, Auntie?

305
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,520
Of course, I’ve always been kidding.

306
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,360
But this time, I’m serious.

307
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,680
Thank you so much! Thank you!

308
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,480
It’s all right. Let’s talk about it later then.

309
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,720
So…can I talk to Kaokie?

310
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, of course. Thank you.

311
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
She wants to talk to you.

312
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,720
Yes.

313
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
Oh, it’s oily again.

314
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes, Granny?

315
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,720
Sweetie, come straight home after you get off from work.

316
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,600
I’m already at your house.

317
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,320
We’ll make Shabu for dinner.

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, I’ll be there, Granny.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,840
Okay, love you, dear.

320
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,400
So, I’m done here.

321
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,760
Please continue with your father-and-daughter talk.

322
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
I’m leaving.

323
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,320
Auntie said she is going to invest with us.

324
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,600
Really? Congratulations, Dad!

325
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,760
Cheers!

326
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Pheem, finally your life is free of all sorrows now.

327
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,240
And you’re also able to get a douche bag like Poon out of your life.

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,520
And even get your company a new business partner!

329
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,960
You’re really something, Kie.

330
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,360
Oh, so does this mean…

331
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,840
you won’t be able to fire her from now on even if you want to, Pheem?

332
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey, watch your mouth, Pock.

333
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,800
Thank you, Pock.

334
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,880
If it weren’t for you, I would’ve been in so much trouble.

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I wouldn’t be able to gather that much evidence myself.

336
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,480
Aww, Pheem. You don’t have to thank me.

337
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,400
You should rather thank that girlfriend of yours.

338
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
She’s the one who foresaw and took care of everything.

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,120
She had all evidence prepared especially for you, Pheem.

340
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
Do you know that she has never given up on you?

341
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
Thank you.

342
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Look at them, Pheem.

343
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,200
Pock.

344
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,920
I also have to congratulate you.

345
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,760
For finally finding someone like Tan.

346
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Someone so madly in love like this is hard to find.

347
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,040
Aww!

348
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,960
Don’t say that. I’m not so down bad…

349
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,480
aren’t I, little one?

350
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
Yeah.

351
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,960
You’re so tiny, baby. Look…

352
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,320
Pock.

353
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,640
What?

354
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,400
Tiny my arse.

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,160
Seriously, what kind of potion did you give him?

356
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,640
Well, it was from that temple in Japan.

357
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,840
[Please give me a lover within this month]
I wrote on it, “Please give me a lover within this month”.

358
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,800
And here he is, tada!

359
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,560
Ahhhh!

360
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,320
Wait.

361
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
Don’t they usually make a wish about studying there?

362
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
But I already finished college.

363
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
So, I made a wish about love instead.

364
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Because you can never stop learning when it comes to love.

365
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,080
Right?

366
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
Oh, wow.

367
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,320

But don’t worry, Uncle.

399

Since you came back from Japan,

408

you’ve come home late every day.

409
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:58,738

To compensate for those seven years I’ve lost.

413
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,938

439

Pheem is coming home quite late these days.

440
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,658
Is it because she’s always spending time with you after work?

441

Yes, sir.

442
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,738
If I give her a reprimand, she’d surely be mad at me.

443
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,818
And the atmosphere in our house would be awful.

453

do you really have to see each other like this every day?

Pheem, come out!

554
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:20,298
Hello.

555
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:23,178
Hello, Auntie. Hello, everyone.

556
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:26,738
So? Isn’t she pretty?

557
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,658
Yes!

558
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,418
What’s going on, Auntie?

559
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,298
We’ve brought you a few gifts.

560
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,818
Maybe not a few though.

561
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,218
This tray is full of gold bars.

562
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:44,018
And on this tray is a title deed of a land in the middle of the city centre.

563
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:47,698
There’s also a tray with a blank cashier cheque on it.

564
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:51,738
Kaokie’s grandmother is absolutely incredible, isn’t she?

565
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:56,698
So, everyone, is Pheem pretty?

566
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:59,218
Yes!

567
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:07,018
So pretty, dear.

568
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:10,618
How are you doing, Poj?

569
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,338
I’m good, Auntie.

570
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:16,738
- Do you remember Korn and Karn? / - Yes?

571
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:18,418
Of course, I do.

572
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,658
He’s such a famous architect.

573
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:22,178
Why wouldn’t I remember him?

574
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:25,498
Well, it’s like this.

575
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:27,298
When Kla graduated from his college,

576
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,618
these two had a big studio built for him…

577
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,818
as a gift for their son’s graduation.

578
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:36,458
And now,

579
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,458
since this girl, Kaokie,

580
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,098
has been promoted at work.

581
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:45,058
They’ve decided to build a big house for her as a gift.

582
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:46,658
And it’s almost done now.

583
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:51,938
That’s such a meaningful gift indeed.

584
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:54,018
Designed by the father, and decorated by the mother.

585
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:56,218
I’m sure it’d be such a lovely house to live in.

586
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,698
Well, Poj…

587
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:02,618
Can I ask you something?

588
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,698
- Of course. / - Do you…

589
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:14,698
Do you perhaps want your daughter to live in a house full of love and tenderness too?

590
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:17,938
Would that be a good idea?

591
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:20,778
My daughter is very hard to please, Auntie.

592
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:22,258
Dad.

593
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:24,378
But then,

594
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:28,338
if you promise that you will not return her to me, then I’ll accept it.

595
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,778
Oh, please don’t worry about that. We’ll never let you down.

596
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:35,898
We, Pipittayaphongsa family, are true to their words.

597
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,538
Well, if you promise you won’t return her to me,

598
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:41,138
then she’s all yours now.

599
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,298

as another daughter in this family.

636
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,858
So am I.

637
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:57,938
We’ve designed this house especially for Kie.

638
00:36:57,938 --> 00:37:01,378
So that she can stay there with the person she loves.

639
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:04,538
We were so glad when we knew that that person is you.

640
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:11,098
I also helped with the design and gave my all in it.

641
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,538
I hope you both’ll like it.

642
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,058
Do you like it, dear?

643
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:16,298
Yes, Mum.

644
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:18,378
It’s so beautiful. Thank you.

645
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,338
I’ve never seen Kie this happy before.

646
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,258
Thank you, Pheem.

647
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:31,178
For loving my daughter as she is.

648
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,898
And for being patient with this tight-lipped girl.

649
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:38,738
Well said, honey.

650
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:43,218
Please look after each other from now on.

651
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:47,098
Let’s hold hands and be together for a very long time.

652
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:47,978
Yes.

653
00:37:49,378 --> 00:37:50,898
Don’t look.

654
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,698
Granny, don’t cry. I’m going to cry too.

655
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:55,258
I’m so happy.

656
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:56,938
Thank you.

657
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,498
In the future,

658
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,578
should you two have any problems,

659
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:06,258
try to be considerate and talk it through with each other.

660
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:10,298
Don’t keep being so tight-lipped. Got it, my dear Kie?

661
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:14,218
You’ve learnt your lesson now, haven’t you?

662
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,578
If you keep being so tight-lipped,

663
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:19,618
many problems will surely arise.

664
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:23,778
Hey, I’ve quit being tight-lipped.

665
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:26,218
I tell you how much I love you every day, don’t I?

666
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,498
Come, I’ll explain it to you.

667
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,858
This one…

668
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:33,538
is this house.

669
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,738
Kie’s house is this one.

670
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,978
This area is for parking.

671
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,298
You can park right under it.

672
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,618
So, I have to buy it for them then.

673
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,138
Oh my goodness.

674
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:46,418
I want 10 of them.

675
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,738
Where are you staying, Granny?

676
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:50,578
That’s a dining room.

677
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,058
And it has a view of the outside.

678
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:54,378
This is a great view.

679
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:55,778
Oh, is there a garden here?

680
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,018
Yes, there's a garden here.

Kie, come here.

699
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,009
I’m curious about something.

700
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:13,489
I think this dog’s house…

701
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:16,489
that your dad has designed is kind of weird.

702
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,529
Look, it doesn’t seem to fit with the rest of the design.

703
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:23,409
The detail is not right. It’s very strange.

704
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:25,249
Is it really a dog’s house?

705
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:27,449
Oh! Or maybe…

706
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:30,329
are you going to use it as your harem?

707
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:34,529
Aww, you’re a badass, buddy.

708
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:36,449
You could say that too.

709
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:39,249
It’s for you.

710
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,289
Huh?

711
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:51,249
I asked Dad to design it for you.

712
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,449
It’ll be right here.

713
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,649

714
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:00,889
Kie!

715
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,689
What kind of joke is this?

716
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:08,209
I don’t get it. What do you mean?

717
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:10,129
My house…

718
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:14,649
I’m not kidding. I really asked him to design it for you.

719
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,289
What?

720
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:19,009
I want you in every moment of my life.

721

Well…

763
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:26,409
Can I bring my guy here? I’m just asking though.

764
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:28,569
Just in case he wants to come to my place.

It’s you who should be crying not me.

768

What? I thought you first met him in Japan, like me.

777

Nope, we first met in Samed.

778

Tan secretly took a photo of me

779
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,089
when I was dancing to fulfill my vow to the Sea Ogress.

780
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:35,049
What? Tan!

781
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:57,289
Don’t tell me you have a crush on me because of this dance?

782
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,289
Your every move impressed me from the very first moment I saw you.

783
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:06,409
Just like when Phra Aphai Mani got enchanted by the Sea Ogress’s magic.

784
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:11,169
So, do you like me because I’m pretty…

785
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,009
or is it because I’m ugly?

786
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:17,329
Pock, I love you even if you’re ugly

You bit my ear again.

793
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:29,289
It was your chin I bit earlier.

No.

And we’re both naked. It’s just…

804
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:05,569
I’ve always dreamt that one day a guy will propose to me.

905
00:56:17,193 --> 00:56:24,953
♫ Always smile whenever I see you ♫

906
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:31,473
♫ Just a few words with you make me so delighted ♫

907
00:56:31,873 --> 00:56:37,673
♫ When I don’t see you, my world is so blue ♫

908
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:44,113
♫ At least just a glimpse of your house will do ♫

909
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:49,793
♫ Will you also feel the same? ♫

910

♫ I love you and only you. Want to see your face every day ♫

912
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,433
♫ I’ve never looked at anyone. I’ve loved you for so long ♫

913
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,433
♫ But I can only keep it inside ♫

914
00:57:09,553 --> 00:57:15,953
♫ I love you and only you. It’s more than I can say ♫

915

♫ What about you? Please tell me how you feel ♫

916
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:34,433
♫ Waiting for that day, the very best day ♫

917
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:41,713
♫ Waiting for a Valentine’s Day to ask you about it ♫

918
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:48,913
♫ I’m quite worried but I’m more curious ♫

919
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:54,593
♫ I should give it a try. Can’t just leave it like this ♫

920
00:57:54,593 --> 00:58:00,673

I made it especially for you. How’s it?

958
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:53,593
Am I getting better?

959
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:58,433
Well, they do look like pigs.

960
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:00,553
So cute.

961
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,393

What I did for you is nothing compared to how I feel for you.

967
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:39,873
I love you, Kie. I’ve always loved you…

968

Let me see if you’re no longer tight-lipped like you just said.

974

You’re right. It’s so soft now.

Pheem.

Ouch, Pheem!

Why did you flick it?

981
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:15,193
You’re not stuttering anymore, are you?

982
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:18,193
