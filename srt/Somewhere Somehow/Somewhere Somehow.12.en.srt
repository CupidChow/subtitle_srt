[Previously]
Can you not go? Please stay with me.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,020
I’m scared.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,180
I’ll stay with you. Don’t be scared.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,220
That no matter what will happen, don’t ever let go of my hand again.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Yes, I promise.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,460
The office in Thailand just called,

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,940
and asked us to submit the project earlier.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,980
Don’t worry, Pheem. I’ll do everything,

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,380
to make it in time.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,900
Are you not going to work?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,300
How can I leave you alone when you’re like this?

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,140
Don’t tell me she still hasn’t told you the truth?

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,940
I know the truth now.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,260
The truth…

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,260
Your agreement with my dad.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,860
You guys can go first, or stay here for a bit.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,020
Okay, sure.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,660
Tob, you go ahead first. Take this too.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,360
Sure.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,300
I’ll get some air for a bit.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:58,860
Yes.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,620
Thank you.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,340
Not tired, not tired, not tired.

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,180
Are you tired?

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,540
Not at all.

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,100
I’m sorry, Pheem…that I didn’t have time for you at all.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,060
Or…should we just do it here…like last night?

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,300
- Don’t even think about it.
- Ouch, Pheem!

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,740
Stop it.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,660
Come, let me put the necklace on for you. Or should I take it back?

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,760
Hey, if you dare take it back, I’ll kill you, remember?

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,900
Who’d dare to forget that? Come.

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,260
Let me see. Where does it hurt?

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,620
- Here, right here.
- Here?

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,100
Where else?

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,730
Here?

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,660
It feels so good. If you keep pampering me like this,

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,020
I’ll definitely be so head over heels for you.

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,140
What if I don’t pamper you, will you still love me?

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,660
Aww, of course. How could I stop loving you?

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,740
Please do it again.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,900
Okay, come.

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,060
Where is it? Here?

44
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,460
- On the back?
- Here.

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,900
On the back? Kie!

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,100
Come, let’s get back to work.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,260
Okay, let’s go.

48
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,960
Pheem, Kie. Please come see me at the office.

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,060
Yes.

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,220
Please don’t worry, sir.

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,100
We’ve increased our speed on the production line for 18%.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,260
From my recent calculation, if we’re able to maintain the speed at this rate…

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,940
we’ll certainly be able to get everything done before the deadline.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,260
By what method?

67
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,700
Raise the OT?

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,860
No, sir. We’ve hired more part-time interns who are Japanese.

69
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,100
We could save more costs this way.

70
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,380
But that means there’s an additional cost.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,860
Just a little, sir.

72
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,020
Compared to the cost of opportunity loss if we fail to meet the deadline, it’s worth it.

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,300
You’ve planned everything well.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,660
You’re doing a better job than an engineer manager himself.

75
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,860
Yes.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Thank you, Kiran.

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,580
I know this job is tough. I’m also pressured by the clients too.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,500
I’m counting on you.

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,580
Don’t worry, sir. This is the VP’s first job.

80
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,020
I’m going to do my best on it.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,620
Pheem and I made a bet…that if she could finish this job before the deadline,

82
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,420
she’d continue looking after our branch here. She doesn’t want to go back to Thailand.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,000
So what, Pheem? Do you still want to stay here? I can take care of that for you.

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,580
Err…it’s not like that, Dad.

85
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,220
I’m working this hard because I want to get this project done on time.

86
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,660
And because I don’t want to disappoint my sensei.

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,780
Does this mean you’re coming back to work with me in Thailand?

88
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,900
Yes. Dad…

89
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,300
if I have a good team to support me like this,

90
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,060
I’m more than ready to take care of everything at our company.

91
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
Good, I’ll be waiting.

92
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,580
Keep up the good job. Look after her for me.

93
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,730
Yes.

94
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,900
I have to go for a meeting.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Yes.

- You can do it!
- You can do it!

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,760
Okay, let's take a seat.

101
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,460
Okay.

102
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,940
With everyone’s help, we've finally competed this project successfully.

103

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,460
Honestly, I can’t believe we can actually make it in time.

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,580
That’s because you had recovered from your broken wrist and came back to help me just in time.

107
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,140
I’m really grateful to both of you.

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,420
Please don’t forget this junior of yours when you go back to Thailand, Miss VP.

109
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,740
Of course, I wouldn’t.

110
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,800
So, when are you going back to Thailand?

111
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,000
In a few days. My friend will come over. I’m going to take her around for a bit.

112
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,500
Have fun then.

113
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,940

114
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,100
Wait, Kie.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
Do we have to pick up Pock this afternoon?

116
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,530
Oh, that’s right.

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,700
Let’s finish eating and hurry there.

118
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,700
Everyone, cheers!

119
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,820
Cheers!

120
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Pock.

121
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,730
Kie!

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
I miss you so much!

123
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,780
My dear hubby. Give me a kiss.

124
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,100
Geez, you’re overreacting.

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,180
Do you want to see Explosive Pheem again?

126
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,820
Oh.

127
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,940
Welcome back, Pock!

128
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,860
Yes. Give me a hug, come on. Aww, miss you so much!

129
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,740
That’s enough.

130
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,620
Geez! What?

131
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,700
It’s been a while, you seem to look prettier.

132
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,860
Or, perhaps…are you in love?

133
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,260
Well, I…

134
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
What the heck are you doing?

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,460
I’m trying to look suspicious here. Geez, forget about me.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,420
Anyway…you look so happy, Pheem.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,580
That thing I gave you last time, do you often use it?

138
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,260
Pock!

139
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,780
Aww, okay fine. I won’t tease you then.

140
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,660
Let’s go home. I’m exhausted right now.

141
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,900
Also, I have something surprising to tell you.

142
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,300
What? You and Tan are dating?

143
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes.

144
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,420
Wait, like girlfriend and boyfriend?

145
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

146
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,700
So, the reason you have disappeared lately…

147
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,260
is because of him then.

148
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,780
So? You’re also glued to your wife.

149
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,580
Can’t blame me for that.

150
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,740
Wait, since when did it happen, Pock?

151
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,540
Did you do a black magic on him?

152
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,700
Hey, what are you saying? It’s pure love.

153
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,540
During those few days on our trip together,

154
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,420
I had to keep distracting Tan away for Kie.

155
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,820
So, we got to spend a lot of time together.

156
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,540
And you know, when a pretty girl meets a handsome guy…

157
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,260
you can’t deny there’s some chemistry there. And the mood there was quite romantic.

158
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,740
So, our love chemistry just sparked and exploded.

159
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,140
The night before Tan would go back to England, I could no longer keep my feelings inside.

160
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,530
Are you still awake?

161
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,730
Yeah.

162
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,380
Why are you still up?

163
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,020
I’m thirsty.

164
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,780
Also, Kaokie’s snoring so loud I can’t sleep.

165
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,530
Yeah.

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,930
So…I’ll sit with you then.

167
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,140
Someone used to tell me…

168
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,820
that if you sip a beer before going to bed, it’d make you sleep better. Is that true?

169
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah.

170
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Really?

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,140
Pock!

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
Oh, we’re drinking from the same glass.

173
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,340
Tan, this beer is so strong.

174
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,060
Pock, I think I should go to bed now.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
Please feel free.

176
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,540
Well, I guess I should go to bed too.

177
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,340
Tan.

178
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,620
But Kaokie really snores so loud. I don’t think I’d be able to sleep.

179
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,900
And Pheem probably has her door locked. Where will I sleep then?

180
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,460
Well, you can sleep here. I’ll go find somewhere to sleep.

181
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,580
Tan! I’m cold.

182
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,060
I’ll give you my blanket too.

183
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,940
Staying under the same blanket like this is so warm, isn’t it?

184
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,730
Yeah.

185
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:13,730
But…I'm a guy and you're a girl. Would it be okay like this?

186
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,060
Don’t you also feel the same as I do? Look at me.

187
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,700
You’re single. I’m single. The mood here is also romantic.

188
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,340
And we’re sleeping under the same blanket.

189
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,780
Please tell me that you also feel the same.

190
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,930
Yeah.

191
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,660
Tan, do you know every time you say ’yeah’, it really makes my heart tremble?

192
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,160
Really?

193
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,460
Damn you!

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,100
You’re leaving tomorrow. I’m going to make you never forget about me.

196
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,340

197
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,940

- Yeah?

- Yeah?

201
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,580
Tan, don’t!

202
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,860
There’re lots of Sakura trees here. I’m shy.

203
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,740
But I’m not.

206
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,180
What? Did you force yourself on him?

207
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,360
No, I didn’t. It’s called a mutual consent.

208
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,460
Wow.

209
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,740
Come on. Cheers!

210
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,900

Oh, okay.

214
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,260
Yeah, so that’s it. We both decided to start seeing each other after that.

215
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,740
Tan has always been like this though. Unlike other people, he seems to like something peculiar.

216
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,020
Pheem, are you saying I’m peculiar?

217
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,340
No, I’m not.

218
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,860
So, that’s why.

219

220
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,560
Not gonna tell you.

Listen, Tan and I are just friends.

320
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:35,871
If I were to think of him more than that, we would’ve dated long ago.

321
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,311
But still…

322
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,111
why didn’t he contact Pock instead?

323
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,751
He’s already seeing her, isn’t he? Why did he have to contact you?

324
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,511
Ah, I see.

325
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:53,851
But then how could he have surprised her, Kie?

326
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,891
I also didn’t get it at first why he wanted to come to Japan too.

327
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,951
Now I know it’s to see Pock.

328
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:04,991
I still don’t trust him.

329
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,591
He used to have a crush on you for a long time.

330
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,891
And suddenly, he’s dating Pock?

331
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,911
Is he going to break my friend’s heart anytime soon?

332
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,191
About that, I think we should be more worried about Tan.

333
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:20,951
Kie.

334
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:26,351
Now that your best friend is dating someone, you’re becoming possessive of her, aren’t you?

335
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:30,891
Of course, I am. She’s like my twin sister.

336
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,591
Don’t you want to see her happy?

337
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,111
Look at her.

338
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,311

340
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,191
It’s time for her to live her own life.

341
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:56,711
I think Pock also wants to have someone by her side to take care of her…

342
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:00,071
just like how you have me.

343
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,791
Then you should tell Tan…

344
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,951
that he should never disappoint her.

345
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:14,551

346
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,031
I’ll get him.

00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:26,071

353
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,071
That’s all right. We can just tell Pock.

354
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:09,831

00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:13,071
Well…what are you saying?

356
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:13,891
Do you?

357
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:14,951
Yes, I do.

358
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:17,311
Pock.

359
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,111
Yes, Pheem? Is everything all right?

360
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:24,391
Well, I only booked two rooms.

361
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,831
I forgot Tan would be here too.

362
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,391
I’m so sorry. I didn’t book it beforehand too.

363
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:33,231
It’s all right, Pheem. I can stay with Tan.

364
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:34,431
Pock!

365
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:35,051
What?

366
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,791
You’re a girl. How can you say that?

367
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:42,511
Kie, Tan and I already did that boom balaka together.

368
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,391
It’s too late to separate us now.

369
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,221
Little one.

370
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:49,391
Why? Don’t you miss me too?

371
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,671
I want that love we’ve lost along the way.

372
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:54,831
Please.

373
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:00,791
Good boy.

374
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:08,551
Also, they have a private onsen here. It’s perfect for a honeymoon.

375
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:11,351
I’d rather not crash on you two.

376
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:15,271
So, I’ll share a room with him, okay?

377
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:18,791
Let’s go, Tan. We don’t have much time.

378
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,951
Come.

379
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:22,871
Let’s go.

380
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,191
They have a private onsen too.

381
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,751
Kie!

382
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,471
Pheemmmm!

383
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:53,311
Wow, so beautiful.

384
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,871
Come take a look over here, Kie. It’s so beautiful.

385
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:09,351
Stop it.

386
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,031
The mood is so romantic here.

387
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:16,351
We have to make the best out of it.

388
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,051
Are you having dirty thoughts?

389
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:23,671
No, not dirty at all.

390
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:25,511
I was just thinking…

391
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,471
that we should go use an onsen.

392
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,551
We’ve been running around all day.

393
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,271
I love you, Pheem.

394
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:38,391
Why are you telling me?

395
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,311
I already quit being tight-lipped.

396
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:42,831
So, I’m going to keep saying it.

397
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:44,111
- Love you.
- Kie.

398
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:45,451
Stop it.

399
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,471
Enough.

400
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:54,511
Fine. Let’s go use an onsen.

401
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:55,991
Okay.

402
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,631
Kie.

403
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,071
What are you doing?

404
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,871
Who’d go to an onsen with their clothes on?

405
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:05,111
Then go get changed first. Don’t…

406
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:06,231
Not like this.

407
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:07,271
Don’t, Kie.

408
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:08,551
Pheem.

409
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,471
Don’t!

410
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:17,951
Kie, you’re always teasing me.

411
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:24,191
Unbelievable, isn’t it? About Pock and Tan.

412
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:28,591
Yeah, but I’m happy for her though.

413
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,991
At first, I thought it’d only be two of us on a honeymoon here.

414
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:38,711
But with those two tagging along, it’s kind of nice too.

415
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:43,431
We can…have our honeymoon somewhere else later.

416
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,651
What did you just say?

417
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,651
Our honeymoon.

418
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,831
Whoa, aren’t you jumping the gun here?

419
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:56,631
We’ve only slept together a few times, but you already called it a honeymoon?

420
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,951
Hey, stop it.

421
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:58,591
Pheem.

422
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,431
Okay, okay. A honeymoon it is.

423
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:07,751
Should we start then?

424
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:11,391
And let’s not stop until late morning tomorrow, shall we?

425
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,431
Geez, stop that. You and your dirty talks.

426
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:20,311
Come, I’ll give you a massage. You’ve been working hard for many days.

427
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:21,671

430
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,691
I want to call off our engagement.

Please. I have no more strength.

I thought you said we’d have our honeymoon until tomorrow morning.

What? Are you going to take back…

Stop it, Kie. Stop.

456
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,935
Stop it. My cheeks are swelling right now.

457
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,775
Do we really have to go back to Thailand?

458
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:09,275
Why? Don’t you want to go back?

459
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:16,335
I’m worried about Poon.

My apology for being late.

Since the president has another meeting this morning,

494
00:36:56,895 --> 00:37:01,095
he has asked me to attend this meeting on his behalf.

495

The first topic of our meeting today…

497
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:12,415
is to congratulate the person who has been promoted in the coming financial year.

498
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:20,275
Congratulations to our new production engineer manager – Kiran Pipittayaphongsa.

00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:38,535
Congratulations. Please stay with us for a very long time, Miss Kiran.

502
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:40,895
Come to think of it,

503
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:44,815
Miss Kiran is considered the first youngest production engineer manager…

504
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:47,655
that our company has ever had.

505
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:53,775
And she’s also a main force in driving and creating various new production lines.

506
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:57,415
Her latest performance on the production line in Japan…

507
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:01,855
is one of the best works which helps save our company from crisis.

508
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:05,455
That is the reason why she has been promoted.

509
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:08,655
I’ll let her say something to all of you.

510
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,015
What?

511
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:10,655

Kie, isn’t it too short?

515
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,575
What else do you want me to say?

516
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:34,375
Just say something. Make it longer.

517
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:44,615
Thank you. I’ll do my best for…

518
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:48,895
for our company.

Why didn’t you tell me that you’d also attend the meeting, Miss?

522
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:03,975
It wouldn’t have been a surprise then.

00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:07,295
Congratulations, my dear girl.

524
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:16,335

Yes.

532
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,215
Why didn’t you tell me you’d come to the office?

533
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:01,575
I had a meeting somewhere else and happened to pass by here on my way back.

534
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,575
I wanted to congratulate Kie too.

535
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,415
Pheem.

536
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:09,115
I want you to be more careful about your demeanour at a workplace.

537
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,895
It’s something quite delicate.

538
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,415
Not all of your colleagues will understand and accept it so easily.

539
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:16,975
I’m sorry.

540
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,815
I’ll be more careful from now on.

541
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:24,895
I already told you I wouldn’t mind if you’ll get back together with Kie.

542
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:29,375
But you must clear it up with Poon and settle about your engagement by yourself.

543
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,075
Yes.

544
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:37,255
I’m his father’s close friend and also a long-time business partner.

545
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:40,175
His family is planning to invest on our company too.

546
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,535
I don’t want to have any problem with them.

547
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,735
Please don’t worry, Dad. I’ll have it settled as soon as I can.

548
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:56,815
So, do you like it here?

549
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:57,815
I love it.

550
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,135
I’m still not that drunk.

551
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,175
Poon.

552
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:06,075
What?

553
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:07,535
Your fiancé is back.

554
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:11,455
Just forget it. I don’t have a fiancé today, right?

555
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,375
Have you checked out your fiance’s FB or IG lately?

556
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:21,175
Isn’t this that queer engineer?

557
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,815
Are they back together now?

558
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:30,455
She even went all the way to Japan?

559
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:10,445
Hello, Mr. Poon.

560
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:11,615
Hi, girls.

561
00:42:12,775 --> 00:42:13,655
Where’s Pheem.

562
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:16,645
She’s probably still in bed.

563
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:20,815
I see. Can you go wake her and tell her I’m here to see her?

564
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,215
Poon.

565
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,645
Pheem, are you up?

566
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,215
I miss you so much, Pheem.

567
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:36,655
Welcome back to Thailand. Wow!

568
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:39,855
Dad is not home today.

569
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,135
I know. I’m here to see you.

570
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:46,015
I heard you’re back to work for your company.

571
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,055
I just want to congratulate you.

572
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,715
Congratulations to the new vice president.

573
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,415
Thank you.

574
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,255
Since you’re back,

575
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,735
I think it’s time we should talk about our wedding.

576
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:05,475
Yes, I also want to talk to you about that.

577
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:09,415
Ooh, great!

578
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:25,375
I haven’t seen you for 7 years. You look a lot prettier.

579
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:27,975
I heard you also went to work in Japan.

580
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:30,055
It was probably a tough job there.

581
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:38,895
I already talked to my parents. I’d do everything to take good care of you after we get married.

582
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:42,735
I want to call off the engagement.

583
00:43:50,515 --> 00:43:53,935
What? What’s going on, Pheem?

584
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:56,615
What are you thinking?

585
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:59,135
You should’ve asked yourself that.

586
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:01,915
What is it have you done all this time to make me feel good?

587
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:07,695
If you’re so against our engagement,

588
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,575
why didn’t you call it off since before you left for England?

589
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:11,655
Why did you leave it like this for 7 years?

590
00:44:11,655 --> 00:44:13,535
Why gave me hope, Pheem?

591
00:44:13,575 --> 00:44:17,095
I just wanted to tie you down to a hopeless dream.

592
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,215
I wanted to toy with your feelings.

593
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:21,655
Just like how you used to toy with mine.

594
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:27,175
Oh my god

595
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,415
I never toyed with your feelings.

596
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,055
I just love you, Pheem.

597
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:36,175
I can’t stand seeing you with someone else.

598
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:38,455
But I don’t love you.

599
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:41,415
Let’s end it here.

600
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,575
Let’s not keep dragging it and make it a big deal.

601
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:45,845
You can’t do this to me, Pheem.

602
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:50,855
Is it because of that engineer bitch? Her name is Kie, right?

603
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:56,275
Don’t tell me you and her got back together in Japan.

604
00:44:57,675 --> 00:44:59,515
Are you having an affair?

605
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:03,495
Yes, I got back together with her…

606
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,735
because she is the only one that I love.

607
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,375
But you’re my fiancé.

608
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:13,045
I wouldn’t allow it.

609
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:16,815
That’s your problem, not mine.

610
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,015
Fine.

611
00:45:20,075 --> 00:45:24,175
Fine! Then, I’m going to claim my right as your fiancé.

612
00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:27,975
Let’s see if Uncle Poj will risk having his reputation ruined…

613
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:31,655
by breaking the promise he gave to my parents.

614
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:43,935
[Next Break]
I'll tell everyone in and out of the company...

615
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:46,415
that Pheem is having an affair with her own employee.

616
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:48,175
He threatened you and the president?

617
00:45:48,175 --> 00:45:49,695
He'll tell everyone we're having an affair.

630
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:47,486
Sir, we’ll be getting some orders from Japan next week.

631
00:46:47,486 --> 00:46:50,606
We’ve agreed to place more orders with Mr. Sato…

632
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:53,566
because our sales performance here is quite satisfactory.

633
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,286
Good.

634
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:01,566
Hello, Uncle Poj.

635
00:47:02,006 --> 00:47:02,806
Hello.

636
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:03,966
Hello, Mr. O.

637
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:05,926
Hello.

638
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:09,406
What’s the matter? Why are you here to see me so early?

639
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:13,036
I’m afraid I won’t have much time though. I still have a lot more work to finish.

640
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:17,166
Well, it’s like this, Uncle.

641
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:20,206
I see you’ve been quite busy working abroad lately,

642
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:25,686
so you probably haven’t heard about the rumour in your company.

643
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:31,446
What rumour?

644
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:35,006
Can I say it here?

645
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:37,566
Do…do…do you want me to go out first, sir?

646
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:43,966
It’s like this, Uncle Poj.

647
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:47,126
They’re talking about this rumour everywhere.

648
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:51,006
That someone called Kiran has got promoted unusually fast…

649
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:56,606
because she’s having an inappropriate relationship with the vice president.

650
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:58,086
That they are more than just a boss and employee.

651
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:04,566
I don’t know where you heard it from.

652
00:48:05,086 --> 00:48:07,086
But if it’s about her promotion,

653
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:10,286
it was actually my idea.

654
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:24,086
Uncle Poj, I’m really curious about this Kiran brat.

655
00:48:24,326 --> 00:48:27,926
What’s so good about her that makes you so fond of her like this?

656
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:31,446
So much that you allowed her to take such a high-ranking position.

657
00:48:32,906 --> 00:48:36,206
Kiran is very talented and dedicated to work.

658
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:43,206
She’s an ideal employee that every organization is looking for.

659
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:46,006
That’s why you pay special attention on her.

660
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:51,766
So special that you allow her to date Pheem openly…

661
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,886
despite knowing that she’s still my fiancé. Is that right?

662
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,206
And one more thing, Uncle.

663
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:03,066
Aren’t you afraid that Kiran might only date Pheem because she wants something from her?

664
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:08,246
I happen to know something about Kiran’s family.

665
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,806
Her father is an architect. Her mother, an interior designer.

666
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,966
That’s obviously a working class, isn’t it, Uncle?

667
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:18,926
And what’s her surname?

668
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:23,966
Pi…Pi…Pipat something. I’ve never heard of it before.

669
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:25,406
Probably…

670
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:27,326
Pipittayaphongsa.

671
00:49:27,906 --> 00:49:30,166
It’s understandable if you’ve never heard it before.

672
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:37,836
But what about “Siraprapakorn”? Does it sound familiar to you, Mr. Poon?

673
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:40,406
Oh, yes. I know that one.

674
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:42,846
That family is one of the top billionaires in Thailand.

675
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:46,566
The owner of Narnia alley, and also the lands around your mansion.

676
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:51,486
Kiran’s mother is the middle daughter of this family.

677
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:55,926
Kiran is therefore Aunt Kimheng Siraprapakorn’s granddaughter.

678
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:02,766
Kiran’s dad is very down to earth. He prefers to live a simple life.

679
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:08,806
But I’ve heard that Miss Kiran is Aunt Kimheng’s favourite granddaughter.

680
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:14,066
So, the amount of assets Miss Kiran might inherit in the future is probably…

681
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:16,466
enormous.

682
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,806
Okay, thank you for your information, Mr. O.

683
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:26,906
But I don’t give a damn who Kiran or her ancestor is.

684
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:31,836
I’m Pheem’s fiancé. I’m the one who will marry her, Uncle.

685
00:50:34,066 --> 00:50:37,206
Uncle Poj, you’re a respectable man.

686
00:50:37,836 --> 00:50:40,246
You can’t take back your words so easily like this.

687
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,806
And you shouldn’t allow Pheem to see someone else like this too.

688
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,866
I also don’t want to break my promise with Pheem.

689
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:50,266
I promise her that I’ll never force her to do anything against her will again

690
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:53,166
And I don’t want to make the same mistake twice.

691
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:55,406
I hope you’d understand, Poon.

692
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:03,886
No, I don’t.

693
00:51:04,886 --> 00:51:06,766
And I’m not going to allow it.

694
00:51:07,206 --> 00:51:12,326
If I don’t get to marry her, I’m going to expose her.

695
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:15,646
I’m going to tell everyone in and out of this company…

696
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,246
that Pheem is having an affair with her employee.

697
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:19,926
And that person is also a woman.

698
00:51:35,306 --> 00:51:38,036
He threatened you and the president?

699
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:39,126
Yes.

700
00:51:39,926 --> 00:51:42,606
He’d tell everyone that we’re having an affair.

701
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,006
What? Really?

702
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,206
Geez, he’s an absolute asshole.

703
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:53,246
It’s only a few days before our company’s party.

704
00:51:53,606 --> 00:51:55,236
I’m afraid he might show up there.

705
00:51:56,006 --> 00:51:58,286
I’m not worried about myself.

706
00:51:58,836 --> 00:52:01,036
But I don’t want him to ruin my dad’s reputation.

707
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:08,606
Don’t worry, Pheem.

708
00:52:08,886 --> 00:52:13,766
I’ll tell the organizer to pay special attention on this matter.

709
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:16,206
Got it, Pock?

710
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:18,366
Yeah.

711
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:23,206
It’s like this, Pheem. My company is the organizer of this event.

712
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,966
So, there’s nothing to worry about.

713
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:29,836
Will you be at the party too?

714
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:35,846
Yes. My personal photographer will also be there too.

715
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:37,206
Who?

716
00:52:37,306 --> 00:52:38,046
Tan.

717
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:41,926
Wait, is he back?

718
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:46,046
Yes. You don’t have to worry, Pheem.

719
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:51,046
I’m going to tell my team that all outsiders are strictly not allowed.

720
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:54,326
You can trust me. You’ll definitely be safe.

721
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:56,806
Poon will never get a chance to come near you.

722
00:53:03,836 --> 00:53:04,636
Pocky!

723
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:09,866
Thank you, Pock. Kie.

724
00:53:13,236 --> 00:53:17,206
Excuse me? Can you please make sure it will work properly during the actual presentation?

725
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:18,686
Make sure it’ll work smoothly.

726
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,806
Congratulations, Miss Kiran.

727
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:22,566
Thank you.

728

Aww, you two look so good today.

So, do you like it, Pheem?

738
00:53:47,106 --> 00:53:49,046
A lot. Thank you so much, Pock.

739
00:53:49,086 --> 00:53:50,126
You’re welcome.

740
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:54,806
Oh, about Poon. You don’t have to worry, Pheem.

741
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:58,966
In case of emergency, Kie and I have a secret weapon waiting for him.

742
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,566
Tan, come here!

743
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:04,886
Come say hi to Kie and Pheem.

Thank you, Tan. How long are you going to stay?

747
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:15,766
I don’t know yet. I just want to spend time with her.

748
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,246
I miss her so much.

749
00:54:17,566 --> 00:54:21,086
Aww, Tan. Why are you being so sweet again?

750
00:54:21,086 --> 00:54:23,206
I need your love right now.

751
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:24,366
Right now?

752
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:25,446
Yes.

Aww, my baby.

Geez, so crazy in love.

Listen, I’m telling you, Tan is so good in bed!

757

I mean it.

758

Pock!

759
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:44,766
What? It’s true though. Why are you embarrassed?

760
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,646
All right, you two enjoy the party then.

761
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:51,286
I’ll go check that way first. It’s still not done yet.

762
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:52,846
- Okay.
- Have fun. Let’s go.

763
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,966
Okay. Where should I put it?

764

It’s me who have to thank you.

770
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:29,206
For convincing Pheem to work with me, and for bringing her smile back.

771
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:36,126
All this time, I had looked down on my daughter’s feelings.

772
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:39,046
I thought it was just a puppy love.

773
00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:41,486
But it turned out to be something completely different.

774
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:44,166
I made her suffer so much.

775
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:48,006
Thank you for healing those wounds in her heart.

776
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:51,906
It’s my pleasure indeed.

777
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:56,166
In the end, you won the bet and get to work here.

778
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,646
And you also waited until she finally came back to you.

779
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,686
Please look after the company for me.

780
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:10,366
I do hope you’ll become a key leader who would drive our company ahead.

781
00:56:10,526 --> 00:56:12,846
And help assist Pheem at work.

782
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:14,606
Please don’t worry, sir.

783
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:18,446
I’ll do my best and won’t let you down.

784
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:21,966
You did a great job.

785
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:29,326
Excuse me, many CEO are looking for the president right now.

786
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,266
Could you please come with me for a moment?

787
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:32,726
Please.

788
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,566
- Excuse me then.
- Yes.

What is it?

792
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:56,606
What were you and Dad talking about? I saw it.

793
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:58,306
Nothing.

794
00:56:59,036 --> 00:57:03,006
He told me to take good care of your heart.

What?

796
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:09,766
Did he really say that?

797
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:16,766
Just kidding. He just congratulated me on my promotion.

798
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:22,766
Congratulations again…to the new production engineer manager.

799
00:57:24,036 --> 00:57:25,486
Congratulations too.

800

To the Vice President…officially.

801
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:35,846
Hmm, you can’t just say congratulations though.

802
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:38,566
Don’t you think there should be a gift too?

803
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:54,006
Isn’t it…too small?

804
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:58,726
How big do you want it?

805
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:02,886
Stop it. There are many people here.

Ouch, Pheem.

00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,406
Can you?

810
00:58:20,606 --> 00:58:22,486
I don’t know.

[Next Episode]
Pheem, you come home late every day.

813
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:39,806
I have to make the most of my time.

814
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,686
But coming home this late is dangerous.

815
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:45,006
I thought you said you’d never force me to do anything again.

816
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:47,246
Are you going to make her do anything against her will again?

817
00:58:47,646 --> 00:58:48,526
You can’t do that.

818
00:58:48,706 --> 00:58:51,906
I wanted to ask if you’d like to take her to live with you.
