1
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,040
Princess

2
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,439
Princess

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,159
Princess

4
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,719
How could I have such a dream?

5
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,960
Princess, what's wrong?

6
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,240
Your servant will help you get up.

7
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,039
The Flower Festival Banquet is about to begin.

8
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,439
Get ready, it's time to go.

9
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Royal Sister

10
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,879
Do you really intend

11
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,520
after winning those White Jade Mandarin Ducks today,

12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
to confess your feelings to Seventh Cousin?

13
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,319
As expected of my Royal Sister.

14
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,360
I dare say

15
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,879
that in Seventh Cousin's heart,

16
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,120
you definitely have a place.

17
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,960
Such great skill.

18
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,639
Why hasn't Seventh Cousin arrived yet?

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
Didn't he really want those White Jade Mandarin Ducks?

20
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,120
Princess

21
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,919
Princess

22
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,800
Young Master Xiu, he...

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,199
What is it?

24
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,919
Young Master Xiu sent word

25
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
saying he has an upset stomach today.

26
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
He can't perform in this play.

27
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,680
He asked Young Master Meng to take his place.

28
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,919
Do you know where he went?

29
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,479
I'll go check.

30
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,759
Roy...

31
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,479
Now the Fourth Princess has left too.

32
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,000
A Lan, what should we do now?

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,639
Here's an idea.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,039
Shao Jue and I will first substitute for Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin

35
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,520
for the opening narration.

36
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,719
Commander He can read it.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,120
We'll go over once we're ready.

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
Judging by this play,

39
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,399
A Lan and I will be buried together.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,519
If not for that scoundrel Ma Wencai,

41
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,519
Brother and A Lan would have eloped long ago.

42
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,680
This is...

43
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,000
Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin had urgent business.

44
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Shao Jue and I are substituting for them.

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,279
I can't talk anymore.

46
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,279
We have to hurry over.

47
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,959
You all go ahead.

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
I'll be right there.

49
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,040
Then be quick!

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,319
Playing the zither and dancing with swords together

51
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,519
is rather interesting.

52
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,600
In the end,

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,839
the two transformed into a pair of butterflies.

54
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,439
That year, with apricot blossoms and light rain,

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,079
Zhu Yingtai disguised herself as a man

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,600
and met the scholar Liang Shanbo.

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,839
The two of them, at first sight...

58
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Look.

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,279
"The one I long for is across the water."

60
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,279
The two of them, at first sight...

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,959
As soon as they met,

62
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Liang Shanbo was poisoned and died.

63
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,399
He kicked the bucket.

64
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,480
I truly didn't expect it to be like this.

65
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,639
How could Liang Shanbo die as soon as he appears?

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Why change a perfectly good play

67
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,160
into something like this?

68
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,959
Just follow his instructions for now.

69
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,839
Shanbo

70
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,360
Shanbo

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,480
Shanbo

72
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,600
After Liang Shanbo's death,

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,959
Zhu Yingtai became a suspect.

74
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,399
The Magistrate ordered her thrown into prison.

75
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,000
Let go of me!

76
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,560
The scholar Ma Wencai ran around everywhere,

77
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,519
trying to clear Zhu Yingtai's name.

78
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
How dare you!

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
Ma Wencai and Zhu Yingtai hit it off immediately.

80
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,279
They studied together,

81
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,399
inseparable day after day.

82
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Yuwen Rui!

83
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing?

84
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,839
I made a slight change.

85
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,959
Don't worry.

86
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,079
It will only be more perfect than before.

87
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,879
If we don't win the prize,

88
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
I won't let you off the hook.

89
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,600
Trust me.

90
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,000
Seventh Cousin.

91
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,439
A Zi.

92
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,959
How did you know I was here?

93
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,839
In the past, when you were unhappy,

94
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,759
you would come here.

95
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm not unhappy.

96
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,279
I just...

97
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,559
have an upset stomach.

98
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,559
The things A Lan and I said,

99
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,399
you heard them all,

100
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,799
didn't you?

101
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,240
If you heard,

102
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,200
with such a reaction,

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,480
the answer is self-evident.

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,759
However,

105
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,440
some words

106
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,559
I still must tell you myself.

107
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
I, An Kezi,

108
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,200
truly like you.

109
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,600
After three years as classmates,

110
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,440
after several misunderstandings were cleared,

111
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,120
after facing life and death together,

112
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,240
Ma Wencai finally realized

113
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
that Zhu Yingtai was a woman.

114
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
So he went to propose marriage.

115
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
With a dowry stretching for miles,

116
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,919
a proper wedding was arranged.

117
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,799
On the wedding day,

118
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,639
Ma Wencai personally helped Zhu Yingtai

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
with her makeup and attire.

120
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,919
What are you thinking about?

121
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
N-nothing.

122
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,320
Hurry up.

123
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
Aren't you done yet?

124
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Just one last step.

125
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
The lovers finally became a couple.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,039
Perfect harmony, everlasting love.

127
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
It's just a play.

128
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,440
Why be so awkward?

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,799
What kind of monstrous rewrite is this?

130
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
Do you remember the scene in the play

131
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,840
with Liang Shanbo's dream?

132
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,320
Th-that was...

133
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,480
p-performed quite well.

134
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,480
This play is rather interesting.

135
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,799
Looking at it this way,

136
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
the Fifth Princess and Lord Yuwen

137
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,559
are truly a perfect match.

138
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,279
I really envy the Fifth Princess.

139
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,759
She gets to marry Lord Yuwen in the future.

140
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,679
The Fifth Princess made many scenes before

141
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
trying to break off the engagement.

142
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,720
No matter how unwilling she is,

143
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,960
the Fifth Princess can only marry Lord Yuwen.

144
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Their betrothal was bestowed by the late Empress Dowager.

145
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,039
Indeed.

146
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Come, let's have a drink.

147
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,759
Alright, I'll toast you.

148
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,440
Ying Lu.

149
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,159
I have a matter to discuss with His Majesty.

150
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
You are an actor, after all.

151
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,360
How did you get nervous acting out a kiss scene?

152
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,840
Yuwen Rui is good-looking,

153
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,399
but aren't you too easily swayed by a pretty face?

154
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,080
A Lan.

155
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,480
Wait for me.

156
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,200
Yinglu.

157
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,519
You've all left, one by one.

158
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Leaving me all alone.

159
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,360
Where did your brother go?

160
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,960
He went to see His Majesty.

161
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,200
What does he want with my father?

162
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,360
Your Majesty.

163
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,879
The Flower Festival Banquet shouldn't be over yet.

164
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,240
Would you like to go take a look?

165
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,200
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

166
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,240
What are you doing here?

167
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,200
This humble subject has been here,

168
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,879
waiting for Your Majesty for quite some time.

169
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,039
You have business?

170
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,519
This humble subject has an impertinent request.

171
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,279
Speak.

172
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
I humbly beseech Your Majesty

173
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,080
to cancel the Fifth Princess's engagement to the Grand Chancellor.

174
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,080
Preposterous!

175
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,840
A Lan's engagement was settled long ago.

176
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,919
How can it be canceled on a whim?

177
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,159
Marriage is a major affair,

178
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,720
concerning the Fifth Princess's entire life.

179
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,200
I beg Your Majesty to think more of A Lan.

180
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,960
We,

181
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,159
are naturally considering her.

182
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,240
This humble subject has heard a plague has broken out in Jingzhou.

183
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,279
Your Majesty is troubled,

184
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,159
wondering whom to send to resolve the epidemic.

185
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,519
What exactly are you trying to say?

186
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,399
This humble subject is willing to go to Jingzhou to resolve the plague.

187
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,679
You?

188
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,480
Currently, within the court,

189
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
there are few who can go to Jingzhou

190
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,159
to ease Your Majesty's worries.

191
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,159
But how can We trust you?

192
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,639
This matter concerns the lives of the people.

193
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,919
This humble subject would never dare speak recklessly.

194
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Does Your Majesty recall

195
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,920
the snow disaster in the south the year before last?

196
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,279
Naturally, I remember.

197
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,519
That year, thanks to your father's proposal

198
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,200
to grant the wealthy who aided the court's relief efforts

199
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,720
the qualification of Imperial College students,

200
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,640
it prompted the noble families to donate money and grain,

201
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,440
resolving the urgent crisis.

202
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,920
That plan was proposed by this humble subject.

203
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,799
If I cannot contain the Jingzhou epidemic,

204
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,359
I am willing to atone with my death.

205
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
If I successfully control the Jingzhou epidemic,

206
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,799
I beg Your Majesty to grant my request.

207
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,759
You want Us

208
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,440
to betroth A Lan to you?

209
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,000
No.

210
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Your Majesty need only grant the Fifth Princess freedom in marriage.

211
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,359
We agree.

212
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,319
However,

213
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
there is one condition.

214
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,240
After you return from Jingzhou,

215
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,759
you must enter the court as an official.

216
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,119
Why hasn't brother returned yet?

217
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,480
I heard from Little Li Zi

218
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,079
that Father greatly admires Shaojue.

219
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,799
Perhaps the two of them are discussing

220
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,799
the matter of entering the court as an official.

221
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,079
Even if His Majesty kills him, it would be useless.

222
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,799
When Mother passed away,

223
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
brother swore an oath

224
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,519
that he would never become a court official in this life.

225
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,559
Why?

226
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,799
When Mother was alive,

227
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,640
Father was always busy with official duties

228
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,119
and neglected to care for Mother.

229
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,039
Later, Mother fell ill,

230
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
and Father was away handling official business, too busy to return home.

231
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,920
Even when Mother passed away from illness,

232
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,400
Father couldn't return to see her one last time.

233
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,559
From that time on, brother

234
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,400
has loathed the idea of being an official.

235
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,480
He should have entered the court five years ago.

236
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,400
Well?

237
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,000
Good.

238
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,359
It's settled then.

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
We will issue an edict ordering the Jingzhou Magistrate

240
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,039
to follow your command.

241
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

242
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,720
This...

243
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,839
If you have something to say, speak plainly.

244
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,880
Your Majesty,

245
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,680
the Fifth Princess previously

246
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,359
tried every method to break off the engagement.

247
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,079
You never agreed.

248
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,400
So why have you agreed to Young Master Meng's request now?

249
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,319
We did not cancel her engagement

250
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,559
because Minister Yuwen is truly a good match.

251
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
We did not want her to miss out.

252
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
But now it seems

253
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,079
this Meng Shaojue is utterly sincere towards A Lan.

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,680
If in the future A Lan can marry him,

255
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
it might not be such a bad thing.

256
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,440
Has Father truly decided to send Young Master Meng

257
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,640
to Jingzhou to handle the plague situation?

258
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
Five years ago, at the palace examination,

259
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,039
I knew he was no ordinary man.

260
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,319
Since he says

261
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,720
he is confident he can control the plague in Jingzhou,

262
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,039
I will trust him.

263
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,519
Young Master Meng has always disliked court politics.

264
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,359
Why would he suddenly take on this matter?

265
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,759
People change.

266
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,279
Enough about him.

267
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,799
I summoned you here

268
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,680
because we have a lead on Shadow Gate disciples.

269
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,880
After Yunze's destruction,

270
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,880
the Shadow Gate began to decline.

271
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,559
Now, they are nearly extinct.

272
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,799
How did Father discover their trail?

273
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,599
All these years,

274
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,880
I have secretly ordered people to search

275
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
for traces of Shadow Gate disciples.

276
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,119
Recently, a spy reported a clue.

277
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,359
Someone used Ice-Soul Silver Thread in Tianyin City.

278
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,039
Ice-Soul Silver Thread...

279
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,920
The signature weapon of

280
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Yun Shang, the Shadow Gate's top disciple.

281
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,759
Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate is likely in Tianyin City.

282
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Depart as soon as possible

283
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,119
to find his trail.

284
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,160
You must uncover the secret of the Map of the Nine Provinces.

285
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,680
Your son obeys. Your servant obeys.

286
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,400
This matter is of great importance.

287
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,400
Do not make it public.

288
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:26,920
You shall travel south

289
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,519
under the pretext of inspecting the provinces.

290
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,279
Brother...

291
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,839
Perhaps you shouldn't go to Jingzhou.

292
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,519
Don't worry.

293
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,599
I'll be fine.

294
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,160
A Lan is worried about me.

295
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,240
The plague is no joke.

296
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,039
What should I do?

297
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,000
I already miss him, and he hasn't even left.

298
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,680
Once I reach Jingzhou,

299
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,880
I'll write to you.

300
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,519
Brother Meng,

301
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,519
if you write to Luo Jing,

302
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,400
A Lan likely won't receive it.

303
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,279
A Lan is coming south with us.

304
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,680
Why the rush to go south?

305
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,319
Prince Ning remains unconscious.

306
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,279
So the mysterious figure behind him

307
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,920
is the real villain, right?

308
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,480
Stop trying to pry information from me.

309
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,000
I just came to tell you

310
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,400
you must also go with them

311
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,759
to Tianyin City.

312
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,680
The next mission is in Tianyin City.

313
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,119
I have some official business to attend to.

314
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:45,880
You and...

315
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,559
I'm uneasy about you going south.

316
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,359
Otherwise, wait for me to return, and I'll accompany you.

317
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,920
What's there to be uneasy about?

318
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,160
I'll return once my business is done.

319
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,240
I must go.

320
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,599
At a time like this,

321
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,079
you still have the leisure to worry about others?

322
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,160
Oh, right.

323
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,240
I prepared something for you.

324
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,759
These gloves and this mask

325
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,839
were specially made for you.

326
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
Remember to wear them once you're in Jingzhou,

327
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,599
especially when contacting patients.

328
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,240
Also,

329
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,920
this letter contains instructions.

330
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,079
After arriving in Jingzhou,

331
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,519
assign some personnel specifically

332
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,400
to have them make more

333
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,519
and distribute them to the local people.

334
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
These items are quite novel.

335
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
Have you prepared them for anyone else?

336
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
I have never received

337
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,279
such a special gift.

338
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,799
If not...

339
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,599
A Lan, help me put them on.

340
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,400
You don't even know how?

341
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,519
It's very simple.

342
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,279
Here.

343
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,640
It's getting late.

344
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,240
Young Master Meng, time to set off.

345
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,359
Big brother!

346
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,440
What do you mean 'set off'?

347
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,200
That sounds terrible!

348
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,079
Once Young Master Meng reaches Jingzhou,

349
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,440
give this edict to the Jingzhou Magistrate.

350
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,480
Brother Meng,

351
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,880
take care on your journey.

352
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,759
Take care.

353
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,480
Young Master Meng...

354
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,359
When I return to the capital,

355
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:26,960
I have something to tell you.

356
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,400
What can't you say now?

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,079
I'm off.

358
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,920
Brother, take care.

359
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,160
Take care.

360
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,359
How long are you going to keep watching?

361
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,039
My brother is going to Jingzhou,

362
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,079
and you're heading south too.

363
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,240
What's the point of staying in Luo Jing?

364
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,200
Alright.

365
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I'll be back soon.

366
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:07,960
Wait for me to return,

367
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,759
I'll bring you a gift.

368
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,680
Then I'm leaving.

369
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,160
Commander He.

370
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,960
Let's go.

371
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,759
Commander He, Miss Meng.

372
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,799
Farewell.

373
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,240
Seventh Cousin, you're so pampered.

374
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,039
What makes you want to go south?

375
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,759
Naturally, because the scenery south of the river is beautiful.

376
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,759
Just for the scenery?

377
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,839
Of course.

378
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,759
What else could it be?

379
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,079
I was just asking casually.

380
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,519
Why are you so nervous?

381
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,799
I...

382
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,240
Miss Meng.

383
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,119
Why are you calling me?

384
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,720
I am not familiar with you.

385
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,160
Regarding our last match,

386
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,039
I, He, was too heavy-handed.

387
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,279
I've been wanting to find a chance to apologize.

388
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,559
Unnecessary.

389
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,599
Last time, I lost because my skills were inferior.

390
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,440
But don't get too cocky.

391
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,839
One day,

392
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,359
I will definitely beat you until you're picking your teeth off the ground.

393
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,119
With Miss Meng's foundation,

394
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,400
if you wish to defeat me,

395
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,359
it is absolutely impossible in this lifetime.

396
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,519
You, surnamed He!

397
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,920
Don't you look down on people!

398
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,240
Is what I, He, said incorrect?

399
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:35,759
You!

400
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
Just you wait!

401
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,279
I... I have something to give you.

402
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,200
This is something I, He,

403
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,119
wrote based on your martial arts level.

404
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
After our last match,

405
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
I, He, analyzed your internal energy

406
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,759
I've gained some understanding of your physical skills and techniques.

407
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,240
You learned all that just from sparring with me?

408
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,559
After our last match,

409
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,079
I, He, wrote these two manuals.

410
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,240
Suitable for you, Miss Meng, to practice.

411
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,160
It's just that usually,

412
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm used to sparring with palace guards,

413
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
so I don't know my own strength.

414
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,480
I actually ended up injuring you, Miss Meng.

415
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,400
Once you finish practicing these two manuals,

416
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,960
I'll then, based on your progress,

417
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,559
continue writing more.

418
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
Who said I was going to practice?

419
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,640
Well, if you don't want to practice,

420
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,440
it's fine to just flip through them for fun in your spare time.

421
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,279
Shao Jue has never been interested in official matters.

422
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,160
Why would he suddenly request an imperial decree to go to Jingzhou?

423
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,480
Is there some inside story?

424
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,319
Father didn't tell you?

425
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,319
The more I think about it, the stranger it seems.

426
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,640
Tell me,

427
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,319
you talk so much.

428
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,480
Aren't you thirsty?

429
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,519
Seventh Cousin these past two days

430
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,200
seems to be avoiding me everywhere.

431
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,359
How could that be?

432
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,599
Was it something I said that day

433
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,799
that troubled you?

434
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,599
How could it?

435
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
What if you and I swap with Royal Sister

436
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,559
and Seventh Cousin?

437
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,440
I'll go ride a horse,

438
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,359
and you go drive the carriage.

439
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,400
Leave the carriage to them for their alone time.

440
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,039
How about it?

441
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,160
Royal Sister,

442
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,519
I feel like riding a horse.

443
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,640
Let's swap, you and I.

444
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:11,960
Zi Xiu,

445
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,279
you go inside.

446
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll drive.

447
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:18,960
No need, Elder Brother.

448
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,920
I really enjoy driving.

449
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,079
You're just asking for trouble.

450
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,000
A Lan and I will go scout the road ahead.

451
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,000
What are you doing?

452
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Weren't you the one who said to let them

453
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,799
have their alone time?

454
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,400
I...

455
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
Hold on tight.

456
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,440
Get in the carriage.

457
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,799
Why are you looking at me like that?

458
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
N-nothing.

459
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,359
What exactly did Father send you south for?

460
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,519
What is the real purpose?

461
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,920
His Majesty ordered me

462
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,680
and the Fourth Princess to find the whereabouts

463
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,759
of Shadow Gate's top disciple, Yun Shang.

464
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,240
Shadow Gate?

465
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,119
I heard from Little Li Zi

466
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,160
that Shadow Gate seems to know

467
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,559
the secrets within the Map of the Nine Provinces.

468
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,039
His Majesty sent people to search for years before learning

469
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,960
that Shadow Gate's Master Yun Shang

470
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,599
is most likely hiding in Tianyin City.

471
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,319
What kind of person

472
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,759
is this Master Yun Shang?

473
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,400
Very little is known.

474
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,519
We only know his personal weapon is Ice-Soul Silver Thread.

475
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
If we go south,

476
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,400
what about the mysterious figure behind Prince Ning?

477
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,160
I've already had He Lianchen spread the word

478
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,599
that Shadow Gate's Yun Shang is in Tianyin City.

479
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,400
You want to lure the mysterious figure to Tianyin City.

480
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
If he wants to learn the map's secrets,

481
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,000
he'll have to make a move.

482
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,160
Once he acts, he'll show his flaws.

483
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,279
I knew it!

484
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,839
How come you agreed to go south so suddenly?

485
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,960
You were already prepared.

486
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,640
Hyah!

487
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,319
Seventh Cousin,

488
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,839
I have something to say to you.

489
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,200
When I said I liked you that day,

490
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,359
I meant it sincerely.

491
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,119
If I, An Kezi, like someone,

492
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,359
I'll let him know.

493
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,519
If he likes me too,

494
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,519
then it's heaven's blessing.

495
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,000
If I'm not in his heart,

496
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,839
I will accept it calmly.

497
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,839
Seeing you so uncomfortable now,

498
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,599
just pretend my previous words

499
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,160
were never spoken.

500
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,920
Luo Jing is so boring!

501
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,279
Brother and A Lan are both gone.

502
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,440
What are you doing here?

503
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,359
I have some business with Grand Preceptor Meng.

504
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,200
Miss Meng,

505
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,559
how are those martial arts manuals?

506
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,279
I just glanced at them casually.

507
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,279
They're... barely acceptable, I suppose.

508
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,400
Stop!

509
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,160
That movement is wrong.

510
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,640
Your arms need to be relaxed.

511
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,079
Your footwork must be steady.

512
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,079
That's right, like this.

513
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
Aren't you going to let me go?

514
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
When will you deliver the remaining volumes?

515
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,880
Didn't you say you'd keep writing?

516
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,480
What,

517
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
only these two?

518
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,480
Miss Meng is referring to the martial arts manuals?

519
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,159
What else?

520
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,119
Darn it, you're so dense.

521
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,480
The third and fourth volumes are almost finished.

522
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,199
I'll bring them to you in a couple of days.

523
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,280
Fine.

524
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
It just so happens I've been very idle lately.

525
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Although these manuals aren't written very well,

526
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,599
but...

527
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,519
barely,

528
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,800
they can still pass the time.

529
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,519
Innkeeper!

530
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,599
Honored guests, please, have a seat!

531
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,920
Waiter, bring tea!

532
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,440
Right away!

533
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:10,800
Innkeeper,

534
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,760
once we pass through the woods ahead,

535
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,239
will we reach Tianyin City?

536
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,719
Well...

537
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,599
Wh-what's wrong?

538
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,679
You all...

539
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,599
want to go to Tianyin City?

540
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,119
Yes.

541
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,960
If you're going to Tianyin City, that's easy.

542
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,719
Besides the woods ahead,

543
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,199
there's another small path

544
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,199
that leads into the city.

545
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:40,719
Oh, right.

546
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,000
Second Master Luo is heading back to the city.

547
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,360
You guests can follow him.

548
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,280
Second Master.

549
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,719
These guests also want to enter the city.

550
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,559
Second Master.

551
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,239
Second Master.

552
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,559
Second Master, what are you thinking about?

553
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
Second Master, do us a favor.

554
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,800
Take these guests into the city by the detour.

555
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,960
Thank you.

556
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,239
Innkeeper.

557
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,480
What's strange about those woods?

558
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,119
I see you're all from out of town.

559
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,599
So I'll say a bit more.

560
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,280
That forest ahead...

561
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,280
Now...

00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:22,639

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,440
