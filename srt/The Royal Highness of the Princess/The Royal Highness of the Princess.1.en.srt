1
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,400
Out of the way! Move!

2
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,680
Get out of the way, quick!

3
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,640
Princess.

4
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,640
We've arrived at Yuwen Manor.

5
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,920
Open the gate!

6
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,400
Open up!

7
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,960
I refuse to believe it.

8
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,159
This marriage can't be called off?

9
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,759
The Fifth Princess is here! Open the gates!

10
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,960
We were unaware of Your Highness's arrival.

11
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
We failed to welcome you properly.

12
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,240
We beg for your forgiveness, Princess.

13
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,879
Where is Yuwen Rui?

14
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,120
Your Highness,

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
My lord has gone out of the city on business.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,599
He hasn't returned yet.

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,159
Then tell him to return immediately.

18
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
Since Yuwen Rui isn't here,

19
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,919
I'll have to amuse myself with you all.

20
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,599
Fifth Princess,

21
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,840
may I ask the purpose of your visit?

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
You should ask your lord that.

23
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,520
Who knows what kind of potion

24
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,680
Yuwen Rui fed to my royal father?

25
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Father actually wants me to marry him.

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,080
What?

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,159
Eager to become the Prince Consort?

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,639
Princess,

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
the marriage contract between you and my lord

30
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,240
was arranged by the late Empress Dowager.

31
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,560
If you are unwilling, Princess,

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,479
my lord would never force you into distress.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Everyone knows he'll use any means

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,280
to climb higher.

35
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,120
Forget it.

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Why am I telling this to a lowly servant like you?

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,199
When exactly will he be back?

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,639
I've already sent word to my lord.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,879
Fifth Princess,

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,560
perhaps you'd like to rest for a while?

41
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,240
How about...

42
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,080
giving Yuwen Rui a big gift?

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,959
Cut! That's a wrap for this scene.

44
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,639
Come here.

45
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,000
This stand-in actress you found

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,839
is quite good.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,680
Thank you, Director.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,680
Let's cast her as An Kelan instead.

49
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,920
Tell the one who injured her leg clubbing last night

50
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,040
not to come.

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,879
Okay, understood, Director.

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,079
Hey, bro.

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,879
You're here.

54
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,279
So, uh,

55
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,000
are the actors' backup costumes ready?

56
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:47,920
They're ready.

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
The director already told me.

58
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,240
The one in the back, move forward a bit.

59
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,240
Sweetie,

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,519
that's good.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
You're really my lucky star.

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,879
I never thought coming to visit you on set

63
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,879
would land me a role.

64
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,839
Of course! Let's go.

65
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,079
I heard that

66
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,319
the role of An Kelan doesn't have many scenes.

67
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,199
Indeed, not many.

68
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,879
She's a minor cannon fodder who dies in episode one.

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,279
Don't look down on cannon fodder.

70
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,120
Cannon fodder are people too.

71
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,480
So, what's our show

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,920
actually about?

73
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,759
Apart from the scene we just shot

74
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,839
and the leads' names,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,959
I know nothing.

76
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,399
This story is roughly about...

77
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,279
It's a tale where

78
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,480
a group of people vie for supremacy,

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
fighting over the Map of the Nine Provinces.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,279
In the end, few meet a good fate.

81
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,160
The year's most bizarre drama.

82
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,279
The year's most bizarre drama.

83
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,160
You've hit on the key point.

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Our show

85
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,759
has innocent cannon fodder dying horribly every few episodes.

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,319
The causes of death are varied,

87
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,680
and the methods are diverse.

88
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,759
By the grand finale,

89
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,439
a whole swath of cannon fodder have perished.

90
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,680
Characters who get a peaceful end

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,560
are few and far between.

92
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,879
The character you're playing, An Kelan,

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,639
in the first episode,

94
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,680
is poisoned at her own birthday banquet.

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,160
After being poisoned, the Fifth Princess looks like she's just asleep.

96
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,959
The imperial physicians can't figure out what poison it is.

97
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,079
They try every method,

98
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,319
but the Fifth Princess doesn't wake up.

99
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,480
Not long after,

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,000
she kicks the bucket.

101
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,000
She's a vile cannon fodder,

102
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,120
so her death is deserved.

103
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,160
It's a satisfying outcome.

104
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,000
You know what?

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,839
Director Ling not only made a special appearance

106
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,000
as a minor character in the show,

107
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,000
but also based the character Yuwen Rui

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,759
on his own older brother, CEO Ling.

109
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,279
What kind of person

110
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,360
is Yuwen Rui?

111
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,720
Good day, CEO Ling.

112
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,279
Good day, CEO Ling.

113
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,600
Ruthless methods,

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,160
immense power at court,

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,800
vengeful to the core,

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,519
extremely protective of his own.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,480
Nicknamed the Grim-Faced Yama.

118
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,720
The legendary number one treacherous official.

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Don't tell me

120
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
CEO Ling is also a penny-pinching devil?

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
CEO Ling is here!

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,160
CEO Ling!

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,519
What I meant just now was...

124
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
Watch out!

125
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,600
Welcome.

126
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,759
Miss Anran.

127
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,759
Who are you?

128
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,439
Where is this?

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
A film set.

130
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,560
Was I just knocked out?

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
I don't seem to be hurt.

132
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:40,600
You...

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
Am I hallucinating?

134
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,759
Spare my life!

135
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,439
Fifth Princess!

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,079
Have mercy!

137
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,279
Fifth Princess, please.

138
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,680
We're starting the shoot now.

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,279
Where's the director?

140
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,519
Where's the cameraman?

141
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,160
Where are the crew members?

142
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,920
Princess.

143
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
If Lord Yuwen sees this upon returning to the manor,

144
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,519
it wouldn't be good, would it?

145
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,439
Wait.

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,519
You're really hitting them!

147
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,159
Does the princess think my strength is insufficient?

148
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,240
Princess.

149
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,399
Is this acceptable to you?

150
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,919
Princess.

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Please spare their lives, Princess.

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,480
Spare us, Princess! Spare us!

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,320
Stop!

154
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,679
Let them down at once!

155
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,799
Why are you just standing there?

156
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,559
Hurry up!

157
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,039
Yes, yes, yes.

158
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,639
Welcome, Miss Anran.

159
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,679
What are you looking for, Princess?

160
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,519
Did you see a young man in red clothes?

161
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,679
He was just here.

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,799
What young man in red?

163
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,840
You've been alone in this room the whole time.

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,639
Are you perhaps looking for me?

165
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,639
Who are you, really?

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,120
How did I get here?

167
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,600
Princess?

168
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,399
Who are you talking to?

169
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Over there.

170
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,919
Did you see anything?

171
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,279
I didn't see anything.

172
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,399
Xixi, you...

173
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,639
Pinch me.

174
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,480
I wouldn't dare.

175
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,000
Xixi.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,039
Xixi!

177
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,519
Congratulations on entering the Script World.

178
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,919
Character bound: An Kelan.

179
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,639
Sc-Script World?

180
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,399
And me?

181
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,320
I am a Plot Spirit.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,240
My name is Hong Yi.

183
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,399
My main duty is to record

184
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,320
and arrange the life and death of cannon fodder in the script.

185
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,039
You brought me here?

186
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,519
Ultimately,

187
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,519
it's because this drama of yours is too bizarre.

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,919
Every few episodes, innocent cannon fodder die tragically.

189
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,399
This truly violates the Script World's

190
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,519
principle of respecting life, peace, and friendship.

191
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,399
No.

192
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,840
What does cannon fodder dying have to do with me?

193
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,639
Cannon fodder dying innocently one by one,

194
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,159
isn't that a setting created by you humans?

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,240
Your setting

196
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,440
naturally needs to be corrected by yourselves.

197
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
And you,

198
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,159
with your statement "cannon fodder are people too,"

199
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,039
have been selected by this Plot Spirit.

200
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Don't look down on cannon fodder!

201
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,639
Cannon fodder are people too!

202
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,559
I just went to visit a friend on set.

203
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,399
I just picked up a role to play.

204
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,360
And now I've become Fifth Princess An Kelan?

205
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,279
No choice.

206
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,240
Who told you to be the Chosen One?

207
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,279
Chosen my foot!

208
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,240
I'm not worthy.

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,759
I refuse.

210
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,240
Sorry,

211
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
refusal invalid.

212
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,799
Only by completing the assigned mission to save cannon fodder

213
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,240
can you return to the real world.

214
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,080
Friendly reminder:

215
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,559
The missions will become increasingly difficult.

216
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,120
You have one and only

217
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,320
one chance to fail.

218
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,120
An Kelan herself

219
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,120
is just cannon fodder, isn't she?

220
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,519
So,

221
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,320
your first mission is

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,080
self-preservation.

223
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,279
I'll cheer you on in spirit.

224
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,000
Heaven never seals off all exits.

225
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,080
It's not the final moment yet.

226
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,200
There's still a chance.

227
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,200
Are you alright, Princess?

228
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm fine.

229
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,799
When is my birthday?

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,399
It's today.

231
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,440
Heaven wants to finish me off!

232
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,159
Princess.

233
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,840
Why did you think today

234
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,360
to arrange a physician to treat the servants of Yuwen Manor

235
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,919
and even reward them with silver?

236
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,519
Master! Master!

237
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,559
The Fifth Princess is here!

238
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,759
Today, this old man will tell the story

239
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,679
of Yuwen Rui, one of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

240
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,679
Four Young Masters of Yunmi?

241
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,480
Have you forgotten, Princess?

242
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
On the Yunmi Young Masters Ranking,

243
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,960
Young Master Meng,

244
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,799
Young Master Xiu,

245
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
Lord Yuwen,

246
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,480
and Commander He are the top four.

247
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,960
They are commonly known as the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
To this day,

249
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,159
there's actually still a "Four Young Masters" setting?

250
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,480
Above tens of thousands,

251
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,799
Furthermore,

252
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,279
he... he is a great...

253
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,399
great treacherous official!

254
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,720
Stop the carriage!

255
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,799
At a young age,

256
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,320
he went to the battlefield.

257
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,799
He kills without batting an eye,

258
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,639
thirsting for blood as if for life itself!

259
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,519
How dare he slander Lord Yuwen in public!

260
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
He must have a death wish!

261
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
Does this storyteller want to die,

262
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,799
or does he not want to live?

263
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,759
Princess,

264
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,639
this was all arranged by you.

265
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,000
I've had a terrible headache all day today.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,720
I can't remember many things right now.

267
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,080
This Yuwen Rui,

268
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,200
has the heart of a wolf, ambitious

269
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,360
and... and blatantly obvious!

270
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,159
This was personally written by you, Princess.

271
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
I never imagined

272
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,720
Your Highness had such literary talent.

273
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,639
So eager to offend people...

274
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,679
Do I want to die,

275
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,679
or do I not want to live?

276
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,080
Using his own power to eliminate dissidents,

277
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,840
he... he is a complete and utter treacherous official!

278
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,360
Who is this?

279
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:17,879
Look, look.

280
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,120
What does it say?

281
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,120
The Lone Star of Calamity, Yuwen Rui.

282
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,279
He brings ruin to father, mother, and kin.

283
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,799
Harboring ill intent, all may punish him.

284
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,480
This... this wasn't also my doing, was it?

285
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,960
This would offend him completely!

286
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,480
Why has Fifth Princess stopped reading?

287
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,200
Princess?

288
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,080
It seems... it's Lord Yuwen.

289
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,679
He, he, he...

290
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,039
He, Yuwen Rui, actually dares to covet the Fifth Princess!

291
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,240
He covets the position of Prince Consort!

292
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,799
One day, he will surely stir up chaos.

293
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,879
And bring disaster to the court.

294
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,039
Master! Master!

295
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,120
Let's run!

296
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,080
Fifth Princess is shocked.

297
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,399
No.

298
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,919
That's good then.

299
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,480
Fifth Princess.

300
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,480
We'll meet at the birthday banquet.

301
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,120
Princess.

302
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,879
Are you alright?

303
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,000
This servant will have them clear the inn.

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,279
So you can change your clothes.

305
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,120
Aside from storming into his manor...

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,600
And trying every way to slander him...

307
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,879
I didn't do anything else to offend Yuwen Rui, did I?

308
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,679
The year the Princess was eight...

309
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,559
...she forcibly took a hairpin from Lord Yuwen.

310
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,599
That hairpin was a memento of Lord Yuwen's mother.

311
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,200
It's fine, she...

312
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,279
Why would I steal a memento of someone's mother?

313
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,160
When Lord Yuwen's mother passed away...

314
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,440
...she left behind only one hairpin.

315
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,759
His lordship treasured that hairpin above all.

316
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,680
Who would have thought, after the Princess saw it...

317
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,039
...she snatched it by force.

318
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,359
Yuwen Rui surely wouldn't...

319
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,559
...hold a grudge over just a hairpin.

320
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:24,960
Right?

321
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,960
This servant does not know.

322
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,359
But...

323
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,359
Lord Yuwen held his late mother...

324
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,039
...in the highest esteem.

325
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,839
Once, there was a servant...

326
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,559
...who spoke improperly of his lordship's mother behind his back.

327
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
Later, that servant...

328
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,519
...what happened?

329
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
...suddenly vanished.

330
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,440
And couldn't be found anywhere.

331
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,839
Could the poisoner be Yuwen Rui?

332
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,000
No, I must think of a way.

333
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,039
Does the Princess feel unwell anywhere?

334
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,559
Everywhere is uncomfortable.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,559
My heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys all hurt.

336
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,640
I feel like I'm about to die.

337
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,640
Princess.

338
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Your pulse is completely normal.

339
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
Please don't tease this humble official.

340
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,480
You don't understand.

341
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,400
I really am about to die.

342
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,000
The Princess is blessed by heaven.

343
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,680
You will surely live a long life.

344
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,720
If only there were a universal antidote.

345
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,880
Princess, this humble official will go inquire about it.

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,000
Imperial Physician Chen!

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,319
I beg you!

348
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,359
Please, see my mistress quickly!

349
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,680
Princess, this servant will go see.

350
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,039
Imperial Physician Chen!

351
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,680
How dare you!

352
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,960
Who allowed you to barge into Fifth Princess's chambers?

353
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,160
Fifth Princess!

354
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,880
Please show mercy!

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,279
We beg you!

356
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,319
Just allow Imperial Physician Chen...

357
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,079
...to go treat our mistress.

358
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,680
It's all my mistress's fault.

359
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,559
She shouldn't have offended you in the imperial garden.

360
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
She shouldn't have picked the flowers you planted.

361
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,359
She shouldn't be thinner than you!

362
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,960
But our mistress didn't mean it!

363
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,480
Imperial Physician Chen.

364
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,519
Go and take a good look at their mistress.

365
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,799
Fifth Princess, rest assured.

366
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,880
I will definitely take a good look at their mistress.

367
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,440
No.

368
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,680
What I mean is...

369
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,839
Take a *good* look.

370
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,559
A *very* good look.

371
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,039
Understand?

372
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,039
Fifth Princess, rest assured.

373
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,079
This humble official understands completely.

374
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,319
How can Fifth Princess be so cruel?

375
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,759
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

376
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,359
Retribution is already on its way.

377
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,440
Why have you all come here?

378
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
Fourth Princess has arrived.

379
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,079
This cool, noble aura...

380
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,920
...it's clearly the female lead, An Kezi.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,880
Fourth Princess.

382
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,440
Fifth Princess won't allow the physician to see our mistress.

383
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,839
Imperial Physician Chen.

384
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,480
Aren't you going to take a proper look?

385
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
This...

386
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
I also just told Imperial Physician Chen...

387
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,400
...to take a good look at their mistress.

388
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,680
Right?

389
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,119
Yes.

390
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
The Princess did indeed say that.

391
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
Fifth Princess's "good look"...

392
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,119
...how could it be the same as Fourth Princess's?

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,119
Is this perhaps...

394
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,200
...the difference between the female lead and a vicious cannon fodder?

395
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,480
Even reckless behavior should have its limits.

396
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Imperial Physician Chen.

397
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,079
Are you still not going?

398
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:48,799
Yes.

399
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Thank you, Fourth Princess.

400
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,519
Royal Sister.

401
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,119
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

402
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,200
Perhaps you should keep your distance.

403
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,680
Lest you catch my illness.

404
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,880
Royal Sister.

405
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,559
Only in front of Father Emperor...

406
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,799
...do you call me Royal Sister.

407
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,920
Is that so?

408
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,799
I must be too ill...

409
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,200
...and a bit confused.

410
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,279
The trick of feigning illness to cancel the birthday banquet...

411
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,319
...you just used it yesterday.

412
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,720
The Princess is taller than this servant.

413
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,319
When Father Emperor arrives later...

414
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,559
...remember to give a loud signal.

415
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:56,759
Yes, Princess.

416
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
We pay respects to Your Majesty.

417
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,960
So fast?

418
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,799
The Emperor truly dotes on Fifth Princess.

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,039
The hanging method might work.

420
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,079
Princess, quick!

421
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,000
Get up there, get up there!

422
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,519
Princess, you mustn't do this!

423
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,519
If you do this...

424
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,279
...this servant will have failed Consort Chen!

425
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,920
Princess!

426
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,480
A Lan

427
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,559
If you'd rather die than marry Yuwen Rui

428
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,359
then your father can

429
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,440
Please, don't die!

430
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,920
If you die, this servant won't want to live either.

431
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Your Highness, please, stop acting.

432
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,680
You're overdoing it.

433
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,160
You truly are my good daughter.

434
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,200
Let me tell you,

435
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,519
the birthday banquet must be held.

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,079
I will also publicly announce

437
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,559
your wedding date with Yuwen Rui.

438
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,599
Your Highness,

439
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,079
it was this servant's fault.

440
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,799
It seems we must use the final move.

441
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,519
Where's a dog hole?

442
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,240
A Lan.

443
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,480
Where are you off to?

444
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,559
This peerlessly handsome face...

445
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,359
Could it be the male lead, Yuwen Xiu?

446
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,559
So,

447
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,640
the pose I just used to swoop down,

448
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,519
was it exceptionally dashing?

449
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,079
This 'handsome for less than three seconds'

450
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,680
and mysteriously confident look...

451
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,480
probably can't be the male lead.

452
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Seventh Cousin is asking you a question.

453
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Why aren't you answering?

454
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Great. It really is the male lead.

455
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,039
Are you trying to...

456
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,480
elope?

457
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,039
Keep your voice down!

458
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,519
Keep your voice down!

459
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,359
Guards! The Fifth Princess is trying to elope!

460
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,640
The Fifth Princess is eloping!

461
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,400
Someone, quick!

462
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
Guards!

463
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,720
The marriage hasn't even been arranged yet!

464
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,839
What kind of elopement is that?

465
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,640
A Lan,

466
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,599
Seventh Cousin is doing this for your own good.

467
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,359
For my own good?

468
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,039
Let me tell you the truth.

469
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,640
Right now, all the gambling houses in the city,

470
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
big and small, have opened a betting pool.

471
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,119
Betting on whether you'll marry our eldest cousin.

472
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,279
I've placed a bet of ten thousand taels

473
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,799
that you two will definitely get married.

474
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,599
The odds are one to a hundred!

475
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,200
Once I get that million taels,

476
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,359
I'll give you half.

477
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
Consider it your birthday gift.

478
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:08,960
So,

479
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,000
isn't Seventh Cousin very generous?

480
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,960
Generous?

481
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,599
So generous.

482
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,920
I heard you want the universal antidote.

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
Imperial Physician Chen is asking around everywhere.

484
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,640
It's all over the palace.

485
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,359
I'd also like to find this medicine for you,

486
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
but I don't know where to find it.

487
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
I wasn't finished talking!

488
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,240
Your Highness,

489
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,160
His Majesty has ordered those guards

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,559
to follow you every step of the way.

491
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,319
It seems he's determined

492
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,480
to announce at the birthday banquet

493
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,640
your marriage to Lord Yuwen.

494
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm afraid a funeral will come faster than a wedding.

495
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,359
Tell me,

496
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,519
if I apologize properly to Yuwen Rui,

497
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,960
reflect deeply on my actions,

498
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,759
and vow to turn over a new leaf,

499
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,960
would he...

500
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,599
magnanimously forgive me?

501
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,119
Your Highness, are you...

502
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,240
deciding to improve relations with Lord Yuwen?

503
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,200
If Your Highness is sincere,

504
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,039
you could certainly try.

505
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,559
Rumors say Lord Yuwen is ruthless

506
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,400
and holds grudges over the smallest matters.

507
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,799
But in this servant's view,

508
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Lord Yuwen probably isn't that kind of person.

509
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,599
He is exceptionally handsome,

510
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,400
with outstanding presence.

511
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,759
Countless women wish to marry him.

512
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,119
If Your Highness agrees to this marriage,

513
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,160
in the future you'll be deeply in love,

514
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,880
and treat each other with respect.

515
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,920
That's some wild imagination.

516
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,559
This servant would then

517
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,039
be worthy of Consort Chen's final wishes.

518
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,079
In that case...

519
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,400
The hairpin!

520
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,279
Go find the hairpin, quick!

521
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,599
The one that's Yuwen Rui's mother's heirloom,

522
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,759
the one I forcibly took from him.

523
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,519
Go find it!

524
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,039
We're all brothers here,

525
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,319
so let's not be so particular.

526
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,079
Here,

527
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,559
drink this cup of wine.

528
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,400
From now on, I'll be your little brother.

529
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,960
If you tell me to go east,

530
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,319
I'll never go west.

531
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,480
Come on.

532
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,400
No.

533
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,440
Yuwen Rui is heartless.

534
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,920
Without a life-and-death bond,

535
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,759
how could he possibly see me as a brother?

536
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,920
If not as a brother, then...

537
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,920
My lord, you are truly so handsome.

538
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,599
I'll return the hairpin to you.

539
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,319
Let's just forget the past.

540
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,480
What do you say?

541
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
No, no, no.

542
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,759
That's too disgusting.

543
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,119
What if I act more fragile and pitiful?

544
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,279
I was blinded by rumors

545
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,480
and couldn't accept marrying you for a moment.

546
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,119
That's why I caused that scene at your manor.

547
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,279
Could you forgive me just this once?

548
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,039
Your Highn...

549
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,079
You might not know,

550
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,559
I'm a person whose words don't match my heart.

551
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,559
My mouth says I detest you, I dislike you,

552
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,920
but actually...

553
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,240
Ling Rui.

554
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,039
Actually what?

555
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,359
Right!

556
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
Yuwen Rui's prototype is Ling Rui.

557
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,079
Fifth Princess,

558
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
actually...

559
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,000
I...

560
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,599
admire you.

561
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,920
I revere you.

562
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,160
I adore you.

563
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,000
The Fifth Princess seems like a different person.

564
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:41,759
Is that so?

565
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,599
People can change.

566
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,519
By the way,

567
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,400
your hairpin...

568
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,759
Didn't the Fifth Princess say back then

569
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,480
that once something is in your hands,

570
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,680
it's yours?

571
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,519
I was immature back then.

572
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,799
I wonder where the poison will be.

573
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,920
What a waste of my favorite grapes.

574
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Come, come, come.

575
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,200
Today is A Lan's birthday.

576
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,599
Everyone, make yourselves at home.

577
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,279
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Father.

578
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,160
A Lan.

579
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,200
Your royal uncle has a gift for you.

580
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,680
This is made from an auspicious stone.

581
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Auspicious stone?

582
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,359
Prince Ning spent half a year in Anzhou.

583
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,000
Helping the local people deal with a locust plague.

584
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,279
The people were immensely grateful.

585
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
So they presented him with this.

586
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,240
That is excellent.

587
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,759
Excellent.

588
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:13,839
Your Majesty.

589
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,759
This humble official also has a gift for the Fifth Princess.

590
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:17,960
Good.

591
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
Does the Fifth Princess like it?

592
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,039
I like it.

593
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,319
I like it very much.

594
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,599
May the Fifth Princess be as elegant as the daylily, with lasting youth and beauty.

595
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,839
May you have this day every year.

596
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,680
And this moment every year to come.

597
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,279
That's entirely unnecessary.

598
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,640
Why isn't the Fifth Princess drinking?

599
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,799
What's wrong, A Lan?

600
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,640
Father.

601
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,359
A Lan misses Mother Consort.

602
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,519
I still remember...

603
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,039
When Mother Consort accompanied me...

604
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,839
For my last birthday with her.

605
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,079
She personally brewed fine fruit wine.

606
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
But I...

607
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,680
Can never drink it again.

608
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,519
How did I not know Consort Chen could brew wine?

609
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,640
Father didn't even know that?

610
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,680
No wonder Mother Consort often lamented in life...

611
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,160
Saying in the next life...

612
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,119
She only wished to be an ordinary couple with Father.

613
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,559
You'd till the fields, I'd weave the cloth.

614
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,759
You'd carry water, I'd tend the garden.

615
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,480
That way...

616
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,079
At the very least, we could see each other every day.

617
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,119
I have wronged your mother consort.

618
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,880
This cup of wine...

619
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,039
A Lan wishes to toast to every little memory with Mother Consort.

620
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
This servant deserves death! This servant deserves death!

621
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,119
Father, you see...

622
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,160
I'd like to step out and compose myself.

623
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,200
Alright, alright. Go quickly and return soon.

624
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,599
Of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best.

625
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,400
Do you know where the map is hidden?

626
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,079
Not yet.

627
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,239
We can't just wait forever.

628
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,119
I will send someone to investigate the Benevolent Heart Hall.

629
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
That was close.

630
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,079
Someone's here.

631
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,880
This works too?

632
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,079
Fifth Princess.

633
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,880
Who were those two just now?

634
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,519
This is a story...

635
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,719
About a group of people fighting for the realm...

636
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,719
The Map of the Nine Provinces.

637
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
In the end, few met a good fate.

638
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,400
The year's most bizarre drama.

639
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,920
What they're looking for is the Map of the Nine Provinces.

640
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,760
Fifth Princess.

641
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Fifth Princess.

642
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
This humble official will escort you back.

643
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,079
That's not necessary.

644
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,880
I still need to return to the palace to freshen up.

645
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:12,760
His Majesty has ordered...

646
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,360
No matter what the Princess says...

647
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
We are to bring the Princess back.

648
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,639
By the way...

649
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,760
Did any of you just see...

650
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,719
Who went that way?

651
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,079
Reporting to the Princess.

652
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,719
When this lowly officer was searching for you...

653
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,719
I passed by that area.

654
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,119
I think I saw the Chief Grand Secretary.

655
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,360
Yuwen Rui.

656
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,559
Fifth Princess, please.

657
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,039
Princess!

658
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,320
I finally found you!

659
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,119
Just now, Imperial Physician Chen...

660
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,599
Sent someone to give me the universal antidote.

661
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,639
He said he found it from a medicine merchant.

662
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,079
And told me to give it to you immediately.

663
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,960
I've already removed the beeswax seal.

664
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,320
You can take it directly.

665
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,280
If it could be found so easily...

666
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,519
A universal antidote...

667
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,199
Then the Fifth Princess in the original story...

668
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,920
How could she have died from poison?

669
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,239
Princess?

670
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
Where is your jade pendant?

671
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,880
Let's go.

672
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:48,599
Yes.

673
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,199
Princess, what's wrong?

674
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,719
The antidote...

675
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,719
The antidote is poisoned!

676
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,119
Fifth Princess!

677
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:01,920
Princess!

678
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:02,679
Fifth Princess!

679
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,639
Princess!

680
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,559
Go fetch the imperial physicians! Quickly!

681
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:05,840
Yes!

682
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,920
Princess! Princess!

683
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Don't scare me like this!

684
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,679
Princess...

685
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,280
Your Majesty!

686
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,559
This humble official never found any antidote.

687
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,239
Nor... nor did I send anyone to deliver medicine to the Fifth Princess.

688
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,400
I beg Your Majesty to investigate thoroughly.

689
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,880
I beg Your Majesty to investigate.

690
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,880
Well?

691
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,159
Your Majesty...

692
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,519
This humble official is powerless.

693
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,800
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

694
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,920
A bunch of useless fools!

695
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,400
What use are you to me?!

696
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,639
Is there truly no other way?

697
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,639
Your Majesty.

698
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,519
This humble official does have one method...

699
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,760
That... perhaps we could try.

700
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,519
Imperial Physician Chen

701
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,920
This silver needle is too thick.

702
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
It's almost as thick as a pen.

703
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,159
If you insert this needle,

704
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,519
can An Kelan endure it?

705
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,039
When this needle goes in,

706
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,079
the pain will be like a spike piercing the heart.

707
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,480
But it can unblock all orifices and meridians.

708
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,920
It might wake the princess.

709
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:24,960
Your Majesty,

710
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,559
the eunuch who delivered the medicine has been found.

711
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,960
Speak quickly.

712
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,039
He was an orderly from the Imperial Hospital.

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,159
Why would that orderly want to poison An Kelan?

714
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,960
When I found him,

715
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,239
he had already hanged himself.

716
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,079
However, in the orderly's room,

717
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
I found a suicide note and a packet of poison.

718
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,760
The letter states

719
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,880
that a few days ago,

720
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,920
this man offended the Fifth Princess in the imperial garden.

721
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,159
The Fifth Princess ordered him to receive thirty cane strikes.

722
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,639
He held a grudge.

723
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,119
An Kelan?

724
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:02,599
What is it?

725
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:02,960
Your Majesty...

726
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,719
Father...

727
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,639
This...

728
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:24,800
An Kelan.
