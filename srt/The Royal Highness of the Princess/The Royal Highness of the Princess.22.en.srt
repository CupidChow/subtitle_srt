1
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,040
If you like that wine,

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
I'll have more sent to the palace.

3
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,319
A Lan.

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,480
A Lan.

5
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
There was no "daughter's wedding wine."

6
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,439
That "Lover's Wine" was brewed by me, for you.

7
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
All my life,

8
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,599
I've never believed in gods or ghosts.

9
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
But the day I left Jingzhou,

10
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,800
I still went to the Jingzhou Snow Mountain.

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
If it's for you,

12
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,000
believing once is no trouble.

13
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,520
There are some words

14
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
I should have told you long ago.

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,719
A Lan, I like you.

16
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,319
I want you to know how much I like you,

17
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,039
but I like you so much

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,319
that I don't want you to know

19
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,439
just how much.

20
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,319
A Lan.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,840
A Lan.

22
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,240
Thank you, Meng Shaojue.

23
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,800
If she suffers any grievance,

24
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,719
I will not let you off.

25
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:08,960
My Lord.

26
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,319
I have sent men to search diligently for

27
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,639
the Sword Maniac and the Hidden Gate's Forbidden Grounds.

28
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
We should have results soon.

29
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,000
Move faster.

30
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,920
In five days is Yunmi's Celestial Rite.

31
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,680
Is everything prepared?

32
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,360
Rest assured, My Lord.

33
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,199
Everything is ready.

34
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
When the grand Celestial Rite begins,

35
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,199
and the Yunmi royal family offers sacrifices and prayers,

36
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,360
we can slay our enemies with our own hands

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
and restore Yunze.

38
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,680
Princess, you're awake.

39
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,319
How did I get back last night?

40
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,959
Lord Yuwen brought you back.

41
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,199
Princess, how could you get drunk?

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,839
And...

43
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,160
and let Lord Yuwen carry you back?

44
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,079
I can't remember.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Your servant will have to watch you closely from now on.

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,079
I'm a bit hungry.

47
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
Go prepare some food for me first.

48
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,480
Speak.

49
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,160
What's the task this time?

50
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,680
This time's task

51
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,720
has an exceptionally, exceptionally high difficulty.

52
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
It's among all tasks...

53
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,319
Alright,

54
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,639
stop being cryptic.

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,480
Just say it.

56
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,399
You will save an

57
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,319
elder who is determined to end his life.

58
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
Even the cannon fodder has gone from passively meeting misfortune

59
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
to actively seeking death.

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,319
No wonder it's the hardest.

61
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,480
Tell me,

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
who is this pessimistic old man?

63
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,439
You know him.

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Grand Tutor Guan.

65
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,720
He will, inside the Benevolent Heart Hall,

66
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,120
dash himself against the Imperial Desk and die.

67
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,040
What could he be so troubled about?

68
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,120
Heaven's secrets cannot be revealed.

69
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,120
Go find the answer yourself.

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Next time,

71
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,560
could you assign me

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,759
a simpler task?

73
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,439
Saving people is too heavy.

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,680
Wouldn't saving some plants be better?

75
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,120
Grand Tutor Guan.

76
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,800
Grand Tutor Guan.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,519
Your copy of this painting

78
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,480
is truly lifelike.

79
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,600
Those who don't know

80
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,319
would think it's the Painting Sage's original work.

81
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,639
Your Majesty flatters me.

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Your servant dares not compare to the Painting Sage.

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,040
This...

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,639
Grand Tutor,

85
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,399
I heard from the imperial physician

86
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,399
you've been listless lately.

87
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,079
This is a thousand-year ginseng I had sought.

88
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,959
Take it.

89
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,240
Your Majesty,

90
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
such a precious item...

91
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,439
Your Majesty should keep it.

92
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,759
I am bestowing it upon you.

93
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Just accept it properly.

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,360
Your servant obeys the decree.

95
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,240
Princess,

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,399
why are you urgently looking for Grand Tutor Guan?

97
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,240
Yesterday in the imperial garden,

98
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,839
I accidentally overheard

99
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,639
the Grand Tutor has thoughts of suicide.

100
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,639
Grand Tutor Guan is fine.

101
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,160
Why would he seek death?

102
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,920
Right.

103
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,120
This...

104
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,879
is something Grand Tutor Guan must tell us himself.

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,879
In a few days is the Celestial Rite.

106
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,879
Is everything prepared?

107
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,600
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

108
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,279
Everything is ready.

109
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,279
Father.

110
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,920
What brings you here?

111
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,399
Your child heard Grand Tutor Guan is immensely learned

112
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
and his zither skills are peerless.

113
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,920
So I came to pay my respects.

114
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,240
Why won't you let me intervene in

115
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,199
A Lan and Lord Yuwen's marriage?

116
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,399
A Lan's heart already belongs to another.

117
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,559
The one she loves

118
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
is Lord Yuwen.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,639
A Lan.

120
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
About you and Lord Yuwen,

121
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,120
when do you plan to tell your father?

122
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,759
How about now?

123
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,480
I heard he nearly lost his life

124
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,799
to save you.

125
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,919
That is rather rare.

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,799
I never thought

127
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,879
he could go to such lengths for you.

128
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,480
It's just a pity for the Meng family's young master.

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
Meng Shaojue.

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,759
What about him?

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,080
Nothing.

132
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,039
Father,

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,759
your child wishes to apprentice under Grand Tutor Guan

134
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,240
to learn zither skills from him.

135
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,200
In the future, when others ask,

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
among music, chess, calligraphy, and painting,

137
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,279
your child can claim mastery in at least one.

138
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,679
You...

139
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,399
You, of all people?

140
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,159
With your meager talent,

141
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
wanting to master it

142
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
is simply a fool's dream.

143
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,639
Better not bother the Grand Tutor.

144
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,799
Such a dear father.

145
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,840
Precisely because your child is foolish,

146
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,320
I need to learn even more.

147
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:49,960
Your Majesty,

148
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,799
since the Fifth Princess wishes to learn,

149
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,240
your servant will teach her.

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,879
Fifth Princess

151
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,519
Watch closely, this old minister's technique.

152
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:38,960
Princess

153
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:39,919
Grand Tutor Guan

154
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,240
Princess

155
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,279
This servant has investigated everything.

156
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,919
Grand Tutor Guan has indeed been listless lately.

157
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,759
He often goes to the Drunken Immortal Inn to drown his sorrows.

158
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,200
It seems he has some troubles on his mind.

159
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's work together in a moment.

160
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,159
See if we can get

161
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,879
anything out of him.

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,679
Grand Tutor

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,559
Why do you look so worried?

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,639
Is something troubling you?

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
This old minister is fine.

166
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,919
Life is full of disappointments.

167
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,639
Take me, for instance.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,039
I lost my mother when I was young.

169
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,399
Yes, yes.

170
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,919
In this life,

171
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,000
who can have smooth sailing?

172
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,039
When this servant was little,

173
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,559
my parents passed away.

174
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,480
Actually,

175
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
we are all pitiful souls.

176
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,559
My children died in the war.

177
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,080
I still remember clearly

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
how they looked before they died.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
How did your parents die?

180
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,559
They went hunting in the mountains

181
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
and encountered a wolf pack.

182
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,440
This servant didn't even get

183
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,480
to see them one last time.

184
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,399
How old were you

185
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,320
when they died?

186
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
Only ten.

187
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,720
Back then,

188
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,559
I had no money for their funeral.

189
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,120
I only found a worn straw mat

190
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
to wrap their bodies in

191
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,840
and buried them behind an old temple.

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,159
So that means

193
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:50,799
all these years,

194
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,279
you never gave them a proper burial?

195
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,480
No.

196
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,399
Later, I entered the palace.

197
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,120
I regret it so much, Xi Xi.

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,559
Xiao Li Zi.

199
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,320
What about you?

200
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Is your family all here?

201
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,799
Your servant...

202
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,279
Your servant doesn't even know who her parents are.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,159
No parents to love me.

204
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,799
You must have suffered a lot.

205
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,679
Your servant was almost sold by traffickers as a child.

206
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,799
Alright, alright, Princess.

207
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,360
Alright.

208
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Don't cry, don't cry.

209
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,879
I never imagined

210
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,919
your lives were so hard.

211
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,080
I thought my life was tragic,

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
but I didn't expect you two...

213
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,159
One abandoned by parents as a child,

214
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,600
one with no money to bury their parents.

215
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,960
It's truly pitiful.

216
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,600
Grand Tutor Guan is right.

217
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,480
This servant's life is so bitter!

218
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,759
Grand Tutor.

219
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,840
Perhaps you should go back for today.

220
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,240
Alright.

221
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,039
Alright, alright, alright.

222
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,240
Weren't we supposed to counsel Grand Tutor Guan?

223
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,639
Right.

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,240
Alright.

225
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,360
From now on,

226
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,360
as long as I'm here,

227
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,720
I will never let you suffer.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,440
Understand?

229
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,840
Princess.

230
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,519
Perhaps you should take a bath first.

231
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,799
Fine.

232
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,679
Why would Grand Tutor Guan crash to his death in the Benevolent Heart Hall?

233
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
Risking death to remonstrate?

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,960
But the Grand Tutor has long stayed out of court affairs.

235
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,679
To prove his resolve with death?

236
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,360
But Father trusts Grand Tutor Guan deeply.

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,679
What resolve does he need to prove?

238
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,600
My Lord, you've come.

239
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,960
The princess told your servant about the southern trip.

240
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
I didn't expect you to test medicine for the princess,

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
nearly losing your life.

242
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
My Lord's devotion to the princess is truly deep.

243
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,799
Then your servant can

244
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,519
start preparing the little master's clothes again.

245
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,120
The weather is getting a bit cold.

246
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,039
Shall we prepare a little cotton-padded jacket for the little master?

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,000
And also prepare some...

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,519
Xi Xi.

249
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Where is the princess?

250
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,919
The princess has been waiting for you for a long time.

251
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,879
Please, My Lord.

252
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,879
Xi Xi.

253
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
My head hurts a bit.

254
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,320
Help me massage it.

255
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,000
Gently.

256
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,079
The water is a bit cold.

257
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,279
Add some more hot water for me.

258
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,440
It's been a long time since I've been this relaxed.

259
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,799
Do you want to take a hot bath later?

260
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,160
I'll show you

261
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,480
my latest massage technique.

262
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,440
Are you sure?

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,519
You... how are you here?

264
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,920
Xi Xi told me

265
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,200
you've been waiting for me for a while.

266
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,279
That unreliable Xi Xi.

267
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,599
You... you go out first.

268
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Back at my villa,

269
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,640
you insisted on attending my bath.

270
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,279
Now,

271
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,559
it's just returning the favor.

272
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Our A Lan is shy.

273
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,960
You go out first.

274
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,359
Don't catch a cold.

275
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,240
I'll wait for you outside.

276
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,680
Everything was meticulously prepared, right?

277
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,359
Just two days ago, you were guarded against like a thief.

278
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,920
Today, you're being treated with courtesy.

279
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,039
You're smarter than I imagined.

280
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,720
About the Third Prince of Yunze...

281
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,839
How is the investigation going?

282
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
Too much time has passed.

283
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
It's very difficult to find anything.

284
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,039
However, there is one rather strange thing.

285
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,039
What?

286
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,839
Nanny Mo, all these years in the palace...

287
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,000
Seems to have been secretly cared for by someone.

288
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,920
Can we find out who's behind it?

289
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,839
This person is quite cautious.

290
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,000
They've only sent some food and clothing, that's all.

291
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,440
It must be the Third Prince of Yunze.

292
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,400
He might have changed his identity.

293
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,359
Really?

294
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,920
That's the standard plot in all revenge stories.

295
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,079
Why?

296
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,160
Why do I increasingly feel...

297
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,279
That you are quite different from us?

298
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,160
You always use words I've never heard.

299
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,599
It seems you have some secret.

300
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,720
Is that so?

301
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,119
We are different.

302
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
It's very likely because...

303
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,559
Everyone has different circumstances.

304
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,720
Forget it.

305
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
Tell me when you're ready to talk.

306
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,200
Regarding the Third Prince of Yunze...

307
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,440
I will have people continue investigating.

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,039
I'll tell you if we find anything.

309
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Why did you recently decide to learn the qin from Grand Tutor Guan?

310
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,480
For some personal reasons.

311
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,440
I'll tell you later.

312
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,279
If you want to learn the qin, I can teach you.

313
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,039
See?

314
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,200
I do have some talent for learning the qin.

315
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
That must be because I'm a good teacher.

316
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
That's true.

317
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,720
I teach you to play the qin...

318
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,519
Don't I deserve some reward?

319
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,400
Come here.

320
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,880
Continue.

321
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,079
You lunatic!

322
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,079
Are you blind? Watch where you're going!

323
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,240
Third Prince!

324
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,359
Third Prince!

325
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,279
Third Prince! Your Highness!

326
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,359
Who gave you the nerve...

327
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,160
To bully this mad nanny?

328
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,279
Young Master Xiu.

329
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
Don't you know the Fifth Princess gave an order...

330
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,359
That no one is to bully her?

331
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,119
Young Master Xiu.

332
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,759
It was this mad nanny...

333
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,359
Get lost!

334
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,599
Yes.

335
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Third Prince!

336
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,839
Third Prince!

337
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,119
Third Prince!

338
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
Candied hawthorn berries!

339
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,240
Come and buy them! Candied hawthorn berries!

340
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,039
Princess.

341
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,759
Xiao Li has investigated everything clearly.

342
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,160
Recently, Grand Tutor Guan...

343
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,279
Has been coming to the Drunken Immortal Inn to drown his sorrows.

344
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,920
What on earth is troubling him so much?

345
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,440
Your servant knows!

346
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
It must be heartbreak!

347
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,079
That's how it always is in the storybooks.

348
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,319
He loves her...

349
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,000
But she loves him...

350
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,240
She flees...

351
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,880
He chases...

352
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,480
She has no way to escape.

353
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,400
Can't your little head be a bit more down-to-earth?

354
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,359
Could it be trouble in his official career?

355
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,920
No, that's not it either.

356
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,279
Xiao Li said...

357
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,799
In a few days, at the Celestial Rite...

358
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,559
Grand Tutor Guan was chosen as the Minister of Heavenly Offering.

359
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,920
So many ministers covet this honor.

360
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,160
For Grand Tutor Guan to be selected this year...

361
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,519
Means he is highly favored by His Majesty.

362
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,119
Then, holding the Heavenly Offering Cup...

363
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
He will present the Heavenly Water for His Majesty to drink...

364
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
To pray for national peace and prosperity...

365
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,039
And favorable weather.

366
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,799
That's way too smooth sailing.

367
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,960
Grand Tutor Guan.

368
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,279
Fifth Princess.

369
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,160
This...

370
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,440
Grand Tutor's qin skills are truly masterful.

371
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,200
However...

372
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
Just now, listening to you play at the door...

373
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,400
I don't know why...

374
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,319
I sensed a kind of...

375
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,039
Faint, lingering sorrow.

376
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,799
Is... is that so?

377
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,079
Does Grand Tutor have something on his mind?

378
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,240
Why not tell me about it?

379
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,880
But this is clearly a cheerful tune.

380
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,880
Fifth Princess...

381
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,519
Why did you hear sorrow in it?

382
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,880
Is that so?

383
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
Then you must ask yourself, Grand Tutor.

384
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,319
Drowning sorrows in wine only deepens them.

385
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:53,960
Grand Tutor.

386
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,279
Staying alone in this dim room for too long...

387
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
Makes one especially prone to despair.

388
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,480
Xi Xi.

389
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:03,759
Grand Tutor.

390
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:04,480
Let's go.

391
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,400
Fifth Princess!

392
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,680
What are you doing? Fifth Princess!

393
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,480
This...

394
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,119
Come on, come on.

395
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,079
You can't stay cooped up in this room all the time.

396
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,319
Exactly! You need to go out more.

397
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,519
See the beauty of this world.

398
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,720
Experience the liveliness of human life.

399
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,279
And the vitality of life.

400
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,160
Right!

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,079
The vitality of life.

402
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,039
Today is not a good day to go out.

403
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Let's just go inside and sit and talk.

404
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:32,839
Hold on!

405
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,680
Why is there a miasma lingering here?

406
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,039
A dark aura that won't disperse.

407
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,119
Sir...

408
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,240
You must be referring to the funeral procession over there.

409
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,000
No.

410
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,160
It's from this direction.

411
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,680
I see that this gentleman...

412
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,400
Will soon face a bloody disaster.

413
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,640
Would you like to spend money to avert this calamity?

414
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,640
He actually guessed right by sheer luck.

415
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,880
Such is fate.

416
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,160
Why struggle against it?

417
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,160
This old man's life is nearly over.

418
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,359
Fifth Princess...

419
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,279
I must take my leave.

420
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,599
Grand Tutor Guan!

421
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,480
Guest, please come inside.

422
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,799
This young lady...

423
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,599
You will soon face a bloody disaster.

424
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,000
Should we spend money to avoid disaster?

425
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,920
What nonsense are you talking?

426
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,480
Get out of the way.

427
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,599
This young lady...

428
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,119
Princess.

429
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,319
Grand Tutor Guan seems even more dejected.

430
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,400
What should we do now?

431
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,880
It seems we must use the final move.

432
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,160
In heaven, we wish to be lovebirds.

433
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,599
On earth, we wish to be intertwined branches.

434
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,640
Lovebirds and intertwined branches both symbolize marital love.

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,880
In my hometown,

436
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,039
on the day a couple marries,

437
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,759
they bury strands of their hair

438
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,279
together beneath an intertwined branch.

439
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
It can bless them to grow old together.

440
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,720
Grand Tutor.

441
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,279
Long time no see!

442
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,559
Fifth Princess.

443
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,839
We just saw each other yesterday.

444
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,160
What business do you have now?

445
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,160
This... this...

446
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:18,440
Come.

447
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,920
Fifth Princess,

448
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,720
please spare this old minister.

449
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,960
This old minister truly is not ill!

450
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,279
Sick people all say they're not sick.

451
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,319
Grand Tutor,

452
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,279
don't be nervous.

453
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,200
Relax.

454
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,000
Listen to me.

455
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,160
Slowly close your eyes.

456
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,000
Close them.

457
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,240
Now,

458
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,039
you are about to enter a world of birdsong and fragrant flowers,

459
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,400
a world with babbling streams.

460
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,119
You slowly walk into it.

461
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,359
You find the path ahead is bright and clear.

462
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,359
The world is so beautiful.

463
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,279
Princess,

464
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,799
what method is this?

465
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,240
Psychological hypnosis.

466
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,160
I saw it on tele...

467
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,240
I read it in a book.

468
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,920
I didn't expect it to actually work.

469
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,400
You slowly walk to the side of a lake.

470
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,519
From the crystal-clear lake water,

471
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,079
you see your own reflection.

472
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,519
Besides your reflection,

473
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,200
you also see

474
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
the nightmare that has been haunting you.

475
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,599
Think about it.

476
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,200
What is it that you can't let go of?

477
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,079
And what has been troubling you?

478
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,319
It's a guilty conscience.

479
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,880
Think again.

480
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,599
What makes you feel guilty?

481
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,359
There was still some gain.

482
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:09,799
At least

483
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,039
we cured his insomnia.

484
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:25,720
My Lord.

485
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,240
Sword Maniac's trail has been found in Yu Zhen.

486
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Princess.

487
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,119
This move didn't work either.

488
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,039
What should we do?

489
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Grand Tutor Guan usually stays out of court affairs.

490
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,920
He even likes to run a private school at home.

491
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,319
He doesn't charge any money,

492
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,160
teaching children from poor families for free,

493
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,920
to read and write.

494
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,880
How could such a person want to end his life?

495
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,799
Don't you think so?

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,359
Prin...

497
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,680
Miss.

498
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,559
Come take a look.

499
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
This face powder smells so nice.

500
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,839
Pick whatever you like.

501
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,759
I'll give it to you.

502
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,480
Yo... young lady.

503
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,599
This rouge and powder is buy... buy...

504
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,680
Buy one, get two free, right?

505
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,160
You're the one who sold fake knives before, right?

506
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,720
Ye... yes, yes, that's right.

507
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,359
I'll buy one.

508
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:15,799
Here you go.

509
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,799
Buy... buy one, get two free.

510
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,000
Beauty powder and... and...

511
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Aphrodisiac, right?

512
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,559
No need.

513
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,200
Thank you.

514
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,359
It's not an aphrodisiac.

515
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,240
It's... Aphrodisiac Powder.

516
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,160
Just give me the beauty powder.

517
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,039
Alright!

518
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,640
Dis... dissolve it in water and drink.

519
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,279
I... I made a mistake.

520
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
It... it's Aphrodisiac Powder.

521
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,920
Princess.

522
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,839
Princess.

523
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,599
Princess.

524
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,599
This servant just heard

525
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,839
His Majesty ordered Lord Yuwen

526
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,079
to go to Yu Zhen tomorrow on business.

527
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,279
Go to Yu Zhen?

528
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,839
Yes.

529
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:03,799
Lord Yuwen

530
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,079
also came to Yunxi Palace today.

531
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,000
Seeing you were not here,

532
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,079
he said he would return tonight.

533
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,599
Princess.

534
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,640
How is it going with Grand Tutor Guan?

535
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,400
We can only think of another way.

536
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,880
Alright.

537
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,960
Stop sighing.

538
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,759
If we can't counsel Grand Tutor Guan,

539
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,960
then let's think of a way

540
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,759
to make it impossible for him to die no matter what.

541
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,559
How about that?

542
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Impossible to die?

543
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,079
The princess is clever!

544
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,480
I have an idea.

545
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,119
Your allotted lifespan is not yet over.

546
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,319
You have no place in the underworld.

547
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
If you have thoughts of suicide again,

548
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,640
you will not be spared lightly.

549
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,279
Grand Tutor Guan is advanced in years.

550
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,440
Do you want him to be scared to death?

551
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Your servant has an idea.

552
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,640
If he wants to drown himself in a river,

553
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,160
we'll just fill in the river.

554
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,119
I have an idea.
