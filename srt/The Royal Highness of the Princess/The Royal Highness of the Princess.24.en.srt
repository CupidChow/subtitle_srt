1
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,359
Father, don't drink it!

2
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,040
What?

3
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,800
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,639
Guards!

5
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,280
Summon the imperial physician!

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,879
Your Majesty!

7
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,080
Guards! It was you who poisoned it!

8
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,919
Your Majesty!

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,159
What's happening?

10
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,240
It seems A Lan already knows something.

11
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,719
You are actually the third prince of Yunze.

12
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,919
Aren't you?

13
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,280
A Lan is indeed clever.

14
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,680
The third prince of Yunze, Your Majesty?

15
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,560
Weren't you already dead?

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,840
You are the one colluding with Prince Ning.

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,800
The one hiding in the shadows is also you.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,039
Yuwen Rui and I treated you like family.

19
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
Royal Sister was even more devoted, wanting to marry you.

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,479
But you...

21
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,280
What about me?

22
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,719
When Yunmi burned our Yunze territory years ago,

23
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,439
and wounded our Yunze warriors,

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
you should have expected this day would come.

25
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,159
What?

26
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,759
Is Yunmi the only one allowed to destroy my homeland?

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
Am I not allowed to slaughter your Yunmi royal family?

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,919
A Lan.

29
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,639
You can't blame me.

30
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,400
Yunze's destruction

31
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,759
was simply its own fault.

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Its own fault?

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,840
You really know how to twist the truth.

34
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,680
Your Majesty!

35
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,439
Guards! Protect His Majesty!

36
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,120
Your Majesty!

37
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,800
Guards!

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,240
Your Majesty!

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
This...

40
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,400
What is this?

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,080
Your Majesty!

42
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,199
You...

43
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,039
Your Majesty!

44
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,520
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,159
Father!

46
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,360
Your Majesty! Father! Your Majesty!

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Commander He!

48
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,839
Who ordered you to be here?

49
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,759
Step aside!

50
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,519
Fourth Princess.

51
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,399
Please return to your room to rest.

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,639
Our master has ordered

53
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,360
that you are not to leave your room.

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Who is your master?

55
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,439
Step aside!

56
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,480
Except for His Majesty and the Fifth Princess,

57
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,600
take everyone to Liuyun Hall.

58
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,160
Without my order,

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,199
no one is to enter.

60
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes!

61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,839
Move! Your Majesty.

62
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,040
Your Majesty, move!

63
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,480
Hurry up!

64
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,720
Your Majesty!

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,079
Your Majesty!

66
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,720
Move!

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,759
Your Majesty! What are you doing?

68
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,959
Your Majesty!

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,199
Hurry!

70
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,560
Your Majesty!

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,639
Hurry!

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Empress, hurry!

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,759
Go!

74
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,600
You...

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,959
You really are...

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,240
Su Qi, the third prince of Yunze.

77
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,480
Your Majesty actually remembers my name.

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,680
When Your Majesty sent troops to attack Yunze years ago,

79
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,519
did you ever think

80
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,680
that over a decade later,

81
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,240
your life and those of the Yunmi royal family

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,639
would be in my hands?

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,920
The Grand Tutor I trusted without doubt,

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,079
and even my palace guards,

85
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,439
are all under your control.

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,360
It seems your scheming wasn't just for a day or two.

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
National and familial hatred

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,759
naturally requires careful planning.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,240
Where is the Map of the Nine Provinces and the Secret Key?

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,720
Even if I die,

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,000
I will not give you the key and the map.

92
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,759
Father! Father!

93
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,720
It seems you won't relent until you see your own coffin.

94
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
How about I cripple one of your hands first?

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,800
Stop!

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,079
Royal Sister!

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,959
Whoever dares hurt them, try it!

98
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,000
Father!

99
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,879
A Zi!

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,600
A Lan!

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,319
You really are Su Qi?

102
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,680
The third prince of Yunze?

103
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,720
A Zi.

104
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,839
I...

105
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,759
Say it.

106
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you Yuwen Xiu,

107
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,360
or are you Su Qi?

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,319
Yuwen Xiu died long ago.

109
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,199
He was recuperating outside the capital since childhood.

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,120
He died of illness when he was eight.

111
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,360
At that time, I was rescued by loyalists.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,920
We found a way to take over Yuwen Xiu's identity.

113
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,959
You hid it quite well.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,279
It's my fault for being so foolish.

115
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,440
I never once doubted you.

116
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,440
I even wanted to grow old together with you.

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
Release Father and A Lan.

118
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
The Map of the Nine Provinces and the Secret Key

119
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
are still in your father's hands.

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Then...

121
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,840
Draw your sword.

122
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,480
A Zi.

123
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Don't force me.

124
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,720
Royal Sister!

125
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,399
A Zi!

126
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
All that carefree attitude,

127
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
all that poor martial skill,

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
it was all fake.

129
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,360
From today onward,

130
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,080
you and I

131
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,399
are like this sword.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,799
From now on,

133
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,240
all ties are severed.

134
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,519
Let go of me!

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
Let go of me!

136
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,919
I will never let you go in this lifetime.

137
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,480
You're insane!

138
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,320
I am indeed insane.

139
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,159
What exactly do you want?

140
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,279
Your father will be safe for now.

141
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,279
Persuade him to hand over the Secret Key and the treasure map quickly.

142
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,559
Otherwise,

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,799
all of you will die.

144
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,919
Lock them both in Renxin Hall.

145
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,799
Post guards to watch them closely.

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,679
Yes!

147
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Put me down, Royal Sister!

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
Put me down, Royal Sister!

149
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,399
If you dare harm my father and A Lan

150
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,919
I will kill you with my own hands

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,279
You stay by my side

152
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,440
We'll be like we always were

153
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,159
I promise not to harm them

154
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Like always

155
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,559
But you are Su Qi

156
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,519
Not Yuwen Xiu

157
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,120
Father

158
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,919
Are you alright?

159
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,200
A Lan

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,919
Listen to me

161
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,679
There is a secret passage in the palace

162
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,080
It leads to Zigui Mountain outside the city

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,799
What do you want?

164
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,879
Our master is soft-hearted

165
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,120
He won't force you to hand over the map and key

166
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm different

167
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,919
If you don't want to get hurt

168
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,840
Hand them over now

169
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,399
I fear if I hand them over

170
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,799
I'll die even sooner

171
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,720
You're not afraid of death

172
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
But what about the Fifth Princess?

173
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,679
You!

174
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,360
No need to look at me like that, Fifth Princess

175
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,159
Blame your father

176
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,720
I'll ask one last time

177
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,519
Where are the map and the key?

178
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,799
You scoundrel!

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Don't worry about me, Father

180
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
Don't you dare regret this

181
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,919
Stop!

182
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,840
Fine

183
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
The treasure map and the key

184
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,960
I'll give them to you

185
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,600
Father!

186
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,039
Those things are not as important as you

187
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,159
Take them

188
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,600
Father! Father!

189
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,039
Father...

190
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,240
Finally got them

191
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,960
Sir

192
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,759
Prince Ning has woken up

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,360
Just a useless pawn

194
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,039
Him waking up is pointless

195
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,399
Keep watch over them

196
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,120
They are not to leave Renxin Hall

197
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,919
Yes

198
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,600
Oh, right

199
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,519
There's something I forgot to tell the Fifth Princess

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,759
Yuwen Rui, on his way to Yu Town...

201
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,159
Died

202
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,879
What did you say?

203
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,600
Why the fuss, Fifth Princess?

204
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
If Yuwen Rui hadn't died

205
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,080
How could our plan

206
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
have proceeded so smoothly?

207
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,639
With just you people?

208
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,360
You think you could take his life?

209
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
In terms of martial skill alone

210
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,879
Our men were no match for him

211
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,879
But who told him to care so much about you?

212
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,879
What do you mean?

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
We sent someone disguised as you

214
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,399
When he went to save "you"

215
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,679
They stabbed him

216
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,720
Impossible

217
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,399
He wouldn't die

218
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Don't you dare lie to me

219
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,399
This item should look familiar, Fifth Princess

220
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,879
I heard when Yuwen Rui died

221
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,879
He was still clutching this lucky pouch

222
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,600
No...

223
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,679
He can't be dead

224
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,080
He clearly promised

225
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,559
that I should wait for him to return

226
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,159
Father...

227
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,559
He's not dead

228
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,399
Right?

229
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,080
He clearly said

230
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,799
he wanted to grow old together with me

231
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,200
He wouldn't break his promise

232
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,919
No...

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,679
No...

234
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,480
No...

235
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,360
This is a protective charm I made for you myself

236
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,559
Wait for me to return

237
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,880
First bow to heaven and earth

238
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,960
Second bow to the parents

239
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,480
Third, husband and wife bow to each other

240
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,799
From now on

241
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,799
you are my wife

242
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,839
The guards say

243
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,079
you refuse to eat anything

244
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,240
A Zi

245
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,119
You're torturing me

246
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,279
You said no matter what happened

247
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,279
you would never regret it

248
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,759
and you would never leave me

249
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,839
Those words were for Yuwen Xiu

250
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,559
Not for you, Su Qi

251
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,480
The only thing I, An Kezi, regret in this life

252
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,599
is meeting you

253
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,359
Your father has already handed over the key and the map

254
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,119
If you promise me

255
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,759
to stay by my side

256
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,440
Once we uncover the map's secret

257
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,720
I can spare them

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,960
A Lan

259
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,759
A Lan

260
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,359
A Lan

261
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
Don't be like this

262
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,240
If you're like this

263
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,559
Beloved Minister Yuwen's spirit in heaven

264
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,799
will not rest in peace

265
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,119
What spirit in heaven?

266
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,119
When a person dies

267
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
they're gone

268
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,279
Nothing is left

269
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,279
A Lan

270
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,440
What's wrong with you?

271
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,960
Don't scare me

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,960
Don't scare your father

273
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,960
My precious daughter

274
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,680
You must be strong

275
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,599
Father...

276
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,359
Was he really so cruel

277
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,559
to abandon me like this?

278
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,079
Yuwen Rui...

279
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,160
What?

280
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,319
Father!

281
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,680
The window

282
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,000
Look by the window!

283
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,000
What is it?

284
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,839
It's the signal flame he gave me

285
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,079
He's not dead

286
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,079
He didn't die!

287
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,559
You mean...

288
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,039
Beloved Minister Yuwen

289
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,519
He said

290
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,680
if I ever wanted to see him

291
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,480
to use this as a signal

292
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,000
I never thought her arrival

293
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,000
would actually change Yuwen Rui's fate

294
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,279
A Lan

295
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,039
If you want to live

296
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,759
Tell Yuwen Xiu

297
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,319
that I died here

298
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,799
Sir

299
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
Will the Fifth Princess understand?

300
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,519
She will.

301
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,519
What's the situation in the palace?

302
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,200
The guards are extremely tight.

303
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,519
Our people can't get in at all.

304
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,119
And we can't gather any information.

305
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,079
Slow down.

306
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,440
Beloved Minister Yuwen must be trying to save us.

307
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
By the way, Father.

308
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,480
Didn't you say there's a secret passage outside the palace?

309
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,599
If we can contact Yuwen Rui,

310
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,079
and coordinate with him from inside and out,

311
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,720
we might be able to subdue Su Qi.

312
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,359
Yes.

313
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,079
But now the entire palace is under their control.

314
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,519
This Renxin Hall,

315
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,480
not even a fly can get out.

316
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,960
How can we send a message?

317
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,079
Now we can only rely on Royal Sister.

318
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,920
A Zi.

319
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,799
You should eat something.

320
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,519
Seeing you like this,

321
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,960
I can't eat anything.

322
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,720
Your Highness, it's terrible!

323
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,720
The Fifth Princess, she...

324
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,359
What's wrong with A Lan?

325
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:11,960
Father!

326
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,480
What's wrong with A Lan?

327
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,319
A Lan, she...

328
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,440
can't accept Beloved Minister Yuwen's death.

329
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,400
Eldest Cousin, he...

330
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,640
Royal Sister.

331
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,119
You're here.

332
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,880
How are you?

333
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,400
Royal Sister.

334
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,319
I'm fine.

335
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,559
Listen to me.

336
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,559
Yuwen Rui is not dead.

337
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,240
A Zi.

338
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,759
These are pastries from Zhenxiu Pavilion I brought for you.

339
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,000
And that Beggar's Chicken from the north of the city.

340
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,079
And this plum wine.

341
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,039
You said before,

342
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,920
at this point,

343
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
what's the point of you doing all this?

344
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,839
I just...

345
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,680
want to be good to you.

346
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,119
All these years,

347
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,599
you have indeed been very good to me.

348
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,079
In my palace,

349
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,559
many things were gifts from you.

350
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,400
I've kept them all carefully.

351
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:08,960
A Zi.

352
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,519
I...

353
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,640
These are all things you gave me on Qixi Festival.

354
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,599
You said,

355
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,839
since I don't often leave the palace,

356
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,079
you wanted to bring all the interesting things

357
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,319
from outside into my palace.

358
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,480
A Zi.

359
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,519
Between us,

361
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,920
why did it become like this?

362
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,599
Could it be that everything,

363
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,759
was all fake?

364
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,559
No.

365
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,799
It's not fake.

366
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,079
My feelings for you,

367
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,960
you know better than anyone.

368
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,799
A Zi.

369
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,480
I know you still have me in your heart.

370
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,400
Let's forget those bad memories

371
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,400
and start over, okay?

372
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,680
Does what you said before still count?

373
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,119
As long as we start over,

374
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,400
you'll release Father and the others?

375
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,240
Of course.

376
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,720
As long as you stay by my side,

377
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,799
I'll promise you anything.

378
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,759
Thank you.

379
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:05,839
A Zi.

380
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,839
Thank you for being willing to give me another chance.

381
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,119
Do you remember our first meeting?

382
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,160
I had just returned to the capital then.

383
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,440
I entered the palace to visit Her Majesty the Empress.

384
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,359
You took me around the palace,

385
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,599
secretly releasing blessing lanterns.

386
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,359
We almost set the Imperial Garden on fire.

387
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,119
Back then, we could play without restraint.

388
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
But now,

389
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,920
with national and familial hatred,

390
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,119
can we ever go back to how it was?

391
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,680
We can.

392
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,799
We definitely can.

393
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:36,920
A Zi.

394
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,319
We still have a long life ahead.

395
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,880
All those beautiful moments from the past,

396
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,880
let's experience them together again.

397
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,759
I wonder how A Zi is doing.

398
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,559
Don't worry, Father.

399
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,079
I've already told Royal Sister the method.

400
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,680
She will definitely succeed.

401
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,079
You're here.

402
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,799
This one is almost finished.

403
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,880
I remember back then,

404
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,279
we both drew on the sky lantern, right?

405
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
You mean...

406
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,640
Eldest Cousin faked his death?

407
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,720
What should I do?

408
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,559
Right now,

409
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,279
you must not oppose Su Qi.

410
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,480
You need to lower his guard against you.

411
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Make him truly believe

412
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,720
that you've completely given up struggling.

413
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,039
When he relaxes his vigilance,

414
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
then you send this out.

415
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,799
A sky lantern.

416
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,839
When Yuwen Rui sees it,

417
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
he will surely understand.

418
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,400
I'll release this one myself.

419
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,079
You make another one.

420
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Okay.

421
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
Let's make it together.

422
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,079
Okay.

423
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,799
A Zi.

424
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,000
This is the happiest moment

425
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
of my life.

426
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,799
Sir.

427
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,119
There was no unusual activity in the palace today.

428
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,640
It's just that moments ago inside the palace,

429
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,960
it seemed someone was releasing sky lanterns.

430
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,440
Sky lanterns?

431
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,119
Who would be releasing sky lanterns in the palace at this time?

432
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,119
Shoot down all the sky lanterns.

433
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,199
Yes.

434
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Father!

435
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,760
I just saw the sky lanterns rise.

436
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,119
Su Qi indeed believed A Zi.

437
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,480
Sir.

438
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,599
These sky lanterns have nothing special about them.

439
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,760
Send people to Zigui Mountain to search for the secret passage.

440
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,239
I'm going to the Meng residence.

441
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,480
Yes.
