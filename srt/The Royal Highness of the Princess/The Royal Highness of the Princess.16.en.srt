1
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,200
The path ahead is too narrow for the carriage.

2
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,439
You'll all have to follow me into the city on foot.

3
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,280
Second Master.

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,239
What's the matter with that forest?

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
Why does everyone's expression change

6
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,719
the moment we mention it?

7
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,159
I've been away on a long trip.

8
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,840
I've only just returned.

9
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm not entirely clear on the specifics.

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,319
Just remember this, everyone:

11
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,239
You must never enter that forest.

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,439
Young Master Pan.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,759
Second Master Luo has been away from Tianyin City for so long.

14
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,439
It's good to have you back at last.

15
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,400
Young Master, watch out!

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
Are you alright?

17
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm fine.

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,360
What's wrong?

19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,479
Is Fourth Sister okay?

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
My foot seems to be sprained.

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Let's go sit down up ahead.

22
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,360
Let's go.

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,800
Take it slow.

24
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,080
Does it still hurt?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
I was just up in the tree picking medicinal fruit

26
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,159
when I accidentally fell.

27
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
Thank you, miss, for coming to my aid.

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,560
How do you know Second Master Luo?

29
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,719
We met him outside the city.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,319
He saw we were heading to Tianyin City

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
and kindly offered to guide us.

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,599
You may have injured the tendons or bones.

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,800
It so happens I run a clinic in the city.

34
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,319
Why don't you come with me, miss?

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll give you a proper examination.

36
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,719
Thank you, Young Master Pan.

37
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,360
Young Master Pan.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,719
I'm in a hurry to get home.

39
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,319
I'll trouble you to take them the rest of the way.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,599
Alright.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,520
Alright.

42
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,599
Thank you, Second Master.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,919
This is the place.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,319
Let her sit down first.

45
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,759
Alright.

46
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,599
Young Master.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,639
Put the medicinal herbs away.

48
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,479
Young Master Pan is out searching for herbs again.

49
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,280
Young Master Pan gathers herbs and treats patients.

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
He really should take better care of his health.

51
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,280
Has your condition improved recently?

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,040
Much better.

53
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,240
Good. I'll go attend to other matters then.

54
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,839
Apply some ointment.

55
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,279
Is there a female physician?

56
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,000
It's just treating a wound. It's fine.

57
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,639
A Lan, you do it.

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
Young Master Pan is a physician.

59
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,000
He's the professional.

60
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,600
Naturally, he should apply the medicine.

61
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,920
I...

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,879
Consider this a favor I owe you.

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,959
Hurry up.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,519
Fine.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
Then I'll kindly help you this once.

66
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,319
Apply the ointment to the ankle.

67
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,360
Rub it in thoroughly.

68
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,639
Does it hurt, Fourth Sister?

69
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:27,839
Done.

70
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,240
Are you okay?

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,879
Fortunately, no tendons or bones were injured.

72
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,519
Young Master Pan.

73
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,000
I'd like to ask you something.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,959
What happened in the forest outside the city?

75
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,399
Why have you come to Tianyin City?

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,399
Just for sightseeing.

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
If it's just sightseeing,

78
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
then there's no need to ask further.

79
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,160
Leave sooner rather than later.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,319
Young Master Pan, you should still tell us

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
what exactly happened in that forest.

82
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,639
We're extremely curious.

83
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,480
To explain in detail...

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
It's also my fault.

85
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,360
The forest outside the city

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
is perpetually shrouded in miasma.

87
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,879
Two months ago, I developed an Antidote Pill.

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,399
After taking it, the common folk

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
could enter the forest

90
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,759
to search for some precious medicinal herbs.

91
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,040
It was originally a good thing.

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Who would have thought...

93
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
It's right up ahead.

94
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,120
Be careful.

95
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,879
There's a ghost!

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,079
A ghost! There's a ghost!

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
A ghost!

98
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
Help!

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,120
Help!

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,519
There's a ghost!

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,680
What happened to those two men later?

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Only one escaped.

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,560
The other remains missing to this day.

104
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,959
His body hasn't been found either.

105
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,360
The one who escaped

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
kept saying there was a ghost in the Miasma Forest.

107
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,720
A few days later, he suddenly vanished.

108
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,240
Afterwards, others also

109
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,879
entered the Miasma Forest one after another.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
But no one ever came out again.

111
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,199
Up to today,

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
six people have vanished without a trace.

113
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
No bodies have been found.

114
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,639
Did the authorities send anyone to investigate?

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,399
They did send several groups.

116
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,720
But all returned empty-handed.

117
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
Now, the Miasma Forest

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
has become a taboo in Tianyin City.

119
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,480
The people in the city

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
say a female ghost haunts the forest.

121
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,120
So no one dares to go near it anymore.

122
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,519
I think someone is playing tricks.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,920
Miss.

124
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,720
What size shoes do you wear?

125
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,439
I'll have someone buy you a comfortable pair.

126
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,519
Once your injury heals...

127
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
I know what size A Zi wears.

128
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,959
I'll go buy them.

129
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,399
Then, miss, why not stay at the Benevolent Peace Hall

130
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,079
for a couple of days?

131
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,319
We have some guest rooms

132
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,040
specifically for patients from out of town.

133
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,319
You're too kind, sir.

134
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,399
We'll stay at an inn.

135
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,120
Today, I fell from a tree.

136
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,720
I was fortunate you came to my rescue.

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,839
Even small birds know to repay a kindness.

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,000
I, Pan, should

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,439
look after you properly.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Young Master Pan.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Just call me A Zi.

142
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,680
Alright, Miss A Zi.

143
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,839
Then I'll have someone prepare medicine for you first.

144
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,439
Help those guests

145
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,279
arrange some rooms.

146
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes, sir.

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
I think that Miasma Forest

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
definitely has something strange going on.

149
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,480
Look over there.

150
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
The woman in this painting

151
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,759
Which deity or bodhisattva is she?

152
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,080
Why don't I recognize her?

153
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,039
Look at the words at the bottom of the portrait.

154
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,000
My Wife, Lin Siqing

155
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,399
My wife...

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,559
Whose wife?

157
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,120
What do you think?

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Take two more doses according to the previous prescription.

159
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,120
Alright.

160
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,639
Shopkeeper, the same prescription as before, please.

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,320
Young Master Pan has a gentle temperament.

162
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
And he's a doctor who heals the sick and wounded.

163
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,840
He's truly worth befriending.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
But I don't understand.

165
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,720
Why do all these townsfolk

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,679
show such reverence

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,879
towards his wife's portrait?

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,679
That's because

169
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,080
Miss Lin is the benefactor of our Tianyin City!

170
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,559
If it weren't for Young Master Pan and Miss Lin,

172
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,120
Tianyin City would have been gone long ago.

173
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,679
How so?

174
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,360
Sir, you may not know this.

175
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,960
The water sources in Tianyin City are strange.

176
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,600
The people who drank this water

177
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,720
became weak and sickly,

178
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,919
rarely living past forty.

179
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,039
Later, Young Master Pan and Miss Lin arrived.

180
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
They had us drink

181
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,799
their specially prepared bitter tea daily.

182
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,120
Only then could the people of Tianyin City

183
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
escape their days of illness and suffering.

184
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,399
Such compassion from a healer.

185
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,440
Young Master Pan,

186
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,720
our group has discussed it.

187
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
We plan to stay here a few more days

188
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,480
to allow A Zi to recuperate.

189
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,440
What do you think?

190
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,000
That's fine.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,440
It's a pity Miss Lin has already passed away.

192
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,200
Yes.

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Such a shame.

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,159
Young Master Pan's wife died?

195
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,639
Yes.

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,639
She caught a slight chill.

197
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,320
It's nothing serious.

198
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,759
I'll have someone fetch some medicine.

199
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Thank you for the trouble, Young Master Pan.

200
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,480
Miss A Lan,

201
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,519
your and Miss A Zi's room is over there.

202
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,360
Just tell me where the room is.

203
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,639
I'll go there myself in a moment.

204
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,279
It's the one at the end of the corridor.

205
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,320
The other two gentlemen's room is next door.

206
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,480
Thank you.

207
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,639
You can go attend to your business then.

208
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,639
Very well, Miss A Lan.

209
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,279
So, who's the poor soul we need to save this time?

210
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,240
This time, we need to save a

211
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,200
very precious life.

212
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,360
All living beings are equal.

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,159
Every life is precious.

214
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,120
Just tell me.

215
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,679
Who exactly needs saving?

216
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,039
Well, the one we need to save this time

217
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,519
is actually a plant.

218
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
It's called the Celestial Frostbloom.

219
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,120
A plant?

220
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,000
A... herb?

221
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,519
Let me correct that.

222
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,399
The Celestial Frostbloom is a flower, not an herb.

223
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,519
Then why isn't it just called the Celestial Frost Flower?

224
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,759
Look, asking me to save a little black pig was one thing,

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,639
but now you're having me save a flower?

226
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,320
I naturally have my reasons.

227
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
Don't tell me saving this flower

228
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,759
is also related to saving a person?

229
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,399
When the time is right,

230
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,080
you'll know naturally.

231
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,080
Stop being cryptic.

232
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,120
Tell me.

233
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
How does the flower die?

234
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,720
In a few days,

235
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,240
it dies within Tianyin City's Miasma Forest.

236
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,159
The Miasma Forest?

237
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,200
That haunted Miasma Forest?

238
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,159
What does the flower look like?

239
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,639
You drew for so long

240
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,279
and came up with *this* thing?

241
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm an abstract artist.

242
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
It's certainly abstract.

243
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,759
So abstract I feel like slapping you.

244
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,720
Great art

245
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,639
is often misunderstood.

246
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,600
I don't blame you.

247
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,200
Oh, right.

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,159
The Celestial Frostbloom is white.

249
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,480
Don't mistake it for something else.

250
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,480
Bye-bye.

251
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,799
Darn it.

252
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,440
This way, please.

253
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,559
Your foot is still injured.

254
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,519
Rest for a while first.

255
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,879
Young Master Pan is quite attentive to Royal Sister.

256
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,639
At this time of year,

257
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,799
where did you get grapes?

258
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,879
Are they good?

259
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,720
By the way,

260
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,360
is what Young Master Pan said about the Miasma Forest

261
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,080
true?

262
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,960
Six people entered the Miasma Forest and vanished.

263
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,799
The authorities only say it's ghosts causing trouble.

264
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,399
I'll go investigate the matter tomorrow.

265
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,679
I'll go with you.

266
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Who knows what might happen in the forest.

267
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,919
You stay at the Benevolent Peace Hall.

268
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,159
Don't worry.

269
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,679
I'll protect myself.

270
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,600
Once we're in the forest,

271
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,159
stay close to me.

272
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,480
It's getting chilly.

273
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,759
Put this on.

274
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,559
Young Master Pan definitely has feelings for Royal Sister.

275
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,679
Look,

276
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,320
he's putting a cloak on her right now.

277
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,639
But Royal Sister saved him today.

278
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,440
Young Master Pan gave him his coat.

279
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
It was likely just a gesture of gratitude.

280
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,159
Luckily, I had a quick idea and played dead immediately.

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
That's how I escaped disaster.

282
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,679
There really are such things.

283
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,240
Right.

284
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
This is the first time I've heard of it.

285
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,000
Another time,

286
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,240
I broke my leg while gathering lingzhi mushrooms.

287
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,919
Fortunately, in the mountain stream at that time,

288
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,559
there was a creek.

289
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,480
We're in for a good show.

290
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,799
I survived by drinking water from that creek,

291
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,519
and held out for a full half month.

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,840
So it turns out a person

293
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,080
can survive just by drinking water.

294
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,720
What are you talking about?

295
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Let me listen too.

296
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,919
Miss A Zi and I

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,600
were talking about my early adventures in the martial world.

298
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,000
A Zi.

299
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,240
I just bought you new shoes and socks.

300
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,879
Would you like to go back to your room and try them on?

301
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
I'll try them later.

302
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Young Master Pan,

303
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,720
tell us more about your time in the Northern Frontier Desert.

304
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,000
The Northern Frontier Desert

305
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
is really quite different from Jiangnan.

306
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,200
Seventh Cousin, really.

307
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,399
What took him so long?

308
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,039
You seem to understand

309
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,240
Zixiu's feelings quite well.

310
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,519
Of course.

311
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,000
Miss A Zi is highly skilled.

312
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,440
Could you teach me some time?

313
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,120
Mosquitoes.

314
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,960
There are too many mosquitoes in this courtyard.

315
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:33,799
A Zi,

316
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,799
you should go back to your room and rest early.

317
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,360
It's fine.

318
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Young Master Pan,

319
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,799
didn't you say your chess skills were passable?

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,120
How about we have a match?

321
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,399
Alright.

322
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,320
Let's go.

323
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,159
Seventh Cousin, get some rest early.

324
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,919
Had enough of the show?

325
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,799
Let's go.

326
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,000
My foot injury is fine now.

327
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,120
I'll go with you to the Miasma Forest to investigate.

328
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:40,919
I've made inquiries.

329
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
The six people who disappeared in the Miasma Forest

330
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,919
didn't offend anyone.

331
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,480
If it really was man-made,

332
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,879
the other party probably wasn't seeking revenge.

333
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,320
The first person to disappear

334
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,960
was two months ago.

335
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,879
Take this Antidote Pill before entering the Miasma Forest.

336
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,240
It will protect you from the miasma.

337
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,200
Remember,

338
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,440
unless absolutely necessary,

339
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,799
do not use your internal energy.

340
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,279
to prevent the poison from attacking your heart.

341
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,680
Are you really going into that Miasma Forest

342
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,400
to find those six missing people?

343
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,319
Isn't the government offering a hefty reward?

344
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,480
I'll go with you.

345
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,519
I don't believe in those ghost stories either.

346
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,279
Young Master Pan,

347
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,920
you don't have to risk yourself by coming with us.

348
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,720
If I hadn't developed the antidote,

349
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,200
the people in the city

350
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
wouldn't have run into the Miasma Forest.

351
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,799
Then please, Young Master Pan,

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
accompany us on this trip.

353
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,240
Young Master Pan,

354
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,759
have you ever heard of

355
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,839
the Celestial Frostbloom?

356
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,440
Celestial Frostbloom?

357
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,160
I've never heard of that.

358
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,640
What you're talking about, miss,

359
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,359
I just read about it in a miscellany book.

360
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
I heard this flower blooms once a century,

361
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
and bears fruit once a millennium.

362
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
It can reverse aging.

363
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,559
It's extremely precious.

364
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,000
It's a flower?

365
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
The name is interesting, though.

366
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,119
Let's go.

367
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,160
Is that the Celestial Frostbloom?

368
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,759
In those melodramatic plays,

369
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,279
strange flowers always grow on cliffs.

370
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,440
But how do you pick them?

371
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,160
Wait for me a moment.

372
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,880
Young Master Pan said not to use internal energy.

373
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Young Master Yuwen, what are you...

374
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,799
Careful!

375
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,559
You're going to pick that flower?

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,519
I know your martial arts are superb,

377
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,200
but what if...

378
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,759
Don't do that again next time.

379
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Miss A Lan likes this flower.

380
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,519
What flower?

381
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,759
You're holding it like a treasure.

382
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,680
Didn't I tell you?

383
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,119
The celestial herb blooms once a century,

384
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,960
and bears fruit once a millennium.

385
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,880
It's extremely precious.

386
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
Um, Miss A Lan...

387
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,039
This flower is called Pig-Ignoring Flower.

388
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,680
Pi... Pig-Ignoring Flower?

389
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,839
They're all over the hills of Tianyin City.

390
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,599
They can't be used in medicine or eaten.

391
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,839
Even wild boars dislike them.

392
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,839
That's why they're called Pig-Ignoring Flower.

393
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,960
Pig-Ignoring...

394
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,160
But A Lan likes it.

395
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,519
Be careful.

396
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't get separated.

397
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,359
This...

398
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,759
We're back where we started.

399
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,279
This place is truly bizarre.

400
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,319
We should leave as soon as possible.

401
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
The side with sparse tree rings is south.

402
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,039
Let's head that way.

403
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,759
Miss A Lan is truly clever.

404
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
I read it in a miscellany book.

405
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
A ghost!

406
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,079
Go!

407
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,200
Go!

408
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,279
Look!

409
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,880
Stay close to me.

410
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,000
He's poisoned.

411
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,240
Thi... this is Carpenter Li from the north of the city.

412
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,920
One of the six missing people.

413
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,839
What's wrong with him?

414
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,200
Judging by these symptoms,

415
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,440
it seems he consumed a large amount of Five-Fold Poison Herb.

416
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,839
The poison has invaded his internal organs.

417
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,480
That's why he's unconscious.

418
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Five-Fold Poison Herb?

419
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,400
Five-Fold Poison Herb is both medicine and poison.

420
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,839
It can counteract miasma poison.

421
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,799
But it can also invade the internal organs.

422
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
Consuming this herb,

423
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
one can only wait for the poison to attack the heart.

424
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,000
When the poison takes effect,

425
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
it feels like ten thousand worms gnawing your bones.

426
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,359
It is a fate worse than death.

427
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,480
An ordinary person

428
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,119
could not endure the suffering of this poison.

429
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
They would rather commit suicide.

430
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,839
I didn't expect that Tianyin City

431
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,839
would actually have the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

432
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,599
I had only seen it in books before.

433
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,079
Is there a way to wake him up?

434
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,319
The toxicity has been temporarily suppressed.

435
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,039
I will try when we get back

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,119
to see if I can wake him.

437
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,079
Let's stay here for the night.

438
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,240
Ghost!

439
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,000
Ghost!

440
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,000
Miss Lin!

441
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,240
Ghost!

442
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,680
Miss Lin!

443
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,880
Young Master Pan, are you alright?

444
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm fine.

445
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,480
Lin Siqing... Ghost!

446
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,079
Why did he call out Siqing's name?

447
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:07,880
Ghost!

448
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,799
Could it be that Siqing...

449
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,920
Young Master Pan.

450
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,240
How did Miss Lin pass away?

451
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,720
A few months ago,

452
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,519
Siqing died saving commoners who fell into the water.

453
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,039
I was practicing medicine out of town at the time.

454
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,799
Kind neighbors helped with the burial.

455
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,279
Why would Siqing...

456
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,480
A Zi.

457
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,039
Drink some water.

458
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,240
Young Master Pan,

459
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,000
I heard that

460
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
you have stayed in Tianyin City

461
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
because Miss Lin liked it here.

462
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,759
After we got married,

463
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,759
we intended to travel the world.

464
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,279
Who would have thought

465
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,519
that once we came to Tianyin City,

466
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,319
she wouldn't want to leave.

467
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,480
At that time, Tianyin City was in decline.

468
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:27,799
Brother Yu,

469
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,640
let's live here from now on.

470
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,880
We can plant some herbs in the yard,

471
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,160
and that room will be for you to refine medicine.

472
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,480
The people of Tianyin City

473
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,680
do not live past forty.

474
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,799
Everyone else wants to stay far away,

475
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,559
but you,

476
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,079
you insist on staying.

477
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,200
But after we arrive,

478
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,160
things will be different.

479
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,480
I think that in the future,

480
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,039
everyone in Tianyin City will live a long life.

481
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
If you refine some

482
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,359
medicine to cure the miasma,

483
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,279
this place will become beautiful,

484
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,599
full of birdsong and fragrant flowers.

485
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,880
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

486
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,400
I don't know where she got the courage

487
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,519
to say she wanted to turn Tianyin City

488
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,960
into a paradise.

489
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,480
Her pitiful medical skills

490
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,720
were learned from me when she was bored.

491
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,079
I heard from the apprentice at Benevolent Peace Hall

492
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
that Miss Lin once helped the locals

493
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,480
drive away a band of robbers.

494
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,200
She always had clever ideas.

495
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,000
Miss Lin had a kind heart.

496
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,079
No wonder the people in the city

497
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,920
respected her so much.

498
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,680
They all said she was innocent and kind.

499
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,839
But I thought she was silly.

500
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,960
She always poured out

501
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,799
all her enthusiasm and kindness.

502
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,920
If she had thought of herself a little,

503
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,039
perhaps...

504
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:09,839
perhaps she wouldn't have

505
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,519
lost her life saving others.

506
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,799
I'm not cold.

507
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,640
Thank you, Seventh Cousin.

508
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,240
You don't need to be so polite with me.

509
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,720
If you have no feelings,

510
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,920
do not let people misunderstand for no reason.

511
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,559
I understand.

512
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,039
What are you thinking about?

513
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,000
If my deduction is correct,

514
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,680
this matter is related to Shadow Sect Yunshang.

515
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,079
Yunshang?

516
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,039
The wound on Carpenter Li's wrist

517
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,920
must have been caused by the Ice-Soul Silver Thread.

518
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,880
Just now in the woods,

519
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
the woman in white we met

520
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,200
was very likely

521
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,519
dressed up as Miss Lin.

522
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,000
That is why Carpenter Li was so scared,

523
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,039
thinking he saw a ghost.

524
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,480
But why would she do that?

525
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,400
And what role does Yunshang

526
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,720
play in all of this?

527
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,480
Alright,

528
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,400
stop thinking about it.

529
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,799
I will investigate thoroughly when we get back

530
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,880
the cause of Lin Siqing's death.

531
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,960
Husband,

532
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,559
you're back.

533
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,279
Why are you so late today?

534
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,319
Is everything alright?

535
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,079
What's wrong?

536
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,279
It's getting late.

537
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
Let's rest early.

538
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
Carry me over there.

539
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,519
Why are you acting strange today?

540
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,039
Am I?

541
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,239
Mo'er and the others are asleep.

542
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,719
It's not that late yet.

543
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,360
Why don't we...

544
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,920
This dream is so realistic.

545
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,960
What's wrong, Husband?

546
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,519
Are you going to hurt me?

547
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,880
A Lan.

548
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,960
A Lan.

549
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,880
A Lan, wake up.

550
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,280
A Lan.

551
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,079
We have entered an illusion.

552
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,360
An illusion?

553
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:55,840
Fourth Sister.

554
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,880
Zixiu.

555
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:57,440
Fourth Sister.

556
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Zixiu.

557
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,960
Fourth Sister.

558
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,599
Siqing, Siqing.

559
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,159
Just now...

560
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
It must be a dream designed to immerse people

561
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,039
so they don't want to wake up.

562
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,719
I once read in a medical book

563
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,679
that some plants can cause hallucinations,

564
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,800
making people indulge in them and refuse to wake.

565
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,440
Could this flower be what caused our illusion?

566
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,079
The soil has been turned.

567
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,679
Someone planted it here on purpose.

568
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,159
The people who went missing earlier in the Miasma Forest

569
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,559
might have also come to this house.

570
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,960
You all sleep first.

571
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,159
I'll keep watch.

572
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,280
At dawn, we'll look around.

573
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,639
You're injured.

574
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,639
Just a flesh wound.

575
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:34,599
It's nothing.

576
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,880
There.

577
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,800
That illusion is born from one's heart's desire.

578
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,519
What did you see in the illusion?

579
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,159
I saw nothing.

580
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,400
And you?

581
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,079
What did you see in the illusion?

582
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,360
Taking a wife and having children.

583
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,119
Taking a wife and having children.

584
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,559
I never would have thought...

585
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,280
what you can't forget...

586
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,559
is actually taking a wife and having children.

587
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,800
What kind of wife...

588
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,840
was she in your illusion?

589
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,159
Beautiful as a goddess.

590
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,519
Gentle and lovely.

591
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:52,679
I'm very curious.

592
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,039
Just gossip.

593
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,679
I wonder which family's daughter...

594
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,880
was so misguided...

595
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,840
as to marry you.

596
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,320
What was your wife's name?

597
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,840
Why are you looking at me?

598
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,159
If I don't say it...

599
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,920
you'll never know in your lifetime.

600
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,320
Other than you...

601
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,800
who else would I take as my wife?

602
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,280
The person I saw in the illusion was you.

603
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,679
The one I wanted to marry was also you.

604
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,519
It is now...

605
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
and will be in the future.

606
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,840
I never thought about it before...

607
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,760
taking a wife and having children.

608
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,440
Leading troops into battle to kill the enemy...

609
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,039
What I thought about...

610
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,800
was whether I'd die on the battlefield.

611
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,840
After returning...

612
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,079
I thought about avenging my parents.

613
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,079
It wasn't until I met you...

614
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,639
that I felt the days to come...

615
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,119
could take on other, hopeful shapes.

616
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,159
I...

617
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,159
A Lan...

618
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:34,280
Would you be willing to grow old with me in this life?

619
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,079
The woman who grows old with you...

620
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,519
will not be me.

621
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,360
In the illusion...

622
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,400
you called out my name.

623
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,880
So you really did see me.

624
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,159
I did see you.

625
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,079
You told His Majesty...

626
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,079
you agreed to cancel our engagement.

627
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,639
In my heart...

628
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,400
I am very pleased.

629
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,280
I'll go rest first.

630
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,119
The woman who grows old with you...

631
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,440
will not be me.

632
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,519
You told His Majesty...

633
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,800
you agreed to cancel our engagement.

634
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,039
In my heart...

635
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,039
I am very pleased.
