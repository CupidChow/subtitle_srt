1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,840
My Lord, one thing for another.

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,040
I think that candied hawthorn stick is quite nice.

3
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,079
Tasty and cheap.

4
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,079
I'll buy you one.

5
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,439
You think one candied hawthorn stick will satisfy me?

6
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Then what do you want?

7
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,599
Stinky beggar! Stinky beggar!

8
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,719
You're an eyesore here. Please, stop hitting him.

9
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,280
Stinky beggar!

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,159
Spare me!

11
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Do you know...

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,919
...my father is Prefect of the Capital, Official Guan!

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,639
I...

14
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,719
Who dares to be so bold?

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
You're blocking my way.

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
It's you again, you idiot.

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,360
Last time you ruined my painting,

18
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,479
and humiliated me at the auction.

19
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,639
I haven't settled that score with you yet!

20
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,039
You are...

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
You idiot!

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,960
I...

23
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,360
I...

24
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,759
Ch-Chief Grand Secretary! I, I...

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,879
You have quite the nerve.

26
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,439
Daring to lay hands on my person.

27
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,639
My Lord.

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,520
My Lord, spare me!

29
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,080
I failed to recognize your eminence.

30
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,680
Relying on your father to act like a tyrant.

31
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,599
It seems the Prefect of the Capital needs replacing.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,879
My Lord, spare me!

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,560
My Lord, spare me!

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,439
I know I was wrong.

35
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,120
My Lord, spare me! My Lord, spare me!

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,639
Get lost.

37
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,639
Right away!

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,120
Aren't you leaving yet?

39
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,240
Thank you, My Lord.

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,879
Thank you, My Lord.

41
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,960
Thank you, My Lord.

42
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,919
Am I hallucinating?

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,879
With so many people, don't get lost.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
On the main street...

45
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,719
...it's not proper to be pulling and tugging.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
If you run off,

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,919
what about my ten thousand taels of silver?

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
My Lord.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,840
What exactly do you want?

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,280
The trinkets at this stall are quite interesting.

51
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,639
You pick one.

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
M-Miss.

53
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,400
Just browsing.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,960
These precious knives and short blades are all quite nice.

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
Pick any one.

56
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll give it to you.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,759
Then I'll pick one for you.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,519
This one's interesting.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
How about I give you this one?

60
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,720
M-Miss.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
Th-This short blade...

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,360
...costs only one tael of silver.

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,079
Buy one, get two free.

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,600
B-Buy one, get two free.

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,439
Th-This bottle is f-fake blood.

66
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,240
Th-This bottle is...

67
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:46,879
F-For... spr-spring...

68
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,560
Take them all to use.

69
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,519
Aphrodisiac.

70
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
Let's skip this one.

71
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,199
Miss.

72
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,959
Th-This one sells very well.

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,399
Buy one, get two free.

74
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,360
A-A great bargain.

75
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,360
I thank you.

76
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:10,720
This...

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,279
You two, please come inside.

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,399
Please browse freely.

79
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,759
So expensive!

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,279
Heavens!

81
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,519
Please.

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,240
You're not trying to swindle me, are you?

83
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
Young master truly has an eye for quality.

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,680
This Auspicious Knot is a new treasure in our shop.

85
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,759
Legend says the token of love between the King and Queen of the Nine Provinces

86
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,519
was the Auspicious Knot.

87
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,959
They lived a life of love and sweetness.

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,839
So?

89
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,319
This Auspicious Knot is perfect to give to your beloved.

90
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,839
How much?

91
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,319
Five thousand taels.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,319
She'll pay ten taels.

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,879
I'll cover the rest.

94
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,680
Understood, understood.

95
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,480
Young master is so considerate.

96
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,879
Have you chosen?

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,199
How much is it?

98
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,000
Ten taels.

99
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,279
Ten taels?

100
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
That's right, miss.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,319
This Auspicious Knot is made from top-grade jade.

102
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,279
There's only one like it in all the world.

103
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,519
What?

104
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,480
Unwilling to buy it?

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,519
Don't buy this.

106
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,519
And don't buy from this shop.

107
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,199
Let's go look somewhere else.

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,319
I think...

109
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,000
...the Auspicious Knot is nice.

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
Why are you so stubborn?

111
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,879
It's not worth it, you know?

112
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,759
I looked around.

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,800
In this shop,

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,319
there's nothing below a thousand taels.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,639
This Auspicious Knot is only ten taels.

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,279
Something's definitely fishy.

117
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,600
So?

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,959
So...

119
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,399
...this Auspicious Knot

120
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,160
is definitely a fake.

121
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,680
Don't look at me like that.

122
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Even though the jade's texture is good,

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,079
it's definitely an imitation.

124
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,680
No matter how real it looks,

125
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,759
it's still a fake.

126
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,800
"Made from top-grade jade"?

127
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,439
"Only one in all the world"?

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,160
He's taking us for fools.

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,399
My Lord, you're brilliant.

130
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,360
You mustn't fall for his trick.

131
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
I want it even if it's fake.

132
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,879
You're incredibly foolish.

133
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,000
Shopkeeper.

134
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll take this Auspicious Knot.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Excellent!

136
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,639
My Lord, I've arrived.

137
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
You followed me to the Meng residence?

138
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
You're not planning to swindle me again, are you?

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
One thing for another.

140
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,800
I already bought you the Auspicious Knot.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,839
Now hurry inside.

142
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,120
Meng Shaojue's birthday.

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
Yuwen Rui will also attend.

144
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,200
Why is he going?

145
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,279
What's his purpose?

146
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,919
Send more top-tier assassins.

147
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,240
This time,

148
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,320
there must be no mistakes.

149
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Understood.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,919
Young Master Meng

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
Happy birthday, Young Master Meng. Thank you, thank you.

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

153
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,080
Please, both of you, have a seat.

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,879
Not at all, not at all.

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,919
Here.

156
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,279
Coming.

157
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,440
Young Master Meng, happy birthday.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Thank you, thank you.

159
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,679
My apologies for the poor hospitality.

160
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,519
Please, take your seats first.

161
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Shaojue.

162
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,320
Zixiu.

163
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Happy birthday.

164
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
May all your wishes come true.

165
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,600
Thank you.

166
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,879
Fourth Princess, Commander He.

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
Even the Chief Grand Secretary is here.

168
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,679
What?

169
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,519
Young Master Meng doesn't welcome me?

170
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,120
Brother Meng.

171
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,519
Look what gift I brought for you.

172
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,919
Nothing beats giving real gold and silver.

173
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,799
Brother Meng.

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Do you like it?

175
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,600
A gift from Zixiu.

176
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,519
Of course I like it.

177
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,879
Today, we drink until we're drunk.

178
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,639
Until we're drunk.

179
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,519
Please, come inside.

180
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,320
I didn't expect...

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
...Eldest Cousin to come celebrate Young Master Meng's birthday.

182
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,559
Just boredom.

183
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,799
Brother Xu.

184
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,720
Brother Xu, it really is you!

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
I was just thinking this morning...

186
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,519
...if I'd run into you again.

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,519
Why are you wearing a sword now?

188
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,320
Is swordplay your troupe's new act this year?

189
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,679
Brother Xu.

190
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

191
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,799
I'm Keyan.

192
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,039
Right.

193
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm wearing a veil.

194
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,919
My face hasn't been feeling well lately.

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,960
Brother Xu, do you remember?

196
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,240
Three years ago, at the master's birthday...

197
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,159
...your troupe came too.

198
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,039
Back then...

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
...you helped chase away an old ruffian for me.

200
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:11,960
Of course I remember.

201
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,200
Really?

202
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,919
I'm so happy Brother Xu remembers me!

203
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
What are you doing here?

204
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
Are you lost?

205
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,960
The main hall is over there.

206
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Should I take you there?

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,080
No need.

208
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,360
I can go by myself.

209
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,919
See you next time, Brother Xu!

210
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,200
Try this dish.

211
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Young Master Meng, come, come.

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
You like this one.

213
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,080
Thank you, Seventh Cousin.

214
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,279
I'll step out for a moment.

215
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,039
Alright.

216
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,840
You're too kind.

217
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,919
It's our honor.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,679
Come, come, Young Master Meng.

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Let me toast you again.

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Alright.

221
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Fill Young Master Meng's cup.

222
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,039
Here.

223
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,120
I just ran into someone from Prince Ning's faction.

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,919
He disguised himself as a performer and infiltrated the Meng residence.

225
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,320
Are you alright?

226
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,240
If something happened, would I be standing here?

227
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,000
We just don't know how many of them have infiltrated.

228
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,360
With so many guests here...

229
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,720
...if anything happens to anyone...

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,840
I have my people among the guests.

231
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,039
I guarantee no one will come to harm.

232
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,279
You...

233
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
This skin is...

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,440
I call this double insurance.

235
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,440
I'll be going now.

236
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,519
It took me several nights to embroider this.

237
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,080
Brother is sure to like it.

238
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,720
Commander He.

239
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,039
Meng Shaojue's birthday.

240
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
You are responsible for protecting Miss Meng.

241
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
And you are, miss?

242
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
I am the young lady of the Meng residence.

243
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,279
Meng Yinglu.

244
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,159
Commander He.

245
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
It's said that since childhood...

246
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,879
...you have mastered all martial arts manuals.

247
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,360
Your martial skills are exceptional.

248
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,600
I admire you immensely, My Lord.

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
I see that you, Miss Meng...

250
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,480
...have an extraordinary bone structure.

251
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,519
Your inner force is quite remarkable.

252
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
How about we find a place to spar?

253
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,320
Right now?

254
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,120
Or perhaps another day.

255
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,840
Today is my brother's birthday.

256
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,720
I must go celebrate with him.

257
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,840
Miss.

258
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,000
Miss!

259
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,679
I hired artists...

260
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,759
...to draw several hundred copies as you instructed.

261
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,159
Post them in every alley of the capital.

262
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I refuse to believe...

263
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,519
...we can't find that scoundrel surnamed He.

264
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,120
Yes.

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,039
Well then, Commander He...

266
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,879
...I'll take my leave.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
Come, come.

268
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,519
Come, come, please.

269
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,360
Shaojue.

270
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,279
My eldest brother is actually a good person.

271
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,000
You'll know if you spend more time with him.

272
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,039
Right, A Zi?

273
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,639
More contact? I'd rather not.

274
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,279
Young Master Meng.

275
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,960
My father is unwell.

276
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,200
He asked me to relay a message.

277
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,159
He asks when you will go drink with him.

278
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,960
Tell the Old Marquis not to worry.

279
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,519
Tomorrow, I'll bring two jugs of fine wine to visit.

280
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,120
Fourth Princess.

281
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,320
Meeting the Fourth Princess at the Meng residence today...

282
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,480
...is truly an honor for me, Li.

283
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,000
I wonder if the Fourth Princess could spare a moment to speak privately?

284
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,759
If I'm not mistaken...

285
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
...His Majesty intends for Young Master Li to be the Prince Consort.

286
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Young Master Li is the heir of a marquis.

287
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,879
He has achieved much at a young age.

288
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,000
He would be a good match for the Fourth Princess.

289
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,000
Zixiu.

290
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,600
Haven't you noticed...

291
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,600
...you care too much about the Fourth Princess?

292
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
I... I see her as a younger sister.

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,519
Of course I care.

294
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,879
Is she really just a sister to you?

295
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,519
I say this because I see you as a good brother.

296
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,759
If you truly like her...

297
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,839
...then boldly confess your feelings.

298
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
So you won't regret it in the future.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
Fourth Princess, please.

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,759
Seventh Cousin

301
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,480
What's wrong?

302
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:21,880
It's nothing.

303
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,359
Come on, come on, come on.

304
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,200
Come on.

305
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,039
Drink, drink, drink! Come on!

306
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
It's you.

307
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,079
You actually...

308
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,440
Miss Meng.

309
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,720
My apologies.

310
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,519
Xiao Hei.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,720
Xiao Hei!

312
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,599
Where did Commander He go?

313
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,279
Young Master!

314
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,200
The young lady is missing!

315
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,599
I've searched everywhere.

316
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
I couldn't find the young lady anywhere.

317
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,079
I'll go look.

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,480
Miss Meng.

319
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,720
Sorry.

320
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,680
Trying to run?

321
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:47,960
Miss Meng.

322
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,359
Are you alright?

323
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,119
You...

324
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,319
Miss Meng, you dropped something.

325
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,319
You...

326
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:09,839
This way.

327
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,920
From now on, you will clean the master's study.

328
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,799
You must especially remember...

329
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,920
Guards!

330
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,039
Go!

331
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,319
Last time it was also you who broke into the Meng residence.

332
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:05,839
Speak!

333
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,680
Why did you break into my Meng residence?

334
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,359
You won't escape this time.

335
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,519
What's that smell?

336
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,119
In the original plot,

337
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,599
Xiao Hei wouldn't die in this fire, would he?

338
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,440
Exactly.

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
In the original plot,

340
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,559
the assassin only wanted to steal the map secretly.

341
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,960
Unexpectedly, Xiao Hei...

342
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,039
knocked over the candlestick.

343
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
The room caught fire.

344
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
The entire courtyard was lost.

345
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,799
Those who died, besides Xiao Hei,

346
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,119
were Auntie Fu,

347
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,880
and this maid,

348
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,119
and three servants who later rushed to fight the fire.

349
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,039
Then why didn't you just have me save people directly?

350
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
This drama spirit has thought it through carefully.

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,079
That's five people.

352
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
With just you alone,

353
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,799
could you manage them all?

354
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,880
You...

355
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,720
But by having you save Xiao Hei,

356
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
you'd inevitably be running after it all day.

357
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,079
Naturally, you'd discover the room was on fire.

358
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,279
Thus, you could stop the fire at its source.

359
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,119
And save everyone.

360
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm secretly lowering the difficulty for you.

361
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,839
Shouldn't you thank me properly?

362
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,960
Thank *you*?

363
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,359
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

364
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off the hook.

365
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,039
In short,

366
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:44,960
congratulations.

367
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,599
Mission successful.

368
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,279
The hidden weapon is poisoned.

369
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
Young Master Meng, don't worry.

370
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
This poison is not fatal.

371
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,039
But if you forcefully use your inner force,

372
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm afraid your meridians will be severed.

373
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
Even without your inner force,

374
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
you are no match for me.

375
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,839
Young Master Meng is indeed formidable.

376
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,519
But you must be feeling quite uncomfortable now.

377
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,440
Young Master Meng, do you know of the Map of the Nine Provinces?

378
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,119
What if I do?

379
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,799
Tell me where the map is hidden.

380
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,920
And I'll spare your life.

381
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,359
Wishful thinking.

382
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,079
You won't yield until you see your coffin.

383
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,839
Take this hidden weapon: Rainstorm of Pear Blossom Needles!

384
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,000
How dare you trick me!

385
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,880
Young Master, are you alright?

386
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
You... get out of here!

387
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,720
Young Master Meng, you'd better be sensible.

388
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
Tell me where the Map of the Nine Provinces is.

389
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,880
If you don't speak,

390
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,079
today may be your last day.

391
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,000
I know where the map is.

392
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,279
Let the young master go,

393
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,640
and I'll take you to the map.

394
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,839
Nonsense! Get out of here!

395
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,400
How do you know where the map is?

396
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,400
While cleaning, I found a secret room in the Qiushui Garden.

397
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
As long as you release the young master,

398
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,519
I'll take you there.

399
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:26,640
Move.

400
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,039
Don't worry, Young Master.

401
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll be fine.

402
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,359
Some things...

403
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,680
I'll explain to you later.

404
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
Commander He is nowhere to be found.

405
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,200
Why hasn't even Young Master Meng returned yet?

406
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,880
Let's go check.

407
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:30,799
You go that way.

408
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,400
I'll go this way.

409
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,559
Be careful.

410
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,359
Where is the secret room?

411
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,759
Get in.

412
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,799
Where is the map?

413
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,559
The Map of the Nine Provinces...

414
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,240
This one is interesting.

415
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,480
How about I give you this one?

416
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,319
Fifth Princess...

417
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,720
I will give you a proper burial.

418
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,960
Should it be a burial or cremation?

419
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,119
My Lord.

420
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,200
H-help... help me!

421
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,720
How long are you going to keep pretending?

422
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
I was just indulging my acting bug.

423
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
I didn't expect to fool you.

424
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,240
Luckily, I was clever

425
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,960
and carried this thing with me.

426
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
My Lord.

427
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,960
The assassin being able to steal the fake map...

428
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,839
I deserve some credit, right?

429
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,920
Where is she?

430
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,880
Young Master Meng forced his acupoints open.

431
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,960
Aren't you afraid your meridians will be severed,

432
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,680
and you'll die suddenly?

433
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,079
Enough talk.

434
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,200
Where is she?

435
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,319
The assassin has been spotted!

436
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,000
Over there!

437
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,640
Be careful yourself.

438
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,720
A Zi, be careful!

439
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,119
Seventh Cousin!

440
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm fine.

441
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Are you okay?

442
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm fine, I'm fine.

443
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,200
Are you alright?

444
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,440
I'm fine, don't worry.

445
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,880
Hurry and bandage the wound.

446
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,440
Young Master Meng

447
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,039
Shao Jue

448
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:40,960
Young Master Meng

449
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:41,640
Shao Jue

450
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,759
Young Master Meng, wake up!

451
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,759
What happened?

452
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,279
Shao Jue

453
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,480
Zixiu

454
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,240
Haven't you noticed

455
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,200
you care too much about the Fourth Princess?

456
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,759
I... I see her as a sister.

457
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,640
Of course I care.

458
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Is she really just a sister?

459
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,519
A Zi

460
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,640
That's enough.

461
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,440
Doctor

462
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
Is Shao Jue alright?

463
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,039
Young Master Meng forcibly used his inner force

464
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,640
and then broke through his own pressure points.

465
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,599
Now his heart meridians are damaged.

466
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,559
He must not use inner force for two years.

467
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,559
Is there any way

468
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,839
to help him recover quickly?

469
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,880
He won't die, at least.

470
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,000
Eldest Brother

471
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,079
Now's not the time for sarcasm.

472
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,960
It's the Soul-Returning Pill His Majesty awarded to Eldest Brother.

473
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,680
It can protect the heart meridians.

474
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,799
Doctor, look.

475
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,400
If he takes this medicine,

476
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,480
Young Master Meng only needs to avoid

477
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,559
forcibly using inner force for a month.

478
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,000
Don't misunderstand. I'm not doing this for you.

479
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:15,880
Eldest Brother

480
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,920
You must be doing this for my sake.

481
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
Lord Yuwen is so kind.

482
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,079
I doubt it's...

483
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,799
Quick, take one.

484
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,599
This old man will go write a prescription for Young Master Meng.

485
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,839
Young Master Meng, do you know the assassin's identity?

486
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,119
The assassin likely stole the Map of the Nine Provinces.

487
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,960
The Map of the Nine Provinces was in the Meng residence?

488
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,680
I only learned of it today as well.

489
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
The assassin was pressing for the map's location.

490
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
Young Master Meng, rest well.

491
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,200
I will report the theft to Father.

492
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,400
Take your medicine properly.

493
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,279
I'm leaving.

494
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,920
I wonder if they'll understand the farewell letter.

495
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,119
Brother Hei

496
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,880
Take good care of yourself from now on.

497
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,519
I prepared some snacks you like.

498
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,960
Goodbye.

499
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,400
Oh, right.

500
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
I didn't take the prescription the doctor gave for Seventh Cousin.

501
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,719
I'll go back and get it.

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,599
A Zi

503
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,920
Miss

504
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,760
A Lan

505
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,440
Seventh Cousin

506
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,599
So you, this fool, have been pretending to be dumb and tricking us?

507
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,079
Eldest Brother, you knew all along?

508
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,119
I'm sorry.

509
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,039
I didn't mean to.

510
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,159
That day after I was poisoned,

511
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I lost my memory.

512
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,360
I could only protect myself by pretending to be dumb.

513
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,519
I couldn't remember anything.

514
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,039
But I quite like how things are now.

515
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,159
Of course.

516
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,559
You're much cuter now.

517
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,239
Imperial Sister

518
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,199
I didn't mean to deceive you.

519
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,119
This cup of wine is an apology for the past.

520
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,039
This cup is for deceiving you all.

521
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,840
What's past

522
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,119
is past.

523
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,199
Little silly.

524
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,440
Then why did you run off to the Meng residence?

525
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,760
That day you took me out of the palace,

526
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,480
I saw you were busy gambling,

527
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,599
and paid no attention to me.

528
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,639
Just then, I was mistaken for

529
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,360
a poor, homeless girl.

530
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,559
They gave me some silver

531
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,079
and told me to be a maid at the Meng residence.

532
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
So I...

533
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,159
deliberately ran off to the Meng residence.

534
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,000
You made me worry!

535
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,480
You... you... you...

536
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:44,760
Forget it.

537
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
Seventh Cousin is magnanimous.

538
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,760
I won't hold it against you.

539
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,400
As expected of my world's most handsome Seventh Cousin!

540
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,760
A Lan

541
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,119
If there's nothing else,

542
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,760
come back to the palace with me later.

543
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,519
His Majesty currently believes

544
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,079
the Fifth Princess is at my villa treating her dementia.

545
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,679
She can return to the palace in two days.

546
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:08,960
Therefore...

547
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,400
No.

548
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,440
Why not?

549
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,760
Eldest Cousin, you should know perfectly well.

550
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,000
Speak plainly.

551
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,440
Eldest Cousin meets with dancers at night and hides a man.

552
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,199
A Lan going to your villa...

553
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,480
I'm not at ease with that.

554
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,719
I imagine the Fifth Princess wouldn't mind.

555
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,400
Fifth Princess, don't you have something to say?

556
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:05,480
Actually, the dancer Eldest Cousin met at night,

557
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,719
and the hidden man...

558
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,079
were both me.

559
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,599
The details...

560
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,199
I'll explain to you all later.

561
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Rufeng will pick you up for the villa later.

562
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,519
Then I'll come to the villa to find you first thing tomorrow.

563
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:37,679
Alright.

564
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,719
Eldest Cousin, come back to the palace with me

565
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,480
to report the treasure map theft to Father.

566
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,239
Come on, come on.

567
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:46,760
Eat, eat, eat.

568
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,440
Eat.

569
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Your servant presumptuously used a fake map

570
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,199
to replace the real Map of the Nine Provinces at the Meng residence.

571
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,519
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

572
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,639
Since you know it's a crime,

573
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,960
why didn't you report it to me beforehand?

574
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:11,960
The enemy is hidden, we are exposed.

575
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,519
The fewer who know, the better.

576
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:14,760
Furthermore,

577
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,119
the map was in Grand Preceptor Meng's hands.

578
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,480
He has always believed your servant has ulterior motives.

579
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,239
If he knew of this,

580
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,519
he would vehemently oppose your servant's plan.

581
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,320
What poison did Eldest Cousin put on the fake map?

582
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,440
Bone-Corroding Powder.

583
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,320
Anyone who touches the fake map

584
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,039
will show symptoms of poisoning after three days.

585
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,760
The veins on their wrists will bulge,

586
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,039
resembling slithering snakes.

587
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,400
If they cannot get the antidote in time,

588
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,519
they will surely die.

589
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:53,519
This is the treasure map that everyone in the world covets.

590
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,159
Now the map is in our hands.

591
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,519
The urgent task now

592
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,639
is to locate the former number one faction,

593
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,480
the Shadow Gate.

594
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,639
The Shadow Gate has long been in decline.

595
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,639
Its disciples have all vanished into the Jianghu.

596
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,159
Finding them

597
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,440
will likely not be easy.

598
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,880
Hasn't His Majesty also been sending people to find the Shadow Gate?

599
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:13,280
We just need to get there before him.

600
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,000
Your Highness,

601
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Yuwen Rui must know the map is with you now.

602
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,199
Why not let me safeguard it instead?

603
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,039
Rest assured,

604
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,039
I will never let the treasure map fall into others' hands.

605
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,559
We shall wait three days,

606
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,920
to see how you find the map thief.

607
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,280
Yes.

608
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,800
Father,

609
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,039
To prevent the thief from becoming suspicious,

610
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,880
why not have Commander He

611
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,760
investigate the map's whereabouts with full effort?

612
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,039
Let it be done as you say.

613
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:50,679
By the way,

614
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,199
how is A Lan?

615
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,199
The Fifth Princess's condition has improved.

616
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,719
The divine healer said she may fully recover in a couple of days.

617
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,159
Have the divine healer treat A Lan with all his skill.

618
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,440
If A Lan regains her senses,

619
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,320
We will surely reward him handsomely.

620
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,039
Yes.

621
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,039
My Lord,

622
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,519
Where is the Fifth Princess?

623
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,719
Resting in the courtyard.
