1
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,480
Father

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,319
A Lan

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
What's so urgent that you're looking for Father?

4
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,480
Nothing major.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,519
By the way,

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Why did you send Yuwen Rui to Yu Zhen?

7
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,040
There's a lead on the Sword Maniac in Yu Zhen.

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,599
I sent him to investigate.

9
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,359
What?

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,640
You'll miss him?

11
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:01,879
Of course not.

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,439
I heard you've been pestering Grand Tutor Guan lately.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,120
And even sneaking out of the palace to see him.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,400
Your daughter noticed Grand Tutor Guan

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,919
has seemed troubled recently.

16
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
I wanted to cheer him up.

17
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,159
Why don't I see you trying to cheer your father up?

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
Your daughter actually has a big matter

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,960
to make Father happy.

20
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,919
Princess.

21
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,159
The vendor said this Beauty Powder must be dissolved in water.

22
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,879
Should I put it in the tea now?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,479
Princess?

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,759
Go ahead.

25
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,560
Lord Yuwen will be here soon.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
This servant will go prepare some snacks.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Lord Yuwen.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
My lord departs the capital tomorrow.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
You must have much to discuss with the princess.

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
I have given orders

31
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,039
to ensure no one disturbs you.

32
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,840
My lord, please go in.

33
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,759
The princess has specially prepared a big gift for you.

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,680
A big gift?

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,800
My Lord.

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,719
These past days,

37
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,639
our people have been searching everywhere for the Sword Maniac.

38
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,400
We finally found his trail

39
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,840
and seized the final key.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
As you ordered,

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,759
I had people spread

42
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,400
the false rumor of the Sword Maniac being in Yu Zhen.

43
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,080
Just as you predicted,

44
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,639
the Yunmi emperor has ordered Yuwen Rui

45
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,680
to go to Yu Zhen.

46
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,400
Is everything arranged?

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,520
Death squad members are already positioned along the route.

48
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,360
They will surely ensure Yuwen Rui

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
never returns.

50
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,160
Spare his life.

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
Just make sure he cannot return to Luo Jing.

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,279
My Lord,

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,920
this...

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,079
What?

55
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,160
Are my words not effective?

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,560
This subordinate wouldn't dare.

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,680
My Lord,

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,720
the Fifth Princess has been persistently bothering Grand Tutor Guan lately.

59
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,079
Could she have discovered something?

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,480
If she had discovered anything,

61
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,120
it wouldn't be so calm.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,319
What time do you leave tomorrow?

63
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,399
At Chen hour.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,639
Aphrodisiac Powder?

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
This... this tea...

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
Does it taste strange?

67
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,920
You told Xixi to add something special.

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
You had Xixi add it?

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,199
For me to drink?

70
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,279
Obviously.

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
Aren't you drinking it right now?

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,480
I heard

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,519
you prepared a big gift.

74
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,639
Xixi told you?

75
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,079
Where's the gift?

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Far away on the horizon,

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,319
yet right before your eyes.

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,600
If all goes well,

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,639
I'll be back soon.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,279
You didn't need to prepare such a grand gift.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Of course it's necessary.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
Hurry up and unwrap the gift.

83
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
Perhaps the gift should be unwrapped another day.

84
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,120
Why not now?

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,319
Are you sure?

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,879
I'm sure.

87
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,160
No regrets?

88
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,040
What's there to regret about this?

89
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,519
Fine.

90
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,680
As you wish.

91
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,079
What are you doing?

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,160
Unwrapping the gift.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,839
Yuwen Rui, you're acting strange.

94
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,600
You're the one acting strange.

95
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,720
Me?

96
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,279
What's wrong with you?

97
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,519
You put Aphrodisiac Powder in the tea.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,759
And you ask what's wrong with me?

99
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,879
Aphrodisiac Powder?

100
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,839
Wasn't that Beauty Powder?

101
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,680
The free sample must have been mixed up.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,519
Are you okay?

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,240
What do you think?

104
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,800
In cheesy TV dramas,

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
the aphrodisiac plot is always there.

106
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,399
What do we do now?

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,399
Calm down first.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
How am I supposed to calm down?

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,679
It really is red.

110
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,559
What are you doing?

111
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,799
Put me down!

112
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
Where's the wound medicine?

113
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,159
You don't actually think

114
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,440
I wanted to do something to you, do you?

115
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,559
I don't want you to feel

116
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,200
you aren't cherished.

117
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,279
If this were a TV show,

118
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,840
the comments would only question you.

119
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,039
It's nothing.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,679
The wound medicine.

121
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,000
It's fine.

122
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,279
Just a minor bump.

123
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,399
Get some rest early.

124
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
It's quite late.

125
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,200
You have to travel early tomorrow.

126
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,360
Stay and rest here tonight.

127
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,759
Once everything is settled,

128
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,759
I will request permission for us to marry soon.

129
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,399
There's no hurry.

130
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,519
Things are fine as they are now.

131
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,720
What do you mean no hurry?

132
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,000
I've been waiting all this time.

133
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,240
Sleep.

134
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,720
This is a protective talisman I made for you myself.

135
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,440
Wait for me to return.

136
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,519
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

137
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,639
Yu Zhen isn't far.

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Big brother will be back in five days at most.

139
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,159
By the way, big brother,

140
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
A Zi is busy with the Celestial Rite preparations.

141
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,639
She asked me to pass on a message.

142
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,480
She wishes you a safe journey.

143
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,440
I'll take a detour via Qi Zhen to Yu Zhen.

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,879
It might delay me by two days.

145
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,639
Take care of yourself.

146
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,559
I'm afraid it's a one-way trip.

147
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,960
I came to see A Lan.

148
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm definitely not here to see you.

149
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,519
I know.

150
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,480
You came to find the Fifth Princess

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,080
and just happened to see me.

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,799
From now on,

153
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,519
I...

154
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
I... can I call you Yinglu?

155
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,519
Yinglu.

156
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,720
Can I...

157
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
give you a hug?

158
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,039
Yinglu.

159
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,120
A Lan.

160
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,320
What have you been up to since you got back?

161
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,120
You didn't even come find me.

162
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,960
I missed you so much!

163
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,080
I missed you too.

164
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
There's been so much going on lately.

165
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,600
But,

166
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
it seems like you've

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
been busy with other things too.

168
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,559
Why is Commander He here too?

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
You two...

170
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,120
We...

171
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,440
We...

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,519
ran into each other

173
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,720
by coincidence.

174
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,480
Fifth Princess,

175
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,519
this humble official will take his leave.

176
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,000
Commander He,

177
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,559
wait.

178
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
There's something I want to ask you.

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Commander He,

180
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
do you have a woman you like?

181
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,200
No.

182
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,159
That's great!

183
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,159
The legitimate daughter of the Xia Residence

184
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,240
told me just yesterday

185
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,200
that she admires Commander He

186
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
and will marry no one but him.

187
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,960
Miss Xia has exceptional grace

188
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,799
and is gentle and lovely.

189
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,519
Commander He isn't getting any younger either.

190
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,399
How about I play matchmaker?

191
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,600
This humble official... I am of lowly status and scant fortune.

192
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,960
How could I possibly...

193
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,799
What's all this "lowly status and scant fortune"?

194
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,639
Commander He is young

195
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,679
and already the Commander of the Imperial Guard.

196
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,679
No wonder Miss Xia

197
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
insists on marrying you.

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,360
Alright then,

199
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll go find Father right now

200
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,240
to arrange your marriage.

201
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,679
How about that?

202
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,559
A Lan!

203
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,759
What?

204
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,039
I...

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
I understand.

206
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,399
Yinglu has reached marriageable age too.

207
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Oh!

208
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,440
Let me tell you,

209
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,679
this Miss Xia has an older brother

210
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,000
who is also an outstanding man.

211
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,679
If you're willing,

212
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
Commander He might one day

213
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,080
have to call you "sister-in-law."

214
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,919
Who wants to be his sister-in-law?!

215
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Don't get so worked up.

216
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,559
I...

217
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:52,960
I...

218
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:54,879
Alright, alright.

219
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,919
I get it.

220
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Then I'll help you

221
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,519
look for other men.

222
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,399
Commander He,

223
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,879
Miss Xia is truly as beautiful as a fairy.

224
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,879
I guarantee once you see her,

225
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,200
you'll fall for her at first sight.

226
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,200
Fifth Princess,

227
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,759
actually, this humble official already has someone he likes.

228
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,799
Don't lie.

229
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,919
You just said you didn't.

230
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,960
Don't be shy.

231
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,879
Let's go.

232
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,559
Don't be shy.

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,240
The person he likes is me.

234
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:27,679
Commander He,

235
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:28,919
you're welcome.

236
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,279
A Lan!

237
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,919
You actually tricked me!

238
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,639
You lied to me first.

239
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,840
How dare you criticize me?

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,639
When did you and Lord Yuwen

241
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,519
get together?

242
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:38,919
Do you know

243
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,440
my brother, he...

244
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,080
What about your brother?

245
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,360
It's nothing.

246
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,759
Hurry up and tell me

247
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,840
about your trip south.

248
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,879
Well, that's a long story.

249
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,400
Seventh Cousin.

250
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,240
What is it?

251
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,279
Nothing.

252
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,440
I haven't seen you at the palace these past few days.

253
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,839
I saw you were busy with the Celestial Rite,

254
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,079
so I didn't disturb you.

255
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,359
After the Celestial Rite,

256
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,640
I will speak to Father about us.

257
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,720
How about that?

258
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,119
What's wrong?

259
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:22,720
Nothing.

260
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,000
His Majesty

261
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,799
probably won't agree to our marriage.

262
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
If Father doesn't agree,

263
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,319
I'll find a way to make him agree.

264
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,920
As long as our hearts are as one,

265
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,240
everything else

266
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,480
is unimportant.

267
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,799
Really?

268
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,200
Of course.

269
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,680
A Zi,

270
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,039
come with me.

271
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,400
A Zi,

272
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,519
my mother told me

273
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,359
even without parental consent

274
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,519
or a matchmaker's words,

275
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,000
as long as two people truly love each other,

276
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
they can still receive heaven's blessing.

277
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,640
A Zi,

278
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,200
would you be willing to take heaven and earth as witness,

279
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,160
the sun and moon as our guide,

280
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,960
and become husband and wife with me?

281
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,519
Why not?

282
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,799
First bow to heaven and earth.

283
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,079
Second bow to the parents.

284
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
Husband and wife bow to each other.

285
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,680
From now on,

286
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,880
you are my wife.

287
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,960
One final step.

288
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,720
I read in a storybook that

289
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,160
newlyweds

290
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,480
bury their wedlock hair under intertwined branches

291
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,799
to be blessed to stay together in life and death.

292
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,839
A harmonious union for a hundred years.

293
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
You read it in a storybook.

294
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,799
How can you believe that?

295
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,160
Better to believe it's true

296
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,559
than to believe it's false.

297
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,160
This should do it.

298
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,480
I wish time could just stop at this moment.

299
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,759
Don't worry.

300
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,880
Things will be better in the future.

301
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Zixiu sent you.

302
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,319
Lord Grand Secretary is indeed brilliant.

303
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,079
At least I'll die knowing the truth today.

304
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,880
Attack!

305
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,559
Lord Grand Secretary is truly formidable.

306
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,079
But no matter how skilled you are,

307
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
you can't save the Fifth Princess now.

308
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,799
Bring her up.

309
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,880
A Lan.

310
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,240
A Lan!

311
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,599
Why do I suddenly feel so uneasy?

312
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,400
I'm sorry.

313
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,480
My Lord.

314
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,839
Yuwen Rui is dead.

315
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,079
Didn't you say to spare his life?

316
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Perhaps the situation was too critical.

317
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,119
They couldn't afford to hold back.

318
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,079
My Lord.

319
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,759
Yuwen Rui is dead.

320
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,559
It's all gain and no loss for us.

321
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,400
Tomorrow's affairs are all arranged.

322
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Rest assured, My Lord.

323
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,119
Everything will proceed as planned.

324
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,240
As for the Fourth Princess of Yunmi,

325
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,319
how does My Lord intend to handle her?

326
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,000
Post guards to watch her closely.

327
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,359
Without orders,

328
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,599
she is not to leave her chambers.

329
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,079
For tomorrow's Celestial Rite,

330
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,480
announce that she has caught a chill.

331
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,000
She is not fit to go out.

332
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,839
Understood.

333
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,559
Take good care of her.

334
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,559
Do not make things difficult for her.

335
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,200
Yes.

336
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,079
Where are A Lan and A Zi?

337
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,160
Why haven't they arrived yet?

338
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,160
Your Majesty,

339
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
word from the Fourth Princess's quarters is

340
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,000
she suddenly fell ill with a chill today.

341
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,039
She is not fit to attend.

342
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,039
As for the Fifth Princess,

343
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,400
A Lan has always been fond of play.

344
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
It's not the first time she's been late.

345
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:54,799
Princess.

346
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,960
I've made inquiries.

347
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
Grand Tutor Guan has been staying at his residence these past few days.

348
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,839
Nothing out of the ordinary.

349
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,119
He entered the palace this morning

350
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,720
to make final preparations for the Celestial Rite.

351
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,119
Princess.

352
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,079
You must hurry.

353
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,640
The Celestial Rite has already begun.

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,839
All the masters in the palace, except you and the Fourth Princess,

355
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
have already gone over.

356
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,000
My elder sister hasn't gone either?

357
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,039
The Fourth Princess has caught a chill.

358
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm afraid she won't be going today.

359
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,960
How did she catch a chill out of the blue?

360
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
I know about this matter.

361
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,319
This morning, I ran into Xiao Liangzi.

362
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Xiao Liangzi said

363
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
he secretly saw

364
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,920
the Fourth Princess and Young Master Xiu

365
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,680
under the peach blossoms in Jingfeng Forest,

366
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,839
pledging themselves to each other.

367
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,599
Young Master Xiu also buried their wedlock hair

368
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,880
under the tree.

369
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:39,759
The wind was strong.

370
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,720
Perhaps that's why the Fourth Princess

371
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
caught a chill.

372
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,759
Seventh Cousin is quite romantic.

373
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,279
Nanny.

374
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,160
This is delicious.

375
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:52,880
Try some.

376
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,720
What is it, Princess?

377
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,079
Nanny.

378
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,799
What is this tune called?

379
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,039
How do you...

380
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,759
Princess.

381
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,680
The nanny was originally from Yunze.

382
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,279
She hums this tune from time to time.

383
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
It might be an old Yunze melody.

384
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,519
A Yunze melody...

385
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,079
Tell me.

386
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,559
Who is this despairing old man?

387
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,960
You know him.

388
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,559
Grand Tutor Guan.

389
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,160
He will, inside the Benevolent Heart Hall,

390
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,920
dash himself against the imperial desk and die.

391
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,920
Grand Tutor Guan...

392
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,079
The Celestial Rite...

393
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,839
What did you just say?

394
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,640
I... I just said

395
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,519
Grand Tutor Guan has been normal these past few days.

396
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,279
No.

397
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,200
After that.

398
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,599
Further back.

399
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,599
I said

400
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,920
I ran into Xiao Liangzi this morning.

401
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,039
Further back.

402
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,200
The Fourth Princess and Young Master Xiu

403
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,440
pledged themselves to each other.

404
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,240
Young Master Xiu also buried their wedlock hair

405
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,920
under the tree.

406
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,359
In my homeland,

407
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,119
on the day a couple marries,

408
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,640
they take strands of their hair

409
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,480
and bury them together under intertwined branches

410
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,119
to pray for a long life together.

411
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,880
Seventh Cousin...

412
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,000
Princess, what's wrong?

413
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
During the Celestial Rite,

414
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,000
isn't Grand Tutor Guan supposed to present

415
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,839
the Heavenly Water to Father?

416
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes.

417
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
Every year at the Celestial Rite,

418
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
three cups of wine are prepared.

419
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,039
One is offered to heaven and earth.

420
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,079
One is offered to the ancestors.

421
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,000
And the last cup

422
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,599
is presented to His Majesty by a venerable elder

423
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,319
to pray for favorable weather

424
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,799
and peace for our Yunmi.

425
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,599
For national prosperity and people's safety.

426
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:52,920
Princess?

427
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,319
Princess!

428
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:53,880
Where are you going?

429
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,319
Your Majesty!

430
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,119
Father, don't drink it!

431
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,279
What...
