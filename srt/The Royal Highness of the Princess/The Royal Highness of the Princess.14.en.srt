1
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,519
Xixi, you need to pull yourself together.

2
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,480
We must live on, carrying Ru Feng's share...

3
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,760
...and live happily.

4
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,159
Don't worry, Princess. I'm fine now.

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
I told His Majesty your dementia is cured.

6
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,359
Only your memories haven't returned yet.

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,159
Recently, His Majesty ordered me...

8
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,640
...to purge Prince Ning's remaining forces.

9
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,959
I'm afraid I can't visit the palace often.

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
You can't enter the palace?

11
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,480
Why are you telling me this specifically?

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,639
What about the mysterious person?

13
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,080
Any discoveries?

14
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,080
I've already sent He Lianchen to investigate.

15
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,960
If there's any news...

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
...I'll tell you.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Then I'll return to the palace first.

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,879
Princess...

19
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,080
Lord Yuwen is treating you so differently now.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,960
Could he have ulterior motives?

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,879
What could he possibly want from me?

22
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,520
Your servant can't figure it out either.

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Anyway, I think...

24
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,520
...Young Master Meng is your perfect match.

25
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
Last time he visited you at Lord Yuwen's villa,

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,479
I noticed his eyes were only on you.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,639
Enough.

28
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,120
Stop playing matchmaker for me.

29
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,719
Meng Shaojue is my friend.

30
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,680
What's wrong with being friends?

31
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,400
Friends can't...

32
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,240
Young Master Meng!

33
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,919
I finally waited for your return.

34
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,439
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Zixiu brought me here.

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,719
He's probably gone to find the Fourth Princess now.

37
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,599
I've already heard about Prince Ning's matter.

38
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,639
Are you alright?

39
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm fine.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,199
It's just Ru Feng...

41
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,639
Alright, let's not talk about this.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
Why didn't Yinglu come with you?

43
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,159
Naturally, because I wanted to be alone with you.

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
Can you be serious for once?

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
If you miss her...

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
...you can visit the Meng residence anytime.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,439
Father!

48
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,400
Good, good, good.

50
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,800
It seems Minister Yuwen...

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
...truly found someone to cure your dementia.

52
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,719
I've worried you, Father.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,879
I've sent some precious medicinal herbs...

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,560
...to your palace.

55
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,199
You've just regained your senses.

56
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,360
You must rest and recuperate properly.

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,960
Thank you, Father.

58
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,280
By the way, Father...

59
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,319
...let me introduce you.

60
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,360
This is Grand Preceptor Meng's son, Meng Shaojue.

61
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,319
He's a friend I made...

62
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,000
...while receiving treatment outside the palace.

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,080
If I remember correctly...

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
...since the Palace Examination five years ago...

65
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,920
...I haven't seen you again.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
Your Majesty still remembers this commoner?

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,839
This commoner is deeply honored and humbled.

68
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,079
I don't sense any humility from you.

69
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,959
To dare, after the Palace Examination...

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,959
...to publicly refuse an official post...

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,079
You are the first in Yunmi to do so.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,759
Father...

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,279
A Lan is a bit tired.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Then hurry back and rest.

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
I have matters to attend to.

76
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,680
I'll visit you later.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,000
Shao Jue...

78
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,279
Why did you refuse to become an official?

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
My temperament isn't suited for officialdom.

80
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,600
Then why did you take the imperial exams?

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,759
Did your father force you?

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
In this world...

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,639
...no one can force me to do what I don't wish.

84
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,000
But if you wanted me to do something...

85
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,879
...even if it meant scaling a mountain of blades or crossing a sea of fire...

86
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,800
...I would gladly do it.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,319
Here we go again.

88
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,000
My late mother's wish...

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,560
...was for me to achieve top honors in the exams.

90
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,319
By the way...

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,079
The Flower Festival is approaching.

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
The peach blossoms outside the city are in full bloom.

93
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,360
Yinglu is clamoring to go for an outing.

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Why doesn't A Lan come with us?

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,759
Alright.

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,680
Perfect timing.

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,600
I brought Yinglu a few martial arts manuals.

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll give them to her then.

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,199
Is that Seventh Cousin?

100
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,519
That's how cheesy dramas always play out.

101
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,560
"I like you."

102
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,399
"You like me too."

103
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,800
"But I just won't tell you."

104
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:02,800
Shao Jue...

105
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Tell me...

106
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,240
...Seventh Cousin clearly likes Royal Sister.

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,720
Why won't he tell her?

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,639
Perhaps Zixiu...

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,120
...feels he's not worthy of the Fourth Princess.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,639
What nonsense about being worthy or not!

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
It only depends on whether one is brave enough.

112
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,600
How about...

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,680
...we give him a helping hand?

114
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,319
Do you have any good ideas?

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,199
Didn't you just say...

116
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,839
...the peach grove outside the city is in full bloom?

117
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,360
If we invite Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin...

118
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,079
...to admire the flowers together...

119
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,279
The fine wine Shao Jue sent...

120
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,720
...is especially fragrant.

121
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,480
Have a taste.

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,120
It really is good.

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,759
Here, Seventh Cousin.

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
Why did you suddenly ask us to accompany you flower-viewing?

125
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,920
Isn't it all for your "peach blossom luck"?

126
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,480
What?

127
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,839
Nothing.

128
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Shao Jue said the scenery here is exceptionally beautiful.

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,639
He invited everyone to admire the flowers and taste the wine.

130
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,040
It's getting late.

131
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,439
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,439
I'll go check.

133
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,240
You two go ahead and wait for me.

134
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:32,959
I'll be right back.

135
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,800
Seventh Cousin! A Zi!

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Let's wait for A Lan over there.

137
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,199
It's all set.

138
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,439
As you instructed...

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,319
...the pit is lined with thick grass.

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,839
I guarantee they won't get hurt.

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,519
Are you alright, A Zi?

142
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,399
I'm fine.

143
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,040
I'll get you out.

144
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I can't use my inner force.

145
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:35,919
This...

146
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
Sorry about this, Royal Sister.

147
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,759
I put something in the wine.

148
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,440
There's also some in the pit.

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,080
If I heard correctly just now,

150
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
the one who screamed was

151
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Seventh Cousin.

152
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,519
Zixiu's courage

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,159
is not even as good as Fourth Princess's.

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,159
The male and female leads falling into a trap together

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,799
is actually an excellent way to foster feelings.

156
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,480
Sorry, A Zi.

157
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,240
It's fine.

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,799
Big Brother, why are you here?

159
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,840
You...

160
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
Where are A Lan and Meng Shaojue?

161
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,960
I don't know.

162
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
Get us out first, hurry!

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,639
Yuwen Rui!

164
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:56,639
Let's go.

165
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,919
Big Brother! Big Brother!

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,320
I...

167
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,759
He... he just left like that?

168
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,720
Why is Yuwen Rui here?

169
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
He showed up at such a critical moment.

170
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,240
Hold on tight.

171
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,200
Wait, why are we running?

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,279
I've never seen Lord Yuwen so flustered.

173
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,799
How interesting.

174
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,639
I'm saying, can you two

175
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,440
stop playing this game of cat and mouse?

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Your Lordship's lightness skill is indeed impressive.

177
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,519
Why are you here?

178
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
I heard you and...

179
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,200
I heard you came here to admire flowers and taste wine.

180
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,919
What admiring flowers and tasting wine?

181
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,279
I wanted to use this opportunity

182
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,159
to properly matchmake Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

183
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,240
Who knew you'd show up halfway through?

184
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,519
And I ruined your little scheme.

185
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
Your Lordship has ruined

186
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,240
more than just this one scheme.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm taking you back to the palace.

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,679
A Lan and I haven't admired the flowers or tasted wine yet.

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,039
Let go.

190
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,159
Zixiu and Fourth Princess

191
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,399
seem to still be waiting for you in the trap.

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
You go rescue them first.

193
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,279
Don't say you saw us.

194
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,720
Shao Jue and I will be over shortly.

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,639
Let's go.

196
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,159
Help!

197
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,519
Someone save us!

198
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,720
Help!

199
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,159
Save... Big Brother!

200
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,799
Big Cousin!

201
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,559
You're finally here!

202
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,159
My throat is almost hoarse from shouting.

203
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,799
I thought you weren't coming.

204
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,200
Come on up.

205
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,519
Quick, quick, quick, A Zi!

206
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,200
Okay.

207
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,039
Take it slow.

208
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,679
Are you alright?

209
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm fine.

210
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,039
Why can't A Zi even use her inner force?

211
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,320
Perhaps someone sprinkled powder in the trap.

212
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,240
What happened here?

213
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,679
Are you two okay?

214
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,360
We're fine.

215
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,080
We accidentally fell into a pit just now.

216
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,000
Why are you here too?

217
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
To admire the flowers together.

218
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,440
This place is suspicious.

219
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
We should return to the palace sooner rather than later.

220
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,799
Right, right, let's hurry and leave.

221
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,799
Don't accidentally fall into another trap.

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
Let's wait until the Flower Festival

223
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,000
to admire flowers and taste wine together in the palace.

224
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,720
Let's go.

225
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,559
Shao Jue.

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,799
In previous years, I never saw you attend the Flower Festival.

227
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Aren't you coming this year either?

228
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:16,919
With A Lan here,

229
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
I must go this year.

230
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,840
What talent is A Lan planning

231
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
to display at the Flower Festival Banquet?

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
Display a talent?

233
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,480
A Lan probably doesn't remember.

234
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,159
Her Majesty the Empress holds

235
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,279
a Flower Festival Banquet every year.

236
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,480
She invites the children of noble families

237
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,279
to admire flowers and taste wine together,

238
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,799
get to know each other,

239
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,559
and compete in talents.

240
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,639
I see.

241
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,279
A large-scale matchmaking event.

242
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
I heard the prize for this year's banquet

243
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,080
is a pair of white jade mandarin ducks.

244
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,480
Rumor has it they were

245
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,639
the love tokens of Emperor Yunze and his empress.

246
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,720
They're extremely valuable.

247
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
Do you want them?

248
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,639
I'll win them for you.

249
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,600
No need to trouble yourself.

250
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,039
Let's go.

251
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,639
Perhaps we can use the Flower Festival Banquet to give them a boost.

252
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:10,840
What do you think?

253
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,960
I think we can.

254
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,279
Watch your step.

255
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,759
Royal Sister.

256
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
What talent are you planning to display?

257
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,399
Sword dancing.

258
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,559
Any chance of winning?

259
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,799
A Zi sword dances every year,

260
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,840
but she only won the top prize the first year.

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,799
I'll think of a way.

262
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,799
We...

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,159
will definitely win those white jade mandarin ducks.

264
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,000
Tomorrow, all of you come to Yunxi Palace.

265
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,600
Bring Yinglu too.

266
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,480
I had Xiao Lizi make some inquiries.

267
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,840
At this Flower Festival Banquet,

268
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,960
no one is performing a play.

269
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,960
This is a storybook I adapted myself.

270
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,279
We'll perform it ourselves.

271
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,159
What does "Version 2.0" mean?

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,480
It means the second version.

273
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,919
It's a tragic yet beautiful love story.

274
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,039
I specifically added scenes where

275
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,080
the male and female leads play the zither together, sword dance,

276
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,360
paint, and compose poetry.

277
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Varied talents combined with a tragic love story

278
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,759
are sure to amaze everyone.

279
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,080
Not bad, not bad.

280
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,000
Others either play the zither

281
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,000
or sword dance.

282
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,200
We have a bit of everything.

283
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,679
This time, we're sure to win the top prize.

284
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,039
Then you

285
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,320
plan to help Zixiu and Fourth Princess?

286
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,559
You'll find out in a moment.

287
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,440
Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin

288
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,960
will play the leads in the opera,

289
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,360
namely, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.

290
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,639
Why me and A Zi?

291
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,759
If you don't want to act,

292
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,399
you can quit.

293
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,440
ShaoJue and Yinglu

294
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,240
can play the page boy and maid, okay?

295
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,119
This play

296
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
relies heavily on the chemistry

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,759
and rapport between the leads.

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,559
Whether it's performed well

299
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,640
depends entirely on Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

300
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,319
You two try a few scenes first

301
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,480
to build some rapport.

302
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,920
Coincidentally,

303
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,039
there's a Cuju scene at the academy

304
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,279
where Liang Shanbo accidentally discovers

305
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,200
Zhu Yingtai's true gender.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,519
So, we

307
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,839
will try this scene first.

308
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,759
Come on, everyone, listen up!

309
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,480
No using inner force or anything in today's match.

310
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,079
Will we need this many people on stage later?

311
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,200
We'll see how it looks first.

312
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,000
Anyway, let's have a serious match today.

313
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,079
I will win.

314
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Be careful.

315
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,839
Control your strength,

316
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,759
don't hurt anyone.

317
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,720
Don't worry,

318
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,920
I know my limits.

319
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,039
Royal Sister,

320
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,000
your chance to be the hero saving the beauty is here.

321
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,440
Is Royal Sister's competitive spirit that strong?

322
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Fourth Princess has never lost a Cuju match.

323
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,079
Seventh Cousin, I'm really sorry for you.

324
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,400
I quit, I quit!

325
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Seventh Cousin, are you okay?

326
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm fine, I'm fine.

327
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,039
Looks like the hero-saving-beauty plan is a bust.

328
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,200
As expected of my Royal Sister,

329
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,720
a true heroine among women.

330
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,559
Chief Grand Secretary,

331
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,559
the Princess and Lord Meng are here.

332
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,319
What are you discussing that requires such closeness?

333
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,359
Nothing.

334
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,200
Let's call it a day for now.

335
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
But the winner hasn't been decided yet.

336
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,119
Seventh Cousin is in this state,

337
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,680
he probably doesn't want to continue.

338
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,880
Let's just disband, disband.

339
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,119
Then let's disband.

340
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,559
On behalf of Zixiu,

341
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,599
Okay.

342
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,359
Why do I feel

343
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
they're not kicking a ball,

344
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,839
One to zero.

345
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,839
Lord Yuwen seems to have lost, right?

346
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,359
Yes, yes, yes.

347
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,480
That's about enough now.

348
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,240
It's time to end this.

349
00:21:59,319 --> 00:21:59,799
A Lan,

350
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,319
I think this act

351
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,960
is not suitable for the Flower Festival Banquet.

352
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,720
Of course it's not suitable.

353
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,119
I already plan to cut it.

354
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,480
Everyone, go home today and familiarize yourselves with the script.

355
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,240
Tomorrow,

356
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,160
we'll have our official rehearsal.

357
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
You... are in a bad mood.

358
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm perfectly fine.

359
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,799
Lately, you've been spending time

360
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,799
with Meng Shaojue every day.

361
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,519
He's helping me matchmake Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

362
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,960
Naturally, we have to meet often.

363
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,759
He certainly has a lot of free time.

364
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,440
What exactly is going on between you and Shaojue?

365
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
It's like you have some deep-seated grudge.

366
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,240
Nothing.

367
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,119
Stay away from him from now on.

368
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,880
Seventh Cousin is right.

369
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,960
You and Shaojue should interact more.

370
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,640
Maybe you'll become good brothers.

371
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,039
Don't mention him in front of me again.

372
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,599
Weren't you the one who brought him up first?

373
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,759
I'll be quite busy in the coming days.

374
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,119
I'll come see you again in a while.

375
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,519
You focus on your business.

376
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,599
No need to visit me for no reason.

377
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,960
If you want to see me,

378
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,200
use this firework as a signal.

379
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,440
Why would I want to see you?

380
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,599
Aren't you going inside?

381
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:40,720
This line...

382
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:45,519
A Lan,

383
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,440
if we perform well,

384
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,440
can we really win first place?

385
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,759
Don't worry, Royal Sister.

386
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,880
I know you want to help Seventh Cousin

387
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,839
win the White Jade Mandarin Ducks.

388
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:55,920
Leave it all to me.

389
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
Ma Wencai is such a darn scoundrel, isn't he?

390
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,119
Who will play him?

391
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,119
His part isn't big anyway.

392
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,519
We can just find someone random.

393
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,720
As for this Ma Wencai character,

394
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,079
why not let He Lianchen do it?

395
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,480
Come on, come on, come on.

396
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,720
Alright, everyone,

397
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
let's rehearse one last time today.

398
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,359
Perform well tomorrow.

399
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,839
Why are you alone?

400
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,000
Where's the leaf-blower?

401
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,160
Princess,

402
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,440
he has a stomach ache.

403
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,759
He'll be a bit late.

404
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,759
Then I'll take his place.

405
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
Let's begin officially.

406
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,759
You can blow leaves too?

407
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,559
Who said the music has to be leaf-blowing?

408
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
I can play the zither.

409
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,400
That year, in a light rain of apricot blossoms,

410
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
Zhu Yingtai, disguised as a man,

411
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,000
encountered the scholar Liang Shanbo.

412
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,519
They became fast friends at first sight.

413
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,799
Hey, that maid, pay attention!

414
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,759
You've been rolling your eyes a bit too much lately.

415
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:44,759
Smoke effect,

416
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,480
go!

417
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,559
I think Lord Meng and the Princess are a perfect match.

418
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,599
But the Princess is already betrothed to Lord Yuwen.

419
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,359
Looking at it this way,

420
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,279
isn't Lord Yuwen just like Ma Wencai?

421
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,839
Yes.

422
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,359
The two studied together for three years,

423
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,119
inseparable.

424
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,920
Background music, go!

425
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,279
Why have you all run over there?

426
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,319
Don't you have any self-awareness?

427
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
Okay, the music is indeed a bit intense.

428
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,839
But you need to have conviction!

429
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,400
Until I call cut,

430
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,240
you must keep acting.

431
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,519
Let's go.

432
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,759
I'll play the zither instead.

433
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,920
Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,400
A Lan.

435
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,319
Can I change the maid I'm playing?

436
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,640
How do you want to change it?

437
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,680
The maid I play hates evil fiercely.

438
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,160
She can't stand He Lian...

439
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,400
...and can't stand Ma Wencai forcing her mistress to marry.

440
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,839
So she finds a chance to beat him up severely.

441
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,359
Beats him until he's searching for his teeth.

442
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,559
He wouldn't even recognize his own father.

443
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,960
Then he kneels and begs for mercy.

444
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,480
But how could this young lady forgive him?

445
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,599
Of course, she beats him so badly...

446
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,039
...he can't get out of bed for half a month.

447
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:05,720
Stop.

448
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,799
You're just a maid.

449
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,279
Aren't you adding too much extra drama?

450
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,319
A Lan.

451
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,839
Please agree to it.

452
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,119
Let me give it a try.

453
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,799
I've been diligently practicing martial arts these days.

454
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,480
I just want a chance to fight He Lianchen.

455
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,640
Last time he said...

456
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
...if I want to defeat him...

457
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
...it's absolutely impossible in this lifetime.

458
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,839
I can't swallow that insult.

459
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,759
Miss Meng.

460
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,279
You're no match for me.

461
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,759
We'll only know if we're matched by competing.

462
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,960
This young lady wants to see...

463
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,480
...just how capable you really are.

464
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,079
A Lan.

465
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,759
Just let me have one fight.

466
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,039
If I win...

467
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,640
...add the scene where the maid teaches Ma Wencai a lesson...

468
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,160
...into the play. How about it?

469
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,240
Alright.

470
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,359
But stop when you've made your point.

471
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,000
Forget it, Miss Meng.

472
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,640
You're truly not my match.

473
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,000
So much talk.

474
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:13,640
Come on.

475
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,799
Why aren't you making a move?

476
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,119
Are you looking down on me?

477
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,519
Since Miss Meng insists...

478
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,079
...then I, He, will spar with you.

479
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,759
However, when I strike...

480
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,119
...I might not know my own strength.

481
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,799
Enough talk.

482
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,119
Show me your real skill.

483
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,079
Miss Meng.

484
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,200
Miss Meng.

485
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,400
Don't push yourself too hard.

486
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,640
Don't you worry about whether I'm pushing myself.

487
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,240
Come on.

488
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Are you hurt?

489
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,240
This time, my skill was inferior.

490
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,480
Next time, you won't be so lucky.

491
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Since you lost...

492
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
...then the scene of the maid beating up Ma Wencai...

493
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,480
...should probably be dropped.

494
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,559
Alright, alright.

495
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,279
Let's...

496
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,880
...take a break.

497
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,319
We'll continue rehearsing later.

498
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,480
Come here, come here, come here.

499
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,880
Why was a scene suddenly added to the ending?

500
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,359
A scene of me marrying A Zi.

501
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,039
And it's so... intimate.

502
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,799
What? You marrying my Royal Sister?

503
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,559
This is Liang Shanbo's dream.

504
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
He dreams of marrying Zhu Yingtai.

505
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm saying...

506
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,200
...can't you forget your status?

507
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
Properly immerse yourself in the role.

508
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,079
But this kissing... the kiss...

509
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,599
I've already discussed it with Royal Sister.

510
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,319
We'll fake it when the time comes.

511
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,759
What does "fake it" mean?

512
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,960
I've already explained it to you all.

513
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
Why are you so hung up on this?

514
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,319
Do you have a guilty conscience?

515
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,559
I do not.

516
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,119
Then why are you being awkward?

517
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,279
I...

518
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:41,880
This...

519
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,359
...is a list of officials secretly working for Prince Ning.

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,759
Go and verify it.

521
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Fifth Princess.

522
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,519
Has been rehearsing the play in the palace recently.

523
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Yes.

524
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,839
The Fifth Princess even played the zither herself today.

525
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,319
However, the music was simply...

526
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,839
...unbearable to listen to.

527
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,799
She really is carefree.

528
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,680
Princess.

529
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,880
You must be exhausted from these past days.

530
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,200
You've all worked hard too.

531
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,359
If you want to see me...

532
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,519
...use this firework as a signal.

533
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,799
Have you heard anything recently...

534
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,559
...regarding court affairs?

535
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,440
Court affairs?

536
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,720
What does Your Highness mean?

537
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,599
Didn't Father command...

538
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,839
...Yuwen Rui to investigate Prince Ning's remaining forces?

539
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,400
This servant only heard...

540
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,680
...that His Majesty ordered Lord Yuwen...

541
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,279
...to fully investigate Prince Ning's actions over the years.

542
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,720
As for other matters...

543
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,799
...I'm not clear.

544
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,119
It's been several days...

545
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,960
...since the last Cuju match.

546
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,759
Including today...

547
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,799
...it's been seven days.

548
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,799
Perhaps he's already investigated and found out...

549
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,799
...the mysterious person's identity.

550
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,679
Come if you want, or don't.

551
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,639
You've been waiting a long time.

552
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
Who's waiting for you?

553
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,440
Stubborn.

554
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,000
I resisted coming to the palace...

555
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,840
...just to see...

556
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
...when exactly you...

557
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
...would send me a message.

558
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
You're quite heartless.

559
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,039
It took you a full seven days to think of seeing me.

560
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,800
Who's thinking of you?

561
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,719
I just wanted to ask...

562
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,320
...about the mysterious person.

563
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:43,760
Is that so?

564
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,039
You call me here so late, not sleeping...

565
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,840
...just to ask me that?

566
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,280
Is that not allowed?

567
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,119
No.
