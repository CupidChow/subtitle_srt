1
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,680
A Lan

2
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,760
Princess, you're awake.

3
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,240
Fourth Sister.

4
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,719
Was the person rescued?

5
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,919
Don't worry.

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
They're fine.

7
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,080
I never expected

8
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,240
that you'd care for him so much now.

9
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,439
Fourth Princess.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,360
The imperial physician says the princess is out of danger.

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,479
You haven't rested all night.

12
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,560
Please return to the palace first.

13
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,599
I will take care of things here.

14
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
Fourth Sister.

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
A Lan is fine.

16
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,319
You should go back first.

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
If anything happens to A Lan,

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,719
you must report to me promptly.

19
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,719
Then rest well.

20
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,879
Don't do anything foolish again.

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,120
The person was really rescued.

22
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,960
Is everything alright?

23
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,199
Rest assured.

24
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,919
He's perfectly fine.

25
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,159
The Fourth Princess is right.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,719
Princess, you must never do anything foolish again.

27
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Even if you like Lord Yuwen so much,

28
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,840
you can't disregard your own life.

29
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,680
Yes.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,199
I've heard all about it.

31
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
The princess, worried about Lord Yuwen,

32
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,680
jumped into the water without hesitation.

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,639
It's spread throughout the entire palace.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,159
His Majesty is both worried and angry.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
I must also advise you.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Leaving aside whether Lord Yuwen needed your rescue,

37
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,280
even if he did,

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,039
you must act within your capabilities.

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Stop.

40
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,439
I'm asking about Commander He.

41
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,400
Princess, don't use Commander He as a shield.

42
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,120
It's perfectly normal to like Lord Yuwen.

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Don't be embarrassed.

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,199
Your train of thought is hard to follow.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,919
How is He Lianchen?

46
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,439
The miracle doctor who treated you before

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,680
is still staying at the Yuwen Mansion.

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,159
Lord He was taken to the Yuwen Mansion last night.

49
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,879
He still hasn't woken up.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,439
Xixi.

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,560
Help me get ready.

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm going to the Yuwen Mansion.

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,520
To see Lord Yuwen?

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,719
Alright.

55
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,639
This servant will also help.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,639
He would kindly save me?

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
He must have ulterior motives.

58
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,519
Princess.

59
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,120
He... greets the princess.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Where's Eldest Cousin?

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
His Lordship is in his room.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Princess.

63
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,360
Careful.

64
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,839
Seen enough?

65
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,879
Eldest Cousin.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Are you and Commander He both alright?

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,439
Get out.

68
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,079
It's good that Eldest Cousin is fine.

69
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,160
Father asks if Commander He is dead.

70
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,160
He's not dead. Now get out.

71
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,319
Princess.

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,399
Where is Lord Yuwen?

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,519
I already said Lord Yuwen is fine.

74
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,560
Why must the princess rush here

75
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,720
the moment she wakes up?

76
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,720
Coming is one thing,

77
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,319
but bringing so many miracle medicines too?

78
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,560
The princess is truly thoughtful.

79
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,399
Judging by last night's events,

80
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,759
Yuwen Rui and the assassin who infiltrated Benevolent Heart Hall

81
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,519
are not working together.

82
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,560
Therefore, on the night of the birthday banquet,

83
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,279
the one plotting to steal the map wasn't Yuwen Rui.

84
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,480
And the one who poisoned me wasn't him either.

85
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,839
This is a huge misunderstanding.

86
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,199
Since it wasn't Yuwen Rui who poisoned me,

87
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,079
then the jade pendant...

88
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,160
Fifth Princess.

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Your jade pendant.

90
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,959
Why does this handwriting look so familiar?

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,519
Xixi.

92
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,519
What about that note?

93
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,920
The one Commander He dropped by the dry well.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,720
This note was written by Yuwen Rui to He Lianchen.

95
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,199
But later, their positions differed

96
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,279
and their political views clashed.

97
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
Gradually, they became like strangers.

98
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,680
Darn it, this cannon fodder constitution.

99
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,480
Have I stumbled upon

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,519
some unsavory secret again?

101
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,240
I shall take my leave now.

102
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,879
What's in your hand?

103
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,000
Eldest Cousin.

104
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,559
Eldest Cousin, I...

105
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:39,960
My lord.

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,159
Commander He has woken up.

107
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,480
Fifth Princess.

108
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,440
Chief Grand Secretary.

109
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,879
Fortunately, he was rescued ashore in time.

110
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,200
Thus, Lord He was spared from death.

111
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,919
The opponent coated the hidden weapon with poison.

112
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,960
This commoner has already helped Lord He detoxify.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,840
He is now out of danger.

114
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,799
Then this commoner will take his leave

115
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,600
to prescribe a remedy for Lord He.

116
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
I heard the Fifth Princess

117
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
entered the water out of concern for the Chief Grand Secretary

118
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,159
but accidentally saved my life.

119
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,480
Regardless,

120
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,919
the Fifth Princess's life-saving grace

121
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,000
is etched in my heart.

122
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,480
If you have something to say, speak.

123
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,360
Eldest Cousin.

124
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,159
A Lan will step out first.

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,840
Fifth Princess.

126
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,000
You already know so much.

127
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
Won't you hear the secret to the end?

128
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,879
Prince Ning sent people to infiltrate the palace

129
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,919
to steal the Map of the Nine Provinces.

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,679
The map the assassin held last night

131
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,320
was a map of the Meng Mansion.

132
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
Could it be because

133
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,480
the whereabouts of the Map of the Nine Provinces are related to the Meng Mansion?

134
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,159
Prince Ning...

135
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
Last night, you entered the water to save me.

136
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,240
Could it be noticed by others

137
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,039
that I am actually working for you?

138
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,120
It's fine.

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,279
I've already had Rufeng spread the word

140
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,480
that I entered the water only to catch the assassin,

141
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,600
not to save you.

142
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm just cannon fodder.

143
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,279
I don't want to know anything.

144
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
Eldest Cousin.

145
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,080
A Lan wishes to return to the palace.

146
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Fifth Princess.

147
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,159
Talk with me.

148
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,360
The Fifth Princess is quite the actress.

149
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
Why pretend to be dumb?

150
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,519
After I was poisoned that day,

151
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
I didn't remember many things.

152
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,600
I only vaguely remembered

153
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,399
someone trying to steal something from Benevolent Heart Hall.

154
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,600
The poisoner definitely wanted to silence me.

155
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,639
So I started pretending to be stupid.

156
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,919
I didn't see clearly who it was.

157
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
But Commander He said

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,120
the assassin who broke into Benevolent Heart Hall was Prince Ning's man.

159
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Then the poisoning

160
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,120
must be connected to Prince Ning.

161
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,639
After losing her memory, the Fifth Princess

162
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
has become much smarter.

163
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,879
Compared to Eldest Cousin,

164
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm still far behind.

165
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,639
By the way,

166
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,080
thank you for saving me yesterday.

167
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,159
This jade pendant was left to me by my Imperial Grandmother.

168
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
It is priceless.

169
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,360
I'll give it to you as a thank-you gift.

170
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Fifth Princess, you don't need to thank me.

171
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,039
I didn't intend to save you.

172
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,279
It's just that

173
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,960
if the Emperor's favorite Fifth Princess

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,000
were to have an accident,

175
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,639
I would be held responsible.

176
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
Regardless,

177
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,960
you saved my life after all.

178
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,919
Besides,

179
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
you helped me pick up this jade pendant last time too.

180
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,799
I didn't find this jade pendant.

181
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,919
Eunuch Xue found the jade pendant,

182
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,399
and His Majesty just asked me to pass it to you.

183
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
If you don't want the jade pendant, forget it.

184
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,440
If you need my help in the future,

185
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,879
feel free to tell me.

186
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,000
About the prayer ceremony,

187
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
and your secret with Commander He,

188
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,399
I absolutely won't tell anyone.

189
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,519
About me pretending to be dumb,

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,440
I hope you can keep it a secret too.

191
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,360
By the way,

192
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,720
the hairpin your mother left you,

193
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I should return it to its owner.

194
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,720
This hairpin is a fake.

195
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,039
So you took the real hairpin long ago.

196
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,200
Otherwise? Give it to you?

197
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,639
I know I did many wrong things before.

198
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,759
But since I lost my memory,

199
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,240
I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

200
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,720
For the sake of me saving Commander He,

201
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,279
as for the past,

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,679
can we just write it off?

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,759
Fine.

204
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
But I have a question to ask.

205
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,320
Did the Fifth Princess really enter the water last night to save me?

206
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,039
Why save me?

207
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
We have a betrothal, after all.

208
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,600
It was right for me to save you.

209
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,960
Our betrothal

210
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,519
was the Empress Dowager's decree before she passed.

211
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,039
It wasn't by our own choice.

212
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,840
I know you don't want to marry me.

213
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
Anyway, you'll definitely find a way to cancel the betrothal.

214
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,919
Since the Fifth Princess is so clever,

215
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,559
why not help me think of a way?

216
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,159
Fine.

217
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,559
Since you put it that way,

218
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,120
I'll definitely think of a way immediately

219
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,240
to get Father to cancel our marriage as soon as possible.

220
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,240
Let's never see each other again.

221
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,279
Speak if you have something to say.

222
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,320
My Lord,

223
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,519
this subordinate feels that the Fifth Princess...

224
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,919
perhaps she has fallen for you.

225
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,080
My Lord,

226
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,600
this subordinate heard last night that

227
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,639
after you fell into the water,

228
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
the Fifth Princess was worried to death.

229
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,679
She jumped into the water regardless of danger,

230
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,480
just to save you.

231
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,039
Perhaps she has other motives.

232
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,200
Motives?

233
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
What motives could there be?

234
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,120
At that time, besides you, only Commander He was underwater.

235
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,200
She has no connection with Commander He.

236
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,559
There is no reason for her to disregard her own life

237
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
for Commander He.

238
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
But you are different, My Lord.

239
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,120
The Fifth Princess saving Commander He

240
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,440
was at most done in passing.

241
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:52,960
My Lord,

242
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,720
when you asked the Fifth Princess to find a way to cancel the betrothal,

243
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,559
this subordinate saw she looked very desolate when she left.

244
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,480
She...

245
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,799
Father.

246
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,720
The guards who went to Flying Immortal Pavilion with Commander He said

247
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,319
Commander He received intelligence

248
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,000
that the assassin who broke into the palace at night

249
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,839
would appear at Flying Immortal Pavilion last night.

250
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
That's why Commander He took men to ambush there,

251
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,640
leading to the fight with the assassin.

252
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,319
To escape from Commander He and Minister Yuwen,

253
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,559
the person behind this seems not simple.

254
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,680
The other party broke into the palace at night

255
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,559
presumably for the Map of the Nine Provinces.

256
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,119
About last night's incident,

257
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,079
do you have any leads?

258
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,480
The assassin escaped

259
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,799
and didn't leave any clues.

260
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,400
You and A Zi go investigate this matter clearly.

261
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,000
You must ferret out the person behind this.

262
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
Your son obeys. Your servant obeys.

263
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,160
About A Lan falling into the water to save you last night,

264
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,160
I have heard all about it.

265
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,799
Since A Lan cares about you so much now,

266
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,400
go visit her more often when you have time.

267
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,559
Yes.

268
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Fortunately, you completed the mission safely despite the scare.

269
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,279
You knew long ago that the person who poisoned me

270
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,039
wasn't Yuwen Rui.

271
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,400
Yet you didn't say anything to remind me.

272
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,680
Sorry.

273
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Heavenly secrets cannot be revealed.

274
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,359
I didn't expect Prince Ning to be such a good actor.

275
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,519
The plot is getting more and more complex.

276
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
The mission is getting harder and harder.

277
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960
When can I go home?

278
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,680
Princess.

279
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,960
Did Lord Yuwen really ask you to find a way

280
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
to cancel the betrothal yourself?

281
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,400
Lord Yuwen is truly cruel.

282
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
The Princess jumped into the water for him,

283
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
risking your very life.

284
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,640
Yet he actually wants to cancel the betrothal.

285
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,880
Your servant really misjudged him.

286
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,519
He is simply a heartless

287
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,759
and ungrateful person.

288
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,000
It has nothing to do with him.

289
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I did all this for myself.

290
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
For yourself?

291
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,119
At a time like this,

292
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,400
you're still making excuses for him.

293
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,880
Princess, don't be too sad.

294
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,519
It is Lord Yuwen's loss.

295
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,240
There are still many young talents in this capital.

296
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,599
Your servant will definitely keep an eye out for you.

297
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,720
If... You go do your work first.

298
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I want to be alone for a while.

299
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,599
My lord.

300
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,880
It seems what I said was correct.

301
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,240
The Fifth Princess truly likes you.

302
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,160
Who she likes...

303
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,079
...is none of my concern.

304
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,160
Xi Xi, I only have one card left.

305
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,880
Do you want it or not?

306
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,000
Xi Xi, it seems the Joker is in Xiao Li Zi's hand.

307
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,119
We're definitely going to lose this round.

308
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,400
I'll do it.

309
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,000
This one... anyone want it?

310
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,519
Joker.

311
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,519
If no one wants it...

312
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,759
I only have one card left.

313
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,720
I... wait!

314
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Four twos!

315
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,079
And a bomb! We win!

316
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,759
Princess.

317
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm the one who loses every time.

318
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,640
From now on, I...

319
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,119
Again, again, again!

320
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,119
...don't want to play Fight the Chancellor with you anymore.

321
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,160
My forehead is going to get swollen from all the flicks.

322
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,119
Fight the Chancellor?

323
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,960
You're quite the player, aren't you?

324
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,920
You two shuffle the cards. I need to go inside for a moment.

325
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,279
You shuffle.

326
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,680
All yours, all yours, all yours.

327
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,519
You've adapted quite quickly.

328
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,759
Enough chatter.

329
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,759
Tell me the mission.

330
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,359
You've been looking for so long.

331
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,400
Who needs saving?

332
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Your mission this time is rather special.

333
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
And also rather... roundabout.

334
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Special?

335
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,519
Roundabout?

336
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,640
You have to save a very special cannon fodder.

337
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,839
What's so special about it?

338
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400
It's not human.

339
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,759
Is it a god, then?

340
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,079
It's not a god either.

341
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,079
A demon?

342
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:32,759
No.

343
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,079
Then what is it?

344
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,799
Actually...

345
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,440
...it's a pig.

346
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
The little black pig from the Meng Mansion.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,759
What did you say?

348
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,359
A pig?

349
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,680
A little black pig?

350
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,519
Has a donkey kicked you in the head?

351
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,680
No personal attacks!

352
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Personal attack?

353
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,000
Do you even count as a person?

354
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,200
Having you save that little black pig...

355
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,640
...is a decision I made after careful consideration.

356
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,920
Don't be ungrateful.

357
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm ungrateful?

358
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,400
Aren't you the one who follows the ironclad rule...

359
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
...that saving one life is better than building a seven-story pagoda?

360
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,920
Then what do you mean by having me save a pig?

361
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
Is a pig a human?

362
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,119
If a pig were human, then you'd be the pig.

363
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,680
You dare call me a pig?

364
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,680
You'll regret this.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,519
By the way...

366
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
...where is the little black pig?

367
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,119
You've already seen it at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

368
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,759
As for when it dies...

369
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,519
...I'll tell you after my anger subsides.

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,720
Bye-bye.

371
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,519
Explain clearly before you leave!

372
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
What kind of Plot Spirit...

373
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
...is this unreliable?

374
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,519
Your Highness.

375
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,599
I've investigated everything clearly.

376
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,680
That little black pig is the beloved pet...

377
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,640
...of the Meng family's young lady, Meng Yinglu.

378
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,119
She treasures it greatly.

379
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,079
She won't give it to anyone except the Meng family's young master.

380
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:51,880
However...

381
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,839
...if you use your power for personal gain...

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,920
...there is still a way...

383
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,559
...to get your hands on that little black pig.

384
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,119
But come to think of it...

385
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,559
Your Highness...

386
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,680
...why are you thinking about the Meng Mansion's little black pig?

387
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,839
Last time I went out of the palace for fun...

388
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,799
...I saw it and thought it was quite cute.

389
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,319
I wanted to borrow it and raise it for a while.

390
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,839
Can't another pig do?

391
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,599
Out of three thousand gallons of water, I only want one scoop.

392
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,319
I only want that little black pig.

393
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,519
I've asked clearly.

394
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Grand Tutor Meng is indeed at the Benevolent Heart Hall right now.

395
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,759
Let's go.

396
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,359
Your Majesty.

397
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,759
Building the academy is a major undertaking that benefits the state and the people.

398
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,000
I will certainly not fail Your Majesty's trust in this matter.

399
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,400
Then I'll trouble you with it, Grand Tutor.

400
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,119
The imperial examinations are approaching.

401
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,119
At that time, we can...

402
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,160
Fifth Princess!

403
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,240
Fifth Princess!

404
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,640
His Majesty is currently...

405
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Father!

406
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,640
A Lan knows how to become smart again!

407
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
The Fifth Princess has now lost all her wits.

408
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,319
Grand Tutor, you must not let this matter leak out.

409
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,839
Yes.

410
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
What A Lan means to say is...

411
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,119
...you dreamed of Consort Chen.

412
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,240
Imperial Mother said as long as A Lan and that little black pig...

413
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,319
...stay together every day...

414
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,839
...I'll become as smart as before.

415
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,759
Nonsense!

416
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,920
How could a little black pig...

417
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,839
Father...

418
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,720
A Lan wants to become like before.

419
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:28,920
Grand Tutor...

420
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,279
A Lan saw the little black pig...

421
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,079
...from your household at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

422
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,279
It's exactly the same as in A Lan's dream.

423
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,160
Grand Tutor...

424
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,559
...can you lend your little black pig to A Lan for a few days?

425
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,960
This...

426
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,119
Why isn't its fur as black and shiny as before?

427
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,039
Eat more. Get fatter.

428
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,119
Xi Xi, bring some water.

429
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,079
Xiao Li Zi.

430
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,279
Grand Tutor Meng...

431
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,200
...is trying to fool an idiot, isn't he?

432
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,559
In my humble opinion...

433
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,680
...this must be the work of the Meng family's young lady, Meng Yinglu.

434
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,680
Grand Tutor Meng is upright and incorruptible.

435
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,559
In the imperial court...

436
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,839
...he's the only one who dares to oppose the Chief Grand Secretary.

437
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,279
Given the Grand Tutor's temperament...

438
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,240
...he would absolutely never do such a thing.

439
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
When will Grand Tutor Meng enter the palace again?

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,160
Your Highness.

441
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,920
The Grand Tutor has gone to Tuzhou on His Majesty's orders.

442
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,200
I'm afraid he won't be back for quite some time.

443
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,799
Princess

444
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,559
Recently, Miss Meng Yinglu of the Meng Mansion

445
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,440
bought several crates of premium ink.

446
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,079
She also told people in the mansion

447
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,640
that the Fifth Princess is willful and vicious.

448
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,599
Young Master Meng Shaojue of the Meng family

449
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,759
is also a rare, fine young man in this world.

450
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,839
If he could marry the princess,

451
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
how wonderful that would be.

452
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,559
As the center of the team,

453
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,400
I feel a bit sad for some reason.

454
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,119
What kind of group is this?

455
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,359
One crazy person,

456
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,160
one fool,

457
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,039
one palace maid, one eunuch,

458
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,759
plus a pig.

459
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,759
Every variety is here.

460
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,680
Let me give your group a name.

461
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,039
Call it Yunmi's Five Beauties.

462
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,240
No, no, no.

463
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,119
Yunmi's Fantastic Five.

464
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,119
Yes, yes, Yunmi's Fantastic Five.

465
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,400
How does this male lead manage

466
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,240
to make people want to turn dark in minutes?

467
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,759
Alright, alright.

468
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,319
Let's get down to business.

469
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,160
Little fool.

470
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,920
Has Big Brother visited you recently?

471
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
Big Brother doesn't pay much attention to you.

472
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,160
My ten thousand taels are probably going down the drain.

473
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,400
Young Master Xiu.

474
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,559
Please don't mention Lord Yuwen in front of the princess.

475
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,319
The princess will be sad if she hears it.

476
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,119
That's true.

477
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,039
You are completely sincere towards Big Brother now,

478
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
but unfortunately, Big Brother he...

479
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
The little fool is so pitiful.

480
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,119
Seeing how pitiful you are,

481
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Seventh Cousin will take you out to relax.

482
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:31,799
How about it?

483
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,240
What are you looking at, little fool?

484
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,039
Looking at Seventh Cousin.

485
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,319
Then tell me, what's so good-looking about Seventh Cousin?

486
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,079
Seventh Cousin.

487
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,119
Are we going to watch cockfights,

488
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:53,119
or to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to see pretty girls?

489
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,559
What are you saying?

490
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,200
How could Seventh Cousin be the kind of

491
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,599
frivolous, pleasure-seeking playboy?

492
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,799
Young Master Xiu, you've arrived.

493
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,680
Please come in.

494
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,680
Little fool.

495
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
Play around here.

496
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,359
Don't run off.

497
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,079
Keep a good eye on him.

498
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,839
Don't worry, Young Master Xiu.

499
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,000
Come, come, please come in.

500
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,279
Win a lot, Young Master Xiu.

501
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,240
Come, come.

502
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,960
Two young masters.

503
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,359
This way, this way, come, come.

504
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,440
Please come in, please come in.

505
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,240
Seventh Cousin.

506
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,559
You'll get your comeuppance.

507
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,960
Take care, sir.

508
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,440
Need to help the Meng Mansion

509
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,720
recruit some honest maids and servants.

510
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,039
Miss, where is your father?

511
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,160
This girl is truly pitiful.

512
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,480
There's a place hiring maids.

513
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,680
The monthly pay is the highest in all of Luojing City.

514
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,279
Would you like to go?

515
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
What place?

516
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
At Grand Tutor Meng's residence.

517
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,559
Meng Mansion... Little Black Pig.

518
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,079
Don't worry, miss.

519
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,759
The masters of the Meng Mansion are extremely good to their servants.

520
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,519
I'm only helping you because I see you're pitiful.

521
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,039
If you agree,

522
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,680
they will give you a sum of silver

523
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,559
to give your father a proper burial.

524
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,799
What do you think?

525
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,119
Give my Imperial Father a proper burial?

526
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,400
I wouldn't dare.

527
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
Look, so many guests are here.

528
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,680
That is absolutely no problem.

529
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,519
Yes.

530
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,119
If you two gentlemen want to play,

531
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,759
why not go in and take a look?

532
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:08,880
Right?

533
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,400
Young Master Xiu.

534
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,160
You've come out.

535
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,519
Where is he?

536
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,200
Where did he go?

537
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,680
N-no, I don't know.

538
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,880
Go look for him, now!

539
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,920
Yes, yes.

540
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,519
Hurry!

541
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,200
Starting today,

542
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,400
it will be you few

543
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,880
who will take care of the young lady's pet pig.

544
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,359
Everyone must not be careless.

545
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,200
Understood?

546
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,480
Follow me.

547
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,200
Because the master disregarded the young lady's wishes

548
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,240
and sent her pet pig to the palace,

549
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,839
so to cheer up the young lady,

550
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,559
the master ordered people

551
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,599
to buy some similar piglets for the young lady.

552
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,000
These are the piglets you will care for in the future.

553
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,359
There's no black one.

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,799
Color and such are just superficial things.

555
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,119
Can't white or pink ones become black?

556
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,920
Yes, absolutely they can.

557
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,440
Girl, what number is this?

558
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,599
Two...

559
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,240
hundred and fifty.

560
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,559
What a pity, truly a pity.

561
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,000
Auntie Fu.

562
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,279
What are you pitying?

563
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,039
Come quickly and greet the young lady.

564
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,359
I was just talking about this girl.

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,559
So the role Director Ling cameoed as

566
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,720
is Meng Yinglu.

567
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,680
It really is quite a pity.

568
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,559
She looks quite delicate,

569
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,559
just her eyesight is poor.

570
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,119
Like my Little Black at home.

571
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,200
You, what's your name?

572
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
A Lan.

573
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,719
Young lady, perhaps we should send this girl away.

574
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,320
No need.

575
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,199
Just give this simpleton to me.

576
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,159
It's just perfect, the mansion has been terribly boring lately.

577
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,000
Little Black.

578
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,920
Little Black, I found you a companion.

579
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,440
Little Black.

580
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,679
Simpleton, you be careful.

581
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
Little Black bites people.

582
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,639
Little Black.

583
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,639
Little Black.

584
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,679
Little Black.

585
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,400
Little Black, my treasure.

586
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,360
That domineering, vicious, selfish

587
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,920
and utterly inhuman Fifth Princess in the palace

588
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,639
actually dares to covet you.

589
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,159
How could this young lady let her have her way?

590
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,079
Simpleton.

591
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,039
Go and fetch the pastries, quickly!

592
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,199
Excuse me.

593
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,519
That domineering, vicious, selfish

594
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,320
and utterly heartless Fifth Princess is none other than me.

595
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,320
She came to your mansion to steal a pig.

596
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,519
Blackie, be good.

597
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,679
Here, have a bite.

598
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,320
You must eat something.

599
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,639
I should still ask my brother to fetch a doctor.

600
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,159
You fool, watch Little Black carefully.

601
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,760
What is it?

602
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,159
You fed him?

603
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,719
It seems Little Black quite likes you.

604
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,199
From now on, you are responsible for taking care of Little Black.

605
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,400
If you dare let him lose a single hair,

606
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,920
you won't eat for a day.

607
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:45,800
Young Master Xiu.

608
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:47,760
Young Master Xiu!

609
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,320
Did you find her?

610
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,239
We didn't find her.

611
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,719
Why did you come back without finding her?

612
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,719
Keep looking!

613
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,079
Yes, yes, yes.

614
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:57,960
This...

615
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,800
Where on earth has that little fool run off to?

616
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Seventh Cousin, you won't find A Lan.

617
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,159
Why?

618
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,320
A pig thief has come to the Meng Mansion.

619
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,039
Just like that domineering Fifth Princess,

620
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,639
coveting our Meng Mansion's little black pig.
