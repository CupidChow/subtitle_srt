1
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
Just like that domineering Fifth Princess.

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,239
Coveting our Meng Mansion's little black pig.

3
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,159
Stop playing dumb.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Speak.

5
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,000
Why are you disguised as a maid?

6
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,840
Coming to our Meng Mansion to steal a pig?

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,239
A Lan is not playing dumb.

8
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,840
And she didn't steal any pig.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,240
You look so foolish and dim-witted.

10
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,599
A Lan is not dim-witted.

11
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,639
Don't be afraid.

12
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,560
A Lan will take you to see a doctor.

13
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,680
He's sick.

14
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,919
He won't eat anything.

15
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,360
He won't drink anything.

16
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,000
He needs to see a doctor.

17
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,639
Is that so?

18
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,439
He seems to be eating just fine.

19
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,400
Guards!

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,439
Young Master.

21
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,159
Throw this girl out of the mansion.

22
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:01,919
Yes.

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop eating.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,879
Young Master!

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,400
Look!

26
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,439
Blackie really is sick.

27
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,800
Blackie looks...

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
...a bit off today.

29
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,000
Perhaps he really is sick.

30
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,319
He really is sick.

31
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,919
It seems I wronged you.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Yinglu asked you to take care of Blackie.

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
And this is how you take care of him?

34
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,199
Cared for so well he won't eat or drink.

35
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,120
Looking utterly miserable.

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,240
With such negligence...

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,599
...what use are you staying in Meng Mansion?

38
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,479
Young Master! Young Master!

39
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,759
Young Master!

40
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Your servant won't leave.

41
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,479
Don't drive your servant out of the mansion.

42
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,680
What's going on?

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,919
If I hadn't discovered it in time...

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
...Blackie would have been stolen by this girl.

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,519
Young Lady.

46
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,920
Blackie is sick.

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,920
A Lan is taking him to see a doctor.

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
A dimwit...

49
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,800
...but quite skilled at talking nonsense.

50
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,720
Brother.

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
She's not talking nonsense.

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,959
This is what the girl left in her room.

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
"Blackie is sick."

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,079
"A Lan will take him to see a doctor."

55
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,920
From now on, if Blackie gets sick...

56
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,519
...you must tell me first.

57
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,399
Understood?

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,079
Pass down the order.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,199
Starting today...

60
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,000
...this girl is not allowed to take Blackie out of the mansion.

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,800
If he gets lost...

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,839
...it's no trivial matter.

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Yes.

64
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you, Young Master.

65
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,920
But your servant is not dim-witted.

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
She won't get lost.

67
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,240
This young master is worried about...

68
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,120
...Blackie getting lost.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,519
Since Blackie is sick...

70
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,519
...then this young lady will take him...

71
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,360
...to see a doctor.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
What are you doing?

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,879
How dare you stop me!

74
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,240
Young Lady.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,920
Before the master left, he ordered...

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,199
...that you are not to leave the mansion casually.

77
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,079
This young lady needs to leave on official business.

78
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,439
The master specifically instructed...

79
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,040
...that even for official business, you cannot leave the mansion.

80
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,759
Fine, I won't go out then.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Be smarter from now on.

82
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,319
Be careful, or this young lady will throw you out.

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Blackie will stay in my room tonight.

84
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,600
You feed him later.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,079
Blackie.

86
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,160
Blackie, be good.

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:13,959
Eat.

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,800
Being naughty again, are we?

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360
Haven't seen you in a few days...

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
...and you've already sunk to being a maid in Meng Mansion.

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,079
Truly impressive.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,120
Your anger subsided quite quickly.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
It's rare to see you in a predicament.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,319
Naturally, I had to come see the show.

95
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,920
Let me tell you...

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
...I already know...

97
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,399
...when Blackie will meet his end.

98
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,560
Oh really?

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,680
You have that ability?

100
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,959
Look here.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,879
Blackie has a dark shadow between his brows.

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,240
His appetite isn't great either.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How could a black pig's brow *not* be black?

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
According to my intuition...

105
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,240
...Blackie's time of death is approaching.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
If nothing unexpected happens...

107
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,000
...it will be within the next few days.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
What "next few days"?

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,319
It's still a long way off.

110
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,680
Is that so?

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Then I'm relieved.

112
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
You're too cunning.

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,120
You actually tricked me into talking.

114
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,680
You're the only one allowed to trick me?

115
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,319
I'm not allowed to trick you back?

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,199
You...

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,839
Good luck to you.

118
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,399
Thanks.

119
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,399
Blackie.

120
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,199
Yuwen Xiu must be anxiously sending people to search for me everywhere.

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,399
Should I send him a message...

122
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,360
...to let him know I'm safe?

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,360
Big Brother!

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Young Master Xiu!

125
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,959
Big Brother! Young Master Xiu!

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,639
The lord is still sleeping.

127
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,040
Big Brother!

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
You mustn't...

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,759
Big Brother!

130
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,399
Big Brother!

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,959
Big Brother!

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,639
I was wrong!

133
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,399
Calm your anger!

134
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,879
I... Big Brother, please calm down!

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,199
I was wrong, I was wrong!

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,959
I...

137
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,639
Young Master Xiu.

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
It's not like you don't know...

139
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,959
...when the lord is sleeping...

140
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
...he dislikes being disturbed the most.

141
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,279
How could you forget?

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,079
I...

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,800
I was just anxious for a moment.

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,240
I just...

145
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,600
Big brother

146
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,720
I've looked everywhere

147
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,680
and couldn't find her anywhere.

148
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,360
Can the Fifth Princess survive outside the palace?

149
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,759
Will she have enough to eat and wear?

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,639
What if she encounters ruffians?

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,039
The world is a dangerous place.

152
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,559
She's just a delicate woman.

153
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,480
Big brother...

154
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,120
Please, help me out.

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,600
I sent word to the palace

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
saying A Lan would stay at my mansion for a couple of days

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
and return her after the Drunken Immortal Tavern opens.

158
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,159
That's how I covered it up for now.

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
If we still can't find her...

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
then... then I'm done for!

161
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,120
Alright, I'll help you this once.

162
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,639
This is the note received this morning.

163
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,759
Seventh Cousin,

164
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,759
guess where A Lan is hiding?

165
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
Did you find the person who delivered the note?

166
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,840
Give the order.

167
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,639
Have all Shadow Guards search for the Fifth Princess.

168
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,679
My lord,

169
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,039
since the Fifth Princess could send someone with a note,

170
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,840
it means she's at least safe for now.

171
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
There's no need

172
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
to mobilize all Shadow Guards, is there?

173
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Before tonight,

174
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,240
you must find the Fifth Princess.

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,759
Yes, sir.

176
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,639
Where are Ke Ren and Blackie?

177
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,480
Come here.

178
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,279
Let this young master give you a hug.

179
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,279
You seem to have gained a lot of weight lately.

180
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,879
Does the young master not like it?

181
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,639
It's good to be plump.

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,720
It feels nicer to the touch.

183
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,919
As long as the young master is pleased.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,200
Morals are declining,

185
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,960
and people's hearts are not what they used to be.

186
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
Meng Shaojue, in broad daylight,

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,279
right in front of Blackie, with Ke Ren...

188
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,279
What have you been eating lately

189
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,080
to get this fat?

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,080
The same as usual.

191
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know why I gained weight.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
Oh, he was talking about Blackie.

193
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,960
Who's there?

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,919
Young master!

195
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,519
It's you.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,759
So idle

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
that you come here to eavesdrop?

198
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,519
Young master!

199
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,000
You molested your servant!

200
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,120
With your looks,

201
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,519
what's there for this young master to molest?

202
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Young master,

203
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,399
it's time for Blackie's bath.

204
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,039
Let's go.

205
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,639
Brother!

206
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,399
I have important business outside the mansion today.

207
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,279
Can you talk to the guards for me?

208
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,480
They'll definitely listen to you.

209
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,120
What important business could you have?

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
The poetry book Father told me to copy is lost.

211
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm going to buy a new one.

212
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,399
I have several more in my room.

213
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,919
Go get one later.

214
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,919
Brother...

215
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,159
Young master,

216
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,919
the Chief Grand Secretary and the Fourth Princess have arrived.

217
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
What are they here for?

218
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,200
Young Master Meng.

219
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,399
The Chief Grand Secretary and I are here

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,039
to investigate the incident involving the assassin from the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

221
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,360
Were you at the Flying Immortal Pavilion that night,

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Young Master Meng? Did you notice anyone suspicious?

223
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,159
Think carefully.

224
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,840
Actually, yes.

225
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,080
Who?

226
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,720
Why, it's naturally the ruthless one

227
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
who wouldn't even spare a little black pig.

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,759
Chief Grand Secretary.

229
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
The Chief Grand Secretary is highly capable,

230
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,519
and a perfect match for the vicious, domineering Fifth Princess.

231
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,039
Truly a perfect pair.

232
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,879
Vicious and domineering?

233
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,240
Young Master Meng,

234
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
you mustn't speak carelessly.

235
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,000
Isn't that the truth?

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,480
For you to openly slander the Fifth Princess

237
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,679
is not appropriate, is it?

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
And meeting dance girls at the Flying Immortal Pavilion at night—

239
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,799
does the Chief Grand Secretary find that appropriate?

240
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,279
Meeting dance girls at night?

241
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,720
Since Young Master Meng has no useful information,

242
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,240
we shall take our leave.

243
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,639
Young Master Meng,

244
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,000
I heard your mansion has a

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,559
rare Sacred Fruit Tree from the southern mountains,

246
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,480
seen only once in a hundred years.

247
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,120
Could you show it to me?

248
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,759
Ke Ren, brother was just looking for you.

249
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,360
You should go quickly.

250
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Yes, miss.

251
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,399
Heaven helps me!

252
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,080
I didn't expect you to be so interested in the Sacred Fruit Tree.

253
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,799
Brother!

254
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,480
My lord,

255
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,559
this way, please.

256
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,120
Perhaps we should see the fruit tree another day.

257
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,240
We should focus on the investigation of the Flying Immortal Pavilion assassin first.

258
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,720
Imperial Sister,

259
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
a little delay won't hurt.

260
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,240
Yuwen Xiu!

261
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,200
Ouch!

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,399
Who's there?

263
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,799
Come out now!

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Must I personally invite you out?

265
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,480
Come here at once!

266
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,920
Yinglu!

267
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,759
Take that basket off.

268
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,880
Pay your respects to the Fourth Princess and the Chief Grand Secretary.

269
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,720
Brother,

270
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,279
I'm Ke Ren.

271
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,240
Brother,

272
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,880
I'm Ke Ren too.

273
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:31,920
Young Master Meng,

274
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,400
the people in your mansion are quite amusing.

275
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,359
Please excuse us, Fourth Princess.

276
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:40,960
Enough, Ke Ren.

277
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,200
Take the basket off.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,759
Hurry up and take it off!

279
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,960
Brother Blackie,

280
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,759
sorry about this.

281
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,519
Blackie ran away!

282
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,640
Go, hurry and catch Blackie!

283
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,119
Quickly!

284
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,960
My younger sister is mischievous.

285
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,960
Please excuse her.

286
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,359
Are you okay?

287
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,599
Why are you hiding in that vat with Blackie?

288
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,079
Quiet.

289
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,240
Blackie likes to sleep there.

290
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,599
What a dummy.

291
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
About me climbing the wall...

292
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,799
You mustn't tell anyone.

293
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,839
Understood?

294
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,559
Alright, alright.

295
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,640
Go find Blackie now.

296
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,039
Blackie.

297
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,079
Blackie.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,519
Blackie.

299
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Blackie.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,160
About meeting the dancer at night...

301
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,519
Elder Cousin.

302
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:01,880
What do you have to say?

303
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,839
You are currently engaged to A Lan.

304
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,400
Meeting a dancer at night...

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,160
Where does that leave A Lan?

306
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
It's not what you think.

307
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,759
A Lan is naive and innocent now.

308
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,559
If you, Elder Cousin, are a womanizer...

309
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,880
A philanderer who leaves a trail of broken hearts...

310
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,839
I will do everything in my power...

311
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,519
To stop your marriage to A Lan.

312
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,839
The Fourth Princess will not get that chance.

313
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,279
As for the others who were at the Flying Immortal Pavilion...

314
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
I'll trouble the Fourth Princess to investigate them.

315
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,319
Sir, how did it go?

316
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,519
The Meng Mansion is heavily guarded.

317
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,160
I'll come again tonight.

318
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,880
And the Fifth Princess?

319
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,799
Any news?

320
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,720
I had the Shadow Guards investigate.

321
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,640
We only know...

322
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
The Fifth Princess was last seen at Shunshun Gambling Den.

323
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,000
How many men did you send?

324
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,079
Don't worry about that, sir.

325
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,240
Just one.

326
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,880
One?

327
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,640
I've thought it over carefully.

328
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,359
Sir, you don't like the Fifth Princess.

329
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
And you're eager to cancel the engagement with her.

330
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,519
So how could you...

331
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,119
Truly care about the Fifth Princess's safety?

332
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,519
When you told me to mobilize all Shadow Guards...

333
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,359
That was merely...

334
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,880
Empty words for Young Master Xiu's benefit.

335
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,160
Rest assured, sir.

336
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I understand completely.

337
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,000
If there's still no news of the Fifth Princess by tonight...

338
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,599
You will depart for the Northern Territories.

339
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,039
This...

340
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,599
Sir...

341
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,160
The Northern Territories, they...

342
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,759
They're covered in snow year-round.

343
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Not suitable for someone as cold-averse as me.

344
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,799
Precisely because it's unsuitable, I'm sending you.

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,640
Sir!

346
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,599
Then...

347
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,519
Could the Fifth Princess...

348
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,359
Have gone to work as a maid in some mansion?

349
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,839
She's not actually foolish.

350
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,039
Why would she give up being a princess...

351
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,519
To be a maid?

352
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,279
Move this wine inside.

353
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,079
Right away!

354
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,759
Be careful!

355
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,960
Wipe this cleaner.

356
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,799
Got it!

357
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,119
Stop working.

358
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,039
Go home and rest.

359
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,160
Huh?

360
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,119
What's wrong, young master?

361
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,599
I'm in a bad mood.

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,559
I don't want to open.

363
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,599
But...

364
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,799
Seventh Cousin!

365
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,039
A Zi.

366
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,160
Everyone, stop working.

367
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,799
Go inside.

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,880
I was just on my way to investigate the Flying Immortal Pavilion incident.

369
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:34,960
And happened to pass by.

370
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,160
Is A Lan here?

371
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,359
I'll go see her.

372
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,839
A Lan is still sleeping.

373
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,559
Don't wake her.

374
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,160
Your tavern opens tomorrow, right?

375
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,119
Tell A Lan...

376
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
I'll be here tomorrow too.

377
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,119
Aren't you investigating the assassin?

378
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,000
It's fine if you don't come.

379
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,079
For my Seventh Cousin's tavern opening...

380
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Of course I must attend.

381
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,039
I have other matters, I must go.

382
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,039
Young master...

383
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,599
Are we still opening tomorrow?

384
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,759
Don't run!

385
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,160
Stop right there!

386
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,519
Blackie.

387
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,039
Blackie.

388
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,000
Blackie.

389
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,599
So it really is you.

390
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,400
In the dead of night...

391
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,599
What is Your Excellency doing?

392
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
In the dead of night...

393
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,559
What is the Fifth Princess doing?

394
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,519
I certainly didn't expect...

395
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
The Fifth Princess to become a maid at the Meng Mansion.

396
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,839
I didn't expect either...

397
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,759
Your Excellency to take up trespassing.

398
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,039
After not seeing you for a few days...

399
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,519
You've become quite sharp-tongued.

400
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,920
Your Excellency.

401
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:31,720
You mind your business.

402
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,400
I'll mind mine.

403
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,279
Why come to the Meng Mansion?

404
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,599
A twist of fate.

405
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,680
Just came to the Meng Mansion for fun.

406
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,759
Playing at being a maid.

407
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,319
The palace is so boring.

408
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,000
I...

409
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,279
Zi Xiu is sending people everywhere to look for you.

410
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:49,880
Later, I'll take you back to the palace.

411
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,759
I'll return on my own in a couple of days.

412
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I'd appreciate it if you didn't reveal my whereabouts.

413
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,319
The Meng Mansion is quite lively tonight.

414
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,000
Assassin!

415
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,079
There's an assassin!

416
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,359
Over here!

417
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,200
Quickly!

418
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,559
The assassin went that way!

419
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,160
This way, hurry!

420
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,000
The assassin outside, is he one of your men?

421
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,119
My men aren't that clumsy.

422
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,279
To be discovered so easily.

423
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,559
Could it be Prince Ning's men?

424
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,119
Your Excellency should hurry and figure out how to leave.

425
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,880
Young master!

426
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,039
The assassin is coming this way!

427
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,119
Quick!

428
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,599
Search the area!

429
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,759
Young master, the assassin is here!

430
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,279
He hasn't gone far!

431
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,880
Don't move.

432
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:30,759
Halt!

433
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,240
He's gone.

434
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,119
It's getting late.

435
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,880
Your Excellency should leave as soon as possible.

436
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,240
If you want to play,

437
00:26:59,359 --> 00:26:59,960
I promise you

438
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,720
I won't reveal your whereabouts for now.

439
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,279
If you haven't returned to the palace in three days,

440
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,920
I will forcibly bring you back.

441
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,920
After all, Meng Mansion is not as safe as the palace.

442
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,640
Fine, I understand.

443
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,359
Take care, my lord.

444
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
None of your business.

445
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
Your Highness, Meng Mansion is heavily guarded.

446
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,559
Barging in to search for the map would be unwise.

447
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
You may withdraw to tend to your wounds.

448
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,880
Yes.

449
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,839
It seems then

450
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
it's better to wait until Meng Shaojue's birthday

451
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
to infiltrate Meng Mansion and search for the map.

452
00:27:59,519 --> 00:27:59,920
My lord.

453
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,119
My lord.

454
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,720
I have failed in my duty.

455
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,279
I have yet to locate the Fifth Princess.

456
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,319
My lord.

457
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,440
Have you found the map?

458
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,559
It's fine. Have some tea first.

459
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,759
This tea,

460
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,160
I had someone replace the pot every half-stick of incense,

461
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,119
so you'd have a hot cup as soon as you returned.

462
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,480
Why are you still at the mansion so late?

463
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,079
Are you hungry, my lord?

464
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,799
I'll go to the kitchen to see if there's any food.

465
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,640
You can depart for the Northern Territories.

466
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,680
My lord...

467
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,839
I don't want to go.

468
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,480
I understand.

469
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,799
I'll go pack my things now.

470
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,680
The Fifth Princess has been found.

471
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:05,680
Really?

472
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:06,920
My lord!

473
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,079
Where is she?

474
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
Does that mean I don't have to go to the Northern Territories?

475
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Inform Zixiu

476
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,640
that the Fifth Princess has been found.

477
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,279
She is perfectly safe.

478
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,680
I will bring her back to the palace within three days.

479
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,519
I'll see to it immediately.

480
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:35,720
Brother.

481
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,920
I heard there was an assassin in the mansion last night.

482
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,279
What kind of assassin is so brazen

483
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,039
as to dare come to our Meng Mansion?

484
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,079
Brother,

485
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,440
leave this to me.

486
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,640
I'll go dig him out.

487
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,480
Finish copying this poetry collection first.

488
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,640
From now on, don't let this girl take care of Blackie.

489
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,480
Young Master.

490
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,559
Your servant enjoys taking care of Blackie.

491
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,039
That's right, brother.

492
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,599
Blackie seems to like her too.

493
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
What does a pig know about liking or disliking?

494
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,799
Blackie will stay in my courtyard from now on.

495
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:24,480
Keqing.

496
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,200
Yes.

497
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,759
That servant Shuncai still hasn't been found?

498
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
He truly has no conscience.

499
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,240
Brother treated him well,

500
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,440
yet he stole your dagger.

501
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,400
That was the last birthday gift

502
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,240
Mother gave you before she passed.

503
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,799
Shuncai stole the dagger,

504
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,599
so he'll surely pawn it.

505
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,240
Go check the major pawnshops.

506
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:00,480
Yes, Young Master.

507
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:06,200
Brother,

508
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,599
aren't you going to that place today...

509
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,559
the Drunken Immortal Tavern?

510
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,720
You want to go too?

511
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,960
Of course not!

512
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,039
I still have to copy the poetry collection.

513
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,000
Hurry up.

514
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
Miss.

515
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,759
Your servant doesn't want to leave the mansion.

516
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,279
Your servant wants to take care of Blackie.

517
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,519
Keep your voice down.

518
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,200
If we're discovered, we won't get out.

519
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,440
Hurry.

520
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,559
The guards will be back soon.

521
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,279
If you dare leak my affairs

522
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,200
like the other maids did,

523
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,200
this young lady will definitely throw you out.

524
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,759
Your servant will obey you in everything, Miss.

525
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:02,720
Let's go.

526
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,759
In all these years,

527
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,839
when have the Four Young Masters of Yunmi ever gathered?

528
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,440
Exactly!

529
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,920
How come the opening of the Drunken Immortal Tavern

530
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
can bring all Four Young Masters together?

531
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That's naturally because

532
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,440
the owner of the Drunken Immortal Tavern...

533
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,839
The Four Young Masters are here!

534
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,759
The Four Young Masters are here!

535
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,640
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

536
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,759
The Four Young Masters of Yunmi really have a grand presence.

537
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
Don't let brother find us.

538
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,480
Lord He.

539
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,079
Lord He.

540
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:11,680
Eldest Brother.

541
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,359
Fifth...

542
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,200
Will that thing really return to the palace in three days?

543
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,599
Mm-hmm.

544
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
When the Fourth Princess asks...

545
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,880
Don't worry, Eldest Brother.

546
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,240
Four Young Masters!

547
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,000
Young Master Xiu!

548
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
I wrote a poem for you!

549
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,319
Young Master Meng!

550
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,359
I wrote you a letter!

551
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,920
I wrote a letter too!

552
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,440
This is mine!

553
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,880
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

554
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
Lord He is indeed as the rumors say:

555
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,200
Majestic and peerless in the world.

556
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Miss Meng is actually a stan of He Lianchen.

557
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,039
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

558
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,000
Young Master Meng, this is my letter!

559
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,079
A Zi, you're here.

560
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,400
Where's A Lan?

561
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,200
A Lan? She knew Eldest Brother was coming today,

562
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
so she was too excited to sleep last night.

563
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,319
She only fell asleep this morning.

564
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,519
I really couldn't bear to wake her.

565
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:51,240
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

566
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
A Lan is so devoted to him,

567
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,799
yet he still meets with dancing girls at night.

568
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,599
What did you say?

569
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,279
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

570
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:56,799
Nothing.

571
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,079
Eldest Brother.

572
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,039
Brother Meng, Brother He.

573
00:33:59,279 --> 00:33:59,799
Go on.

574
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,880
Where did you come from? What are you doing?

575
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,440
Lord Yuwen!

576
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,159
This young lady didn't mean to!

577
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,559
If apologies were useful,

578
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,360
what would we need constables and bailiffs for?

579
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,599
Come, please.

580
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,320
Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master!

581
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,519
As expected of Lord He.

582
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Honorable and impartial.

583
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,039
Young lady.

584
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,800
The young master will find out.

585
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,360
We've changed our clothes and are wearing veils.

586
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,079
How would my brother find out?

587
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,840
Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master!

588
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,199
Thank you, everyone.

589
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,800
Today, my Drunken Immortal Tavern opens.

590
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,760
All food and drink are half price.

591
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,840
Great! Great! Great!

592
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,360
Come on in.

593
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,559
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!

594
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:07,960
Everyone.

595
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,039
Please, come inside.

596
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,639
You three, please.

597
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,639
Young master.

598
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,119
I just found out.

599
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,760
Yuwen Xiu specifically prepared for Meng Shaojue...

600
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,480
...a pot of wine.

601
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,599
I put the item in that pot of wine.

602
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,239
Last time, Meng Shaojue ruined my plans.

603
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,719
This time, I'll make him know...

604
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,440
...this young master's power.
