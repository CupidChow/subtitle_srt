1
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,680
The pattern on that medicine bottle is exquisitely crafted.

2
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,879
It shouldn't be the work of an ordinary artisan.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
I've already sent someone to investigate the totem.

4
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,079
Are you feeling unwell?

5
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,079
I told you earlier.

6
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

7
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,519
First, rendezvous with Royal Sister and the others.

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Rest for two days before seeking Qin Chi.

9
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,439
You just wouldn't listen.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
It's fine.

11
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,080
The mysterious person is in the shadows.

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
Finding Qin Chi must be done quickly.

13
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,199
Besides, Zi Xiu's injury still needs a few days of rest.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,599
Have some water.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,639
Did you pull on the wound?

16
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,080
Here.

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Let me feed you.

18
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,280
It's all wet.

19
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,120
My Lord.

20
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,960
This subordinate has ordered a message sent to inform Fourth Princess.

21
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,960
That you and Fifth Princess went to find Qin Chi first.

22
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,319
Understood.

23
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
A Zi, what are you looking at?

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
Cousin sent a letter.

25
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,520
What does the letter say?

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
We must gather all three Secret Keys.

27
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,719
To open the Secret Gate's Forbidden Ground.

28
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,479
Only then can we decipher the secrets of the Map of the Nine Provinces.

29
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,479
Now, Qing Chi's Secret Key is already in hand.

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,159
Two remain now.

31
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,759
They are in the hands of Qin Chi and Jian Chi, respectively.

32
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,719
He and A Lan went to find Qin Chi first.

33
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,599
Did he say where?

34
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,199
He didn't.

35
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,360
However, Cousin's letter says...

36
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,759
Qin Chi dislikes conflict.

37
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,280
The Secret Key shouldn't be hard to obtain.

38
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,399
You drink this medicine first.

39
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,240
A Zi.

40
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,360
Actually, my injury is already of little consequence.

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
This medicine...

42
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,959
I won't drink it.

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
No.

44
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,680
Then...

45
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,959
I'll wait for this medicine to cool before drinking it.

46
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
The doctor said...

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,439
Medicine must be drunk while hot.

48
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,680
But this medicine is very bitter.

49
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,079
Yes.

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,399
Good medicine is bitter to the taste.

51
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,160
A Zi.

52
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,959
Did you encounter a quack doctor?

53
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,240
After I finish this medicine...

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,480
I feel weak all over.

55
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,040
My limbs are stiff.

56
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,680
How can this be?

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,639
Could it be...

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
I misread the prescription?

59
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,519
A Zi.

60
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Next time, tasks like brewing medicine...

61
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
You should leave them to the attendants at Ren'an Tang.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,279
Is it really that bitter?

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,319
Opera scripts say...

64
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,439
There's another method to relieve bitterness.

65
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,079
Not enough.

66
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,959
A Zi.

67
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,439
I will never let you go.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,279
Candied hawthorn berries!

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,439
Come buy candied hawthorn berries!

70
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Sugar figurines! Come, have a taste!

71
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,600
Sugar figurines! Come, miss, take a look!

72
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,399
Thank you.

73
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,480
Hurry up.

74
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Is it good?

75
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,839
You try some.

76
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,240
Fresh watermelon!

77
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
Miss, my readings are very accurate!

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,560
No need.

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Wait for me a moment.

80
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll be right back.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,560
Your side hustle has even expanded to Dongyang City.

82
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
What side hustle?

83
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,759
This Drama Spirit has been waiting for you here for a long time.

84
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,000
Speak.

85
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,839
What is it?

86
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,639
I have good news to tell you.

87
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,279
What good news could you possibly have?

88
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,879
Congratulations.

89
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,480
The mission to save the immortal herb was successful.

90
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,720
Successful?

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Now, that Cold Epiphyllum Immortal Herb...

92
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
is growing quite vigorously.

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,240
No way.

94
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,079
A mere cutting can come back to life?

95
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,839
I can only say you're lucky.

96
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,360
I'd rather not have this damn luck.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,199
Since when has A Lan been interested in this?

98
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
Just playing around casually.

99
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,559
A very bad fortune, miss.

100
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,279
Your romantic fate...

101
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,679
You must look carefully.

102
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,080
The young master's reminder is correct.

103
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Upon this careful look...

104
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,519
This fortune is very auspicious!

105
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
Miss, in the future, you will surely have three husbands and four lords.

106
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,080
Your household will be harmonious!

107
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,440
Aren't you going to do something?

108
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
You brought this on yourself.

109
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,039
Let's go.

110
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,039
Three husbands and four lords...

111
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,879
Very happy.

112
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,320
What?

113
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,960
Are only you men allowed three wives and four concubines...

114
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
and we women not allowed three husbands and four lords?

115
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,919
Just think about it.

116
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,360
If the household is harmonious...

117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
Make way, make way!

118
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,759
I, Yuwen Rui...

119
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,279
in this life, will only grow old with one person.

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Heavens divine, earth divine!

121
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,360
Fortune-telling and divination, I'm the most accurate!

122
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,639
Yin Yang, Five Elements, ten divinations, nine accurate!

123
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,480
If not accurate, no charge!

124
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,159
My Lord.

125
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,360
This subordinate has not found Qin Chi's trail.

126
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,879
Only know that every year on this day, the qin masters of Dongyang City...

127
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,879
gather at the Elegant Lodge in the east city to meet friends through qin music.

128
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,080
Qin Chi is obsessed with the qin as if his life depends on it.

129
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,320
He is sure to appear.

130
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,039
Go wait for him to show up.

131
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,120
Let's go.

132
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,159
My Lord

133
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,919
Since we need to find three secret keys

134
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,559
to uncover the secret on the treasure map

135
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
Why don't I send someone to find Yuwen Rui

136
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,279
to see if we can learn where Qin Chi is?

137
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,639
No need.

138
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,000
Since Yuwen Rui has made the first move,

139
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,480
we'll let them do the dirty work

140
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,840
and then we'll be the ones to profit.

141
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,399
My Lord...

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,960
An Kezi trusts you completely now.

143
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,960
Why don't we use her life

144
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,480
to threaten Yuwen Rui? How dare you!

145
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,200
My Lord!

146
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,240
You cannot let personal feelings

147
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,759
hinder our great undertaking!

148
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,720
Since when do you get to

149
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,840
tell me what to do?

150
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,159
If you dare touch her,

151
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,879
don't blame me for being ruthless.

152
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,200
Do you understand?

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,759
This subordinate understands.

154
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,240
The secret key in Jian Chi's possession

155
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,679
must be obtained before Yuwen Rui gets it.

156
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,440
Yuwen Rui will eventually figure out

157
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,200
what the pattern on the medicine bottle means.

158
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,000
Notify our people in the palace to begin preparations.

159
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,759
It's time to reclaim the Map of the Nine Provinces.

160
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

161
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,279
This old master's skill is superb.

162
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,840
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

163
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,039
Truly marvelous! Absolutely wonderful!

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,799
Indeed.

165
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,720
Can you tell

166
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
who plays the qin best?

167
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,720
They're equally matched.

168
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,960
Qin Chi's qin skills are exceptional.

169
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
If he's among them,

170
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,919
he'll surely hide his true ability.

171
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
Why don't I give it a try?

172
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,960
Find a way to make him slip up.

173
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
In my opinion, this qin master plays best.

174
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
What do you know?

175
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,320
Young lady...

176
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,240
What are you...

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
I haven't eaten for days.

179
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,559
I'm feeling a bit weak.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
You still need to eat.

181
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,519
She can play the qin too?

182
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Look at her posture.

183
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,480
Everyone,

184
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
I, a humble woman, have traveled far,

185
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,679
and am now completely penniless.

186
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,639
Today, hearing you gather here to meet through music,

187
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,480
I thought to find a destined owner for this qin

188
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,279
to exchange for some silver.

189
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,720
This qin looks rather ordinary.

190
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,039
How much silver do you want for it, miss?

191
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,120
Ordinary?!

192
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,399
You...

193
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,000
You dare call this qin ordinary?

194
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,360
Do you know this qin is...

195
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,000
Could it be this qin has a story?

196
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,080
This qin...

197
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
This qin...

198
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,799
Forget it.

199
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,799
Today, I might as well tell you all.

200
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,559
Have any of you heard of

201
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,639
Shadow Gate's Qin Chi?

202
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,279
Qin Chi?

203
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:58,919
No, I don't know.

204
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,080
I've never heard of him.

205
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,679
Have you heard of him?

206
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,679
Shadow Gate... Qin Chi?

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
Who is Shadow Gate's Qin Chi?

208
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,799
Never heard of him in the jianghu.

209
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Well, that's to be expected.

210
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,080
This person is elusive

211
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,039
and extremely skilled at hiding his identity.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,320
It's normal you wouldn't know.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,799
This qin...

214
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,480
Could it be related to that Qin Chi?

215
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,840
This qin...

216
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,799
was Qin Chi's token of love to my aunt.

217
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,840
It's a family disgrace,

218
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,240
not fit for public airing.

219
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,879
But I'm truly at the end of my rope.

220
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,480
Years ago, Qin Chi pledged himself to my aunt.

221
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,200
But he left behind this ancient qin

222
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,559
and vanished without a word.

223
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,519
He didn't know...

224
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,759
my aunt...

225
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,879
had been...

226
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,399
waiting for him all this time!

227
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,360
She even carried his child for ten months and bore him a daughter!

228
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,200
This is truly absurd!

229
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,919
To think we have such a person among us!

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,639
For Qin Chi to act this way

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,919
is truly darn it!

232
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,039
Yes!

233
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,799
Too darn it!

234
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,799
Simply despicable!

235
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,759
He should be taught a lesson!

236
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,639
It's so infuriating!

237
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,000
My aunt just passed away early this year.

238
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,799
So I've been carrying this qin, searching for Qin Chi everywhere,

239
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,720
just to ask him on behalf of my late aunt

240
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,519
and my critically ill cousin:

241
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,799
"Do you still remember Xia Yuhe by the Daming Lake?"

242
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,919
For Qin Chi to love and then abandon her...

243
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,039
He's truly shameless!

244
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,039
Old sir,

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,240
don't you think that Qin Chi

246
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,519
is both callous and heartless?

247
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,039
My poor, critically ill cousin

248
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
still wishes to see her own father

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,279
one last time!

250
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,640
Calluses this thick...

251
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,799
Let's go.

252
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,359
Back home.

253
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,440
Miss,

254
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,759
did Qin Chi truly pledge himself to your aunt?

255
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,519
Your aunt had a hard life.

256
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,359
Indeed!

257
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,960
Let's beat him up!

258
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,839
Master!

259
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,720
There's really nothing!

260
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,279
Xia Yuhe by the Daming Lake!

261
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,359
That woman came for the secret key.

262
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,519
How many times must I say it?

263
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,839
I don't know her,

264
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,519
nor any Xia Yuhe!

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,079
Why such a big temper?

266
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,640
Master,

267
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,000
how did you know

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,359
they came for the secret key?

269
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,480
I received a letter from Qing Chi before.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,759
He said he'd already handed over his secret key

271
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,319
and revealed clues to the other two keys.

272
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,160
I didn't expect

273
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,519
them to find me so quickly.

274
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,720
It seems what's meant to come will come.

275
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,039
There's no hiding from it.

276
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,279
Oh, it's my wife.

277
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
What nonsense are you spouting here?

278
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,119
Now everyone outside is saying

279
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,559
you have a critically ill daughter.

280
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,839
If this is true,

281
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,839
I'll divorce you!

282
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,839
And that damn key!

283
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,160
Back then, because of it,

284
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,759
we almost lost our lives!

285
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Now you've forgotten the pain once the wound healed, haven't you?

286
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
You are right to scold me, my wife.

287
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,359
Absolutely right.

288
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,640
How many times have you promised me?

289
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,960
Let me tell you,

290
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,680
this time, no matter who comes,

291
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,359
you are not to get involved with this damn key!

292
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,039
Do you hear me?

293
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,640
Yes, yes.

294
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,160
Wife, my dear wife, rest assured.

295
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
I, your husband, swear

296
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,440
I will never let this thing worry you again.

297
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,640
And I absolutely will not

298
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,759
let anyone disrupt our peaceful life.

299
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,680
That's what you said.

300
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,440
If it happens one more time,

301
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,599
you pack your bags and get out!

302
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,319
Go find somewhere cool to stay!

303
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
I humbly obey my lady's command.

304
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,720
Then hurry up and make me some food!

305
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,359
That newly bought agarwood

306
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,640
is still waiting for you to make it into a zither.

307
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,440
You have too much free time!

308
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,319
What are you looking at?

309
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,559
Hurry up and leave!

310
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,079
Yes, Master.

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,839
From what I know,

312
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,559
this Qin Chi dislikes conflict,

313
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,200
but he is very stubborn.

314
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,880
It seems we can only succeed through wit this time.

315
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,519
My Lord.

316
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,079
That man is indeed the Qin Chi.

317
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,119
According to this subordinate's investigation,

318
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,160
the Qin Chi is henpecked.

319
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,359
The couple has been hiding in Dongyang City,

320
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,279
teaching the zither and students,

321
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,440
and staying out of worldly affairs for a long time.

322
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,119
Do you have an idea?

323
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,920
That depends on your skills, A Lan.

324
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,519
Me?

325
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,599
My wife!

326
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,440
Behold!

327
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,039
This divine craftsmanship!

328
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,599
How is my zither-making skill?

329
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,680
You're blowing your own horn to the heavens!

330
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,960
If it weren't for my painstaking efforts

331
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,079
to buy this agarwood back,

332
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,279
you, too, would be a skilled wife with no rice to cook!

333
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,680
Yes, yes.

334
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,559
Yes.

335
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,119
In this vast world,

336
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,119
only my wife loves her husband the most.

337
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,319
Heaven and Earth bear witness,

338
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,079
I will henceforth wash my hands and make soup,

339
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,519
keeping my wife away from trouble and strife,

340
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
bringing you joy every day.

341
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,079
Over here! Over here!

342
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,200
Master!

343
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,839
Master!

344
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,680
That girl from before brought someone with her!

345
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,440
This... what should we do?

346
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,519
This...

347
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,960
Didn't you tell me you were well hidden,

349
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,359
that they couldn't possibly find this place?

350
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,960
How was I to know they are this capable,

351
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,640
finding us so quickly?

352
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,319
You take that damn key right now

353
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:56,960
and throw it out for me!

354
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Make them leave immediately!

355
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,640
No, that won't do!

356
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,200
Madam!

357
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,680
This Secret Key was entrusted to me

358
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,440
by the leader on his deathbed.

359
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,160
How can I casually hand it over to others?

360
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,960
You, a recluse,

361
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,559
forget about those damn rules!

362
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,200
Forget about past loyalties!

363
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,160
This... this...

364
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,160
This is not acceptable.

365
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,839
You won't throw that scourge

366
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,039
out for me, is that it?

367
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Do you think you've lived too long, is that it?

368
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,839
Fine!

369
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,000
I'll give you a second choice.

370
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,359
You go out there yourself now

371
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,880
and persuade them to leave for me.

372
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,559
If, within half the time it takes to drink a cup of tea,

373
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,599
you cannot persuade them to leave,

374
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,799
do you remember what I told you?

375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,960
Say it!

376
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,839
One more time,

377
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,839
pack your bags and get out!

378
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:49,960
Master's wife!

379
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,319
Why go to such extremes?

380
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,440
Isn't this putting Master in a difficult position?

381
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,599
Who knows what other tricks

382
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,680
those two outside have up their sleeves?

383
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,440
If he doesn't cherish his own life,

384
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,839
why should I stand here worrying for nothing?

385
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,799
What are you still standing here for?

386
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,119
Go chase them away!

387
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,160
My wife...

388
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,359
This...

389
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,039
Go, go, go!

390
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:12,559
Master's wife!

391
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,920
Wife, and you too!

392
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,759
Listen to me!

393
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,759
Out!

394
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,880
Wife, let me tell you...

395
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,440
Master! Master! Are you alright?

396
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,160
My nose!

397
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,799
Master!

398
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,559
They're back again!

399
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:53,680
Master!

400
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,759
They all seem to have gone mad!

401
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,640
Hurry up and catch them all for me!

402
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,119
I'm going right now!

403
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,359
Over there! Over there!

404
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,359
Hurry!

405
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,440
Heaven strike them dead!

406
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,200
Who is behind this mischief?

407
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm going into labor!

408
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,720
They don't even spare people!

409
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,880
Truly ruthless to the extreme!

410
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
Heaven has sent down fiends!

411
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,119
Bringing calamity to this place!

412
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,680
This old man's integrity in his later years is ruined!

413
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,559
The demonic music backfired!

414
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,799
Master!

415
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,400
Your disciple is unfilial.

416
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,359
I... I must go first.

417
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,279
Disciple!

418
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,359
My disciple!

419
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,960
You actually stuffed cotton in there

420
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,920
You... you've gone too far

421
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,079
Senior Qin Chi

422
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,279
I've long heard of your great name

423
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,039
You... you...

424
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,839
You people

425
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,759
What deep-seated grudge do I have against you?

426
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,559
That you press me so relentlessly?

427
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,920
So vicious to this extent

428
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,480
How can you say that, sir?

429
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,119
I am your die-hard fan

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
That is, your admirer

431
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,920
I just wanted to pay you a visit

432
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Enough with the nonsense

433
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,680
Your purpose for coming here

434
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,839
I know perfectly well

435
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,119
Why put on an act?

436
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,279
Since that's the case

437
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,039
Sir

438
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,240
Let's get straight to the point

439
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
The thing we want, to you sir,

440
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,880
is just a piece of scrap metal

441
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,519
But to us,

442
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,240
it concerns the nation's rise and fall

443
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
and the people's peace

444
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,920
We hope you will oblige us

445
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
Moreover,

446
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,480
Hasn't your wife always

447
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,359
been worried about you getting involved in trouble again?

448
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,839
Hand over that thing

449
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,160
and it can also return to you two

450
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
peace and safety

451
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,920
This thing involves too much

452
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,880
If it falls into the hands of villains,

453
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,160
the consequences would be endless

454
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,480
How can I know if you two have ulterior motives,

455
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,640
harboring ill intentions?

456
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,599
I beg your pardon, but this old man cannot grant your wish

457
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,000
Please leave

458
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,559
No...

459
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,920
You get out too, Shimu

460
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,319
Shimu

461
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:03,839
My wife

462
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,640
My wife

463
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,519
Who is your wife?

464
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,359
From now on, you can live with that stupid key of yours

465
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,079
My wife, my wife

466
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,000
Shimu

467
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,839
Shifu

468
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,880
Shimu says the time of half a cup of tea has passed

469
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,079
Since you insist on keeping that thing

470
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,119
and cannot extricate yourself from trouble,

471
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,000
the only way is a letter of divorce

472
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,359
to settle things cleanly from now on

473
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,119
Shimu

474
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,079
Shimu

475
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,759
Oh, my wife

476
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,759
Why are you so heartless?

477
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,720
One day as husband and wife brings a hundred days of kindness

478
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,799
How decisive

479
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,400
Don't even need to go to the civil affairs bureau

480
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,400
Since it's come to this,

481
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,079
now that I'm all alone,

482
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,160
you can also forget about me handing over the secret key

483
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,400
This Qin Chi has quite a temper

484
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,880
Shifu

485
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,119
You still have me

486
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,240
Go, go, go away

487
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,880
Mr. Jiang

488
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,880
I have a way for you to return home

489
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,720
Shall we discuss a collaboration?

490
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,240
Shifu

491
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,480
What should we do?

492
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,880
I think that girl has a lot of clever ideas

493
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,279
Why not let them help us?

494
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,160
You want me to beg them?

495
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,799
I'd rather die

496
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,519
Then what should we do?

497
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,599
I've got it

498
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,119
Shifu

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,960
Do you remember when you first

500
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,640
proposed to Shimu?

501
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,960
How about this

502
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,920
They seem to have an idea

503
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,119
We'll see

504
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,279
There is a beauty, oh

505
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,799
Once seen, never forgotten

506
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,440
One day without seeing her, oh

507
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
I miss her like crazy

508
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,640
The phoenix soars high, oh

509
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,319
Searching the four seas for his mate

510
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:54,880
This...

511
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:55,599
This...

512
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,480
What's this for?

513
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,279
Shifu

514
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,200
The storybooks all say

515
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,720
If we walk in the snow together,

516
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
we'll grow old together in this life

517
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,279
There's no snow,

518
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
so we have to use goose feathers instead

519
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,160
If we walk in the snow together,

520
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,799
we'll grow old together in this life

521
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,680
That's actually a good omen

522
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,799
My wife

523
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,200
My wife

524
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,720
Mr. Jiang

525
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,359
Are you sure you don't need my help?

526
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,359
Two acres and three-tenths of land

527
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,240
cannot compare to your unwavering devotion

528
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,039
From now on, I can only address you as "you" respectfully

529
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,440
Because you are in my heart

530
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,519
The Qixi Festival fireworks are very loud,

531
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,559
but not as much as I miss you

532
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,759
Dongyang City is actually trending

533
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,799
corny pick-up lines

534
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,039
Shifu

535
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,720
These sweet nothings

536
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,519
I gathered them from various popular

537
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,000
storybooks

538
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,480
When Shimu sees them,

539
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,279
she'll definitely be overjoyed

540
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,279
She's coming out

541
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,039
My wife

542
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,559
My wife

543
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,880
You finally agreed to...

544
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
What disgusting things did you write?

545
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,279
My wife

546
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:18,680
This...

547
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,480
Shifu

548
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,480
If all else fails,

549
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,960
let's use the final move

550
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,559
Shimu

551
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,359
Shifu says

552
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,880
if you don't open the door,

553
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,400
he will kneel outside

554
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,960
and never get up

555
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,440
If he wants to kneel, let him kneel

556
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,839
Shimu

557
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,400
Shifu is physically weak

558
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
He... he can't kneel for long

559
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,880
Shifu, please get up

560
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,440
Where did you find this washboard?

561
00:32:59,079 --> 00:32:59,720
Shifu

562
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,160
Why... why are you doing this?

563
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,279
It seems Qin Chi truly is devoted to his wife

564
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,440
We'd better think of another way

565
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,480
Look

566
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,279
Shifu

567
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,039
For you

568
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,599
Master

569
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,640
Have some water.

570
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,359
If you faint,

571
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,400
Shimu will be heartbroken.

572
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,200
What an actor.

573
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,680
Master.

574
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,599
Please get up.

575
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,160
Look at you,

576
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,960
your face is all red.

577
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,519
If you faint,

578
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,279
Shimu will be heartbroken.

579
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,359
Quick, quick, quick!

580
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:55,839
Quick!

581
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,839
Master!

582
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
Wake up, Master!

583
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,559
Master, how could you faint, old man?

584
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,599
What's wrong, old man? Master!

585
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,440
Hurry, help your master inside!

586
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,440
Here.

587
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:10,960
Master.

588
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,039
Come on.

589
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:12,679
Take it slow.

590
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,400
You said you recently found a

591
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,320
long-lost, peerless qin score.

592
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,840
That's right.

593
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,840
I originally wanted to use this peerless score

594
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,559
to make a deal with Qin Chi.

595
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,599
But Qin Chi was unwilling.

596
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,639
This thing is useless to us now.

597
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,679
What a pity.

598
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,360
Destroy it.

599
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,679
What are you standing there for?

600
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,719
Help your master inside!

601
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,920
Master?

602
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,599
You...

603
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,039
It really is a peerless score?

604
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,760
You...

605
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,880
You all...

606
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
You wretched old man!

607
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,480
How dare you trick me!

608
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,519
My wife!

609
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:54,519
I...

610
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,440
Get out of here!

611
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,800
If I ever let you back in this house,

612
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
I'll take your surname!

613
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,320
My wife!

614
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,519
My wife!

615
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,039
My wife!

616
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,800
My wife!

617
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,360
I...

618
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,519
Oh, my wife!

619
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,280
Oh, my wife!

620
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,440
Mr. Jiang,

621
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,679
we'll help you.
