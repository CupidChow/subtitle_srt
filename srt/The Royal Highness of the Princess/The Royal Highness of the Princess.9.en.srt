1
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,920
Where on earth has Grand Preceptor Meng hidden the painting?

2
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,039
Why is A Lan receiving treatment at your villa?

3
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,719
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
The miracle doctor your servant found

5
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,080
has a peculiar temperament.

6
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
He is accustomed to living in the mountains and forests.

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
My elder brother and I discussed it

8
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,560
and decided to send A Lan to his villa in the capital's outskirts.

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,599
So the miracle doctor could properly examine A Lan.

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Your servant did not know if that miracle doctor

11
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,759
could cure the Fifth Princess.

12
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,159
Therefore, I did not inform Your Majesty,

13
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
to avoid causing you worry.

14
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,719
So, has this miracle doctor examined A Lan?

15
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
What did he say?

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,879
He is adjusting the prescription.

17
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,360
We will know the result in a few days.

18
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,960
Report to me promptly if there is any news.

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,080
Yes.

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,000
By the way,

21
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,560
what happened when Fourth Princess left the palace yesterday?

22
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,520
Why did she suddenly ask me to carefully reconsider

23
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,080
your marriage to A Lan?

24
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,479
The Fourth Princess has some misunderstandings about your servant.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,439
Is that so?

26
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,280
She didn't give any reason.

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,879
I was wondering

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,719
if you are unwilling to marry A Lan.

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,439
Tell me honestly.

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,759
Regarding the marriage to A Lan,

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,159
what are you truly thinking?

32
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,280
The marriage contract with the Fifth Princess

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
was a decree from the late Empress Dowager.

34
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,800
It cannot be canceled arbitrarily.

35
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,479
Your servant will certainly obey the Empress Dowager's final wish.

36
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,719
My ten thousand taels are saved!

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,439
More wine!

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,680
Those flowers over there need watering too.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Bear with it. Just think of it as tending to a pig.

40
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,399
Can you read?

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,639
I know a few characters.

42
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:40,920
Read it.

43
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,439
Why aren't you reading?

44
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,839
Young Master...

45
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,839
This servant girl doesn't recognize all the characters.

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,319
It's fine.

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,240
If you can't read a word,

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,279
just skip it.

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,040
For the ones I don't know,

50
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,120
I can make something up.

51
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,319
He lifted her...

52
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,759
skull.

53
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,079
He grabbed her neck.

54
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,959
He bent down... something... something bone.

55
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,560
He took apart her bones.

56
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,519
Enough.

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,439
Get out.

58
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,360
Yes, yes.

59
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,040
My lord.

60
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,319
Lord Zhang's wife, children, and family have now arrived in Danzhou.

61
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,680
Tell them to act cautiously

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,160
and not to leak any information.

63
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,480
Understood.

64
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,680
How much longer are you going to eavesdrop?

65
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
My lord is indeed as ruthless as the rumors say.

66
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,399
You actually intend to wipe out Lord Zhang's entire family.

67
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,759
As the saying goes, punishment should not extend to the family.

68
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,800
How can you sleep soundly at night

69
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,399
after doing something like this?

70
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,959
In your heart,

71
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,079
am I such a ruthless person?

72
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,079
Aren't you?

73
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,399
Everyone says so.

74
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,319
Besides, I saw it with my own eyes back then—

75
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,319
you killed Lord Zhang.

76
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,839
Princess!

77
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,399
Lord Zhang was not killed by my lord.

78
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,319
What actually happened that day was this:

79
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,439
Lord Zhang had already been poisoned by Prince Ning.

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
It was he who, before dying, begged my lord

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,839
to escort his wife, children, and family back to their hometown.

82
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,439
You should have said so earlier!

83
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,839
You made me misunderstand you.

84
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,639
My lord, please forgive me.

85
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,800
Please forgive me.

86
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,879
Sit down and talk.

87
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
I never thought my lord would escort

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Lord Zhang's family back to their hometown.

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I didn't expect

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,399
my lord to have such a side.

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,319
What?

92
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,240
Afraid I poisoned it?

93
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,160
I still need to help you find the map.

94
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,319
Why would I poison you?

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,079
You haven't found the map yet, have you?

96
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
The Meng residence is so vast.

97
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Finding the map isn't that easy.

98
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,120
The Fourth Princess asked about you in the palace today.

99
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,439
She seemed not to believe you are receiving treatment at my villa.

100
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,680
Write her a letter.

101
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,000
Say that you are safe and well.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
I've lost my memory.

103
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,759
I can't even write properly anymore.

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,519
I'll do it myself.

105
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,799
I don't want to help you either.

106
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,000
It's just that your handwriting...

107
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,440
Who can read it?

108
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:36,720
Big! Big! Big!

109
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,559
Open!

110
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,360
Big! Big! Big!

111
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,879
I won! I won!

112
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,440
I won again!

113
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm just lucky.

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,960
Young Master Xiu,

115
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:50,679
do you still want to play?

116
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,679
Young Master Xiu's luck isn't good today.

117
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,080
Let's play another day, another day.

118
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,320
You guys play, you guys play.

119
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,519
Come on, alright, alright.

120
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,159
We'll play, we'll play.

121
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,240
Continue, continue!

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,399
Come on, come on!

123
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,279
Who are you?

124
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,519
Me.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Go back to the Drunken Immortal Inn now.

126
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,759
How much did you win from him?

127
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,720
You must return it all to him

128
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,360
and apologize to him.

129
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,039
I won the money fair and square.

130
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,559
Why should I return it?

131
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,159
Fair and square?

132
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
I... I'll return it.

133
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,519
I'll return it, okay?

134
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,919
I'll go return it right now.

135
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,480
We've almost turned the entire Meng residence upside down.

136
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,840
Where on earth is the Map of the Nine Provinces hidden?

137
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,360
Xiao Hei!

138
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:16,799
Xiao Hei!

139
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:25,519
Big! Big! Big!

140
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:25,799
Open!

141
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,440
Big! Big!

142
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,879
Serves you right for cheating earlier!

143
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,799
Now you're losing badly, aren't you?

144
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,519
Come on, again!

145
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,200
Come on!

146
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,399
Come on, come on! Continue, continue!

147
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,000
Still playing?

148
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm still betting!

149
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,200
Open

150
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,000
Mine

151
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,840
Mine, mine

152
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,639
Won again

153
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Xiao Hei

154
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,919
Xiao Hei

155
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Xiao Hei

156
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,720
Autumn Water Garden

157
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,559
Xiao Hei

158
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,159
Xiao Hei

159
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,159
Xiao Hei

160
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,879
A Lan

161
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,480
What are you doing here?

162
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,919
The young lady is looking everywhere for you.

163
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,039
I'm looking for Xiao Hei.

164
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,679
Why did you come over here again?

165
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,759
Have you forgotten about last time,
when you broke a vase

166
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,519
and almost got kicked out by the master?

167
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,559
But Sister Ren,

168
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,759
this room is

169
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,960
the Autumn Water Garden where the master used to live.

170
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,159
After the mistress passed away,

171
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,159
he moved to the West Garden.

172
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,159
Keep a closer eye on Xiao Hei from now on.

173
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
Don't let it run over here again.

174
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,440
The master is very fond of this room.

175
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,320
He still comes to stay here from time to time.

176
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,919
Let's go.

177
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,080
Big, big, big!

178
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,639
Mine!

179
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,720
I won, I won, I won!

180
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,360
It's all mine!

181
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,240
Don't cheat anymore, okay?

182
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,279
I'm done, I'm done playing.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,440
Someone!

184
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,519
Take it away.

185
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,600
A Zi

186
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,679
You came today

187
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,320
surely not just

188
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,639
to watch me play dice with them?

189
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
A Lan is at Eldest Cousin's place.

190
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,679
I'm worried.

191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,960
Come with me to check on her.

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
What's there to worry about?

193
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,240
Oh, right.

194
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,879
Eldest Brother asked me to give you this.

195
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,200
A letter from A Lan to you.

196
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,960
Take a look.

197
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm still concerned about A Lan's condition.

198
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,080
It wouldn't hurt to go see her.

199
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,200
Let's go.

200
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,639
Eldest Brother's villa is quite far from here.

201
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,039
Let's have something to eat before we go.

202
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,879
Someone!

203
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
Prepare some wine and food.

204
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,000
This is the finest wine from our Drunken Immortal Inn.

205
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Cheers!

206
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,639
A Zi,

207
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,960
try this.

208
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
It's the signature dish of the Drunken Immortal Inn.

209
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,919
What's wrong, A Zi?

210
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,519
My head feels a bit dizzy.

211
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,679
How is this the One-Cup Knockout?

212
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:31,919
Someone!

213
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:33,799
What's going on?

214
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,919
Why was the wrong wine served?

215
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,039
This...

216
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,399
A Zi?

217
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:38,840
Young Master?

218
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,919
Why did you give Fourth Princess the One-Cup Knockout?

219
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,279
Go on, get out of here.

220
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,639
Young Master Xiu,

221
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,000
should we brew some sobering soup for Fourth Princess?

222
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,639
That won't be necessary.

223
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,359
This Young Master Meng really has too much time on his hands.

224
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,799
Go investigate A Lan's background.

225
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,039
Yes.

226
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,279
She is quite interesting, though.

227
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,119
This isn't it either.

228
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,519
Brother said you have sleepwalking.

229
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,200
The young master saw it.

230
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,640
Lock your door when you sleep from now on.

231
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,480
Understand?

232
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,119
That's strange.

233
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,240
Why isn't it here?

234
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,880
Young Lady.

235
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,799
Commander He's surname is also He.

236
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,599
Anyone could be that little thief.

237
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,440
Except for Commander He.

238
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,960
Why?

239
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,480
Commander He is a man of integrity.

240
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Open and upright.

241
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,279
How could he do something as sneaky as that?

242
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,440
Young Lady.

243
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Xiao Hei ran to the Autumn Water Garden yesterday.

244
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,920
I know.

245
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
Xiao Hei likes it there.

246
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Even if it likes it, it's not allowed to go there.

247
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,160
If Father finds out,

248
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:31,960
he'll lecture us again.

249
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,599
A Lan, keep an eye on Xiao Hei.

250
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:35,720
It's fine.

251
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,079
Brother has already had the room locked.

252
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
Xiao Hei won't be able to go even if it wants to.

253
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,680
Ru Feng.

254
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,160
My lord.

255
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:00,799
What time is it?

256
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,680
Right now,

257
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,119
it's 6:45 p.m.

258
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:09,839
To the Meng residence.

259
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:11,960
Yes.

260
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,839
Where did Meng Shaojue put the key?

261
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,680
Young Master.

262
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,839
I've already inquired.

263
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,200
He said he met A Lan on the street.

264
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,079
Seeing her father had died, he gave her some silver.

265
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,599
And had her come to our residence.

266
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,359
What are you doing on my bed?

267
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,880
The storybooks say

268
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
maidservants are to warm the young master's bed.

269
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
It's getting late.

270
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,559
It really is time to rest early.

271
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,079
Come help me.

272
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Continue.

273
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,559
Young Master.

274
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
This servant remembered something.

275
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:50,960
Speak.

276
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,319
Xiao Hei just relieved itself.

277
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,160
And then?

278
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,319
This servant helped clean Xiao Hei.

279
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,480
This servant didn't wash her hands.

280
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,799
Go back and rest.

281
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,000
What does Young Master Meng mean?

282
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,359
Ru Feng.

283
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,759
Lord Yuwen.

284
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,079
Lord Grand Secretary.

285
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,039
I already said my young master is not available to receive guests.

286
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Why are you forcing your way in?

287
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,599
My lord, does this count as trespassing?

288
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
The matter is urgent.

289
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,559
I had no other choice.

290
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,160
Go pour some tea.

291
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,359
I'd like to see

292
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,559
what urgent matter you have, my lord.

293
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,559
Speak.

294
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Lord Yuwen has come to my Meng residence.

295
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,359
For what purpose?

296
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Has Grand Preceptor Meng sent any letters home recently?

297
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,920
What is it?

298
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
It's nothing of great importance.

299
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,599
I'm merely asking when the Grand Preceptor will return.

300
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
My lord is quite concerned with my father's whereabouts.

301
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,960
His Majesty is waiting for the Grand Preceptor to return to establish the Academy of Letters and Virtue.

302
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,119
Lord Yuwen barges into my Meng residence.

303
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,359
Is it just for this matter?

304
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,039
The Academy of Letters and Virtue concerns the numerous students of Yunmi.

305
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,599
Such an important matter.

306
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,279
Naturally, I must be attentive to it.

307
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,680
Lord Yuwen is truly dedicated to the state and its people.

308
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
That is how an official should be.

309
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,480
The tea has gone cold.

310
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,319
Would my lord like more tea?

311
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,039
That won't be necessary.

312
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,160
I have urgent business to attend to.

313
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,599
A Lan.

314
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,759
See our guest out.

315
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,119
Young Master Meng.

316
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,240
Where did this dagger come from?

317
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,920
A gift from someone I cherish.

318
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,480
What's wrong?

319
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
Nothing, nothing.

320
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,720
It's fine, it's fine.

321
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,640
My lord.

322
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
At 6:45 p.m., I was busy looking for the map.

323
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,759
That's why I forgot to go find you.

324
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Aside from this matter,

325
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,319
does the Fifth Princess have nothing else to say to me?

326
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,640
Oh, right.

327
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,000
Meng Shaojue has probably already realized I'm pretending to be foolish.

328
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,039
But don't worry, my lord.

329
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
He hasn't exposed me.

330
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,400
So I'll keep pretending.

331
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,039
Until I find the treasure map for you.

332
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,839
That dagger was you who gave it to Meng Shaojue.

333
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,279
You could say so.

334
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,559
If I'm not mistaken,

335
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
it's exactly the one I won at the auction.

336
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,200
Didn't you not want it anymore, my lord?

337
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,160
So it conveniently fell into my hands.

338
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,880
And then you gave it to Meng Shaojue.

339
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,759
Fifth Princess.

340
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,519
Our engagement has not yet been canceled.

341
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,160
In name,

342
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
you are still my betrothed.

343
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,359
Rest assured, my lord.

344
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,400
Once I return to the palace,

345
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll immediately find a way to cancel our engagement.

346
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,400
I told you to find the map.

347
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
I didn't tell you to use any honey trap.

348
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,799
Honey trap?

349
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,440
My lord.

350
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,640
Are you saying...

351
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
that I also count as a beauty?

352
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
I'm kindly reminding you.

353
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,799
Don't do anything that damages my reputation.

354
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Otherwise, what you'll have to worry about

355
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,240
won't just be Xiao Lizi.

356
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,440
My lord.

357
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,799
Why did Young Master Meng say

358
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,319
that dagger was a gift from someone he cherishes?

359
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,519
Your servant understands.

360
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,480
After the Fifth Princess picked up the dagger,

361
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,440
she gave it to Young Master Meng.

362
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,599
She must have fallen for Young Master Meng.

363
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,519
And Young Master Meng also has feelings for the Fifth Princess.

364
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,640
No wonder the Fifth Princess sneaked into the Meng residence.

365
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,039
So that's how it is.

366
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,440
I dare bet

367
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,640
she must have had her eye on Young Master Meng for a long time.

368
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,160
Bet what?

369
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,920
Bet what?

370
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
If your servant loses the bet,

371
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,599
according to Shadow Guard rules,

372
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,799
I'll wear women's clothing

373
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,160
and spar with everyone in the residence.

374
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Since when did the Shadow Guard have such a rule?

375
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:02,799
Yes.

376
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,079
What are you standing around for?

377
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,039
Grind the ink.

378
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,359
Meng Shaojue wouldn't keep the key on his person, would he?

379
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,279
A Lan.

380
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,279
A Lan.

381
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:42,319
Young master.

382
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:46,039
What did I just say?

383
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,680
In a few days, it will be my birthday.

384
00:27:59,319 --> 00:27:59,920
A Lan.

385
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
What are you planning to give me?

386
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,119
This servant has no money.

387
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
Could it be in his belt?

388
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,160
Young master!

389
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,720
You're harassing this servant!

390
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,960
You're the one harassing me.

391
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,480
This servant wouldn't dare.

392
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,759
You still say you wouldn't dare?

393
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,440
It's dirty.

394
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,000
It's smudged.

395
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,039
Someone!

396
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,200
Prepare water.

397
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,440
Come here.

398
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,039
Young master.

399
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,759
The storybooks say

400
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,599
men and women must keep their distance.

401
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,240
The storybooks also have

402
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,319
stories of maids and young masters living happily ever after.

403
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,640
Haven't you heard?

404
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,519
Hurry up and come here.

405
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,200
You just wait.

406
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,839
A fool.

407
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,559
can also be shy.

408
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,160
Young master.

409
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,640
This servant thinks...

410
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,440
This servant thinks...

411
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,079
Young master's skin is so fair.

412
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,279
It smells nice too.

413
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
I wonder if it feels...

414
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,279
smoother than an egg.

415
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,079
Young master.

416
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,279
Can this servant touch...

417
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Wait a moment.

418
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,480
Then, should we wipe your chest?

419
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
You... you should leave.

420
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,759
Alright.

421
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,920
Young master.

422
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,559
This servant will come back later.

423
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,400
Don't forget the birthday gift.

424
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,839
Understood, young master.

425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
Xiao Hei.

426
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,519
Xiao Hei.

427
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:03,799
Xiao Hei.

428
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,519
Eldest Cousin.

429
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,359
How has A Lan been recently?

430
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,079
The Miracle Doctor said

431
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,640
she can be visited in two days.

432
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,400
Don't worry, A Zi.

433
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,640
A Lan will be fine.

434
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,200
Then I'll go to your villa the day after tomorrow to see her.

435
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:40,839
The day after tomorrow won't work.

436
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,960
The day after tomorrow is Meng Shaojue's birthday.

437
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
Eldest Brother is going with me.

438
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,480
Eldest Cousin is also going.

439
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,599
Eldest Brother.

440
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,079
Shao Jue is actually a gentleman worth befriending.

441
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,799
You'll know once you spend more time with him.

442
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,039
I have something to attend to, I must go.

443
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,519
Eldest Cousin and Young Master Meng have never gotten along.

444
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,840
Why do you want to go to his birthday banquet?

445
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,920
Last time I went to the Meng residence with Eldest Cousin,

446
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,880
I thought he was acting a bit strange.

447
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,880
I see.

448
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,000
The day after tomorrow, I'll go to the Meng residence with you.

449
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,039
My lord.

450
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,360
The fake map has been swapped.

451
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,639
My lord.

452
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,679
We have an agreement.

453
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,119
Xiao Lizi, you must not touch him again.

454
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,239
Do you really think

455
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
I would kill Xiao Lizi?

456
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:04,519
Your Majesty

457
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,599
has covered for you long enough.

458
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,599
It's time for you to leave the Meng residence.

459
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,119
When the time comes, I will return naturally.

460
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,800
My lord.

461
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,639
The map has now been swapped.

462
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,880
What do you plan to do next?

463
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,440
Knowing too much is not good for you.

464
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,639
I already know more than enough.

465
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,719
One more thing won't make a difference.

466
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,239
The fake map has been poisoned.

467
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,719
The day after tomorrow, just let Prince Ning's men steal it.

468
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,679
Then I... I...

469
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,639
Don't worry.

470
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,760
Your poison was just neutralized.

471
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,280
Then, my lord,

472
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
the day after tomorrow is Meng Shaojue's birthday.

473
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,199
I'm worried

474
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,320
Young Master Meng is highly skilled in martial arts.

475
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,199
That's not for you to worry about.

476
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,880
My concern is for Miss Meng Yinglu.

477
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,280
My lord,

478
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,119
could you

479
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,679
send someone to protect her?

480
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,639
Commander He will also be going.

481
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,320
I've put him in charge of this matter.

482
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,800
If there's nothing else,

483
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,639
I'll take my leave now.

484
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,719
I lied to Meng Shaojue, saying

485
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,480
I went out to buy him a birthday gift.

486
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,639
I need to go buy something quickly.

487
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:11,679
That dagger

488
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,119
is worth ten thousand taels.

489
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,599
My lord.

490
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,199
That dagger was the last birthday gift

491
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,719
his mother gave him before she passed.

492
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,599
It was a gift from Meng Shaojue's mother.

493
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,440
You were the one who found the dagger.

494
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,679
You can take it.

495
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:34,760
Thank you, my lord.

496
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,400
However,

497
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,760
one thing for another.

498
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,400
What will you give me in return?
