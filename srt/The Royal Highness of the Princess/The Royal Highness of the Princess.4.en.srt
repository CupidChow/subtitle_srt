1
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,439
Fifth Princess

2
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,879
Don't move.

3
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
The Fifth Princess is so obedient.

4
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,360
What if A Lan disobeys?

5
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,879
Disobey?

6
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
Then it's a dead end.

7
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,439
Eldest Cousin will teach you archery.

8
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,080
Hurry up.

9
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,599
Prince Ning's token.

10
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,400
You scared away my rabbit.

11
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
This will come at a price.

12
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,280
Eldest Cousin...

13
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
A Lan wouldn't dare.

14
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Don't be afraid.

15
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,879
Just pretend it's a rabbit.

16
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,160
I'll go check.

17
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,959
What are you doing here?

18
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,360
People sent by Prince Ning.

19
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,920
I sensed movement from Prince Ning's faction.

20
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,240
I came specifically to investigate.

21
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,680
Unexpectedly, I ended up saving your life, Lord Zhang.

22
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
You would be so kind?

23
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
I am certainly not a kind-hearted person.

24
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
The black-clad men will catch up soon.

25
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,600
Lord Zhang should worry about himself.

26
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
What will it take for you to save me?

27
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,079
That depends on what Lord Zhang offers me.

28
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,879
Wait.

29
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,199
Wait.

30
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,680
The assassin who infiltrated the Benevolent Heart Hall is named Shadowless.

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
He was sent by Prince Ning.

32
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,439
Prince Ning sent someone into the Benevolent Heart Hall

33
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,279
to steal the Map of the Nine Provinces.

34
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,360
On the fifteenth of this month,

35
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,639
Prince Ning will secretly meet

36
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,839
with Shadowless at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

37
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,040
At that time,

38
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,639
Lord Zhang...

39
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,120
Come.

40
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,759
Yes, yes.

41
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,439
It was Prince Ning who poisoned me.

42
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,720
In return for all I've told you,

43
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,560
I beg you to send my wife and child

44
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,079
back to Danzhou.

45
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,160
One more thing.

46
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,399
Back then, your... your father...

47
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,639
Your... your mother...

48
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,360
Bury him.

49
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,759
E-Eldest Cousin...

50
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,879
D-Did I hit it?

51
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,959
Did the Fifth Princess enjoy herself?

52
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,439
Good that she's happy.

53
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,240
He really did discover I was pretending to be foolish.

54
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,279
The outing was a pretense.

55
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,480
Ambushing Lord Zhang, and warning me in passing,

56
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,519
was his true purpose.

57
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,680
This man is cunning and treacherous.

58
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,079
Stay as far away from him as possible.

59
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,079
You've come.

60
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,600
The Map of the Nine Provinces is not in the palace.

61
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,839
It might be in the Meng residence.

62
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,039
You can send someone to investigate.

63
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,919
How do you know the map is at the Meng residence?

64
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,559
Your Highness and I are grasshoppers tied to the same string.

65
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,919
There's no need for Your Highness to doubt me.

66
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
It's not that I don't trust you.

67
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,039
Commander He!

68
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:12,919
Something terrible!

69
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,960
The Princess is missing!

70
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,559
What?!

71
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
Leave no place in the palace unchecked.

72
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,840
We must find the Fifth Princess quickly.

73
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,240
Alright.

74
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Go quickly.

75
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,879
Yes.

76
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
This servant deserves death.

77
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,639
This servant deserves death.

78
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
Is Your Excellency looking for the Fifth Princess?

79
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,440
This servant just saw

80
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,080
the Fifth Princess heading towards the Cold Palace.

81
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,039
You may leave.

82
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,679
Princess, are you alright?

83
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm fine, I'm fine.

84
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,320
Princess...

85
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,679
Why are we trapping Commander He?

86
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,840
Trust me.

87
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,720
The less you know,

88
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,000
the better for you.

89
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,080
That's...

90
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,759
Tonight at Xu hour, Luo Jie River, Flying Immortal Pavilion.

91
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,039
Have you found Commander He?

92
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,679
No.

93
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,360
Keep looking.

94
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,279
Commander He...

95
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't blame me.

96
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm doing this all to save you.

97
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,639
Princess...

98
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,600
Do you think that dry well can hold Commander He?

99
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,720
Of course it can.

100
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,720
Don't forget,

101
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
the huge rock on that well

102
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,159
was moved by the three of us

103
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,759
using all our strength.

104
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,159
Even if the rock is moved,

105
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,080
Commander He is also under a special sedative.

106
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,759
Unless he receives some major shock,

107
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,480
otherwise,

108
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,679
he'll be unconscious for at least a day and night.

109
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,919
Rest assured.

110
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,799
A Lan used to love grapes this much too.

111
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,639
I don't like them.

112
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,600
I hate them.

113
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,759
Lost her mind.

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like she became a different person.

115
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,919
Becoming someone else is fine.

116
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,279
The way she is now

117
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
is much more pleasing to the eye.

118
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,159
The little fool is here again, mooching food off A Zi.

119
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,799
Mosquito!

120
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,360
Trying that trick again? I...

121
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,399
Fourth Sister!

122
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,519
Seventh Cousin!

123
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,080
Did you come today to see Her Majesty the Empress?

124
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

125
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,960
Her Majesty wanted delicacies from the Gourmet Pavilion.

126
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,799
So I brought some over.

127
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,759
By the way,

128
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,919
there are fireworks at Luo Jie River tonight.

129
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
I'll take you both to see them.

130
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,679
A Lan won't go.

131
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,159
Fourth Sister and Seventh Cousin should go.

132
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,399
You...

133
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,960
Even in ancient times,

134
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,039
being a third wheel is no good.

135
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,519
Fifth Princess!

136
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,639
What's going on?

137
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,000
Wasn't she supposed to be unconscious for a day and night?

138
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,720
This servant...

139
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
This servant doesn't know either.

140
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,720
Where was the Fifth Princess found?

141
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
She was found at the Fourth Princess's place.

142
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,600
It scared this maid half to death.

143
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,159
This maid... this maid forgot to inform you, sir.

144
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,080
Please forgive this offense, sir.

145
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,480
It's good that she's found.

146
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,919
I need to leave the palace shortly.

147
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,519
I shall take my leave now.

148
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,399
Princess, how...

149
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,879
A Zi, please go.

150
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,039
The fireworks at Luo Jie River

151
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,320
aren't something you can see anytime.

152
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,519
Just think of it as accompanying me, okay?

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,639
Fourth Sister.

154
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
A Lan wants to leave the palace too.

155
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,519
To... to see the fireworks.

156
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,440
Alright, alright.

157
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,639
Look there, look there!

158
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,519
Isn't it much livelier than the palace?

159
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,279
Fourth Sister.

160
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,200
A Lan wants to go see the fireworks.

161
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,720
Fine.

162
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,879
Let's go now.

163
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:02,840
Thief!

164
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,320
My money pouch was stolen!

165
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,559
Protect A Lan.

166
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,559
Ru Feng.

167
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,720
Ru Feng!

168
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,240
Young Master Xiu.

169
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,080
Ru Feng.

170
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,399
You take A Lan to Luo Jie River.

171
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,279
I'll go check on A Zi.

172
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,120
Keep a close eye on her.

173
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,759
Young Master Xiu.

174
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,440
Understood.

175
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,879
Come take a look at masks!

176
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,039
Miss.

177
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,320
Here's your money.

178
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,399
The scenery from our boat ride earlier

179
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,720
really had a unique charm to it.

180
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,679
Let's come again next time.

181
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,400
It's Young Master Meng!

182
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,519
Young Master Meng.

183
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,240
Young Master Meng is coming over.

184
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who is this Young Master Meng?

185
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,880
You're new to the capital, so of course you don't know.

186
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,640
He's the leader of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

187
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,880
The son of Grand Preceptor Meng.

188
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,720
He's also Yunmi's

189
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
first Top Scholar in Arts and Arms.

190
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,799
The dream lover of countless women.

191
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,720
If I could marry Young Master Meng,

192
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,599
I'd willingly be vegetarian for ten years.

193
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,440
I'd do twenty years!

194
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,319
I'd do thirty!

195
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
How can he be so handsome?

196
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,319
Indeed.

197
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,599
How can one win him over?

198
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
Young Master Meng!

199
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,640
Young Master Meng, you're so handsome!

200
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,279
Young Master Meng! Young Master Meng!

201
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,640
Has anyone here seen

202
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,599
a small pig, completely black in color?

203
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,079
Come on, come on, let's drink!

204
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
Why is he here?

205
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
Fifth Princess.

206
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,680
Later, the two of you will lie in wait outside the room.

207
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,240
I'll hide inside.

208
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,400
Once the assassin and the person behind him meet,

209
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,839
we'll coordinate from inside and out

210
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,279
and move to capture them.

211
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,519
Yes.

212
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
Could Yuwen Rui have recognized me?

213
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,480
Second floor of the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

214
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,119
Aren't dancing girls not allowed in here?

215
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,960
My lord, forgive me.

216
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,079
This humble girl took a wrong turn.

217
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,119
Master.

218
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,839
You're so naughty.

219
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,160
The magistrate's office is quite a distance from Luo Jie River.

220
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,400
Going there and back will waste a lot of time.

221
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,160
Is A Lan waiting for us?

222
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
I've already told Ru Feng

223
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,200
to take A Lan to Luo Jie River to see the fireworks.

224
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,160
Pity you won't get to see the fireworks this time.

225
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,400
I didn't expect fireworks here too.

226
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,839
A Zi, look!

227
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,319
Isn't it beautiful?

228
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,200
A Zi, look!

229
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,039
That purple one is especially pretty.

230
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,960
The young master said

231
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,920
whoever finds Little Black

232
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,720
gets a reward of one thousand taels.

233
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:55,599
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

234
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,279
Someone saw Little Black heading towards the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

235
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,799
What are you looking for?

236
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,480
Little Black.

237
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,200
What exactly is Little Black?

238
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,400
People from the Meng residence.

239
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,640
Just in case.

240
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,599
Spread the word.

241
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,920
Have Shadowless come to the Flying Immortal Pavilion

242
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,160
and find me at the Jingshui Tower opposite.

243
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,039
Yes.

244
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,599
Just now, this humble girl was flustered in the moment

245
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,160
and thus offended you, my lord.

246
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,759
I hope you can be magnanimous.

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,599
Then I won't disturb you any further, my lord.

248
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,839
This humble girl will take her leave.

249
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,079
Halt.

250
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,839
Does my lord have any other instructions?

251
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,599
Take it away.

252
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,640
This humble girl doesn't know how to take it away either.

253
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,119
Perhaps I should go out and look for

254
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,000
this pig's owner

255
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,319
and have him come take this little black pig away,

256
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,519
and also kowtow to apologize to you, my lord.

257
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,880
The Grand Chancellor is ruthless and vicious.

258
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,480
Won't you even spare a little black pig?

259
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,119
If Young Master Meng dares to offend this official,

260
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
this official will likewise not let it go.

261
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
A lone man and woman alone in a room.

262
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,119
You're in high spirits, my lord.

263
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,079
So it was you who just said

264
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,839
to find me to come kowtow and apologize?

265
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,759
Which family's young lady

266
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,480
is so good at pleasing the Grand Chancellor?

267
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,920
Young Master Meng, are you trying, in front of me,

268
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,519
to bully my person?

269
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,119
The Grand Chancellor seems to have urgent business to attend to.

270
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,559
I won't keep you company any longer.

271
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,079
They want to kill He Lianchen.

272
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,400
Eldest Cousin!

273
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,960
There's danger!

274
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,839
Hide!

275
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:31,960
Let go!

276
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,359
No! There's danger!

277
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,440
Hide with A Lan!

278
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
It's not about killing He Lianchen.

279
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,359
Speak quickly!

280
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,119
Who sent you to infiltrate the imperial palace?

281
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Won't talk, huh?

282
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,720
Watch out!

283
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,240
It's poisoned!

284
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,400
Think of something!

285
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,119
Yeah!

286
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,640
Eldest Cousin!

287
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,920
Commander He has been poisoned and fallen into the water!

288
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,759
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

289
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,119
This Luo Jie River looks narrow,

290
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,119
but the water is very deep!

291
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:42,880
That's right.

292
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
And there are underground rivers beneath the water.

293
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,240
Why hasn't he come up yet?

294
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,599
Commander He's belt!

295
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,400
Why did that girl jump in?

296
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,480
They're jumping in one after another!

297
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,680
Why did this girl tie a rope and jump into the water?

298
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,559
She saw the Grand Chancellor hadn't come out.

299
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,160
So she anxiously jumped in to save him.

300
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,519
Grand Chancellor, this worried look of yours...

301
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,000
...clearly shows she admires the Grand Chancellor.

302
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
What a devoted girl.

303
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,119
What did the girl who fell in look like?

304
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,880
She was wearing a pink gauze dress.

305
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,680
She called...

306
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,519
...called the Grand Chancellor 'Eldest Cousin'.

307
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,440
Yes, 'Eldest Cousin'.

308
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,000
What?
