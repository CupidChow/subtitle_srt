1
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,359
I never expected

2
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,120
that the Map of the Nine Provinces

3
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,519
was actually a scheme by Emperor Yunze.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,120
There's no such treasure map to rule the world.

5
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,159
Everything,

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
is just a trick of human nature.

7
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,519
My father learned

8
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,000
what happened during the Heaven-Worship Ceremony.

9
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,560
He realized he had

10
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,319
misjudged the Chief Grand Secretary's intentions.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,959
These past few days,

12
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,759
he's been locking himself in his study, full of regret.

13
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,479
Right, speaking of which,

14
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,719
thanks to you that day,

15
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,879
otherwise, Yuwen Rui

16
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,039
definitely wouldn't have

17
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,840
taken the token so easily.

18
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,400
It's rare

19
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,159
that you were willing to trust him.

20
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,159
Yinglu told me a bit

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,639
about what you encountered on your southern trip.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
Lord Yuwen stepped forward to protect the people.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,759
It shows he's a trustworthy and good official.

24
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,360
Besides, he was your choice.

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,919
Your judgment can't be that bad, right?

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Since you praise me so sincerely,

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,599
I'll graciously accept your compliments.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,919
To return the favor,

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
I should praise you too.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,599
Wearing this official robe,

31
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,080
you truly stand unparalleled in the world,

32
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,240
matchless under heaven.

33
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,080
Of course.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
My brother is peerlessly elegant.

35
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,280
He looks good in anything.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,319
Someone's in a very good mood today.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,879
Is it because you're going to see your sweetheart?

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,879
What sweetheart?

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,240
I just came to see you today.

40
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,360
I have official duties to attend to.

41
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,520
I'll visit you another day.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Alan.

43
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,319
Is the Fourth Princess doing alright?

44
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,639
My elder sister recently

45
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,599
has been helping Father with various state affairs.

46
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,719
On the surface, she seems fine,

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,719
but I know

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
her heart must be in great pain.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,479
Tell me,

50
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,120
why couldn't Su Qi just be Yuwen Xiu?

51
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,680
Fifth Princess,

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,560
you sent for me?

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,000
It's not me looking for you.

54
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,800
I guessed

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,639
that someone came to the palace

56
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,120
to see their sweetheart.

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,759
This...

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,120
Alan,

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,279
what are you talking about?

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Why are you so flustered?

61
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,680
I wasn't talking about you.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,439
Alright.

63
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,879
I need to go see my elder sister.

64
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,240
I'll leave this place for your "world for two."

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,480
What "world for two"?

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Thank you, Fifth Princess.

67
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,800
I was busy the past few days,

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
so I didn't come to find you.

69
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,839
I made you worry.

70
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,959
Who's worried about you?

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,639
Were you injured that day?

72
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,560
Just a minor injury.

73
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,639
It's fine now.

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,240
Let me see.

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,439
In a few days,

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,279
I will go to the Meng residence to propose.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,279
Is that alright?

78
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,720
Who...

79
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,279
Who said I'd marry you?

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
A new mission already?

81
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,319
Save Grand Tutor Guan.

82
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,120
It's your final mission.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,879
You can go back.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,399
Alan.

85
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,800
Alan.

86
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,600
What's wrong?

87
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,439
You mean you're leaving?

88
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,319
Never coming back?

89
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,360
All of this is a world from a storybook,

90
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,319
and you're returning to your own world.

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,759
You're acting quite convincingly,

92
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,680
but you still can't fool me.

93
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm not lying to you.

94
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,639
Think carefully.

95
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,680
How did I know Grand Tutor Guan would take his own life?

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,560
And Commander He,

97
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,360
Little Li, and the others?

98
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,840
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

99
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:36,720
Let's go.

100
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,279
Hongyi.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,039
Can you help me with something?

102
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,679
You... you...

103
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,000
He...

104
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
He's the "drama"

105
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,879
spirit you mentioned?

106
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,279
At this point,

107
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,200
you two

108
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,559
should say your goodbyes properly.

109
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,080
So it's true.

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,519
You really don't belong to this world.

111
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,759
You really don't belong here.

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,720
It's okay.

113
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll find a way to make you stay.

114
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,039
Father, Mother,

115
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,279
I've come to see you.

116
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,000
But this time, I'm not alone.

117
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,279
Alan is my beloved.

118
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,120
I originally planned to bring her after our wedding,

119
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,080
but I thought

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
you must be eager

121
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
to meet her.

122
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,919
She will be my one and only wife.

123
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,080
I will protect her for the rest of her life.

124
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,360
Alan,

125
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,720
would you be willing to call them Father and Mother?

126
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,360
Father.

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Mother.

128
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
May Father and Mother in heaven

129
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,519
bless Alan and me

130
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
to grow old together in this life.

131
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,320
Being so handsome,

132
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
I should have looked at you more before.

133
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
You still can in the future.

134
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,240
Don't frown so much.

135
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,480
I told you,

136
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,600
I will find a way.

137
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,240
If...

138
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,360
if I do leave,

139
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,799
you be well,

140
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,559
alright?

141
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:53,799
Alright.

142
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,120
After two or three years,

143
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,159
just forget about me.

144
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,720
Alright.

145
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,200
Then find a girl you love,

146
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,759
and get married.

147
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,519
Don't overthink things.

148
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,039
Get some rest early.

149
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,720
I've prepared some things.

150
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,960
They're in the room we stayed in before.

151
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,480
There are letters inside for Father and my elder sister.

152
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,559
And also some gifts for Shaojue,

153
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,000
Yinglu,

154
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,600
Xixi,

155
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
and Little Li Zi and the others.

156
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,679
If I...

157
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,720
Please help me deliver them.

158
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,480
Alright.

159
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,319
Yuwen Rui.

160
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,920
What's wrong?

161
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,200
A Lan.

162
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,519
A Lan, tell me.

163
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,480
What must I do...

164
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,559
for you to not leave?

165
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,720
Tell me.

166
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,559
I have no choice.

167
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,200
I have no choice.

168
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,680
I lied to you.

169
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,039
If you leave,

170
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,960
how could I possibly live well?

171
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
No, you must live well. How could I...

172
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,599
How could I ever forget you?

173
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
And how could I ever marry and have children?

174
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:15,640
No.

175
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,359
You...

176
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
How could I... A Lan...

177
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,160
Tell me.

178
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
What should I do?

179
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,720
A Lan.

180
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,720
Don't make me worry.

181
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
Alright?

182
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,480
I once said,

183
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,359
in this lifetime of mine,

184
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,200
I only wish to grow old with you alone.

185
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,400
I only wish for you.

186
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,279
What's wrong?

187
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,039
Chief Grand Secretary is overwhelmed with grief,

188
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,920
hence the blood he coughed up.

189
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,440
Your Highness, please don't worry too much.

190
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,200
Imperial Physician Chen.

191
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,720
May I have a word in private?

192
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,400
Your Highness.

193
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,319
What further instructions do you have?

194
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
Physician Chen, do you know...

195
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,400
if there is any medicine that can make one forget...

196
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
the one they love in their heart?

197
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,240
Your Highness...

198
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,640
What do you need this medicine for?

199
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,079
It's nothing.

200
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
This is the prescription I've written for Chief Grand Secretary.

201
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,799
Take it for two days and he'll be fine.

202
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,160
Then this humble official will take his leave.

203
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,200
It's today.

204
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,839
After I leave this place,

205
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,759
what will happen here?

206
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,559
You will leave...

207
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,279
in a manner that appears to be an accident.

208
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,640
Perhaps as time passes,

209
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,599
everyone will slowly forget you.

210
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,960
He won't.

211
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,599
Fifth Princess.

212
00:20:59,279 --> 00:20:59,799
Physician Chen.

213
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,200
Your Highness.

214
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,519
This humble official...

215
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,240
...did not tell you the truth earlier.

216
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,759
What do you mean?

217
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,680
This is the elixir Your Highness wanted.

218
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,559
Didn't you just say...

219
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,200
you didn't know of such a medicine?

220
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,799
Your Highness, please forgive me.

221
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,240
This humble official did not intend to deceive you.

222
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,279
It's just that this Heart-Severing Pill...

223
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,319
is the only one in the world.

224
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,799
I originally intended to give it to my...

225
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,480
elderly mentor who just lost his beloved wife.

226
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,920
But I just received tragic news.

227
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,319
My master has already passed away.

228
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,000
So this medicine is for you, Your Highness.

229
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,119
You're awake.

230
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,000
I've prepared medicine for you.

231
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,319
Drink it while it's hot.

232
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,559
A Lan?

233
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,559
What is it?

234
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,599
Yuwen Rui?

235
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,839
Why is the Fifth Princess here?

236
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,519
I...

237
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,559
This official does not wish to see the Fifth Princess.

238
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,200
Please show some self-respect.

239
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:41,960
I...

240
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,920
I'll leave now.

241
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:50,759
Wait.

242
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,880
Regarding my marriage engagement with the Fifth Princess...

243
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,720
I must ask the Fifth Princess...

244
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,119
to find a way to cancel it as soon as possible.

245
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:10,920
Alright.

246
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,960
Physician Chen.

247
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,799
My lord.

248
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,599
What further instructions do you have?

249
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,519
Please trouble yourself to give this to the Fifth Princess.

250
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,480
Tell her this is the medicine she was seeking.

251
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
Letting you leave with peace of mind...

252
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,079
is the only thing I can do for you.

253
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,359
An Ran.

254
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,079
An Ran.

255
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,759
An Ran.

256
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,880
An Ran.

257
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,079
You're finally awake!

258
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,680
What happened to me?

259
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,359
Don't you remember?

260
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,440
I was scared to death.

261
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,920
On the day you were playing An Kelan,

262
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,119
a ladder fell on the set.

263
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,640
Both you and President Ling passed out.

264
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,759
It scared me so much.

265
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,039
Ling Rui also passed out?

266
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,279
He should be in this hospital too.

267
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,119
I wonder if he's woken up yet.

268
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,400
An Ran?

269
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,519
Thank goodness you shielded him.

270
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:37,559
Otherwise,

271
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,000
he'd definitely have a big hole smashed in him.

272
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,200
Be careful!

273
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,720
Could he be like me too?

274
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:58,920
Which room is he in?

275
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,599
Can you take me there?

276
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:07,920
An Ran!

277
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,759
Why are you looking for him?

278
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,160
An Ran!

279
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,000
An Ran, why are you walking so fast?

280
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,440
An Ran!

281
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,000
Why are you in such a hurry to find him?

282
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:44,519
Yu...

283
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,599
You are...

284
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,640
I...

285
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,319
President Ling.

286
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,960
She's from our crew,

287
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,599
the actress playing An Kelan, An Ran.

288
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,839
She was the one who saved you on set earlier...

289
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,359
I'm sorry.

290
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,400
I have something urgent.

291
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
If there's anything, you can contact the production team.

292
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,200
Anran

293
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,759
What's wrong?

294
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,039
As I thought.

295
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,119
It was just a dream.

296
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
Wh-what?

297
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's go.

298
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,720
Let's head back first.

299
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
Here, take it slow.

300
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Don't move.

301
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,599
My girlfriend is so beautiful.

302
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,359
Our engagement was decreed by the late Empress Dowager.

303
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,799
It wasn't by our mutual consent.

304
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
I know you don't want to marry me.

305
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,599
Anyway,

306
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
you'll definitely find a way

307
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,519
to cancel the engagement.

308
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,799
A'Lan likes her elder cousin.

309
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,359
Don't cancel the engagement.

310
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,119
Does the Fifth Princess not know

311
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,319
that seeing a woman's bare feet

312
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,039
means one must marry her?

313
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,039
You saw them, sir.

314
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,359
Do you intend to marry me now?

315
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,359
Sharing a snowfall together,

316
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,640
I wish to grow old with you.

317
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,000
A'Lan.

318
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,119
Would you spend your life with me, till our hair turns white?

319
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,240
Two one nine.

320
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,440
Five six one.

321
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Seven eight two.

322
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,799
Two-one-nine means page two of the love letter collection,

323
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,880
the ninth character of the first line.

324
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,200
The whole string of numbers is...

325
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,519
Is what?

326
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
I love you.

327
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,680
If you leave,

328
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,400
how could I possibly be okay?

329
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,000
How could I ever forget you?

330
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,279
How could I ever marry and have children?

331
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,039
For my entire life,

332
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,960
I only wish to grow old with you alone.

333
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Hey, bro, wake up.

334
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,480
The actress playing An Kelan,

335
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,159
which room is she in?

336
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,360
Room 406.

337
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,519
You know she saved...

338
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,679
Sweetheart.

339
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,199
Are you sure you don't want to stay a couple more days for observation?

340
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,159
Didn't the doctor say I'm fine?

341
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,920
I can be discharged.

342
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,199
Alright.

343
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,880
Then I'll take you back to the hotel first.

344
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,480
Then I'll head to the set.

345
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,519
Our show...

346
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,639
Do you know how it ends?

347
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,880
Don't even mention it.

348
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,840
Almost everyone dies.

349
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:02,400
By the way,

350
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
do you know who

351
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,800
the biggest villain in our show is?

352
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
The male lead, Yuwen Xiu.

353
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,639
He's actually Su Qi, the prince of the enemy state.

354
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,239
Su Qi kills the Emperor of Yunmi,

355
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,199
and destroys Yunmi.

356
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,000
Then the female lead, An Kezi,

357
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,280
dies in the war

358
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,559
protecting her country.

359
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,719
Two people who clearly love each other,

360
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:23,360
yet never confess their feelings before they die.

361
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
It's very different from the dream.

362
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,559
Later,

363
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,039
Su Qi becomes emperor.

364
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
He seems to have gained everything,

365
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,079
but he's actually a pitiful man.

366
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,719
The person in his heart

367
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,599
will never return.

368
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:47,960
His entire life,

369
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,639
is spent in regret and remorse.

370
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Forget it.

371
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,119
Let's not talk about this.

372
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,960
You go back and get some proper rest.

373
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
I'll go back and pack up,

374
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,639
then come find you at the set later.

375
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:08,559
Okay.

376
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,360
I'll have someone buy some grapes you like.

377
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,159
Let's go.

378
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,039
Xiao Wang, bring that prop over.

379
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:48,960
Okay.

380
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,400
Put it here.

381
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,039
Be careful.

382
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,480
It's quite heavy.

383
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,519
Food's here! Food's here!

384
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,360
Come on, let's eat.

385
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,119
Let's go, let's go, go.

386
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:05,599
Go.

387
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,559
It's you.

388
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,599
Isn't it?

389
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,280
It's me.

390
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,639
I've remembered everything.
