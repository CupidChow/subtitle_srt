1
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,599
Fifth Princess

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
When the master is sleeping,

3
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,599
he absolutely must not be

4
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,239
disturbed.

5
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,599
Cousin.

6
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,640
Good morning.

7
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,319
What are you doing here?

8
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,879
I'm here to help you, Cousin, get up and wash.

9
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,039
Would you like something to drink, Cousin?

10
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,639
We have green tea,

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,400
warm water,

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,439
and grape juice.

13
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,639
So, Cousin, what would you like to drink?

14
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:39,800
Warm water.

15
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,080
Alright.

16
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Cousin,

17
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,120
let me help you get dressed.

18
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,080
Did no one tell you

19
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,560
that what I dislike most

20
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
is being disturbed while I sleep?

21
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
That's my fault.

22
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll come back later then.

23
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Get straight to the point.

24
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,840
Cousin,

25
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,199
could you be a bit gentler?

26
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,639
It really hurts.

27
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,439
The master, he actually...

28
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,360
It seems the master

29
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,039
has taken a liking to the Fifth Princess.

30
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,199
Master,

31
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,039
you've hidden it so well.

32
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,439
What's wrong with the master?

33
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,959
Is our princess inside?

34
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,519
I heard

35
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,759
the master dislikes being disturbed while sleeping.

36
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,279
He wouldn't be inside

37
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,560
bullying our princess, would he?

38
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, if you mean bu-bullying,

39
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,759
then I suppose so.

40
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Don't worry,

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,399
the Fifth Princess will be fine.

42
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,120
Really.

43
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,319
Really.

44
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,279
Dislikes being disturbed while sleeping,

45
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,920
and even made you wear...

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,879
Your master certainly has a lot of quirks.

47
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,120
All these years,

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,199
being by his side,

49
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,759
must have been tough.

50
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,800
I-I've gotten used to it.

51
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll go get your breakfast first.

52
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,480
I'll be right back.

53
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Princess, are you alright?

54
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,879
What could possibly be wrong with me?

55
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,040
This business of Young Master Meng frantically looking for the Fifth Princess...

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
I'd better not tell her yet.

57
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,839
Others can read ten lines at a glance,

58
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,439
but the master reads ten pages at a glance.

59
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,600
Cousin is bathing.

60
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,240
You follow him even when he bathes?

61
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,240
Of course.

62
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,199
I must be a loyal,

63
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,720
attentive, and capable personal maid.

64
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,959
What I want isn't just a maid.

65
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,000
What else do you want, Cousin?

66
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
As long as I can do it,

67
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,319
I'll definitely help you.

68
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
What do you mean?

69
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,759
I've been a maid

70
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,360
at the Meng Mansion for a while now.

71
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,079
You'll find out later.

72
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,680
We'll talk about that later.

73
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,120
For now, let me have you try

74
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
my new invention.

75
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,839
I guarantee after using it,

76
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
you'll be reborn,

77
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
given a new lease on life.

78
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,839
That's completely unnecessary.

79
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,639
You say the master's skin,

80
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,959
how is it so delicate and smooth?

81
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,879
It's as silky as...

82
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,519
As what?

83
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,000
I retract that.

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,279
Let's start over.

85
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,159
The master's skin, you see,

86
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,639
is truly silky where it should be silky,

87
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,879
and rough where it should be rough.

88
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,759
Why is you men's skin

89
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,600
so perfect?

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,720
You...

91
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Has Meng Shaojue used this invention of yours?

92
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Why so quiet?

93
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,399
H-how could that be?

94
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,399
Such a great invention

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,120
naturally must be used by you first, Master.

96
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,600
Stop being sarcastic.

97
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,240
Speak.

98
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,360
What's your purpose?

99
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,960
What purpose could I possibly have?

100
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,399
I'm just here to promote bath-scrubbing culture.

101
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,639
Speak plainly.

102
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,159
There is indeed a small favor I need from you, Master.

103
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,559
Let's hear it.

104
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,759
I want you to lend me Ru Feng for a few days.

105
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,440
I want him to, from morning till night,

106
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,799
guard me, protect me.

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Coincidentally, I've been missing Meng Yinglu these past two days.

108
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,279
I plan to visit her in a couple of days.

109
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,720
Ru Feng can accompany me down the mountain.

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,639
There are people protecting you in the shadows.

111
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,039
The matter of going down the mountain

112
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,279
can wait until I return from the palace.

113
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,080
I know there are people in the shadows monit-

114
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,879
protecting me.

115
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,559
But I need protection in the open too.

116
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,720
In this villa,

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,519
aside from you,

118
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,159
he has the highest martial arts skill.

119
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,879
I can't possibly have you

120
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,519
guarding me day and night, can I?

121
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,879
Even if I wanted to,

122
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,879
you certainly wouldn't be willing.

123
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,039
So, what do you say?

124
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:16,960
Turn around.

125
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
So it's settled about Ru Feng, okay?

126
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,240
Agree or not, at least say something!

127
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,080
Are you done?

128
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm turning around now.

129
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,919
You...

130
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
Put your clothes on properly.

131
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,559
What are you... what are you doing?

132
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm getting dressed.

133
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,840
Why is your face red?

134
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,159
I am not.

135
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,799
Isn't this the Auspicious Knot

136
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,039
I bought for you at Peiyu Pavilion?

137
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,840
You don't carry it with you every day, do you?

138
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
You actually keep it on your person.

139
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,919
Right over your heart, no less.

140
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
Don't tell me...

141
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,600
You discovered this Auspicious Knot is actually very valuable?

142
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,960
Right?

143
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,600
What a miscalculation.

144
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,039
Back then, I actually thought it was a fake.

145
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Had I known, I shouldn't have given it to you.

146
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,240
Wait a minute!

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,480
You haven't agreed to my request about Ru Feng yet.

148
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,360
We'll talk about it when I get back.

149
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,080
My lord.

150
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,960
Our people watching Prince Ning's mansion have sent word.

151
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,759
Prince Ning has closed his doors and refuses visitors.

152
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,519
He has also secretly summoned several physicians.

153
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,159
It seems the poison has taken effect.

154
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,759
Starting today,

155
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,399
you will stay by the Fifth Princess's side.

156
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,279
Rest assured, my lord.

157
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
This subordinate will spare no effort

158
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
to protect the Fifth Princess.

159
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,759
Your humble servant pays respects to Your Majesty.

160
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,799
May I ask why Your Majesty urgently summoned me to the palace?

161
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,960
What is the matter?

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,159
Prince Ning is injured.

163
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,279
He accidentally scalded himself yesterday.

164
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,840
Then let Imperial Physician Chen examine you.

165
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern.

166
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,759
It's just a minor injury.

167
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,639
Prince Ning has dedicated himself to Yunmi.

168
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,519
It is only right for me

169
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
to be concerned about your health.

170
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,559
Yes.

171
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,559
Your Majesty can rest assured.

172
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Prince Ning's scald is not very serious.

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,279
Applying Yuqing Ointment for a few days will suffice.

174
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,039
That is good to hear.

175
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,360
Prince Ning must still take more care of his health.

176
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,159
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern.

177
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,759
Trying to please him is useless.

178
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,360
Why is Yuwen Rui harder to deal with than Xiao Hei?

179
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,600
Maybe I should think of a way to kidnap Ru Feng.

180
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,279
But his martial arts are quite formidable.

181
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,440
Can't use force, must rely on wit.

182
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,960
Fifth Princess.

183
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,080
Why do you want to kidnap me?

184
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,679
It's nothing.

185
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,559
I wanted to ask you about something.

186
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,879
Why aren't you following Yuwen Rui?

187
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,080
Before he left, my lord gave orders.

188
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
He told me to follow the Fifth Princess's commands from now on.

189
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Yuwen Rui does have a conscience.

190
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,000
Starting today,

191
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
you must stay within my line of sight.

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Understood?

193
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,360
Fifth Princess,

194
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,279
what did you want to ask me about?

195
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,080
You can just ask me directly.

196
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,879
Do you know how Yuwen Rui

197
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,679
got the scars on his back?

198
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,960
The Fifth Princess even knows about that?

199
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,120
My lord and the princess really are...

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,480
Fifth Princess,

201
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,960
I hope you won't take it to heart.

202
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,200
Wait a minute.

203
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Take it to heart?

204
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,480
What would I take to heart?

205
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,639
Well...

206
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,240
Indeed, there's nothing to take to heart.

207
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,120
The Fifth Princess really is different from before.

208
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,480
If my lord knew,

209
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,759
he would be deeply moved.

210
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,440
What nonsense is this?

211
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,799
Are the thought processes of you maids and guards

212
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,039
all this strange?

213
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,759
Forget it, forget it.

214
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,639
Tell me about the scars on Yuwen Rui's back.

215
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,759
After the old general and his wife passed away,

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,080
my lord took up his spear and went to the battlefield.

217
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,000
He fought everywhere to protect our Yunmi.

218
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,120
All these years,

219
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
amidst the clash of blades and rain of blood,

220
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,559
it was inevitable he'd sustain some injuries.

221
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,159
Princess,

222
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,919
you must treat our lord well from now on.

223
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,600
Me, treat him well?

224
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,840
When my lord was young,

225
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,639
the old general and his wife passed away.

226
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,159
For all these years,

227
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,399
my lord has been on his own.

228
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,799
When did you first meet Yuwen Rui?

229
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,840
Eight years ago.

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,559
Back then, the Yun-Zhan War...

231
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,080
In order to seize the Map of the Nine Provinces,

232
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,279
they rashly dispatched troops.

233
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,720
My hometown was right on the border between the two countries.

234
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,840
The flames of war burned the entire village.

235
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,279
It was my lord

236
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,720
who rescued me from the raging flames.

237
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,120
Of the whole village,

238
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,240
I was the only one who survived.

239
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,039
Ever since then,

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,559
you've been following Yuwen Rui.

241
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,559
I was only twelve years old then.

242
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,039
My lord thought I was too young,

243
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,079
that I'd only be a hindrance on the battlefield.

244
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,759
So I followed them for many days.

245
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,440
I practiced swordplay day and night.

246
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,519
After I was discovered,

247
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,200
that's when I finally entered my lord's service.

248
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,640
No wonder you're so loyal to him.

249
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
You obey him in everything.

250
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,000
My lord is worthy of it.

251
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,799
Yuwen Rui saved you,

252
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,359
not so you could blindly repay the favor.

253
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,640
Otherwise,

254
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,200
there was no need to drive you away at first.

255
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,599
I know.

256
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,200
It's right for you to repay his life-saving grace.

257
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,680
But you can't just be a pawn.

258
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
A pawn?

259
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,200
What does that mean?

260
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,839
It means,

261
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,039
besides repaying the favor,

262
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,559
you should also have your own life.

263
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,839
You need to have things you want to do.

264
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,720
You can't have your head filled with thoughts like,

265
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,640
"You saved me,

266
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,079
so my life is yours.

267
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,359
I'll do whatever you tell me to do."

268
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Fifth Princess, how did you know?

269
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,559
From that day on,

270
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,359
I swore an oath

271
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
to obey my lord's every command thereafter.

272
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,440
That's how it always is in TV dramas.

273
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm not trying to drive a wedge

274
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,480
between you and Yuwen Rui.

275
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,799
It's just that, when you're alive,

276
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,559
you need to have hopes, big or small.

277
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,359
Do you understand?

278
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:22,960
Princess,

279
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,559
this servant has brought you grapes.

280
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,519
Then this subordinate will take his leave.

281
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,599
Today's grapes are really fresh.

282
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,799
Princess, try one quickly.

283
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,839
Just now at the Benevolent Heart Hall

284
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,200
Eldest Cousin saw Third Imperial Uncle's wrist bandaged

285
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,400
and wasn't surprised.

286
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,039
You suspected him of stealing the map long ago.

287
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Third Imperial Uncle has long been called a Living Bodhisattva.

288
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,319
He has Father Emperor's deep trust.

289
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,440
Why would Eldest Cousin suspect him?

290
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,720
The more sinister and vicious a person is,

291
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,559
the more they like to hide behind

292
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,920
the name of a Living Bodhisattva to do evil.

293
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
If what you say is true,

294
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
and Third Imperial Uncle really stole the fake map from Meng Mansion,

295
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,279
why wasn't he poisoned?

296
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,160
Don't you have the only antidote?

297
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,039
The antidote was at the suburban villa.

298
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:28,920
It might have been stolen.

299
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,559
I'll go with you to check.

300
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,000
A Zi.

301
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,839
I brought you delicacies from Zhenxiu Pavilion.

302
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,640
Seventh Cousin, please don't

303
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,839
bring me food from outside the palace anymore.

304
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
I know you care about me.

305
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,279
But now,

306
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,279
you have a woman you like.

307
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,279
If she were to find out,

308
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,799
it would inevitably cause misunderstanding.

309
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,920
I will also keep my distance from you from now on.

310
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's go, Eldest Cousin.

311
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,480
Zixiu.

312
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,519
Don't make yourself regret it.

313
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,759
Elder Brother.

314
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,960
I am just a

315
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
good-for-nothing playboy.

316
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,519
I'm not worthy of A Zi.

317
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,279
That's not a reason.

318
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,680
Slow down.

319
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,319
Where are you rushing off to, My Lord?

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
Speak plainly, Young Master Meng.

321
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,240
Did you take A Lan away?

322
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,799
What if I did?

323
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,839
Lord Yuwen should know

324
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
she is a member of my Meng Mansion.

325
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,480
Is that so?

326
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,400
Young Master.

327
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,519
I investigated the people around Yuwen Rui.

328
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,839
I found a portrait of the Fifth Princess.

329
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,440
Don't forget, Young Master Meng,

330
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
she and I are betrothed.

331
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,920
But I've heard news

332
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,079
that A Lan is not satisfied with this betrothal.

333
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,839
As long as she doesn't want it,

334
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,039
I will never let anyone force her.

335
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,799
There are some people you shouldn't covet.

336
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,799
What if I do?

337
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,480
We'll see.

338
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,839
A Lan told me

339
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,319
she left a letter for you.

340
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,359
Didn't Young Master Meng see it?

341
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,200
A Lan is safe now.

342
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,920
There's no need for Young Master Meng to worry.

343
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,519
Her identity is special.

344
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,839
The matter of her being in your mansion,

345
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,079
please do not leak it, Young Master Meng.

346
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:29,839
Xixi.

347
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,319
Do you know how the old general and his wife

348
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,519
passed away?

349
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,839
This servant heard people in the palace say

350
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,319
that when the old general and Lady Shen went to battle,

351
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
they were ambushed

352
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,720
and died unfortunately.

353
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,720
It's a pity. They spent their whole lives guarding Yunmi,

354
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,720
yet couldn't see the current peaceful age.

355
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,920
Princess.

356
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,319
Rest for a while.

357
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,920
I've prepared chilled watermelon for you.

358
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,559
Alright.

359
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,000
The Princess likes to eat grapes.

360
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,079
Why did you prepare watermelon?

361
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,119
It's fine.

362
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,160
It's nice to eat melon occasionally.

363
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,160
Xixi.

364
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,559
Didn't you say you wanted watermelon this morning?

365
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,279
Here,

366
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,960
have a taste.

367
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,519
Princess, you eat first.

368
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
This servant still needs to water these potted plants.

369
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
You go and rest with the Princess.

370
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,160
I'll take care of this here.

371
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,960
No need.

372
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,720
I'll be done soon.

373
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,680
Then I'll help you.

374
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,119
Any more water and they'll drown.

375
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Fifth Princess, I...

376
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:51,759
My Lord.

377
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,920
I heard from Ru Feng

378
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,440
you entered the palace regarding Prince Ning's matter.

379
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,319
How did it go?

380
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,160
Prince Ning wasn't poisoned.

381
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,200
Eldest Cousin suspects the antidote was stolen.

382
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,920
The antidote really was stolen.

383
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,480
Someone who can evade the hidden guards

384
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,279
and silently steal the antidote

385
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,519
from my villa

386
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,680
can be counted on one hand in Yunmi.

387
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,319
Around Prince Ning,

388
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,839
there is no person of such skill.

389
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,039
Eldest Cousin means

390
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,559
Prince Ning must have a mysterious person secretly aiding him.

391
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,559
Who could this person be?

392
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,640
I will have people watch Prince Ning.

393
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,200
No matter who this person is,

394
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,079
as long as they have plans,

395
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,799
they will surely reveal a flaw.

396
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,480
Fortunately, you stole the antidote.

397
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,799
Although we avoided disaster,

398
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,400
Yuwen Rui

399
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
must already be aware of my existence.

400
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,319
You act with such caution.

401
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,319
Could he possibly discover your identity?

402
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,720
In the coming days,

403
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,200
don't make any rash moves.

404
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,759
Unless absolutely necessary,

405
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,039
we should not meet for now.

406
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,640
I met Young Master Meng outside the city today.

407
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,880
He's been searching for you all these days.

408
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Didn't he see the letter I left?

409
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
It's spread all over Luojing.

410
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
Young Master Meng is offering a large reward to find a woman.

411
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,559
My seventh cousin and I

412
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,039
learned about this a few days ago.

413
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,079
But we couldn't reveal your identity,

414
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,519
so we didn't tell

415
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,200
Young Master Meng your whereabouts.

416
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,519
Meng Shaojue is a righteous man.

417
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,880
He must be thinking of

418
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
the favor I did by drawing the assassins away.

419
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,559
He's worried I might be in danger.

420
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,279
I'll write another letter to send over later,

421
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,119
so they won't worry.

422
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,559
Elder Imperial Sister,

423
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,960
how have things been with Seventh Cousin lately?

424
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,319
I've been intentionally keeping my distance from him recently.

425
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,519
He has someone he likes.

426
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,960
We should still maintain proper boundaries.

427
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,160
Elder Imperial Sister,

428
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,720
you do have feelings for Seventh Cousin, don't you?

429
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
After learning he has someone he likes,

430
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,880
I realized my own feelings.

431
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,559
You're not planning to tell him?

432
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,000
His heart belongs to someone else.

433
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
Telling him would only cause unnecessary trouble.

434
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,839
The male and female leads

435
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,160
are on a path of anguished, deep love?

436
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,400
Elder Imperial Sister,

437
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,119
this seems to belong to Seventh Cousin.

438
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,559
Perhaps the one Seventh Cousin likes

439
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,359
is not someone else.

440
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,559
Brother said he has a lead on A Lan.

441
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:40,759
Why didn't he tell me?

442
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,960
Where exactly is A Lan?

443
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,480
Lord He.

444
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,359
Miss Meng.

445
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,039
These books were not recommended by me.

446
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
It's just a little trick by the bookseller.

447
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,920
If Miss Meng enjoys martial arts training,

448
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I, He, can actually recommend

449
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,519
some truly substantial works.

450
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,200
As expected of Lord He.

451
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
In the future, when I refine my martial skills,

452
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,960
I hope to have a chance to spar with you, my lord.

453
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,440
Isn't this the birthday gift I gave my brother?

454
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,599
It fell during the fight with that petty thief He.

455
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
How did it end up with Lord He?

456
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,960
This...

457
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Lord He,

458
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,640
you couldn't possibly be that petty thief He, could you?

459
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,759
My lord, you are full of righteousness.

460
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,400
How could you be the one who stole my purse

461
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,039
and injured me, that petty thief He?

462
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,039
Miss Meng,

463
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,720
this matter is something I can explain.

464
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,079
Stealing your purse...

465
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,319
was because...

466
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,000
It really is you!

467
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,640
You kidnapped me several times,

468
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,640
and stole my things!

469
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,799
And here I was, I even...

470
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,319
Miss Meng,

471
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,880
I, He, have wronged you.

472
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,720
You, my lord, as the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

473
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,720
actually engage in such sneaky, thieving acts?

474
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,519
I must have been blind

475
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,720
to have admired you so much.

476
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
Don't let me see you again!

477
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,319
Fifth Princess.

478
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,920
I found some light reading for you.

479
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,160
You can read them when you're bored.

480
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,400
Can they even understand some of these words?

481
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,720
What's there not to understand?

482
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,119
They definitely won't understand.

483
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,599
"Youthful genius" is one thing,

484
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,920
but "honest, kind, and pure-hearted" is a bit excessive, isn't it?

485
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,319
How is that excessive?

486
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,400
That's just our lord's true nature.

487
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,119
Doesn't the outside world all say

488
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,359
your lord is petty and exacting,

489
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,480
ruthless and cruel?

490
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,200
That's just slander spread by those with ulterior motives,

491
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,039
defaming our lord.

492
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
Our lord just wants to do his job well.

493
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,079
He can't be bothered with them.

494
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,119
Princess,

495
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:35,759
you...

496
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,359
take a look at these books I found for you.

497
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,400
So you won't have misunderstandings.

498
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,799
Just put them aside for now.

499
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,440
Fifth...

500
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,519
What is it?

501
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,880
Fifth Princess,

502
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,680
actually, today is the anniversary of the old general and his wife's passing.

503
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,839
Our lord has been planning to bring down Prince Ning

504
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,680
to avenge the old general and his wife.

505
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,799
But His Majesty trusts Prince Ning too much.

506
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,119
The old general and his wife were killed by Prince Ning.

507
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
When our lord was young,

508
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,680
the old general and his wife passed away.

509
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,160
Our lord was left alone and helpless.

510
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,440
When he had nothing to do, he would go

511
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,960
to the training ground where the old general drilled troops.

512
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
He would stay for several days at a time.

513
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,480
Even that Wishing Tree outside

514
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,920
was specially moved here by our lord from the training ground.

515
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,319
Princess,

516
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,279
What are you doing, Ru Feng?

517
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,160
Please go see our lord, Princess.

518
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,880
Ru Feng, I'm telling you...

519
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
He's really too pitiful.

520
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,119
Can you slow down?

521
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,839
Princess,

522
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,119
I leave our lord in your hands.

523
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,519
Wait...

524
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,279
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,680
That Wishing Tree was moved here by you from the training ground?

526
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,119
Ru Feng told you?

527
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,960
Ru Feng said

528
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,759
you had a serious illness when you were young,

529
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,119
and almost lost your life.

530
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,039
Later, you were alone and helpless,

531
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,920
with no protection.

532
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,119
Often you didn't know where your next meal was coming from,

533
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,000
and were bullied by other children.

534
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,000
But, my lord, you are naturally gifted and clever.

535
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,559
Except for the last sentence,

536
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,680
the rest was probably Zixiu.

537
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,000
I suspected it was him too.

538
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,119
Eight out of ten things he says are false.

539
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,480
My lord, you clearly don't look like someone who gets bullied.

540
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:44,880
However,

541
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,799
there's one thing he said

542
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,880
that must be true.

543
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,680
What is it?

544
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,680
He said

545
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,079
you take on too much yourself.

546
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,640
I was wondering why on that Wishing Tree

547
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,240
there were so many "return safely" wishes.

548
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,200
Now that I think about it,

549
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,240
they were probably made by the soldiers

550
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,759
who fought alongside you.

551
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,599
You led them to the battlefield,

552
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,640
but couldn't bring them all back.

553
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,599
Why isn't it here?

554
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,880
Yunmi is now peaceful and prosperous.

555
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,440
The people live and work in contentment.

556
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,519
All of this was left by you and those soldiers.

557
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,240
A Lan.

558
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,800
Yuwen Rui.

559
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,360
Yuwen Rui.

560
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,440
Yuwen Rui.

561
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,599
His drinking manners are terrible.

562
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,039
Your Highness.

563
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
Your handwriting is much better than mine, my lord.

564
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Why don't you have him help you write it?

565
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,039
Why are you asking so many questions?

566
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,000
Write it properly.

567
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,559
Remember to add a line.

568
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,079
Say that I'll visit them at the Meng Mansion in a few days.

569
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,480
Tell them not to worry about me.

570
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,000
Is your lord awake yet?

571
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,280
He woke up long ago.

572
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,159
Right now,

573
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,320
he's probably busy in the study.

574
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,079
My lord drank too much last night.

575
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,159
He can't remember anything.

576
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,440
Can't remember.

577
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,400
He can't remember a thing.

578
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,960
It seems he only remembers

579
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,239
that Your Highness drank a few cups with him.

580
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,000
Th-then what?

581
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,039
There's no 'then'.

582
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:36,719
Your Highness,

583
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,360
if you said something

584
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,760
or did something important,

585
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:40,480
it's fine.

586
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,960
When you see my lord later,

587
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,400
you can explain it to him carefully.

588
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,639
N-no, nothing important.

589
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:48,920
Are you done with the letter?

590
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,639
Remember to explain at the end,

591
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,320
say I spent half a coin

592
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,920
to hire a literate beggar

593
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,960
to help me write this letter.

594
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,440
Beg...

595
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,960
Your Highness?

596
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,679
Alright.

597
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:15,519
Your Highness.

598
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,360
I have a favor to ask.

599
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,320
Go ahead, what is it?

600
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,880
I see that Your Highness and my lord

601
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,960
are quite close.

602
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,400
I was thinking...

603
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,199
Which eye of yours sees

604
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,800
that I'm close with your lord?

605
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,159
You even slept in the same room.

606
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,320
Isn't that close enough?

607
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,119
Not close, not close.

608
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,400
I see that Your Highness and my lord

609
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,639
aren't very close.

610
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So I wanted to learn more about Miss Xixi.

611
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,760
Don't worry.

612
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,280
I'll take care of it.

613
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,840
Your Highness,

614
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,440
why not have Young Master Meng come here to see you?

615
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:14,920
Better not.

616
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,239
Yuwen Rui and he are naturally incompatible.

617
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
If the two of them meet,

618
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,360
they'd probably tear this villa down.

619
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,639
Alright.

620
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,119
Your Highness,

621
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,000
has Young Master Meng never realized you're pretending to be foolish?

622
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,159
If he knew you were hiding your identity,

623
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,320
he wouldn't get angry, would he?

624
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
I think

625
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,440
he noticed long ago.

626
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
He just didn't expose me.

627
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,360
He's having fun at my expense.

628
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,800
Young Master Meng is really romantic.

629
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,199
Not like Lord Yuwen.

630
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,000
I think Young Master Meng is more suitable for you, Your Highness.

631
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,199
Stop playing matchmaker.

632
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,559
Think about yourself instead.

633
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,719
Have you ever thought about

634
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,159
when you'll find a suitable husband?

635
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,079
Why is Your Highness suddenly asking about this?

636
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,039
This servant wishes to stay...

637
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,519
Don't you dare say

638
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,039
"This servant wishes to stay by Your Highness's side forever,

639
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,400
I won't go anywhere,

640
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,119
I don't want to marry."

641
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,559
That's how the loyal maidservants act in dramas.

642
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,400
They all perform like that.

643
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,719
You don't need to be like that.

644
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,280
Really.

645
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,880
What are you saying, Your Highness?

646
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,039
"Stay by Your Highness's side forever"?

647
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,000
"Won't go anywhere"?

648
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,039
"And won't marry"?

649
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,639
Why would I do that?

650
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,760
This servant wishes to stay in the palace.

651
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,880
After Your Highness gets married,

652
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,719
once I've saved enough silver,

653
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,159
and reached marriageable age,

654
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
I'll leave the palace and rent a shop.

655
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,480
I'll sell some pastries and cakes.

656
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,719
Why would I stay by Your Highness's side forever?

657
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,360
You really are an unusual girl.

658
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,400
Your Highness isn't reluctant to part with me, are you?

659
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,199
In my humble opinion,

660
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,840
the person Your Highness will marry in the future

661
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,119
will either be Lord Yuwen or Young Master Meng.

662
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,159
When I leave the palace later,

663
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll rent a shop close to both the Meng Mansion

664
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,920
and the Yuwen Residence.

665
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
That way, it'll be convenient for you to visit me.

666
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:02,880
Don't wait for later.

667
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:03,920
Once we're back in the palace,

668
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,079
I'll beg Father to let you leave the palace early.

669
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,840
So after you leave the palace

670
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,840
and rent your shop,

671
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,039
have you thought about

672
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,679
what kind of man you'd want to marry?

673
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,679
Naturally, one who likes me

674
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,440
and is genuinely good to me.

675
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,719
Then, when the time comes,

676
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,360
I'll give you a whole room full of dowry.

677
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,800
How about that?

678
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

679
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,000
On second thought,

680
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,960
I'd better wait until after Your Highness is married to leave the palace.

681
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,159
Without me,

682
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,719
Your Highness would probably only end up marrying Lord Yuwen.

683
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,159
No, no, no.

684
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,159
What are you muttering?

685
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,039
Nothing.

686
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,679
Your Highness, please rest well.

687
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,840
This servant will take her leave now.

688
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,760
You heard everything clearly.

689
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,960
As expected of Xixi.

690
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,039
She's truly different from ordinary girls.

691
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,559
She's actually a good match for you.

692
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,119
If she really does fall for you in the future,

693
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,440
and marries you,

694
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,800
you must treat her well.

695
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,920
Otherwise...

696
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:21,599
Rest assured, Your Highness.

697
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:22,920
I understand completely.

698
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,039
Yinglu is sure to like this one.
