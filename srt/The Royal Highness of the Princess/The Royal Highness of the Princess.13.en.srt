1
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
Finally found you.

2
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,039
Young Master.

3
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,199
Princess, Meng Mansion's...

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Young Master Meng.

5
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,919
Master Meng, make yourself at home.

6
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
I'll keep watch at the door.

7
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Do you know how hard I've searched for you?

8
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,560
I've scoured the entire Luo Jing.

9
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm sorry, Young Master.

10
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
I wrote you a letter.

11
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't expect you wouldn't see it.

12
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,759
Young Master.

13
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,120
That title is too much for me.

14
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,520
Fifth Princess.

15
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,919
From now on, just call me Shaojue.

16
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,240
I never expected...

17
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
...you were the one coveting my Blackie...

18
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,240
...the wicked Fifth Princess.

19
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
That's all in the past.

20
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,400
Who doesn't have some embarrassing past?

21
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright.

22
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,319
Have you missed me these past few days?

23
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
A Lan missed...

24
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,680
...thinking that I couldn't go to Meng Mansion...

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
...so I couldn't see Yinglu...

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,520
...or see Blackie...

27
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,639
...and couldn't eat the little pears from the little pear tree.

28
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Little pear tree?

29
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
There's a little pear tree behind the garden.

30
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
It's covered in beautiful little pears.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,800
The little pears are so sweet.

32
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,479
The Fifth Princess should know...

33
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
...that's not a pear tree.

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It's a Sacred Fruit Tree, seen once in a century in the southern snow mountains.

35
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,000
That Sacred Fruit Tree is extremely precious.

36
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,759
How does the Fifth Princess plan to make up for it?

37
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
How about... offering yourself in marriage?

38
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,680
Use me to pay for the sacred fruit.

39
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,759
Not a good deal.

40
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,759
How thoughtful of you to consider for me.

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,240
Why did you keep pretending to be foolish?

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,399
I didn't mean to deceive you and Yinglu.

43
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,360
It's just that something happened in the palace.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
I had to act dumb and foolish for a while.

45
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,360
I was planning to go to Meng Mansion to find you soon.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,959
I didn't expect you to find me first.

47
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,120
The most favored Fifth Princess of Yunmi...

48
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,040
...was actually pretending to be an idiot in the palace...

49
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,680
...and came to my Meng Mansion to be a little pig-tending maid.

50
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,079
It's a long story.

51
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,480
I'll tell you slowly another time.

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
By the way, about the pretending to be dumb...

53
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
...no one knows except my Royal Sister and them.

54
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,959
Please keep it a secret for me.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
Since palace affairs are so complicated...

56
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,600
...why not just stay in my Meng Mansion?

57
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,279
I'll keep you safe.

58
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,720
Lord Yuwen.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,959
The score between us...

60
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,920
...we'll settle properly later.

61
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,759
Master Meng.

62
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,040
What score?

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
Why not settle it with this official?

64
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,439
Matters between A Lan and me...

65
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,120
...are none of your business.

66
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,079
She is my betrothed wife.

67
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,639
Her matters are my matters.

68
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
Right, A Lan?

69
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,720
A Lan?

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,560
A Lan?

71
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,279
Yes, you're right.

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,639
Whatever you say is right.

73
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,439
My lord invited Yinglu over.

74
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
I took the liberty of coming along. You don't mind, do you?

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,399
Miss.

76
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,519
A Lan!

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
Stupid A Lan, silly A Lan!

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,519
Where did you go?

79
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,680
Why didn't you return to Meng Mansion?

80
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,240
Do you know how worried I've been about you?

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Miss, A Lan is fine.

82
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
You're not foolish anymore.

83
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,160
The Fifth Princess has just regained her senses.

84
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,519
Brother, what nonsense are you saying?

85
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,079
How could A Lan be the Fifth Princess?

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,279
A Lan is just A Lan.

87
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,199
A Lan?

88
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,079
A Lan really is the Fifth Princess.

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
This cup's temperature is just right.

90
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,959
Thank you.

91
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,160
A Lan... Fifth Princess.

92
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
How did A Lan become the Fifth Princess?

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,879
Anyone but the Fifth Princess.

94
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,319
Yinglu.

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,519
Whether I'm the Fifth Princess or A Lan...

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,040
...I'm still your good friend.

97
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,759
In my room...

98
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,120
...there are some martial arts manuals.

99
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,680
If you like them...

100
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
...I'll pick a few for you to take back.

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,720
How about it?

102
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,560
Really?

103
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
Are they my martial arts manuals?

104
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,800
But since you've already moved in...

105
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,040
...they're yours.

106
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
Then let's go quickly!

107
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,079
If there aren't any really amazing ones...

108
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,079
...I'll ignore you from now on.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,079
Don't worry.

110
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,920
Where's Blackie?

111
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,920
How did it get outside the railing?

112
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,639
Good Blackie, come back quickly.

113
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,720
There are lots of delicious pastries over there.

114
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,839
Come back, I'll let you try some.

115
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
You're not coming back, huh?

116
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
Believe it or not, I'll leave you here...

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
...to keep Lord Yuwen company every day.

118
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,960
To keep Lord Yuwen company day after day.

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,879
Blackie is timid.

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,799
Don't scare it.

121
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,200
So it's timid, huh?

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,639
I thought it was as brave and fearless as Master Meng.

123
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,399
Alright, alright.

124
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,799
I'll go outside and bring it back.

125
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,279
No need for such trouble.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,840
What would you like for lunch?

127
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,559
Meat!

128
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,960
What kind of meat?

129
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,360
Braised pork belly.

130
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,320
What a spineless pig.

131
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,480
With these...

132
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,559
...next time I see that guy named He...

133
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,279
...I'll beat him until he calls me 'Grandma'.

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,039
Yinglu, you know Commander He is...

135
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,000
So he's that 'He the Little Bandit'!

136
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,679
I only just realized it.

137
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
That guy named He is too cunning.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,039
This is going from die-hard fan to anti-fan.

139
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,159
Lord Yuwen really understands the Fifth Princess.

140
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,879
These are all dishes the Fifth Princess likes.

141
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,159
Naturally.

142
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,399
I'm eating. Please don't mention me. Thank you.

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Back at Meng Mansion,

144
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,679
Didn't the princess often have stomachaches?

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,279
It's best to eat less of these greasy foods.

146
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,679
When did I...

147
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,559
I told you long ago,

148
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,399
food from outside isn't clean.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,720
When did you...

150
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
Loving meat is naturally a good thing.

151
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,559
But sometimes,

152
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,559
you should still try other things.

153
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,320
Perhaps the taste

154
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,919
is even more delicious than meat.

155
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,799
When I return to the palace,

156
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,080
I'll invite you all to visit.

157
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,799
Blackie must be eager to go back.

158
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,440
We'll take our leave now.

159
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,639
The gates of Meng Mansion are always open for you.

160
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,960
It's a promise.

161
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,440
We're off now.

162
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,679
Let's go.

163
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,120
Leaving.

164
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,759
My lord.

165
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
This Young Master Meng has even pursued us to our villa.

166
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,799
Look how overjoyed the Fifth Princess is.

167
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,840
Look, even Xixi is on his side now.

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,320
Princess.

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,759
My lord, you... you...

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you still have a chance?

171
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,519
Here.

172
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,879
Blackie won't get off the carriage.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
You can carry him back to the mansion later.

174
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes, Miss.

175
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,039
Young Master Meng, Miss Meng.

176
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,759
What brings you here?

177
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,000
Commander He.

178
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,039
I know all about you and Yinglu.

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I believe in your character.

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,519
But I must warn you,

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
if anyone dares to bully our Yinglu,

182
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,159
I will not let it go.

183
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,559
I understand.

184
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
I came specifically to apologize today.

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,559
I wonder if I could speak with Miss Meng alone for a moment.

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,679
Say what you have to say, quickly.

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
This young lady is very busy.

188
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,279
Regarding the previous incident,

189
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,919
I, He, am at fault.

190
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,120
I mentioned before

191
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
that I would recommend martial arts books to Miss Meng.

192
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,799
So I selected these few and brought them over.

193
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,000
I hope Miss Meng can be magnanimous and not hold it against me.

194
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,759
With these, I'll be able to defeat you.

195
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,799
With just these few, absolutely impossible.

196
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,519
Martial arts manuals like these,

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in my home, fill three walls of four rooms.

198
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,039
Books covering three walls in four rooms.

199
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,879
You've read them all?

200
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,720
However,

201
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,279
given Miss Meng's temperament,

202
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,679
if you wanted to finish reading them all,

203
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,159
a conservative estimate

204
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
would be fifty years.

205
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,360
Fifty years from now,

206
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,120
whether Miss Meng is still in this world

207
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,759
is hard to say, I'm afraid.

208
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,240
You said you came to apologize?

209
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,799
I think you came deliberately to anger me!

210
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,039
Miss Meng.

211
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,000
Was I incorrect?

212
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,360
Correct, my foot!

213
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
I was blind!

214
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,399
I actually thought you were full of integrity back then,

215
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,559
and even took you as a role model.

216
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,519
Miss Meng, where have I offended you this time?

217
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,720
Get out!

218
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,919
No, I...

219
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,320
You come.

220
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,039
Princess.

221
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,360
Last time you asked me

222
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,120
if I had something I wanted to do for myself.

223
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,080
These past two days, I've figured it out.

224
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,200
What did you just say?

225
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,960
I said,

226
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
I know what I want to do in the future.

227
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,840
Back then,

228
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,559
after my lord saved me from the sea of fire,

229
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
I practiced swordplay day and night.

230
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,399
Actually, it wasn't just

231
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
to be able to stay by my lord's side.

232
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,679
More importantly,

233
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,879
I wanted to become someone like my lord.

234
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,240
In times of war,

235
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,799
gallop on horseback, spear in hand, to battle the enemy.

236
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,679
Protect our Yunmi in eternal peace.

237
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,679
In times of peace,

238
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,200
stationed in Luo Jing to deter all quarters,

239
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
so that other nations never dare invade our Yunmi.

240
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,360
I never imagined you were such a Ru Feng.

241
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,000
Keep it up.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,399
My lord.

243
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
This subordinate will leave, will leave.

244
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,360
How are you getting along with Ru Feng?

245
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,240
Quite well.

246
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,279
Ru Feng is a promising, good kid.

247
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,159
I have high hopes for him.

248
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,480
Having high hopes means telling him

249
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,360
not to listen to me in everything.

250
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,039
I was just talking nonsense.

251
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,840
Actually, Ru Feng is extremely loyal to you.

252
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
When I kept him by my side, I told him,

253
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,080
the day he finds what he wants to do for himself,

254
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
he can leave at any time.

255
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,600
What is this?

256
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
I suspect things won't be peaceful lately.

257
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,399
This can be used for self-defense.

258
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,799
Just activate the mechanism,

259
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,039
and it will shoot needles that render people unconscious.

260
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,200
Give me your hand.

261
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,079
Thank you.

262
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,359
This bracelet is very precious.

263
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I have no money, you know.

264
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,559
Who's asking you for money?

265
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,480
Then what do you want?

266
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,480
You'll find out later.

267
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,839
As long as it's not silver, it's fine.

268
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,160
Come, I'll teach you how to activate the mechanism.

269
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
What are you doing here?

270
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,079
Couldn't sleep late at night, came to see you.

271
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,279
Why see me? I'm not a sleeping pill.

272
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,839
Sleeping pill?

273
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,799
What is that?

274
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,480
Something that aids sleep.

275
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,200
Tell the truth.

276
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,720
Why did you come running to me?

277
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,079
The stars are bright tonight, the moonlight is beautiful.

278
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,480
Let's go see together.

279
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,240
Can't sleep in the middle of the night.

280
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you have something on your mind?

281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Need me to offer some guidance?

282
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,359
The stars are bright.

283
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,079
The moonlight is beautiful.

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,519
If not the scenery, looking at a person is fine too.

285
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,079
There are mosquitoes.

286
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,799
Shao Jue, see how loyal my friend is?

287
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,519
Feeding mosquitoes late at night to listen to your troubles.

288
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,920
What did you just say?

289
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,599
It's nothing, I don't need it.

290
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,200
Thanks.

291
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,119
Why aren't you asleep yet?

292
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,119
Young Master Meng treats my villa

293
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,759
like his own back garden.

294
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,240
The back garden of Meng Mansion

295
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,440
is not as beautiful as here.

296
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,359
Shao Jue, it's getting late.

297
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,000
Perhaps you should head back first.

298
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Alright.

299
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,240
Next time, I'll watch the stars with you again.

300
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,720
Next time, I'll visit your residence again.

301
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,960
No need to see me out.

302
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm going back to sleep now.

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There are quite a few mosquitoes here.

304
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,160
You should rest early too.

305
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:22,759
Come here.

306
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,920
What?

307
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,880
I'm heading back first.

308
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,640
You've been bitten by a poisonous mosquito.

309
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Really?

310
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Why would I lie?

311
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
What should I do then?

312
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,039
What are you doing?

313
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Afraid you might faint.

314
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,799
The map left at Meng Mansion

315
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,799
must have been sent back to the palace by Yuwen Rui.

316
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,559
We need to send someone to infiltrate the palace again to find the map.

317
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,920
This matter requires careful planning.

318
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Yuwen Rui has had his eyes on you for a long time.

319
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
Now he's also investigating my identity everywhere.

320
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,960
If he discovers anything,

321
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,240
everything we've done will be in vain.

322
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,160
Are we supposed to just wait idly like this?

323
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,160
Until Yuwen Rui uncovers your identity?

324
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
This Yuwen Rui

325
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,799
has always been our greatest threat.

326
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,640
It would be better to

327
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,079
eliminate the threat for good.

328
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,680
Xixi likes responsible and magnanimous men.

329
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,720
Have you noted all this down?

330
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,599
Princess,

331
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,079
what kind of man do you like?

332
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,880
Someone like our lord here,

333
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,400
what do you think?

334
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,279
Your lord is quite good.

335
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,400
Unfortunately, he's not my destined one.

336
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,440
Then tell me, who is your destined one?

337
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,359
There are so many.

338
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
Like my Royal Sister, Xixi, Yinglu...

339
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,160
They are all my destined ones.

340
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,839
Alright, enough joking.

341
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,680
Regarding the map swap, the assassin wasn't caught.

342
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Did Father Emperor vent his anger on you?

343
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,519
Are you concerned about me?

344
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,559
Who's concerned about you?

345
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,960
His Majesty was naturally furious.

346
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,799
He ordered me to capture the assassin within three days.

347
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,160
And you still have the mood to read leisurely here?

348
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,559
My lord, a message from the Shadow Guard.

349
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,799
What message?

350
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,480
Is it related to Prince Ning?

351
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,359
Prince Ning petitioned His Majesty

352
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,839
to go to the three southeastern provinces to investigate the flood disaster.

353
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
His Majesty consented. He has already left the city.

354
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:10,960
He left the city?

355
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,519
He also took a group of death warriors from his residence.

356
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,519
Investigating the flood is likely just a pretense.

357
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,319
He has another objective.

358
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm afraid he intends to take someone's life.

359
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,559
Who does he want to kill?

360
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,200
If he wants my life,

361
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
it won't be that easy.

362
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,759
Where did Ru Feng die?

363
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,440
How did he die?

364
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,559
Right in the woods at the foot of this mountain.

365
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
As for when he died,

366
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,599
due to the increased mission difficulty,

367
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,559
you will not know when the cannon fodder perished.

368
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
To leave this place,

369
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,839
must one pass through the woods below the mountain?

370
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
If Prince Ning wants to kill someone,

371
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,720
isn't the woods the best ambush point?

372
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,279
Yuwen Rui,

373
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,440
be careful.

374
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,400
Ru Feng,

375
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,720
today you stay with me at the villa.

376
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,279
You are not allowed to go anywhere, understand?

377
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,559
But...

378
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,960
All the Shadow Guards at the villa today

379
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,119
have gone down the mountain with Yuwen Rui.

380
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,240
Besides you, who else can guard me?

381
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,000
Protect me?

382
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,599
Fifth Princess,

383
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,119
I...

384
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,000
If you have something to say, speak up. Why hesitate?

385
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,119
Didn't Xixi say before that after she leaves the palace,

386
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,960
she wants to rent a shop

387
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,079
close to both Meng Mansion and the Yuwen residence?

388
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,359
I recently found a courtyard I like.

389
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,880
I plan to take her to see it tomorrow.

390
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,759
If she likes it, I'll give it to her.

391
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,480
I just don't know if you, Princess,

392
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,039
would allow me to take her tomorrow.

393
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,279
Of course, it's fine.

394
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,400
Not bad.

395
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,160
You even know to buy a house.

396
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,839
If in the future,

397
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,079
Xixi can marry you,

398
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I'll give you a whole house full of dowry.

399
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,119
Thank you, Fifth Princess.

400
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,200
No need for thanks.

401
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,359
We might be family in the future.

402
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,839
Today is your day of death.

403
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Attack!

404
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,880
It smells so good.

405
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,279
Miss Xixi, I...

406
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,480
What's wrong?

407
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,119
Nothing.

408
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,119
Ru Feng!

409
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
Xixi, hurry back to the villa.

410
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,599
Stay with the Fifth Princess. I'll go check on my lord.

411
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,480
But the Princess said you're not to leave.

412
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,359
But I'm worried about my lord.

413
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,759
Princess, Ru Feng went down the mountain.

414
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:28,839
What?

415
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,079
Why are you here?

416
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,519
A severely injured death warrior was found outside the villa.

417
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,559
I'm worried my lord is in danger.

418
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,519
Ru Feng, watch out!

419
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,160
Fifth Princess, A Lan, are you alright?

420
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,000
We're fine.

421
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,400
A Lan.

422
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,400
Come here.

423
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:32,720
Come.

424
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,680
Don't take such risks in the future.

425
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,759
Take Prince Ning back into custody.

426
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,359
Yes.

427
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,240
Prince Ning is indeed no match for Yuwen Rui.

428
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
Proceed as planned.

429
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,160
You infiltrate the villa to rescue Prince Ning.

430
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,559
If rescue is truly impossible,

431
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,839
I understand.

432
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,920
Be careful.

433
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,079
Does it hurt here?

434
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,000
What about here?

435
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,000
Bear with it.

436
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,839
How is it?

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,960
Much better.

438
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,079
My lord, Prince Ning has not yet awakened.

439
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,680
I have confined him to the back courtyard.

440
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
Fifth Princess, are you alright?

441
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
It's all because of me...

442
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,119
It's fine, I'm better now.

443
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Look.

444
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,599
Someone's there. I'll go check.

445
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,559
Be careful.

446
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,279
Stay alert.

447
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:11,960
Understood.

448
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,440
Wake up.

449
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,800
Guards! Someone, help!

450
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,880
Xixi.

451
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,760
Ru Feng.

452
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,320
This mission was truly perilous.

453
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,079
Fortunately, it succeeded.

454
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,320
You seem quite happy.

455
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,360
Of course.

456
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
However, more than the mission's success...

457
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm happier that Ru Feng is alive.

458
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,039
The mission is not yet complete.

459
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,360
How is that possible? Wasn't Prince Ning...

460
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,519
Ru Feng!

461
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,320
Princess, run!

462
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,159
Go!

463
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,239
Ru Feng!

464
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,519
Ru Feng! Ru Feng! Ru Feng!

465
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
Ru Feng! Ru Feng!

466
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,480
Ru Feng!

467
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,039
Ru Feng!

468
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,119
Ru Feng!

469
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:25,960
Come.

470
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,559
Ru Feng... Ru Feng...

471
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,000
My lord, I...

472
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,119
It seems I can only accompany you this far.

473
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,320
It's my fault. I failed to protect you.

474
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,199
My lord, if not for you...

475
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,119
I would have died in the war long ago.

476
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,280
To have stayed by your side...

477
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,719
I die without regret.

478
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,199
Princess, this... please...

479
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,159
Help me give it to Xixi.

480
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,840
No, no! You give it to her yourself.

481
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,039
I won't.

482
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,239
Don't say it's from me.

483
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,599
Just say... it's a gift from the princess.

484
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,320
No, I beg you...

485
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,559
You give it to her yourself.

486
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,519
You give it to her yourself.

487
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,679
No...

488
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,039
My lord and Xixi...

489
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,480
I entrust them to you, Princess.

490
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,920
Ru Feng! Ru Feng, don't! Ru Feng!

491
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,199
Ru Feng, you mustn't! Ru Feng!

492
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,599
Ru Feng...

493
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,840
No! Ru Feng, no!

494
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,599
Ru Feng, don't...

495
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,639
Ru Feng... Ru Feng...

496
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,920
Ru Feng...

497
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
No!

498
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,199
Ru Feng...

499
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,800
Back then...

500
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,719
After my lord saved me from the sea of fire...

501
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,639
I practiced swordplay day and night.

502
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,639
Actually...

503
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,800
It wasn't just to be able to stay by my lord's side.

504
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:49,800
More importantly...

505
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,960
I wanted to become someone like my lord.

506
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,360
In times of war, to ride forth with spear in hand...

507
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,719
To go into battle and slay the enemy.

508
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,599
To protect Yunmi's eternal peace.

509
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,920
In times of peace...

510
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,360
To hold court in Luo Jing, deterring all quarters.

511
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,480
So that other nations would never dare invade Yunmi.

512
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,840
Didn't Xixi say before that after she leaves the palace...

513
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,679
She wants to rent a shop?

514
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,760
One close to both the Meng Mansion and the Yuwen residence?

515
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,800
I recently found a courtyard I like.

516
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,239
I plan to take her to see it tomorrow.

517
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,800
If she likes it, I'll give it to her.

518
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:22,920
I just don't know...

519
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,840
If it would be convenient for you, Princess, to let me take her tomorrow.

520
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,400
He was rescued from a sea of fire.

521
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,039
He held the lofty ambition to slay enemies and serve his country.

522
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,639
He never got to take up his spear and go to the battlefield.

523
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,960
He never got to marry the girl he loved.

524
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,559
Prince Ning has not awakened.

525
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,480
The imperial physician says...

526
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,440
Perhaps he will never wake up.

527
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,400
The mysterious man wanted to silence him.

528
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,360
I will continue investigating the mysterious man's identity.

529
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,079
Xixi.

530
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,599
Princess, what is this?

531
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:15,360
This is...

532
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,679
It's the courtyard I asked Ru Feng to buy for me a while ago.

533
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,800
Didn't you say you wanted to open a shop after leaving the palace?

534
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,119
This is for you.

535
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,239
Thank you, Princess.

536
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,000
I am very sorry.

537
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,079
This mission failed.

538
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,320
If you fail again...

539
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,119
You will remain here forever.

540
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:13,800
Please accept my condolences.

541
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,400
In the past, when I saved people...

542
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,199
It was to complete a mission.

543
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
It was to go home.

544
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,800
But saving Ru Feng...

545
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,199
If I were as skilled in martial arts as my royal sister...

546
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,920
Would Ru Feng still be alive?

547
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:07,920
A Lan.

548
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
This is not your fault.

549
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,679
It was Prince Ning and his men who killed Ru Feng.

550
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,000
Believe me.

551
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,239
I will avenge him.

552
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,679
Master, how is Prince Ning?

553
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,079
The imperial physician examined him.

554
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,599
He may never wake up.

555
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,960
Without Prince Ning as a pawn...

556
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,960
We must act with even greater caution from now on.

557
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,039
To avoid detection by Yuwen Rui.

558
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,280
I understand.
