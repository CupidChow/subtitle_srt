1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,599
Xiao Lizi

2
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,159
Is the Fifth Princess really...

3
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,519
...want to know?

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,879
Same as always.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,799
Tell us, tell us!

6
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,719
The Imperial Hospital is in total chaos now.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,200
They say there's no cure.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,120
His Majesty had to order Lord Yuwen to search far and wide for a skilled doctor.

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
...to treat the Fifth Princess.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,239
Will she be like this for the rest of her life?

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,719
What was the Fifth Princess usually like?

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
Everyone knows.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,919
If she could stay foolish for life,

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,639
it might not be a bad thing.

15
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,599
Trouble comes from the mouth.

16
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,199
Be careful someone doesn't hear you.

17
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't worry.

18
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,919
It's so early in the morning.

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
Who would come to such a remote place?

20
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,360
True.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,800
What do you think...

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,039
...could this matter be related to the Grand Chancellor?

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,840
I heard the death of that Imperial Hospital servant was also...

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
...discussing the Grand Chancellor behind his back.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,560
Don't you value your lives?

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
The way I see it,

27
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,039
all the palace maids and eunuchs right now

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,439
must be secretly rejoicing.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,599
With the Fifth Princess in that state,

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
our lives

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,680
will finally be a bit easier.

32
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,599
I must burn a few more incense sticks for all the gods.

33
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,319
After being in the palace for so long,

34
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,360
I've finally encountered such a great piece of good fortune.

35
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,159
Yes.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Wonderful! It must be my parents who died young

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
watching over me, ensuring my wishes come true.

38
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,919
I only pray that heavenly blessings descend,

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,159
making everything go as I wish.

40
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,000
Who's there?

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
Fifth Princess!

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
Fifth Princess, spare us!

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,199
Fifth Princess, have mercy!

44
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,120
The grapes are gone.

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
This servant understands.

46
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,840
Fifth Princess,

47
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,719
look.

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,719
Is this enough?

49
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,840
I never thought

50
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,560
that I, all by myself,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,199
would raise the happiness index of the entire palace.

52
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,000
Should we award you a Medal of Outstanding Contribution?

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
Rather than giving me some award,

54
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,719
you'd be better off telling me:

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
Was it Yuwen Rui who poisoned her?

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,879
Yes.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Or no.

58
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,599
Both are secrets I cannot divulge.

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,639
That night,

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,719
what the person in the shadows was looking for

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,919
was definitely the Map of the Nine Provinces.

62
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,240
It's a pity you still couldn't escape

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,759
the tragic fate of discovering others' secrets.

64
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,159
In the original story,

65
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,079
the spoiled Fifth Princess secretly left the banquet

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,759
to avoid the marriage arrangement with Yuwen Rui.

67
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,800
And you?

68
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,839
You were running for your life.

69
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,560
No matter what,

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,399
you couldn't shake off this special trait

71
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,040
inherent to your cannon fodder status.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,319
What trait?

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Through a series of coincidences

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,639
and mishaps,

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
regardless of time or place,

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
you always discover others' secrets—the Cannon Fodder Constitution.

77
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,439
The more you know, the sooner you die.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,879
This Cannon Fodder Constitution...

79
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,600
isn't it just trying to get me killed quickly?

80
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,480
After discovering the secret, the original Fifth Princess

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,079
was found by Commander He and brought back to the banquet.

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,439
She bumped into a servant carrying a congratulatory gift,

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,279
touched a poisoned porcelain piece,

84
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
and was accidentally poisoned.

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,759
She kicked the bucket.

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,959
But now, this poison

87
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,319
was placed inside a pill that can cure a hundred poisons.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,120
The other party is quite adaptable, aren't they?

89
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,199
In broad daylight,

90
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,439
hugging and holding each other...

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,680
This is really...

92
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,439
really...

93
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,639
really a feast for the eyes.

94
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,000
Why did the rain suddenly get heavier?

95
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,439
It totally ruins the mood.

96
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,319
Can't you see the handsome guy and the beauty are cultivating feelings?

97
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,879
You think this rain is an accident?

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
To keep them from going back for a while,

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
to have a chance to be alone,

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,439
this heavy rain was created.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Don't try to fool me.

102
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,040
Isn't there a covered walkway?

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
They could just walk along it.

104
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,319
Why don't you try it and see?

105
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,879
Alright, alright, alright.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,399
I won't leave, okay?

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,199
I'll wait until they're done cultivating feelings before I go.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
I should be out in the rain,

109
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,480
not here,

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,720
watching how sweet they are.

111
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,199
The rain is getting heavier.

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
Luckily it wasn't heavy on the way here.

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,879
Otherwise, we would have gotten soaked.

114
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,360
This rain seems to have a spirit.

115
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,959
Every time we practice swordplay together,

116
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
it only gets heavy after we reach the pavilion.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
It's not a spirit at all.

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the Protagonist's halo.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,279
That's why you didn't get wet.

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,519
If I find a way to join the protagonist team,

121
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,680
A cannon fodder wants to sneak into the protagonist team?

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Can't you make some noise next time you appear?

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
Why do you want to sneak into the protagonist team?

124
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't you understand teamwork?

125
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm a powerless, malicious cannon fodder.

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
How can I complete various tasks all by myself?

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,439
For a cannon fodder like you,

128
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,680
it is indeed difficult.

129
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,399
So,

130
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,279
teamwork becomes very important at this point.

131
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,800
If I can form a team with the male and female leads,

132
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,240
then I'll definitely get twice the result with half the effort.

133
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Fourth Sister.

134
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,959
Why has A Lan come?

135
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,480
A Lan came to give Fourth Sister a gift.

136
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,040
Everything inside is A Lan's treasures.

137
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm giving them all to Fourth Sister.

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,519
Do you like them?

139
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,320
This jewelry was originally bestowed upon A Zi by His Majesty.

140
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,039
But later, you insisted you liked it

141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
and forcibly took it away.

142
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
Xixi says

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,480
Fourth Sister likes to look at these.

144
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,600
These few books are the ones I gave to Azi last year.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,159
But later, Azi said she couldn't find them anywhere.

146
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,039
And they're actually with you.

147
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
What is this?

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Speaking of the Fourth Princess of Yunmi,

149
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,519
she is less than five chi tall,

150
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,919
cross-eyed, with a bulbous nose,

151
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,039
her face is hideous, her heart as black as ink.

152
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,320
Every day in the palace, she fools around with people,

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
eunuchs and guards alike.

154
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,039
Fourth Sister, what are you reading?

155
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,679
This play script of yours doesn't seem to be finished, does it?

156
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,799
If I'm not mistaken,

157
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,679
you plan to, after finishing it,

158
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,320
give it to a storyteller outside the palace.

159
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
A Lan is hungry.

160
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,759
Going back to eat grapes first.

161
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Thanks to the original body's blessing,

162
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,720
infiltrating the protagonist group

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,440
is truly a long and arduous road.

164
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,960
Birds of a feather flock together.

165
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,039
It's understandable that the protagonist group

166
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,360
is unwilling to accept you.

167
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
I said, why are you haunting me like this?

168
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,240
I came to inform you

169
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,919
that your next mission

170
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,080
is to save the eunuch Xiao Lizi and Nanny Mo from the Cold Palace.

171
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,720
According to the original plot,

172
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,679
in five days,

173
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,759
Xiao Lizi will die in the library.

174
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Nanny Mo will die in the Cold Palace.

175
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,440
By the way,

176
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
Xiao Lizi is the one

177
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
you threw grapes at today.

178
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,679
Good luck to you.

179
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,159
Princess.

180
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,360
This is the information on Lord Yuwen you requested.

181
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,679
Isn't this prop a bit too casual?

182
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,360
Princess,

183
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,679
properly speaking,

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,080
you should address Lord Yuwen as 'Eldest Cousin'.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,360
Eldest Cousin.

186
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,360
Her Majesty the Empress is Young Master Xiu's aunt.

187
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,679
You address Young Master Xiu as 'Seventh Cousin'.

188
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,039
And the Grand Chancellor is Young Master Xiu's cousin.

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,039
Therefore, it's only right for you, Princess,

190
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,720
to address him as 'Eldest Cousin'.

191
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,879
You had some past conflicts with Lord Yuwen.

192
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,799
Returning the hairpin

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,639
might make him forgive you, Princess.

194
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,399
That day, when the Princess wanted to return the hairpin to Lord Yuwen,

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
this servant thought

196
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,960
the Princess had finally realized Lord Yuwen's good qualities.

197
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,720
I didn't expect such a thing to happen again.

198
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,039
Lord Yuwen.

199
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,600
Eldest Cousin.

200
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,799
The Fifth Princess has never called me 'Eldest Cousin' before.

201
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,799
Is the Fifth Princess...

202
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,200
What on earth did Xixi find?

203
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:42,919
My lord,

204
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,679
it was this servant.

205
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,600
Eldest Cousin,

206
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,240
I asked Xixi to find them.

207
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,960
The Fifth Princess is so interested in my affairs?

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,559
Know yourself and know your enemy,

209
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,080
and you will never be defeated.

210
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,360
Eldest Cousin is handsome.

211
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,559
A Lan likes Eldest Cousin.

212
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,360
Has the Fifth Princess forgotten

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,039
how you tried every possible way to cancel the engagement before?

214
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,159
A Lan likes Eldest Cousin.

215
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Don't cancel the engagement.

216
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,240
It seems the Fifth Princess has indeed forgotten many things.

217
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
You don't remember a thing from the birthday banquet.

218
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,600
Xixi said

219
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
the hairpin must be returned to Eldest Cousin.

220
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,279
Does the Fifth Princess still remember

221
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,639
how you obtained this hairpin?

222
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
You don't remember.

223
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,279
I remember.

224
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,000
The Fifth Princess should keep this hairpin for herself.

225
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,279
The miracle doctor is outside.

226
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,679
When the Fifth Princess is ready,

227
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,720
have someone summon him.

228
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,039
Princess!

229
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,360
Lord Yuwen actually

230
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
gave you such an important thing!

231
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,200
This definitely means he's still willing to marry you!

232
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,919
Even though you're like this,

233
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,000
he still hasn't abandoned you.

234
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,399
His feelings for you

235
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,279
are truly full of kindness.

236
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,240
No.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,919
He wants to kill me.

238
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,919
After all the things the Princess did before,

239
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,559
Lord Yuwen can still let bygones be bygones.

240
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,120
Rumors all say

241
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,519
that offending Lord Yuwen

242
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,159
will never end well.

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,519
It seems

244
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,360
they're all just jealous of Lord Yuwen's handsomeness and talent.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,559
In the future, when the Princess marries into the Yuwen residence,

246
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,080
and later has a child or two,

247
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Miracle doctor!

248
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,559
This servant will go invite him right away.

249
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
Princess, don't be afraid.

250
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,320
Rou'er is not poisonous.

251
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,799
I use it for treatment.

252
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,799
Princess,

253
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,039
this servant heard this miracle doctor was formerly a coroner.

254
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,600
Princess,

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,080
This miracle doctor has tasted hundreds of herbs,

256
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:25,840
and

257
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,919
poisoned himself mute.

258
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,200
My Rou'er! Rou'er!

259
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,440
What illness are you treating?

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,960
My Rou'er is missing!

261
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,279
What's going on?

262
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:50,919
My lord!

263
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
The matter is like this...

264
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
Only the most skilled can treat A Lan.

265
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,120
What?

266
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:08,960
What thing?

267
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,399
What thing?

268
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,440
Rou'er!

269
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,799
Where's my Rou'er? My Rou'er!

270
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,600
Rou'er is missing!

271
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,240
My lord!

272
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,360
This commoner's Rou'er hasn't been found yet!

273
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,600
The Fifth Princess's illness...

274
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
This commoner is powerless to treat.

275
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,840
Please find someone more capable, my lord.

276
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,519
Let's go quickly.

277
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,159
Rou'er is lost!

278
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,080
Princess, rest assured,

279
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,799
this servant will definitely find a way

280
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,600
to restore your mind.

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,680
Evil spirits and malevolent entities,

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,119
disperse at once!

283
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,599
Return the Princess's mind!

284
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,559
Demons, ghosts, and monsters,

285
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,000
show yourselves immediately!

286
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
Otherwise, I'll stab you to death!

287
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,839
Stab you to death!

288
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,519
Stab you to death!

289
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,960
Princess,

290
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,839
the peach wood sword is useless.

291
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,400
Princess, don't worry.

292
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,599
This servant had Xiao Lizi inquire about many folk remedies.

293
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,880
We will definitely cure you.

294
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,079
Bathing in dog's blood every day

295
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,839
Darn it, Xiao Lizi

296
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
How could this method be used on the princess?

297
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
This girl is still somewhat sensible.

298
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,960
What a waste of dog's blood.

299
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,400
Fierce flames to exorcise evil.

300
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,240
No.

301
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,519
Baptism by a virgin boy's urine.

302
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,160
This won't do either.

303
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,480
No.

304
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
This one might work.

305
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,079
As long as the princess can regain her senses,

306
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,920
shaving her head to become a nun is no big deal.

307
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,440
From now on, let your servant

308
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,720
No!

309
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,920
No!

310
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,319
Princess, if you cannot regain your senses,

311
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,960
I... I would have failed Consort Chen.

312
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,519
Princess?

313
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,880
Princess, what's wrong?

314
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,799
I'll go find a royal physician right away.

315
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,519
Wait here.

316
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm fine.

317
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
Princess?

318
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,759
Wonderful!

319
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,319
The peach wood sword!

320
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,559
The peach wood sword really worked!

321
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,519
I... I'll go tell His Majesty at once.

322
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,160
Wait.

323
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,440
Don't tell anyone else about this for now.

324
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,079
Why?

325
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,720
The more she knows,

326
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
the less beneficial it may be for Xixi.

327
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,039
Last night, I dreamed of Chen...

328
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,920
I dreamed of my mother.

329
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,799
She said I've committed too many wrongs,

330
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,200
and I need...

331
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,240
I need to pretend to be foolish and dim-witted,

332
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
endure hardships,

333
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
to atone for my sins.

334
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,319
You're right.

335
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,480
Therefore,

336
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,440
this matter must not be known by others.

337
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,839
Otherwise, all our efforts will be wasted.

338
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,839
I must

339
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,559
continue pretending to be an idiot for a while longer.

340
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,240
Besides,

341
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,319
I've only regained my senses now.

342
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,839
I don't remember many things from the past.

343
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,599
It's better to wait until my memory fully returns

344
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,680
before telling Father.

345
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,000
I understand.

346
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,599
I would die before telling a soul.

347
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,680
Not even Lord Yuwen?

348
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,079
Absolutely not.

349
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,920
By the way, Xixi,

350
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,839
tell me about the Fourth Princess.

351
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,440
My mother appeared in my dream,

352
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,599
telling me to get closer to her.

353
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,839
The Fourth Princess probably isn't willing to get close to you right now.

354
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,319
Why?

355
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,160
I inquired about it.

356
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,200
The play you wrote about the Fourth Princess

357
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,599
was seen by Consort Shu.

358
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,599
Her Highness was so enraged

359
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
that she suffered a heart attack.

360
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,599
Consort Shu...

361
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,599
The Fourth Princess's mother.

362
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,000
She still hasn't woken up.

363
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,200
How is Her Highness?

364
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,240
What did the royal physicians say?

365
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:32,839
The physicians said...

366
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,359
Mother's illness...

367
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,160
Princess?

368
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm afraid...

369
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Princess?

370
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,000
What is it?

371
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,000
The miracle doctor Lord Yuwen invited

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
claims he can cure Her Highness's heart condition.

373
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,599
Really?

374
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,039
Seventh Cousin,

375
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,319
regarding Her Majesty the Empress,

376
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,799
I'll go pay my respects later.

377
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,599
Please convey my apologies.

378
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,200
Alright.

379
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's go.

380
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,960
None of those methods worked.

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,319
I heard yesterday

382
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,920
the princess rushed off

383
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,359
to find that scorpion-raising miracle doctor.

384
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,680
I thought the princess had regained her senses.

385
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,960
The princess sought that doctor

386
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,880
because she was worried about Consort Shu.

387
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,759
Worried about Consort Shu?

388
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,519
It seems the Fifth Princess is truly very ill.

389
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,440
What are you talking about?

390
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,720
The miracle doctor is very eccentric.

391
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,000
He said Consort Shu is merely unconscious,

392
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,799
but he has lost his Rou'er.

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,359
To beg the doctor to treat Her Highness,

394
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,720
the princess searched for that Rou'er all night.

395
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,720
She finally found it,

396
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,400
but her hand got stung, swollen like a radish.

397
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,759
I happen to have

398
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,920
a folk remedy to reduce swelling and pain.

399
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Five qian of silver.

400
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,680
Want to try it?

401
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,960
Does it work well?

402
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,279
It's very effective.

403
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,319
Fine, fine, fine.

404
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,960
About the princess begging the doctor to treat Consort Shu,

405
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,599
you must absolutely not tell anyone.

406
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:49,920
Don't worry.

407
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,400
Hand over the silver.

408
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,599
So the Fifth Princess actually...

409
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,279
Give me the silver.

410
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,799
Fourth Sister.

411
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,839
What happened to your hand?

412
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,640
What's going on?

413
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,200
Sister...

414
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,039
I didn't do it on purpose.

415
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,799
Please be magnanimous

416
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,759
and forgive me this once.

417
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,400
How would I know

418
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,480
if you did it on purpose or not?

419
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

420
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,039
Then, sister, how can I appease your anger?

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,400
Ouch!

422
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,359
Ouch!

423
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,000
Very well.

424
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,519
Just now, while I was feeding the fish in this lotus pond,

425
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,279
unfortunately, my bracelet seems to have fallen into the water.

426
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,440
I wonder if my sister would be willing

427
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,839
to go into the water and help me look for it?

428
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,680
What is this?

429
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,519
My bracelet

430
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,799
accidentally fell into this pond.

431
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,599
Noble Lady Liu insisted on helping.

432
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,359
Isn't that right, Noble Lady Liu?

433
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,559
Yes.

434
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,359
It's just a bracelet.

435
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,160
No need to go into the water for it.

436
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,200
This bracelet...

437
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
was given to me when I first entered the palace.

438
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,640
His Majesty bestowed it.

439
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,839
It holds great significance for me.

440
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,519
If not for...

441
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,960
If not for Noble Lady Liu insisting on helping...

442
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,119
and holding me back from entering the water...

443
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
I surely would have...

444
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,000
found it by now.

445
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,079
A Lan can help.

446
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,599
While they're not looking...

447
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,799
A Lan will help you fall into the water.

448
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,640
To find the bracelet.

449
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,920
Your Highness!

450
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,000
Your Highness!

451
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,559
Help!

452
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:40,920
Help!

453
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,240
Consort Yu is looking for her bracelet!

454
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,799
You all, wait over there.

455
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,200
Help!

456
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,400
Yes, yes.

457
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,160
H-help!

458
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:48,880
Go see.

459
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,160
Quick, find the bracelet!

460
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,839
Fifth Princess, you...

461
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,640
You...

462
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,359
Look, the bracelet is over there!

463
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,240
What are you looking at?

464
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,400
Hurry and get me out of the water!

465
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,799
Yes, yes. You...

466
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,200
What... what is going on here?

467
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,000
Your Majesty!

468
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,680
Rescue them quickly!

469
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
Your Majesty!

470
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,359
Noble Lady Liu had good intentions.

471
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,240
She entered the water to help me find the bracelet.

472
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,200
The Fifth Princess, she...

473
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,160
She also ultimately had good intentions.

474
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,720
You, tell me...

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,599
why did you kick Consort Yu into the water?

476
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,559
A Lan just wanted to help.

477
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,400
Your Majesty.

478
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
The Fifth Princess, she...

479
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,440
didn't do it on purpose.

480
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Your Majesty, please don't scold her further.

481
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,720
Fourth Sister.

482
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
A Lan doesn't understand.

483
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,720
Don't understand what?

484
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,319
Her Highness wanted to go into the water to find the bracelet.

485
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,640
A Lan helped Her Highness into the water.

486
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,759
Her Highness went into the water.

487
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,160
A Lan saw the bracelet.

488
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,039
But then Her Highness stopped looking.

489
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,359
Why is that?

490
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,359
That's right.

491
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,440
Didn't you just say...

492
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,559
you insisted on going down to find the bracelet?

493
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,400
Was it Noble Lady Liu holding you back?

494
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,559
Then why, once you fell in...

495
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,480
did you stop looking?

496
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,079
Your servant...

497
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,799
Your servant...

498
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,880
That bracelet really fell into the water.

499
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,119
Your servant wasn't sure.

500
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:30,880
It's just that...

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,680
Just what?

502
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,440
J-just...

503
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,440
Guards!

504
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,119
Escort Consort Yu back to her palace.

505
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,119
Effective immediately...

506
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
she is confined to her quarters for half a month.

507
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,880
Yes.

508
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,359
No!

509
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,400
Your Majesty, please don't!

510
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,359
Your Majesty!

511
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,759
Your servant knows she was wrong.

512
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,559
Your Majesty, your servant knows she was wrong!

513
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
Your Majesty!

514
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,240
Your Majesty!

515
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,799
Then your servant will also take her leave now.

516
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,759
I heard the miracle doctor treating A Lan...

517
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,640
has a way to cure your mother's heart condition.

518
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
Your son also just heard about it.

519
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,799
I was just about to go see.

520
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,759
Then I shall accompany you.

521
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,480
Yes.

522
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,960
A Lan, what happened to your hand?

523
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
Beloved Minister Yuwen.

524
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,480
You escort A Lan back to the palace.

525
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,839
Your humble servant obeys the decree.

526
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,039
Fifth Princess.

527
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,359
Let's go.

528
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,319
Yuwen Rui saw me kick Consort Yu into the water.

529
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,119
Will he become suspicious?

530
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,119
What is the Fifth Princess thinking about?

531
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,839
So engrossed.

532
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
Thinking about Eldest Cousin.

533
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,519
Eldest Cousin is handsome.

534
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,200
Fifth Princess.

535
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,799
Your jade pendant.

536
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,759
It was indeed him.

537
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,880
If I tell the emperor...

538
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,039
that Yuwen Rui administered the poison...

539
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,839
could he finally get killed off?

540
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,359
With just you?

541
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,839
How could you possibly handle Yuwen Rui?

542
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,319
The original Fifth Princess...

543
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,279
after being poisoned, with her last breath...

544
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,079
accused Yuwen Rui of poisoning her.

545
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,240
But in the end?

546
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,599
Yuwen Rui was still completely unscathed.

547
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,680
The wicked live for a thousand years.

548
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,759
Fourth Sister.

549
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,839
Apply it once in the morning and once at night.

550
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,119
It can relieve the pain.

551
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,400
F-Fourth Princess.

552
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,880
I have other matters.

553
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,839
I'll take my leave first.

554
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,319
If you have any matters in the future...

555
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,519
you can come find me directly.

556
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,920
Yes.

557
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,480
If she wishes to go to Yaohua Palace...

558
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,279
you are to take her there at any time.

559
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,000
Yes, Fourth Princess.

560
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,720
Princess.

561
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
The Fourth Princess's attitude towards you...

562
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
is different from before.

563
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,559
You really seem like a different person.

564
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,880
Not only do you realize Minister Yuwen's goodness...

565
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,359
you've even fallen for Minister Yuwen.

566
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,079
How could I possibly like Yuwen Rui?

567
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,039
Princess,

568
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
liking Lord Yuwen

569
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,519
is something you said yourself.

570
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
Back then, saying I liked him

571
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,640
was only because

572
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
of that lousy booklet you found.

573
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,720
Your servant looked for the picture book

574
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,039
also because

575
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,480
you said you wanted to understand Lord Yuwen.

576
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,759
Princess, don't be shy.

577
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,000
But Princess,

578
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
how did you suddenly fall for Lord Yuwen?

579
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,519
I know!

580
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,359
It must be because Lord Yuwen is deeply loyal.

581
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,480
Seeing the princess in her simple state,

582
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,720
he still, without a word,

583
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,319
gave you such a precious item as the hairpin.

584
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,319
He gave it to you.

585
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,279
The princess couldn't help but be deeply moved.

586
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,359
Lord Yuwen,

587
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,240
are the grapes tasty?

588
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,400
Extremely sweet.

589
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,799
And,

590
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,720
how did you know I stole some grapes?

591
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,079
Be smarter next time.

592
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,000
Don't get grape skins on your skirt again.

593
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,359
The Fifth Princess took poison

594
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,519
and actually managed to survive.

595
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,559
Do we need

596
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,240
to find another way to kill her?

597
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,119
No need to take the risk.

598
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's wait a bit longer.

599
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,519
There's still no lead from the Shadow Gate.

600
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,680
Who would have thought that back then,

601
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
the once-dominant World's Number One Sect

602
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,440
would now vanish into thin air.

603
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,319
The Shadow Gate knows

604
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,119
how to decipher the secrets on the Map of the Nine Provinces.

605
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,880
Its disciples naturally won't appear casually.

606
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,279
The urgent task now

607
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,480
is to find the map first.

608
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,799
Have you found a new miracle doctor?

609
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:07,960
Your Majesty,

610
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,079
not yet.

611
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,279
Your Majesty,

612
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,160
aren't you preparing to choose an auspicious day

613
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,559
to pray for the people

614
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,279
of the three southeastern provinces hit by floods?

615
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Why not take this opportunity

616
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,119
to also pray together

617
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,640
for the Fifth Princess's swift recovery of her mind?

618
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
In the beginning of primordial chaos,

619
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,680
the five elements were not yet in motion,

620
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,240
the two luminaries not yet bright.

621
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,480
Within it stood tall,

622
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,519
existence and void held no sound.

623
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,359
The Divine Sovereign emerged to rule,

624
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,160
first distinguishing the turbid from the clear.

625
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,720
He established heaven and earth,

626
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,519
and all things came to life.

627
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,639
Look!

628
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,000
Your Majesty!

629
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,760
This is an auspicious sign!

630
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,320
Feudal superstition is no good.

631
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,800
This... this is...

632
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,519
What is happening?

633
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,119
Guards!

634
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Light the lanterns!

635
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,519
Yes!

636
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,519
How could this be?

637
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,119
What on earth is going on?

638
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Your Majesty,

639
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,199
lanterns falling on their own,

640
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,159
wind snapping flags...

641
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,480
This... this is an inauspicious omen!

642
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,960
Around the altar,

643
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,400
only the flag in the southeast direction was snapped by the wind.

644
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,639
Thus it can be seen

645
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,599
that within our Yunmi borders,

646
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,199
the southeast must be filled with suffering,

647
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,239
with deep resentment!

648
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,000
Nonsense!

649
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
The flood in the three southeastern provinces has passed.

650
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,480
The people have gradually returned to their former peace.

651
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,639
Prince Ning merits praise for the disaster relief.

652
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,119
How could there be widespread suffering

653
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,199
and deep resentment?

654
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,400
This...

655
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,519
Exactly!

656
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,239
High Priest, you must be mistaken.

657
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,519
Your Majesty,

658
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,000
this matter concerns the nation's fate.

659
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,480
I... I dare not speak recklessly.

660
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,719
Your Majesty,

661
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,280
this is a matter of great importance.

662
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,559
Why not send someone to investigate thoroughly?

663
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,400
Beloved Minister Yuwen,

664
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,880
Your Majesty.

665
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,960
Then I entrust this matter to you.

666
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,519
Your Majesty,

667
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,639
since this matter concerns the people's safety and suffering,

668
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,159
the person responsible for investigating it

669
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,199
must be of upright character,

670
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,320
incorruptible and impartial,

671
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,000
putting the common people first.

672
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,039
I'm afraid the Grand Chancellor is not suitable.

673
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
I urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

674
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,639
Then, Grand Preceptor Meng, tell us

675
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,920
who is more suitable than this official?

676
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,039
Among all the officials,

677
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,800
those more suitable than you

678
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm afraid I couldn't finish listing them anytime soon.

679
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,159
Then, does the Grand Preceptor have a suitable candidate in mind?

680
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,199
Your Majesty,

681
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,159
this humble official is willing to share Your Majesty's burden.

682
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,760
Then I'll trouble the Grand Preceptor.

683
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,320
Be sure to investigate thoroughly.

684
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,239
I will not fail in my mission.

685
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:45,679
Master.

686
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,400
What is it?

687
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,239
The flags are so pretty.

688
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,360
Let's go.

689
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,559
I'll take you back to the palace.

690
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:07,480
Let's go.

691
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,239
This Cannon Fodder Constitution that keeps stumbling upon secrets

692
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
is really going to be the death of me.
