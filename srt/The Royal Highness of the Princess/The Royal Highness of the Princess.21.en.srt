1
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,159
We've been waiting so long.

2
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,719
Why is there still no sign of anyone?

3
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,319
I told you to stay at the residence.

4
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,879
But you insisted on coming with me.

5
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,519
It's been so long since I've seen A Lan.

6
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,760
I miss her terribly.

7
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,719
Now that she's finally returning to Luo Jing,

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,680
I naturally had to come welcome her.

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Brother, you're no different.

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,319
Brother.

11
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,479
I saw the portraits in your study.

12
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,680
The ones you painted in Jingzhou.

13
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,479
What were you doing in my study?

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,639
That's not important.

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
I never expected...

16
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,439
...you painted so many portraits of A Lan.

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,680
Brother.

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,599
You went to Jingzhou to treat the plague,

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,199
and agreed to serve in the court for His Majesty.

20
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,039
Was it all for A Lan?

21
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,199
Don't speak of this to anyone.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
I know.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,479
So when did you...

24
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,159
...start having feelings for A Lan?

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Commander He.

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,759
Brother.

27
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,000
You lied to me.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
I must have been mistaken.

29
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,879
What's going on between you and Commander He?

30
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,639
I heard from the maids at the residence.

31
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,560
While I was away from Luo Jing,

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Commander He...

33
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,280
...kept sending you martial arts manuals for no reason.

34
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,879
What could possibly be between us?

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
He just offended me,

36
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,919
and sent a few lousy manuals as an apology.

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,759
A few?

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,879
What time is it already?

39
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,360
Why isn't A Lan back yet?

40
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll go check over there.

41
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,080
Miss Meng.

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,719
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm waiting for A Lan to return to the capital.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,199
And you?

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,159
By His Majesty's order,

46
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,080
I had some business outside the city.

47
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,039
By the way,

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,439
once you finish practicing with these two manuals,

49
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,800
there will only be one left.

50
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,360
There are one hundred in total.

51
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,120
This final one...

52
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,319
...still has a little content left to complete.

53
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,560
I'll start writing it as soon as I return to my residence.

54
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,439
I'll definitely finish it tonight.

55
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,399
What's the rush?

56
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,839
I haven't even started on these two yet.

57
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,680
I have time tonight.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
I might as well visit you at the Meng Residence.

59
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,879
What I mean is...

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
...tonight, I'll go to the Meng Residence...

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,839
...to deliver the final training manual to you.

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Well...

63
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,839
My father is at home.

64
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,199
He won't let me meet with outsiders casually.

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,839
Then tomorrow...

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,639
...can you leave the residence tomorrow, Miss Meng?

67
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,600
Without a reason, why would Father let me leave the residence?

68
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,079
I should go.

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,759
If you're really that bored tonight,

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,240
wait for me at the back gate of the Meng Residence.

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
A Zi, are you tired?

72
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,120
Would you like to rest in the carriage?

73
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm not tired.

74
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,639
Are you thirsty?

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,959
Would you like something to drink?

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,560
Seventh Cousin.

77
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,519
This entire journey,

78
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,839
you've asked Royal Sister countless times:

79
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,959
"Are you tired? Are you thirsty?"

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Asking so many times,

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,839
aren't you tired or thirsty yourself?

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,879
Eldest Brother has been flipping through that love letter collection.

83
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,160
Why don't you ask if he's tired?

84
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,639
By the way, A Lan.

85
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,160
Give one copy of your love letter collection to Seventh Cousin.

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,639
I'll have the storyteller recite it at the Drunken Immortal Inn.

87
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,439
It's sure to attract many customers.

88
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,160
Are you sure?

89
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,439
Of course.

90
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,040
Even Eldest Brother likes it so much.

91
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,480
Alright.

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,240
Just don't regret it later.

93
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,600
Don't worry, I won't regret it.

94
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,800
In such a short time,

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,959
the plague in Jingzhou has already been controlled.

96
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,560
You truly have not disappointed Us.

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
We heard

98
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,160
you even contracted the plague in Jingzhou,

99
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,680
and nearly didn't wake up.

100
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
At that time, the plague was not yet eradicated.

101
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,040
This commoner dared not fail to wake up.

102
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,040
"Well, dared not fail to wake up."

103
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,839
Speak.

104
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
What reward do you desire?

105
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,720
This commoner has only one request.

106
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,920
I humbly beg Your Majesty to grant the Fifth Princess freedom in marriage.

107
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,959
Good.

108
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,160
We grant it.

109
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,120
When she returns to the palace,

110
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,800
We will inform her.

111
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,319
Could Your Majesty, for this commoner,

112
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,680
conceal the reason for going to Jingzhou?

113
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,519
Tomorrow, you shall begin your post at the Hanlin Academy.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,720
If you have time,

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,439
you may enter the palace to spend more time with A Lan.

116
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Your servant thanks Your Majesty.

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
What did you see?

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,519
To be so delighted?

119
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:55,959
Brother.

120
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,839
Look at A Lan.

121
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
You...

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,120
The grapes are quite good, aren't they?

123
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
I chose them personally.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,720
Of course they're good.

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,399
I had the finest grapes prepared

126
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,959
all along the journey.

127
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,319
Yet I never heard her say a single word like,

128
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,519
"Are you thirsty?"

129
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,399
"Are you tired?"

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
How sarcastic.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,160
Is this alright?

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,759
Brother.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,919
Lord Yuwen and A Lan...

134
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,039
Let's go.

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Opening the secret door to the forbidden area

136
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,799
will reveal the secrets within the Map of the Nine Provinces.

137
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
There is also a key in the Sword Maniac's possession.

138
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,559
Eldest Cousin and I have already sent people to search for it.

139
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,039
Prince Ning actually colluded with the Yunze Remnants.

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,559
You must uncover this person's identity.

141
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Your child obeys the decree. Your servant obeys the decree.

142
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,840
The imperial physician says

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
Prince Ning has shown signs of waking recently.

144
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,720
After he awakens,

145
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,799
We will personally interrogate him.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,720
Do you like it?

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,679
I do.

148
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,639
Princess.

149
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
Your servant and Xiao Li have prepared a gift for you too.

150
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,440
Really?

151
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,960
Let's go.

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
What is this?

153
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,559
It boosts your romantic luck.

154
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,879
It's quite effective, huh?

155
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,320
Princess, don't mind the details.

156
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,399
Xiao Li.

157
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,399
Bring the booklet.

158
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,120
Right away!

159
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,559
Princess, look.

160
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,320
And this is?

161
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,559
All the eligible bachelors in Luo Jing are listed here.

162
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,799
Your servant and Xi Xi ranked them by talent, family background,

163
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,080
character, and appearance.

164
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,080
The first place...

165
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,120
It's obvious.

166
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
...is Young Master Meng from the Meng Residence.

167
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,679
Young Master Meng just returned from Jingzhou yesterday.

168
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,039
His Majesty praised him for his merit in treating the plague.

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,919
He entered the Hanlin Academy directly.

170
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,200
Shao Jue agreed?

171
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,519
Of course!

172
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,240
Personally appointed by His Majesty.

173
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,799
What a great honor!

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,080
A young man who drinks and picks flowers.

175
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,759
Even drunk, his elegance is peerless.

176
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,159
Young Master Meng taking first place

177
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
is well-deserved.

178
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,960
Right.

179
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,080
Brother.

180
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
Are you alright?

181
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm fine.

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,519
A Lan told me before

183
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,600
that she would absolutely not marry Yuwen Rui.

184
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,240
Yuwen Rui must have used some trick

185
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
during the southern trip.

186
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,799
That's why A Lan lost her senses.

187
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Brother.

188
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,600
Next time I enter the palace,

189
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll definitely talk some sense into her.

190
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,720
Make her see the error of her ways.

191
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,360
Turn back from the wrong path.

192
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
I have my own plans.

193
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,879
You don't need to worry too much.

194
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,120
About this matter...

195
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,799
Don't tell A Lan.

196
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,679
The more I draw, the uglier it gets.

197
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,879
The last one is just to fill the list.

198
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,879
That's Lord Yuwen.

199
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,639
Who told him to ask the Princess to cancel the engagement before?

200
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,519
Exactly.

201
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,639
There's something

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
I should mention.

203
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,120
What?

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,320
Your princess

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,519
already has an owner.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,559
Who?

207
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,039
That blob.

208
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,639
What are you looking at?

209
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,600
Lord Yuwen! Lord Yuwen!

210
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,639
Who is this?

211
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,799
You may leave now.

212
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,360
Yes, yes.

213
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,559
A Lan is choosing a husband, I see.

214
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,279
How could that be?

215
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm at the end.

216
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
You heard everything.

217
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,039
Why am I last?

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,759
You have high status.

219
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,840
You're the grand finale.

220
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,000
Back then, you told the Princess

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
to find a way to cancel the engagement herself.

222
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,960
Now you're

223
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,399
being inconsistent.

224
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
What's the real reason?

225
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,720
I know.

226
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,480
You must have seen Young Master Meng cares for the Princess,

227
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,200
and your pride acted up.

228
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,080
That's why you insincerely said you liked her.

229
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,159
Aren't all men like that?

230
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
We're both out here.

231
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
A man and a woman alone...

232
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:49,720
What if...

233
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,200
You go in and check.

234
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,519
No, you go.

235
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
You go.

236
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,679
What does 'high status' mean?

237
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,600
It means you're the most important.

238
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,320
The most important one

239
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,080
naturally appears last.

240
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,240
So can I understand it as...

241
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,759
I'm the most important in your heart?

242
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,279
Wishful thinking.

243
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,480
Then tell me,

244
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,000
who is the most important?

245
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,639
Why should I say it just because you told me to?

246
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,799
If you don't say it...

247
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,639
What then?

248
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,919
I'll...

249
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,519
I'm back.

250
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Matron.

251
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,799
Matron.

252
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,279
Stop running, Matron.

253
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,559
Don't run.

254
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,159
Come, come.

255
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,799
Come play with His Highness the Third Prince.

256
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,960
Matron.

257
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,639
Hurry up!

258
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,799
You should go back quickly. Wait.

259
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:05,919
Matron.

260
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
Let's play together.

261
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,279
Matron.

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,480
Isn't the Third Prince already dead?

263
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240
No, no.

264
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,639
His Highness the Third Prince is not dead.

265
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,320
Your Highness.

266
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,960
Your Highness is not afraid of fire.

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
The big fire is not scary.

268
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,039
Let's play, Matron.

269
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,279
Slow down, Matron. Be careful.

270
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,679
Don't fall.

271
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,080
What's wrong?

272
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,120
Do you remember

273
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,519
the situation after the Xicui Palace fire back then?

274
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
After the fire was extinguished,

275
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,759
the body of the Yunze prince was found.

276
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
It was already unrecognizable.

277
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,120
Melodramas are always like this.

278
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,080
Like falling off a cliff with no body found,

279
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
or a body burned beyond recognition...

280
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,399
Actually, they never died.

281
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,480
I have a feeling

282
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,480
the Third Prince of Yunze might still be alive.

283
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,839
Melodrama...

284
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,519
refers to those unoriginal storybooks.

285
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,359
You're really good at focusing on the key point.

286
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,079
I'll investigate this matter.

287
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,599
I'll come find you tonight.

288
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,119
I need to write a bit more.

289
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,039
If you're sleepy,

290
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,240
go rest first.

291
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,519
If the Princess isn't asleep,

292
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,359
how can this servant rest?

293
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:58,839
Right.

294
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,079
You're not worried Yuwen Rui will come for me, are you?

295
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,279
Wha... what is the Princess saying?

296
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
This servant doesn't know.

297
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,799
Don't know, don't know.

298
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,839
Fine.

299
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,920
Then I'm going to sleep.

300
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,920
If you're worried,

301
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,359
go guard the door.

302
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,240
The Princess is cunning.

303
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,799
Resourceful.

304
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:46,799
Very resourceful.

305
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,839
She's definitely not asleep yet.

306
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,000
Keep guarding.

307
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,200
To secretly meet Lord Yuwen,

308
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,680
the Princess actually climbed out the window.

309
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,960
Find her quickly!

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,759
Princess!

311
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,079
Princess!

312
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,279
Princess!

313
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,359
You little...

314
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,359
Still think you can keep your Princess in?

315
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,720
Who is A Lan waiting for?

316
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,759
Why are you here?

317
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,359
If I didn't come,

318
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,920
you wouldn't think to look for me.

319
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,720
The palace guards are truly useless.

320
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,359
Is everything alright for you in Jingzhou?

321
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,599
With you gone,

322
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,319
of course it's not good.

323
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,759
Can you be serious for once?

324
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,279
Is Yinglu doing alright?

325
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
I even brought her a gift.

326
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,960
She's doing great.

327
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,519
She's busy with more important matters now.

328
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,359
What are you looking at?

329
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,039
Nothing to see here.

330
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,039
Your outfit today

331
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,720
is just like

332
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,720
the green frog in the northeastern border swamps

333
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,519
that feeds on mosquitoes.

334
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
Now you're glaring,

335
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
looking even more like that green frog.

336
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,440
You... are quite cute.

337
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,319
Give it to me.

338
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,240
This booklet,

339
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,920
I started preparing it a long time ago.

340
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,359
Was the hundredth one difficult?

341
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
Not really.

342
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,160
You'll know when you see it.

343
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,359
What is this?

344
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,599
This is you, angry

345
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,759
when your purse was stolen.

346
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,440
This is me.

347
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:00,759
Well?

348
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
It looks quite like me, doesn't it?

349
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,079
Like.

350
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,599
Very much like.

351
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,079
My mother said I

352
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,480
had a talent for drawing since childhood.

353
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,799
Your mother must have doted on you.

354
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,799
This is you chasing me to give me a beating.

355
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,240
This is you practicing martial arts.

356
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,240
This is you holding your bottom and crying out in pain.

357
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,079
Why are you drawing me for no reason?

358
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,160
Look at the last page.

359
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,200
What nonsense did you write?

360
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,680
This is not nonsense.

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,319
I've wanted to write this for a long time.

362
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,359
I...

363
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,319
My heart belongs to you.

364
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,599
Miss Meng...

365
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,359
And you?

366
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,559
I...

367
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
I should go back first.

368
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,640
I...

369
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:40,920
Me too.

370
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,200
So,

371
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,240
Yinglu and Commander He

372
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,319
have actually progressed to this point?

373
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,640
Commander He is quite something.

374
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
You prepared a gift for Yinglu.

375
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,559
What about mine?

376
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
Of course there's one for you too.

377
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,759
It's the same as Yinglu's.

378
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,839
I'll have someone fetch it.

379
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,359
The same as hers?

380
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Then I don't want it.

381
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,480
I want...

382
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,440
just a hug.

383
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,960
Don't be so handsy all the time.

384
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,039
It's not proper.

385
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,440
Remember before you went to Luo Jing,

386
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,160
I told you

387
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
I had something to say to you.

388
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,960
What is it? Tell me.

389
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,839
You're being so mysterious.

390
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,240
First, have a drink with me.

391
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Drink here?

392
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,079
The palace isn't a good place for drinking.

393
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,160
We should go outside the palace.

394
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,240
Consider it celebrating my entry into court service.

395
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,440
How about it?

396
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,559
Alright.

397
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,720
Let me change clothes then.

398
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,359
We'll go early and return early.

399
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,960
Yinglu told me

400
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,480
your reason for refusing to serve in court.

401
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,119
Although I don't know

402
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,759
why you've agreed to it now,

403
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,200
but as a friend,

404
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,759
I still hope you can

405
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,440
do what you love

406
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,960
and live freely and at ease.

407
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,240
Don't worry.

408
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,039
I will never do what I don't wish to do.

409
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,480
Taste this wine.

410
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Crisp with a sweet aftertaste

411
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,400
It's truly excellent wine

412
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,720
I'm glad you like it

413
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,759
Jingzhou's fine wines are renowned everywhere

414
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,680
Among them, the Lover's Wine is the most famous

415
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,839
Lover's Wine

416
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,319
The name is quite lovely

417
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,079
Lover's Wine

418
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,359
It's brewed from the brightest flowers on the snowy mountain

419
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
and the snow from its highest peak

420
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,839
The local people regard the snowy mountain as a deity

421
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,839
If they have someone they love

422
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,839
they will circle the mountain forty-nine times

423
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,599
bowing and kowtowing with each step

424
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,680
praying to the deity to protect their beloved

425
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,279
keeping them safe from illness and misfortune for life

426
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,680
After completing the forty-nine circles

427
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,759
they go to the mountaintop to gather the flowers and snow

428
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,720
to brew a pot of Lover's Wine

429
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,319
How do you know all this so well?

430
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,480
In Jingzhou, I accidentally contracted the plague

431
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,160
I was bedridden for a long time

432
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:57,400
A commoner brewed a pot of Lover's Wine for me

433
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,119
You caught the plague too?

434
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,039
But thankfully, you're fine now

435
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,920
If I hadn't woken up

436
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,559
would A Lan have been sad?

437
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,640
Don't say such unlucky things

438
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,240
Wait

439
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,200
You just said

440
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,960
a commoner brewed Lover's Wine for you

441
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,599
That commoner was a woman, wasn't she?

442
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,319
The daughter of the Jingzhou Prefect

443
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,559
It seems the Prefect's daughter

444
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,000
has deep feelings for you

445
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,039
What we're drinking now is Lover's Wine

446
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,599
The one the Prefect's daughter brewed for you

447
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,039
I have no romantic feelings for her whatsoever

448
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
Naturally, I couldn't accept her wine

449
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,680
But what if this Lover's Wine

450
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,000
was brewed by me, personally for you?

451
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,119
A Lan, you're shocked

452
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,160
I'm teasing you

453
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
This isn't Jingzhou's Lover's Wine at all

454
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,000
It's just Luo Jing's Nuerhong wine

455
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,559
You really scared me

456
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,480
Your acting skills are wasted in this era

457
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,240
This Nuerhong is really quite good

458
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,279
Where did you buy it?

459
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,359
Yuwen Rui would definitely like it

460
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,680
I forgot

461
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,839
I'll tell you when I remember

462
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,480
You and Yuwen Rui...

463
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,640
That's a long story

464
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Is there some happy occasion?

465
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,240
What did you need to see me about?

466
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,880
Regarding the death of the Third Prince of Yunze

467
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,039
I want you to investigate

468
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,759
He might still be alive

469
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,000
And also Matron Mo

470
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,680
have someone keep a close watch on her

471
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,559
Alright

472
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,519
After... after he tested the medicine for me

473
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,079
I... I realized

474
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,680
that I had actually liked him for a long time

475
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,119
So during your trip south

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
so much happened

477
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes

478
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,000
If I had gone south with you back then

479
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,240
would everything be different?

480
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,319
The wine is delicious

481
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,039
Wait a moment

482
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,079
Yuwen Rui is looking for me

483
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,960
Right

484
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,039
Yuwen Rui

485
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,559
Regarding Matron Mo, I will...

486
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,079
You...

487
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,519
Look

488
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,160
Yuwen Rui, he...

489
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,039
will be here to find me soon
