1
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,959
You really have a way?

2
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,879
Of course.

3
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,719
I'll help you.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,359
Give us the key.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Well?

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,359
Let's wait until my wife cools down.

7
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,879
Dear...

8
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,800
Your husband was truly wrong.

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,039
Now, your husband's whereabouts are exposed.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,759
People with ill intentions

11
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,719
have come knocking.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,439
I'm afraid I won't escape this calamity.

13
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,319
I only hope to see you one more time, dear.

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Then your husband can die without regret.

15
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,639
Dear...

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,919
Dear...

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
You finally agreed to see me.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Get lost.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
Kneel if you want to kneel,

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,439
but don't block me from buying groceries.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,360
Move!

22
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
Dear...

23
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,520
You old fool.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,439
Time for the show to begin.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,879
Did you memorize the Jiang Residence location?

26
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,680
Yes.

27
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,639
The one kneeling outside the Jiang Residence is Jiang Cheng.

28
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,800
If he doesn't hand over the key,

29
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,599
show no mercy.

30
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,120
Understood.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,479
Darn it, old man!

32
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,400
Old man!

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,800
Hand over the Secret Key!

34
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,199
Or don't blame my sword for being merciless, old man!

35
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,159
No way.

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,800
Old man!

37
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,360
Old man!

38
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you okay?

39
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,319
Dear...

40
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,240
Your husband fears his time is up.

41
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,439
To see you once more now,

42
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,560
your husband can die without regret.

43
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,719
Hurry up and hand over the Secret Key!

44
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,159
Or I'll kill him!

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
With me here,

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,439
you won't lay a finger on him!

47
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,240
Dear...

48
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,960
Dear...

49
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,240
Your husband might not escape this disaster this time.

50
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,199
Now,

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,319
before I close my eyes, I just want to ask you again:

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Do you still blame me?

53
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,759
You silly old man.

54
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,000
We've been husband and wife for so many years.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,439
When have I ever truly blamed you?

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,800
If we can escape this calamity today,

57
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,639
you mustn't leave me behind again.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,079
How dare you hurt my old man!

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,240
I'll fight you to the death!

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,399
You... w-wife...

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,680
Spare him.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Actually, I...

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,319
I'm not that badly injured.

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,600
You coughed up so much blood!

65
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,639
And you say it's not serious?

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,759
I'll fight you to the death!

67
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,480
I forgot to tell them...

68
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,319
my wife is as strong as an ox.

69
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,319
I'll fight you!

70
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,680
Dear, trying to run?

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,240
Old man!

72
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,160
Old man!

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,879
Dear...

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,519
Are you okay?

75
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,439
Just give them this stupid key!

76
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,839
This Secret Key is of great importance.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,959
How can I give it away casually?

78
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,600
But you already promised them!

79
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,240
What,

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
are you going back on your word?

81
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,600
You...

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,879
Master Jiang.

83
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,759
I know this Secret Key is precious.

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
So,

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,439
I specially prepared a great gift to exchange with you.

86
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,240
This is...

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
A peerless qin manual.

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,199
You...

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,079
This collection of love letters...

90
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,279
is written in the same style as yours, sir.

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
If Madam finds out

92
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,720
and thinks you wrote them to Xia Yuhe...

93
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,160
Then...

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
What do you say, sir?

95
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,279
You like this qin manual, right, sir?

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,839
I hope you use this item to walk the righteous path.

97
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,000
Whether it brings fortune or calamity,

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
take good care of yourselves.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,519
Don't worry, senior.

100
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,959
Actually,

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,959
we have another great gift for you.

102
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,160
No, no, no, that's not necessary.

103
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,720
Th-thank you.

104
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,839
Master Jiang, no need to refuse so hastily.

106
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,399
The *real* peerless qin manual.

107
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,279
Thank you for giving us the Secret Key, sir.

108
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,560
This is truly wonderful.

109
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
We return to Tianyin City tomorrow.

110
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,480
Did you send word to the Princess and the others?

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,879
What are you looking at?

112
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,800
I had Chen Liang go to Master Jiang's place

113
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,959
to get the peerless qin manual.

114
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,879
You got that love letter collection back?

115
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,040
Cloudy days, rainy days, none compare to chatting with you.

116
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
When I'm with you,

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,680
I often catch a chill.

118
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,519
Because I have zero resistance to you.

119
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Even when you're silent,

120
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,839
the world feels noisy to me.

121
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,720
Because my head is filled

122
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,759
with the sound of your voice.

123
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,960
Stop reading that!

124
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
We just finished eating.

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,799
You know so many sweet nothings.

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,639
No wonder the fortune-teller said you'd have three husbands and four lords.

127
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,039
How do you still remember that nonsense?

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,960
What do *you* think?

129
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,440
You move aside first.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
Why are you nervous?

131
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,879
I...

132
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,320
What do I have to be nervous about?

133
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,639
Is that so?

134
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,039
Say something for me to hear.

135
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,000
S-say what?

136
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,879
Say what I want to hear.

137
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,639
If you don't say it...

138
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,159
My lord.

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,919
My lord.

140
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,440
My lord.

141
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,320
Sir

142
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,919
I've identified the pattern on that medicine bottle.

143
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,440
Before the Yunze royal family fell,

144
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,840
they used this totem

145
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,639
as an auspicious symbol for protection.

146
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,639
It was reserved for royal use.

147
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,679
So all of this is connected to Yunze.

148
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,720
No wonder the mysterious man wants the Nine Provinces Map.

149
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,799
He has been plotting this for a long time.

150
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,080
He won't stop until he gets the treasure map.

151
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,360
Send a message to His Majesty.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
Make sure he is informed of this.

153
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,399
Understood.

154
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,240
By the way,

155
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:22,960
Sir,

156
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,360
the carriages and horses are ready.

157
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,720
We can depart for Tianyin City

158
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
tomorrow at any time.

159
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,519
I'm a bit tired.

160
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll go rest first.

161
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,480
Two one nine.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Five six one.

163
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,840
Seven eight two.

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
The words you wanted to hear...

165
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,279
Fourth Sister!

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,399
A Lan!

167
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I missed you so much!

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,399
How was your journey?

169
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,080
Where's Seventh Cousin?

170
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,919
He went to buy you all some treats, of course.

171
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,279
Tianyin City has many local delicacies.

172
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:34,960
A Zi,

173
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,720
I bought a lot for you.

174
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,720
All your favorites.

175
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,559
There's something off about you two.

176
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,559
You and my fourth sister.

177
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,200
Impressive, Seventh Cousin.

178
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,399
A few days apart,

179
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,080
and you've already swept my sister off her feet.

180
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,679
You're one to talk.

181
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,399
What's going on with you and Eldest Brother?

182
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,399
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

183
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Not bad.

184
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,960
You're quite perceptive.

185
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,559
Easy there.

186
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,480
My injury just healed.

187
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,519
A Zi, look at her!

188
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,240
No respect for her elders!

189
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,039
Getting handsy!

190
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,519
Here, have this.

191
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,399
Eat more, talk less.

192
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,519
Right, A Zi?

193
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,399
A gentle nest is a hero's grave.

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
If my lord cannot sever all ties of affection,

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
then even if I must die,

196
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,919
I cannot watch my lord stray down this misguided path.

197
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,960
Are you saying

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,200
the mysterious man is connected to Yunze remnants?

199
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,080
Yes.

200
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,960
Third Imperial Uncle actually colluded with Yunze remnants?

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,279
The mysterious man wants to know the secrets of the Nine Provinces Map.

202
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,559
He will definitely act again.

203
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,080
We will depart for the capital today.

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,039
Leaving today, sirs?

205
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,960
Tonight is the Qixi Festival.

206
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,799
Our little town's lantern fair is quite lively.

207
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Missing it would be a pity.

208
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,799
Qixi Festival...

209
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,519
Eldest Brother,

210
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,879
why don't we return to the capital after Qixi?

211
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,960
A Zi, look!

212
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,840
Come on!

213
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,240
Everyone, feel free to look!

214
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,159
Take your pick!

215
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,200
Which one do you like?

216
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,960
I'll buy it for you.

217
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,360
I want to make one by hand for you.

218
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,039
Handmade shows more sincerity.

219
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,799
This young master treats his dear so well.

220
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:58,919
Eldest Brother,

221
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,519
do you know how to make clay figures?

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,639
Want to make one for A Lan too?

223
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:08,879
No need.

224
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,600
She doesn't like such things.

225
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
Is it that A Lan doesn't like them,

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,639
or that you don't know how, Eldest Brother?

227
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,000
Eldest Brother, since childhood, you've either practiced martial arts or read books.

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,559
I've never seen you play with anything.

229
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,919
It's just making clay figures.

230
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,919
How could I not know how?

231
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,840
I like clay figures.

232
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,480
I really want one.

233
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,159
Try it.

234
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,559
Don't regret it.

235
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,679
A Zi, how is it?

236
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
Making clay figures?

237
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:09,919
Why are you looking at me?

238
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,480
If I don't look carefully,

239
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,120
how can I make it look like you?

240
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,000
Turn around.

241
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Don't move.

242
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,080
Stop making it.

243
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,759
Let's go look somewhere else.

244
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,720
Look.

245
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,000
Sorry.

246
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,039
Be careful.

247
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,240
Let's go.

248
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:10,960
Let's go see.

249
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:29,840
I've drawn it.

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,159
Yours is...

251
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,399
I...

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,799
Mine probably means the same as yours.

253
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,120
Long-lasting.

254
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,559
Why is your face red?

255
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:22,759
It's hot.

256
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,599
Sir.

257
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,559
Wait for me a moment.

258
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,240
I'll be right back.

259
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,519
You go ahead with your business.

260
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,119
It's snowing.

261
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:47,960
It's not snow.

262
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,519
Someone is scattering pear blossom petals.

263
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,039
Sharing a snowfall together...

264
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,319
means growing old with you.

265
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,000
This hairpin suits you perfectly.

266
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,240
The words you wanted to tell me that night,

267
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,119
I've already deciphered them.

268
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,279
What words?

269
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,640
Two one nine.

270
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,720
Five six one.

271
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,119
Seven eight two.

272
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,400
Two one nine refers to page two of the love letter collection,

273
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,880
first line, ninth character.

274
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,279
The whole string of numbers is...

275
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,160
Is what?

276
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
I love you.

277
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,079
I love you.

278
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,920
A Zi!

279
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,640
Look!

280
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
I bought a lot of lotus lanterns.

281
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,759
You can make as many wishes as you want.

282
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,039
We'll make them slowly tonight.

283
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,400
One is enough.

284
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,440
Okay.

285
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:39,960
Here.

286
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,920
If you have too many wishes,

287
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,519
wouldn't that be too greedy?

288
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,240
The bright moon hangs in the sky

289
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,079
Witnessed by countless lanterns

290
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,799
I, An Kezi

291
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Only wish that Seventh Cousin's heart holds a desire

292
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,079
And if he has a wish

293
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,759
How I wish time would stop at this moment

294
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:52,640
Azi

295
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,039
Wait for me here

296
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,240
I'll be right back

297
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,680
Miss

298
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,799
Buy a Qiqiao cake

299
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,759
Freshly baked

300
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
Fragrant and crispy

301
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,200
If I don't sell all the cakes today

302
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,559
My wife will scold me again when I go back

303
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,119
Old man

304
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
Give me two, please

305
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,319
Alright

306
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,799
Miss, try it quickly

307
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,559
They're all made by my wife's own hands

308
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,720
They're very tasty

309
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
That old man selling Qiqiao cakes is really strange

310
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Yeah

311
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,279
He actually refused to sell the cakes to us

312
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,799
Forget it. It's rare for us to come out

313
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,480
Let's enjoy the lanterns

314
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,440
Azi

315
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,400
Don't eat that

316
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,119
Did you eat it?

317
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,400
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

318
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,240
I hadn't even taken a bite

319
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,119
before you knocked it away

320
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,359
What's wrong?

321
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,759
There's something wrong with this cake

322
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,160
I just heard people say

323
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,519
Several people

324
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,400
got diarrhea after eating his Qiqiao cakes

325
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,799
They're probably unclean

326
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,839
It's good that you're fine

327
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,480
Azi

328
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,079
Every year from now on, on Qixi Festival

329
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:28,839
Will you stay by my side?

330
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,319
Alright?

331
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,839
Tianyin City's Qixi Festival is really fun

332
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,839
Is it the festival that's fun?

333
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,799
Or is it the person by your side?

334
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,680
You're praising yourself in a roundabout way

335
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Alan

336
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,519
I bought your favorite grapes

337
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,039
We really are in sync

338
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,519
I bought you a Qiqiao cake

339
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,200
Try it

340
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,559
You didn't buy it from an old man, did you?

341
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,920
No, I didn't

342
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:28,759
Why?

343
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,000
It's good that you didn't

344
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,480
Seventh Cousin and I

345
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,400
encountered an old man selling Qiqiao cakes

346
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,319
His cakes seemed unclean

347
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,279
Seventh Cousin heard

348
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,279
that some people who bought his cakes

349
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,400
got sick to their stomachs

350
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,519
That old man was very strange

351
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,799
This cake is delicious

352
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Azi, you should try it quickly

353
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,960
Very good

354
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,039
Very good

355
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,480
Truly worthy of being my top subordinate

356
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,559
To actually act on your own

357
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,759
Attempting to poison the Fourth Princess of Yunmi

358
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,920
Such loyalty

359
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,799
My lord, please calm your anger

360
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,839
Your subordinate saw you entangled with the Fourth Princess

361
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
That's why I resorted to this plan

362
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,480
If my lord is bound by romantic feelings

363
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
How can you achieve the great undertaking?

364
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,200
Everything I have done

365
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,559
has been for you

366
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,160
For the great cause of restoring our nation

367
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,319
It seems I cannot distinguish right from wrong

368
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,279
Your subordinate wouldn't dare

369
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,400
What wouldn't you dare?

370
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,680
My lord

371
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,480
As the saying goes

372
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,799
Honest advice is hard to accept

373
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,119
Even if you blame me today

374
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I absolutely cannot stand by and watch

375
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,079
you remain entangled with the Fourth Princess of Yunmi

376
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
Sinking deeper into the mire

377
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,160
I know my own limits in my affairs

378
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,480
I don't need you to criticize me

379
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,480
Since ancient times, beauties bring disaster

380
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
You cannot have both the fish and the bear's paw

381
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
If my lord does not wake up soon

382
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,680
I fear you will become addicted to the land of tenderness.

383
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,599
It will hinder the great cause of restoration

384
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,200
In that case

385
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,880
How will you face the late former emperor?

386
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,599
How will you face the souls of Yunze on the road to the underworld?

387
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
After today

388
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,759
if you dare act on your own again

389
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,519
it will be a path to certain death
