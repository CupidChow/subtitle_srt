1
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,159
Drama Spirit

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Drama Spirit

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Come out quickly.

4
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,439
I need to talk to you.

5
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,640
Forget about saving the herb for now.

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
What do you want?

7
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,159
This Ephemeral Frost Herb...

8
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,719
can indeed cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Right?

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,280
If this Ephemeral Frost Herb doesn't bloom,

11
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,359
it's no different from a weed.

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,919
Eldest Cousin.

13
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,400
I just saw Carpenter Li

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
when the poison took effect.

15
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,560
It was truly a fate worse than death.

16
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,800
This time, listen to me.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,479
Let's hurry back to the capital.

18
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,319
Have His Majesty summon the best doctors for you.

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,719
No need.

20
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,400
But...

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,080
Where did you find the Ephemeral Frost Herb?

22
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,360
In the miasma forest.

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Think carefully about the exact spot.

24
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,680
Maybe I can think of a way to make it bloom.

25
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,039
The exact spot...

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
was under a withered ginkgo tree.

27
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,719
A ginkgo tree...

28
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,759
Let me think of another way.

29
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,560
Eldest Cousin.

30
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,199
About you being poisoned...

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,719
You really won't tell A Lan?

32
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,159
She doesn't need to know.

33
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,080
Zixiu.

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
You must help me keep this secret.

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,919
Please bless us.

36
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,199
Let's go check it out.

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,039
Please bless us.

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Please bless us.

39
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,560
Bless us.

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Bless us.

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,039
Please bless us.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,000
Bless us, bless us.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
What are they doing?

44
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,080
The matter of my young master seeking test subjects

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,479
has spread throughout the city.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
Everyone is terrified.

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,039
Today happens to be a day for prayers.

48
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,000
Everyone is thinking of going to Tianyin Temple to pray.

49
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,240
Second Master Luo was taken by Pan Yu.

50
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Second Master Luo's death is no loss.

51
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm just afraid Pan Yu

52
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,199
will take his anger out on Tianyin City's innocent people.

53
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,680
Let's go to Tianyin Temple.

54
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,759
Eldest Cousin.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,919
But your poison...

56
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,319
It's fine.

57
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,960
Tell A Lan

58
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,159
we're going to Tianyin Temple.

59
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, Young Master.

60
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,560
Let's go.

61
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,360
Murder!

62
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,720
Open the door! Open up!

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,319
Darn it!

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
This door can only be opened from the other side.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,199
What do we do?

66
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,439
Murder! Murder!

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
Run!

68
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,040
Young Master Pan.

69
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,199
You must stop this.

70
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,319
Siqing's poison took effect last night.

71
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,199
She hasn't woken up yet.

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
She won't last the day.

73
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,120
None of this has anything to do with the city's people.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,879
Don't harm the innocent.

75
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,519
Siqing, like you,

76
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,639
cared for the city's people.

77
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,560
But who will pity her?

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,639
She loved Tianyin City.

79
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,680
She loved the people here.

80
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,000
Fine.

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
Then I'll have them...

82
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,519
have them all accompany her to the grave.

83
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,240
Help!

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,560
Help!

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Open the door!

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Help!

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Open up!

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,399
After they're all dead,

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,519
I'll go down to join her.

90
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,680
That way, she won't be too lonely.

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,680
Zixiu.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,680
Protect the people.

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,680
Understood.

94
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,480
Eldest Cousin! Brother!

95
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,120
You're poisoned with the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

96
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,879
How could you possibly be a match for me?

97
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,120
I've tried every possible method.

98
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,879
What exactly have I missed?

99
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,720
But I can only give you one hint.

100
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,720
Far away in the horizon,

101
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,439
yet right before your eyes.

102
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,720
Far away in the horizon,

103
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,720
yet right before your eyes.

104
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
Yuwen Rui said

105
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,079
he found it under a withered ginkgo tree.

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,480
Could it be...?

107
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,399
It all depends on this.

108
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,919
It's no use!

109
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,240
Where are they?

110
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,480
That's right.

111
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,559
They went to Tianyin Temple.

112
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,720
They asked me to tell you.

113
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,519
A Zi.

114
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,200
A Zi.

115
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,639
Seventh Cousin.

116
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,559
Zixiu.

117
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,919
Seventh Cousin.

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,080
Seventh Cousin.

119
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,759
A Zi.

120
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,399
Seventh Cousin.

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm fine.

122
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,559
How could you possibly be fine?

123
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,000
Really, don't worry.

124
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,679
Siqing doesn't have much time left.

125
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,360
Then I'll have you pave her way to the underworld.

126
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,480
Open the door!

127
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,399
Lord Grand Secretary.

128
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,639
You can't protect them.

129
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,840
I don't want to kill you.

130
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,039
Enough talk.

131
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,519
Then I'm sorry.

132
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,879
Eldest Cousin!

133
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
Stop!

134
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,080
A Lan.

135
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,080
Fourth Sister.

136
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,879
Are you alright?

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,759
Young Master Pan, do you still wish to save Miss Lin?

138
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,039
This Ephemeral Frost Herb in my hand

139
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,639
can cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin.

140
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,279
A single white flower?

141
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,240
Miss A Lan, are you trying to fool me?

142
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,120
If it were just an ordinary white flower,

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,399
why would I go to such lengths to find it?

144
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Well?

145
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Go quickly.

146
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,039
You're poisoned.

147
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,120
You... you tested the medicine for me?

148
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,240
I will definitely save you.

149
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,039
Young Master Pan

150
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,919
In this world

151
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,039
the only thing that can cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb

152
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,240
is the Ephemeral Frost Herb in my hand.

153
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,639
How can I trust you?

154
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,639
Believe it or not.

155
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,399
But Miss Lin

156
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
probably can't wait for you to hesitate any longer.

157
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Fine.

158
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll trust you this once.

159
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
One Ephemeral Frost Herb cannot fully cure the poison.

160
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
How to find the Ephemeral Frost Herb

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and how to make it bloom

162
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,039
are known only to me.

163
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,080
To completely cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin,

164
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,679
one must take the antidote for forty-nine consecutive days.

165
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,799
What do you want?

166
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,720
I can give you the Ephemeral Frost Herb.

167
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,000
But you must promise me

168
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
that after you refine the antidote today,

169
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,159
aside from Miss Lin's portion,

170
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
you must give the remainder to me.

171
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,039
Then I will tell you how to find the Ephemeral Frost Herb.

172
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,879
Alright.

173
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,960
No problem.

174
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,120
If I don't receive the antidote today,

175
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
you'll never find a second herb in your lifetime.

176
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
If I can't save Siqing,

177
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
none of you will leave Tianyin City alive.

178
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,759
Yuwen Rui!

179
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,399
Yuwen Rui!

180
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,759
Yuwen Rui!

181
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
Yuwen Rui!

182
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,039
How is Eldest Cousin?

183
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,559
And Seventh Cousin?

184
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,639
His wound has been bandaged.

185
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,240
He just needs to rest well for a few days.

186
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,919
That Ephemeral Frost Herb...

187
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,039
Can it really cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb?

188
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,159
Most likely.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's just unknown if Pan Yu

190
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,919
can successfully refine the antidote.

191
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,759
I'll have someone prepare medicine for Eldest Cousin.

192
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't think that because you did this,

193
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
I'll be grateful to you.

194
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,840
If Pan Yu fails to refine the antidote...

195
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,759
If you...

196
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,399
Then I'll resent you for life.

197
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,639
I'll never forgive you, even unto death.

198
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,639
Who told you to take it upon yourself to test some medicine for me?

199
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,200
And what's this about sending a message to Father Emperor

200
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,879
to cancel the marriage arrangement?

201
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,279
If you're okay,

202
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,039
this time,

203
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,039
I won't hold it against you.

204
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,759
Royal Sister...

205
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,840
What time is it?

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,720
It's midnight.

207
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,039
Midnight...

208
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,120
Pan Yu still hasn't delivered the antidote.

209
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,360
Could the antidote refinement have failed?

210
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,320
Yuwen Rui!

211
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,919
I'll go find a doctor!

212
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,080
How are you feeling?

213
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,080
I didn't tell you

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,519
because I was afraid you'd be like this.

215
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,080
About testing the medicine for you...

216
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
If anything happens to you,

217
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,399
I will absolutely never forgive you, you know that?

218
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
As long as you're okay,

219
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,279
I'll be fine no matter what.

220
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
Listen to me.

221
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
Right now,

222
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,480
leave Tianyin City immediately.

223
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,880
Live well.

224
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,920
But if I...

225
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,240
No!

226
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,759
You won't be in danger.

227
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,279
You won't be in danger.

228
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,200
You won't be in danger!

229
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,240
A Zi...

230
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,039
Let me help you.

231
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:08,720
Here.

232
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,400
Where are Big Brother and the others?

233
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,359
They went to see Pan Yu.

234
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,599
It's fine.

235
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,319
It'll be completely healed in a few days.

236
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:29,960
Does it hurt a lot?

237
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,319
No, it doesn't hurt.

238
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,799
When you fought Pan Yu,

239
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,000
why did you take the sword strike for me?

240
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,960
I...

241
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,839
I didn't think that much at the time.

242
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,400
Seventh Cousin...

243
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,079
You like me too,

244
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,200
right?

245
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,599
I...

246
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
You do like me!

247
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,960
A Zi...

248
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,799
You are the noble Fourth Princess of Yunmi.

249
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,599
And I...

250
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,759
I'm just a member of the Yuwen family,

251
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,960
a good-for-nothing playboy with no ambition.

252
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
Why worry about all that?

253
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,319
You like me.

254
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,640
I like you too.

255
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:57,680
That's enough.

256
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm afraid you'll regret it in the future.

257
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,200
Being with the one you love,

258
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,960
what is there to regret?

259
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,920
Thank you for finding the Ephemeral Frost Herb

260
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,920
and saving my life.

261
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:10,960
It's nothing.

262
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,160
Fortunately, no innocent citizens died because of you.

263
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,119
Otherwise, this official wouldn't let you leave so easily.

264
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,920
It was my mistake.

265
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,440
From now on, I will travel the world with Siqing,

266
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,279
healing the sick and saving lives.

267
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,720
I will not harbor thoughts of killing again.

268
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,880
If you break your word...

269
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,519
Rest assured.

270
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,079
I, Pan Yu, am a man of my word.

271
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,319
It's Miss A Lan who is full of lies.

272
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,839
She actually tricked me, saying

273
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,680
the antidote must be taken for forty-nine days.

274
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,160
If I hadn't said that,

275
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,599
what if you refined the antidote

276
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,680
and didn't give it to me?

277
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,440
Since it's an immortal herb,

278
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,960
naturally there's only this one.

279
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,519
That thing is useless for you to keep.

280
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,960
But it's useful for them.

281
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,319
So give it to them.

282
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,160
The secret of the Map of the Nine Provinces

283
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,519
was known only to the leader of Shadow Gate.

284
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,880
Before his death, he hid the treasure map's secret

285
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,400
within Shadow Gate's forbidden sanctuary.

286
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,599
Where is this sanctuary?

287
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,920
I only know it's in Luojing.

288
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
The exact location

289
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,200
you'll have to find for yourselves.

290
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,440
This key can open the sanctuary,

291
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,359
but three keys are required.

292
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,119
Before the leader died,

293
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,880
he entrusted the three keys separately to me,

294
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,160
the Lute Fanatic, and the Sword Fanatic.

295
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,319
The Lute Fanatic is currently hiding in Dongyang City.

296
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
The Sword Fanatic, however, has no fixed abode.

297
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,319
Love Fanatic?

298
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,319
Lute Fanatic.

299
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
Shadow Gate isn't very particular with names, is it?

300
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,319
What if someone mispronounces the nasal sounds?

301
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
The flower has been used to make the antidote.

302
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,960
All that remains is this.

303
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
Since this Ephemeral Frost Herb is so unique,

304
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,880
take good care of it.

305
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,119
It might bloom again someday.

306
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Then let's go.

307
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,880
Farewell.

308
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,160
We should go too.

309
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
You rest well first.

310
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,440
I'll have the kitchen prepare some food for you.

311
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,599
I'm not hungry.

312
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,160
Stay with me a little longer.

313
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,160
From now on,

314
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,240
I will never push you away again.

315
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,039
Young Master Zixiu.

316
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:56,720
Enter.

317
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,519
Young Master.

318
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Is your wound feeling better?

319
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,240
Miss A Zi.

320
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,559
I came to ask you something.

321
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Go ahead.

322
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,759
My young master...

323
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,559
Will he ever return to Ren'an Hall?

324
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,480
Of course.

325
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,759
After all that has happened,

326
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,720
how could Miss Lin be willing

327
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,839
to stay in Tianyin City?

328
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,319
In my heart,

329
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,480
both my master and Miss Lin are good people.

330
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,319
If not for how Second Master Luo and the others treated Miss Lin,

331
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,000
my master wouldn't have...

332
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,640
Fortunately, Miss Lin was cured.

333
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,559
Yes.

334
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,839
Young Master.

335
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,039
You should rest properly first.

336
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,160
I'll take my leave now.

337
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,400
Shadow Gate's Yun Shang is indeed as the rumors say:

338
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,319
he loves his wife more than life itself.

339
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,079
But I can understand him.

340
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,559
If you were ever not by my side,

341
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,519
I'm afraid I'd be even more frantic than him.

342
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,079
Don't worry.

343
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,000
I won't leave you.

344
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,799
It's already like this.

345
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,480
Can it still survive?

346
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,160
Are you alright?

347
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm fine.

348
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,079
Go.

349
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,839
After them!

350
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,920
Lord Grand Secretary.

351
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
Your serious injury hasn't healed.

352
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,640
You're probably no match for us.

353
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,119
Who sent you?

354
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,640
What did Shadow Gate's Yun Shang tell you?

355
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,599
The brocade box he gave you...

356
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,839
does it relate to the secret of the Map of the Nine Provinces?

357
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,640
If you tell me everything truthfully,

358
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,119
perhaps I can spare both your lives.

359
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,960
You think you can?

360
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,079
Attack!

361
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,720
Yuwen Rui!

362
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:49,839
Are you okay?

363
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,920
I'm fine.

364
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,000
Go find the Master.

365
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:20,799
Let's go.

366
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,279
The mysterious person has been quiet all along

367
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,680
just waiting for today.

368
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,279
The assassins think they've found

369
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,599
a clue to decipher the treasure map.

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,279
They'll report to the mysterious person immediately.

371
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,240
They'd never expect

372
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,720
we already have agents secretly following them.

373
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,839
You just fought the assassins

374
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,079
and fell into the water.

375
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,960
Are your injuries really okay?

376
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,359
So worried about me?

377
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,400
Who's worried about you?

378
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,160
I was just thinking,

379
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,400
if you collapse here,

380
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,799
I'd have to struggle to get you back to Ren'an Hall.

381
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,000
What's wrong?

382
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,480
Did your wound reopen?

383
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,400
Let's go.

384
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:38,799
Careful!

385
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,480
Master.

386
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,319
The contents of this brocade box

387
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,880
must be the key to unlocking

388
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,920
the secret on the Map of the Nine Provinces.

389
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,680
What about Yuwen Rui and the others?

390
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,680
They fell off the cliff.

391
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,480
Their chances of survival are slim.

392
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,279
He's not that easy to kill.

393
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,640
Go investigate.

394
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,640
Find out what's really inside this box.

395
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,359
Yes.

396
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,440
By the way,

397
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:25,640
Master.

398
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,279
This medicine will help your wound heal.

399
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,440
Who's there?

400
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:16,680
Yuwen Rui!

401
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,799
How are you?

402
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,119
Don't scare me!

403
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,279
A Lan.

404
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm here.

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,559
I'm here.

406
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:39,880
I...

407
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm okay.

408
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,279
Yuwen Rui!

409
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,079
Yuwen Rui!

410
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,279
Yuwen Rui, wake up!

411
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,279
Don't die!

412
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,359
Yuwen Rui!

413
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,559
Didn't you say...

414
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,400
didn't you say you liked me?

415
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,079
I actually like you too.

416
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,680
As long as you wake up,

417
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,200
as long as you wake up,

418
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,680
I... I'll promise you anything, really.

419
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,440
I'll promise you anything.

420
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,359
You said it.

421
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,599
Was it fun tricking me?

422
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,079
I just wanted to hear your true feelings.

423
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You just said

424
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,559
you like me too.

425
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,440
And you'd promise me anything.

426
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,759
Who said that?

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,759
How could I possibly say

428
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,119
such nauseating words?

429
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,759
Are you feverish?

430
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,599
Delirious from the fever?

431
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,759
You were in such pain earlier.

432
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Was that also an illusion?

433
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,400
That was no illusion.

434
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,839
Just now, I...

435
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,079
was genuinely quite upset.

436
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,000
I was thinking at the time,

437
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,400
we're in this desolate wilderness.

438
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,119
If you were to die,

439
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,799
a poor, helpless woman like me,

440
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,279
how would I ever get back?

441
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,160
Take off your clothes.

442
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,359
Why should I take them off?

443
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,920
My clothes are already dry.

444
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,440
Wear mine.

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Why is this robe so big?

446
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
The sleeves are so long.

447
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,119
The hem is too.

448
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,799
It's such a hassle to put on.

449
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,880
With all this chatter, do you need my help?

450
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,319
No.

451
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,160
Thank you.

452
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,079
Where's the belt?

453
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,319
I don't see it.

454
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,799
I forgot to give it to you.

455
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,599
A man's belt is rather intricate.

456
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:46,920
Let me help you.

457
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,679
Too tight?

458
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,320
Hurry up.

459
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,760
There.

460
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,800
I wonder if your men

461
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,599
tracking the assassins found anything.

462
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,199
Chen Liang is most skilled in tracking.

463
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,559
If he discovers anything,

464
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:57,800
he will come find me.

465
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,239
The person tailing you was surely arranged by Yuwen Rui.

466
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,000
It seems obtaining the brocade box

467
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,039
was merely one part of his plan.

468
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,079
The item inside the box was also a fake.

469
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,360
Yuwen Rui is truly cunning and deep.

470
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Fortunately, our master was vigilant.

471
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,440
He was not discovered by them.

472
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,039
From now on, Yuwen Rui will surely be more alert.

473
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
For now, we must not act rashly.

474
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,960
Understood.

475
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,760
He's quite pleasing to look at, isn't he?

476
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,920
Why did you stop looking?

477
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,480
I saw your face was dirty.

478
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,559
I wanted to wipe it for you.

479
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,519
All clean now.

480
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,039
My lord.

481
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,639
Well?

482
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,960
Did you see who the mysterious person was?

483
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,440
My lord.

484
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:44,840
I have failed.

485
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,800
I was detected by the other party.

486
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,800
I could not see his true face.

487
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,480
I only know he seemed to be injured.

488
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:50,920
Injured?

489
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,159
Yes.

490
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,679
I also found this.

491
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,760
Did you find out what medicine this is?

492
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,800
It's a miraculous medicine for treating external wounds.

493
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,480
Nothing else was discovered.

494
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,880
Our master's injury is not serious, is it?

495
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,360
It's nothing.

496
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,840
Right.

497
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:23,920
I haven't given you the medicine yet.

498
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:28,800
The medicine is gone.

499
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:30,840
Oh no.

500
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,840
That medicine was specially made.

501
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,760
If I remember correctly,

502
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,360
the bottle's base should be carved with a stag antler totem.

503
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:39,960
What did you say?
