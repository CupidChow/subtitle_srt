1
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,719
I

2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
I just woke up.

3
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,799
I thought it was some lecher.

4
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,080
You had me come to your villa.

5
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,639
You don't have another purpose, do you?

6
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
What do you think?

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,439
Follow me.

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,919
What exactly are you taking me to see?

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
You had me come to your villa.

10
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
Just to keep being a pig-tending maid?

11
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,319
Where exactly did I offend you?

12
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,639
Why do you all like raising pigs so much?

13
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Ru Feng.

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,439
My lord.

15
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,759
Take them away.

16
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,120
M-My lord...

17
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,919
Wasn't it you who ordered me to...

18
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,879
...search everywhere for them?

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
Why send them away now?

20
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,120
My lord, there's one more thing.

21
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,000
Speak.

22
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,080
Which guest room should I arrange for the Fifth Princess...

23
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
...to stay in?

24
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,039
The one closest to your bedroom...

25
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,080
...or the one farthest away?

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,919
What do you think?

27
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,960
I say...

28
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,280
What do you all think?

29
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,520
Brother.

30
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,159
Do you think A Lan was kidnapped by the assassin?

31
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,360
The assassin wasn't after her.

32
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,960
Then where could she have gone?

33
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,800
To put it bluntly...

34
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
...it's all that He scoundrel's fault.

35
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,919
If it weren't for chasing him...

36
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,599
...I would never have left the Meng residence.

37
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,039
How could A Lan have gone missing?

38
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:05,919
Young Master.

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,439
Young Lady.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,800
Well?

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
Any news?

42
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,719
Not yet.

43
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,520
Keep sending people to search.

44
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:13,879
Yes.

45
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,360
Ru Feng.

46
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,560
I saw inside the room...

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,759
...there are girl's clothes.

48
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,839
That is...

49
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,279
...that is what my lord ordered to be prepared for the princess.

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,439
I didn't expect...

51
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,959
...your lord to be so considerate.

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,240
I was just wondering what to wear...

53
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,000
...when I change and bathe later.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,000
Princess.

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,920
Do you need anyone to attend to you?

56
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,879
Our villa has no maidservants.

57
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:44,920
No, no need.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,439
Then this subordinate will take his leave.

59
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,360
A Lan.

60
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,480
What is it?

61
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,240
My lord.

62
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,000
My lord, what are you...

63
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,800
You just called out 'Fifth Princess'...

64
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,959
What Fifth Princess?

65
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,279
Didn't you notice anything unusual?

66
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,160
N-No, I didn't.

67
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,639
Assassin!

68
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,839
There's an assassin!

69
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,560
He's already gone.

70
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,839
In the future...

71
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,920
...be more alert.

72
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,160
Taking a bath in broad daylight?

73
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,360
My lord.

74
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,519
Young Master Meng has sent people...

75
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,319
...everywhere inquiring about the Fifth Princess's whereabouts.

76
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,399
Moreover, this subordinate also heard...

77
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,079
...that Young Master Meng particularly likes...

78
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,279
...the Fifth Princess disguised as a maid.

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
He often teaches her to read...

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,279
...paint, swordplay, and such.

81
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,639
And the Fifth Princess...

82
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,240
...in turn warms Young Master Meng's bed, reads to him...

83
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
...and even attends his baths.

84
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,680
I told you so.

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
The Fifth Princess infiltrated the Meng residence...

86
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
...it must be for Young Master Meng.

87
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,920
He is, after all, the foremost of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

88
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,240
So I say the Fifth Princess likes him...

89
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,000
...and wants to get close to him.

90
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,720
That's perfectly normal, isn't it?

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Which room did you put the Fifth Princess in?

92
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,240
Don't worry about that, my lord.

93
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,560
I arranged her in...

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
...I specifically put her in the east wing room.

95
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,160
What? My lord...

96
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
...is it still not far enough?

97
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,399
I shouldn't have saved you.

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,160
He lifted her skull.

99
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,600
The storybooks say...

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,959
...a maid must warm the young master's bed.

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,879
In a few days it will be my birthday.

102
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,879
A Lan.

103
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
What are you planning to give me?

104
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Young Master!

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,439
You're harassing your servant!

106
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,600
I know where the map is.

107
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,720
Release the young master.

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll take you to find the map.

109
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't worry, Young Master.

110
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,959
I'll be fine.

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Some things...

112
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,120
...I'll explain to you later.

113
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,799
Seventh Cousin.

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,840
How is the wound on your arm?

115
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
It's almost healed.

116
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,480
What's wrong? Let me see.

117
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,519
It's nothing, nothing.

118
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:17,960
See?

119
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,120
No need to worry.

120
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,879
Is Royal Sister almost here?

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
You stayed at the Meng residence for so many days...

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,440
...yet at my villa...

123
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,039
...you can't even stand one day?

124
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,600
It's not the same.

125
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Indeed, it's not the same.

126
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,279
Here, no one has you...

127
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,799
...read, warm beds, or attend baths.

128
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,159
A Lan.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,039
Royal Sister!

130
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,080
Seventh Cousin!

131
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Eldest Brother! Princess!

132
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,519
Your servant missed you so much!

133
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,799
Your servant missed you so much...

134
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,519
...I couldn't eat or drink.

135
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,039
Really?

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
How come I feel...

137
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
...you've gained quite a bit of weight?

138
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
I did gain a few pounds.

139
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,600
Royal Sister.

140
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,919
Let me return to the palace with you today.

141
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,240
When we return, if Father asks, just say...

142
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,720
...last night I suddenly became enlightened...

143
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,399
...and regained my senses.

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,960
How about it?

145
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,840
Five hundred taels!

146
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,720
Five hundred taels!

147
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,639
Seven hundred taels!

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Seven hundred taels!

149
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Is there anyone higher than seven hundred taels?

150
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,159
Young Master Meng

151
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,960
Young Master Meng is here.

152
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,240
He's so handsome and dashing.

153
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,039
Indeed.

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
Young Master Meng.

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,039
Do you have something to auction?

156
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,320
So much money!

157
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
So much, so much gold!

158
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,679
So much gold!

159
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Young Master Meng.

160
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
What is this...

161
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
It's too much.

162
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,600
Look, this painting is of a girl.

163
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,039
Everyone.

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
Today, with Prosperous Auction House as witness,

165
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
anyone

166
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,919
who finds the woman on this notice

167
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,200
will receive all this gold.

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,519
All of it will be theirs.

169
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,399
All of it will be theirs.

170
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,720
All of it will be theirs.

171
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,840
Young Master Meng, who is this woman?

172
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,919
Yes, why spend such a fortune to find her?

173
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,840
She is a maid from my Meng household.

174
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,480
A maid?

175
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,200
A person I would pay any price

176
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,600
to find.

177
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,600
Here.

178
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Give me a few, give me a few.

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,399
Get me a few more.

180
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,039
Give me one more.

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
Give me one, give me one.

182
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,240
There's enough for everyone.

183
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,120
Give me one, give me one.

184
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
Have you seen this woman in the painting?

185
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,240
I haven't seen her.

186
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,159
Miss, have you seen her?

187
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,639
No.

188
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,679
Today's grapes are quite fresh.

189
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,600
Here, try one.

190
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,720
Thank you, Princess.

191
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,720
Royal Sister.

192
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,879
Royal Sister.

193
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,639
What's wrong?

194
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,799
Do you have something on your mind?

195
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
It's nothing.

196
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,120
I just feel that lately,

197
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,120
Seventh Cousin has been acting strange.

198
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,960
Strange?

199
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,000
I always feel

200
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
he's intentionally avoiding me.

201
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,799
Fourth Princess,

202
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,960
could it be because

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
Young Master Xiu has someone he likes?

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Usually, when a man likes someone,

205
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,799
he deliberately keeps his distance from other women.

206
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,600
According to your servant's guess,

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,759
Young Master Xiu definitely has someone in his heart.

208
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,159
Royal Sister,

209
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,480
you generally shouldn't listen to Xixi.

210
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,320
You're not just any other woman.

211
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Who Seventh Cousin likes,

212
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,919
don't you have any sense of it at all?

213
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,360
You two are the male and female leads.

214
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Male and female leads?

215
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,639
What's that?

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,039
That's not important.

217
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,120
Royal Sister,

218
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,440
you're with Seventh Cousin every day.

219
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,360
Haven't you noticed who he's fallen for?

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,639
Maybe we should find a way to help the leads along.

221
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,519
Alright.

222
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,240
Let's not talk about him.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,440
What about you?

224
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,720
Me?

225
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,720
Yes.

226
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,320
You still have a marriage contract with Eldest Cousin.

227
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,960
The engagement will definitely be canceled.

228
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,720
Besides,

229
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
Yuwen Rui doesn't want to marry me either.

230
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on, come on.

231
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,879
Here.

232
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,919
This

233
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,279
is fine wine I specially brought from

234
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,440
the Drunken Immortal Tavern for Eldest Brother.

235
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:18,960
Come on.

236
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,159
Everyone, try some.

237
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,480
Here's to us.

238
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,879
Here.

239
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,879
Good wine.

240
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,720
With this mood and setting,

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,480
it's a waste not to play a game.

242
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,360
A Lan, what do you want to play?

243
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,679
Truth or Dare.

244
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,320
I swear,

245
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
if I tell even half a lie,

246
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,159
may I be run over by a carriage.

247
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,320
Swear.

248
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,519
Hurry up.

249
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,000
This...

250
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Seventh Cousin, hurry up.

251
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,120
I swear,

252
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,960
if I tell even half a lie,

253
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,399
may A Lan gain twenty jin.

254
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,519
Me?!

255
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,320
Fine, fine.

256
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
If I tell even half a lie, then

257
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,279
may I be struck by lightning.

258
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,120
That's more like it.

259
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,679
Let's go.

260
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,240
Let's try one round first.

261
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,720
The bamboo tube points at him.

262
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,759
You can ask him anything.

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,360
Like if he has someone he likes,

264
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,879
what he's afraid of.

265
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,639
If he doesn't want to answer,

266
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,840
then he must choose a dare.

267
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Eldest Brother.

268
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Do you have someone you like?

269
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:39,960
Come on, come on.

270
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,600
That last one doesn't count.

271
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,879
Let's do it again.

272
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,960
Seventh Cousin.

273
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
Is there anything you want to ask?

274
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,480
Then I'll ask.

275
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:06,960
Royal Sister.

276
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,039
What kind of man do you like?

277
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,039
An upright and honorable man,

278
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
a man I can entrust my life to.

279
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,639
So that's the type Royal Sister likes.

280
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,639
Come on.

281
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,200
Let's continue.

282
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Seventh Cousin.

283
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,159
It's your turn.

284
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,159
Then I'll ask.

285
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,120
Do you have a woman you like?

286
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
I choose dare.

287
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,919
A dare, huh?

288
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,799
Then the dare is

289
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,240
to kiss the person next to you.

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,200
Seventh Cousin,

291
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,480
you should choose truth instead.

292
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,119
Do you have someone you like?

293
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,680
I never expected it, Seventh Cousin.

294
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,640
You've hidden it quite well.

295
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,880
Come on, come on.

296
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,359
Continue, continue. This time, it's my turn.

297
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Not me, not me.

298
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,759
The dare is to kiss the person next to you.

299
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:36,960
Me?

300
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,480
Let me see.

301
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,359
Seventh Cousin.

302
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,200
Look at where the bamboo tube is pointing.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,119
It's still you.

304
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,880
Then I'll ask another one.

305
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,680
Is the person you like here?

306
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
A Lan, I think you're doing this on purpose.

307
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm not telling you.

308
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,319
I've noticed you've been getting mischievous lately, you little fool.

309
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,240
Isn't that right? Let me tell you.

310
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,920
This is a gentleman's game.

311
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,480
You, come here.

312
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,960
Come here.

313
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,759
Have you been learning bad things?

314
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,519
Seventh Cousin!

315
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,480
You're still running? Let me hit you once.

316
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
Royal Sister, look at him!

317
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,240
Alright.

318
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,039
Just once, just once.

319
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,400
Come here. Be careful.

320
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,039
Slow down, slow down.

321
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,880
So many?

322
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,799
Let me see.

323
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
Why are there so many 'return safely' wishes?

324
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,960
What did you wish for?

325
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,160
That's my only wish right now.

326
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I can't tell you.

327
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,000
You can't help me make it come true anyway.

328
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,759
Any wish you want to come true,

329
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,319
I will help you achieve it.

330
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,759
Really?

331
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,000
Then I'll only let you take a peek.

332
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,079
Alright, alright.

333
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,359
Are you two done yet?

334
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Let's go, let's go.

335
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,400
Let's keep drinking.

336
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,599
Let's go back and keep drinking.

337
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,559
Let's go, let's go.

338
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,279
Let me tell you.

339
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,240
We won't go home until we're drunk.

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,839
Let's go.

341
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,319
Eldest Cousin.

342
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,839
Both you and A Lan want to cancel the engagement.

343
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,279
After returning to the palace,

344
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I will also advise Father Emperor.

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,119
Once we find the person who stole the map,

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,559
My engagement with her will be decided accordingly.

347
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,359
Are you sure that with that poisoned fake map,

348
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,599
we can find the assassin?

349
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,279
We'll see in two days.

350
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,720
You all should stay at the villa tonight.

351
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,559
Leave tomorrow.

352
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,279
Keep drinking.

353
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,599
Go home.

354
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,759
Go home.

355
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,000
Careful, careful, careful.

356
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,480
Go home.

357
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,079
Go home.

358
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,039
When you wake up, you can go home.

359
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,319
Do you want to go home that badly?

360
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,559
Want to go home.

361
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,039
This little thing is quite a looker, huh?

362
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,000
Get dressed and get up.

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,680
A Zi.

364
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,599
Last night, we...

365
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,400
Last night you drank too much.

366
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,759
I was afraid you'd feel unwell if you woke up in the night,

367
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,119
so I slept nearby.

368
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:38,920
Unexpectedly, I fell asleep.

369
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,480
A Zi.

370
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,799
Men and women should maintain propriety.

371
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,079
You're right.

372
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,599
Now that you have a woman you like,

373
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,720
in the future,

374
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,599
I will be more careful.

375
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,759
Who is the woman Seventh Cousin likes?

376
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,240
Have I met her?

377
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,160
No.

378
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,079
How did Yuwen Rui get into my bed?

379
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,920
He really is quite handsome.

380
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Fifth Princess.

381
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,119
Doesn't this count as taking advantage of someone?

382
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,359
I wiped it for you.

383
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,880
Don't mind it.

384
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
What were you trying to do while I was asleep?

385
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,759
You moved, that's why I fell.

386
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,640
You weren't doing it on purpose, were you?

387
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,400
On purpose?

388
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,160
I deliberately let you fall on me to attack me?

389
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,079
For what purpose?

390
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
That's true.

391
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,680
Since the Fifth Princess has been so forward with me,

392
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,839
I can only respond in kind.

393
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
Return the favor.

394
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,240
What are you doing?

395
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,680
I'm not like you.

396
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,240
I don't enjoy taking liberties with others.

397
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
Consider yourself lucky this time.

398
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,440
Eldest Brother.

399
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,720
Then I'll escort them back first.

400
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,039
I'll come find you again in a few days.

401
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Seventh Cousin!

402
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,920
Hurry up!

403
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,519
Everyone's waiting for you.

404
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,039
Coming, coming!

405
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,000
We're leaving.

406
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,119
Royal Sister.

407
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,480
What's wrong?

408
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Seventh Cousin really does have someone he likes.

409
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,880
It's probably someone none of us know.

410
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,680
Impossible.

411
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,640
He said it himself.

412
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,039
He must be lying.

413
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,759
I didn't expect...

414
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,759
that I would care about this so much.

415
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,559
My lord.

416
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,759
The Fifth Princess didn't even have breakfast.

417
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
She was in such a hurry to leave.

418
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,319
It seems...

419
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,200
she's unwilling to stay at this villa a moment longer.

420
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,240
I can see it now.

421
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,160
The Fifth Princess truly does not like you.

422
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,359
This villa...

423
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,759
she probably won't come back to again.

424
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,799
If she ever willingly returns in the future,

425
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,640
what will you do?

426
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,799
That's absolutely impossible.

427
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
If the Fifth Princess does come back,

428
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,039
according to Shadow Guard rules,

429
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:14,839
if I lose the bet,

430
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,119
I'll wear women's clothing.

431
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:25,839
Fi...

432
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,440
Fifth Princess!

433
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,920
What are you...?

434
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,839
Please sit tight and hold on.

435
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,240
This Plot Spirit is about to issue a new mission.

436
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,799
The... the mountain road is rough.

437
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,920
Royal Sister, sit more securely.

438
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,079
Listen carefully.

439
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,440
The next cannon fodder you need to save

440
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,519
is...

441
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,799
Ru Feng.

442
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,200
Stop the carriage!

443
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,599
I've thought it over carefully.

444
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Staying at this villa

445
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,720
is much more interesting than being in the palace.

446
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,599
Right?

447
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,920
Remember what you said.

448
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,319
My lord.

449
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,440
Princess.

450
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
Princess, you are so beautiful.

451
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,839
Xixi.

452
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,559
You... don't misunderstand.

453
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,839
I lost a bet with my lord.

454
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,400
No need to say more.

455
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,559
I understand everything.

456
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,720
What do you understand?

457
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,400
Some things don't need to be spelled out.

458
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,640
Yes.

459
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,400
This dress is new.

460
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,079
This is life's trial for us.

461
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,480
It will pass eventually.

462
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,839
Don't be sad.

463
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,400
You wearing this...

464
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,079
actually looks quite good.

465
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,720
I'm saying, next time...

466
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,920
when you give me a new mission...

467
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,720
can you pick the right moment?

468
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,000
I just got on the carriage away from Yuwen Rui.

469
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,079
Then you tell me the next...

470
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,640
person to save is Ru Feng.

471
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,880
Are you teaching me how to do my job?

472
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,920
Fine.

473
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:24,400
Tell me.

474
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
In the original plot...

475
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,400
where does Ru Feng die?

476
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,279
How does he die?

477
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,519
Right in the woods at the foot of this mountain.

478
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,720
As for when he dies...

479
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,599
due to the increased mission difficulty...

480
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,079
you will not know.

481
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,559
when the cannon fodder meets his end.

482
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,119
Mission difficulty increased.

483
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,440
You don't even discuss it with me?

484
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,599
What do you think?

485
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,839
What about Yuwen Rui?

486
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,839
What?

487
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,119
Are you worried about him?

488
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,200
Why would I worry about him?

489
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,240
I'm just thinking...

490
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,759
Ru Feng's death...

491
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,680
might be related to Yuwen Rui.

492
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,319
If Yuwen Rui gave Ru Feng...

493
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,240
some mission...

494
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,400
and sent Ru Feng to carry it out...

495
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,240
And then...

496
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,920
Don't try to trick me into talking again.

497
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,599
This Plot Spirit won't fall for your trap again.

498
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,799
This attitude of yours won't do.

499
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,640
Between a human and a Plot Spirit...

500
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,039
wouldn't a little more trust be good?

501
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,680
Cross-dimensional trust is fragile.

502
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,240
Goodbye.

503
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,160
Good luck.

504
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,119
I say...

505
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,880
Again with this.

506
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,359
Princess.

507
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,079
How much longer must we stay...

508
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,119
at Lord Yuwen's villa?

509
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,960
What's wrong?

510
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,400
You want to leave as soon as we arrive?

511
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,480
Your servant is worried about you.

512
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,640
I think Lord Yuwen is very strange.

513
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,200
Strange?

514
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,279
Guess what I just saw.

515
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,880
What did you see?

516
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,519
I saw Ru Feng...

517
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,799
actually practicing swordplay in women's clothing.

518
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,280
The skirt was even pink.

519
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,679
Why... why would he?

520
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,079
Ru Feng was evasive...

521
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,119
and unwilling to say more.

522
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,440
But your servant understood everything at a glance.

523
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Many young masters from noble families...

524
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,719
have some strange quirks.

525
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,880
Like forbidding maids to laugh.

526
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,199
Not letting their wives appear in public.

527
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,360
Or, for example...

528
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,320
forcing their subordinates to dress as women.

529
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,639
So you mean Yuwen Rui is...

530
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,599
Lord Yuwen is the last kind.

531
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,440
After all this time apart...

532
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,679
you still have that familiar train of thought.

533
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,400
Princess.

534
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,079
Your servant notices Lord Yuwen these past few days...

535
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,800
seems quite eager for you to stay at the villa.

536
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,679
Could it be he regrets it...

537
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,800
and wants to marry you again?

538
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,519
No.

539
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
That's good then.

540
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,800
He made you so sad before.

541
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,679
Now that you've finally come to your senses...

542
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,960
your servant doesn't want to see...

543
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,639
him make you sad again.

544
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,320
Princess.

545
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Now that everyone knows your mind has recovered...

546
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,480
your marriage arrangement with Lord Yuwen...

547
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,119
won't it be difficult to cancel?

548
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,079
Don't worry.

549
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,599
I will not marry him.

550
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,519
Princess.

551
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,800
Didn't you say...

552
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:30,880
these past days...

553
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,440
you've been staying at the Meng residence?

554
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,079
So, what is Young Master Meng like?

555
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
He's talented in both arts and war, and fiercely protective of his own.

556
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,079
Why?

557
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,960
It's nothing.

558
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Young Master Meng...

559
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,199
and the Fifth Princess...

560
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,679
are a perfect match.

561
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,159
I wonder if that heartless little black one...

562
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,039
misses me or not.

563
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,119
Let's take A Lan's portrait and ask around.

564
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,519
Maybe someone has seen her.

565
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,320
Lord He.

566
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,079
Miss Meng.

567
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,800
Lord He, your visit to the Meng residence...

568
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,639
His Majesty ordered me to investigate the matter of the assassin.

569
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,599
Lord He.

570
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,559
A maid from my residence is missing.

571
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,000
She may have been abducted by the assassin.

572
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,000
Could you investigate this for me, my lord?

573
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,039
This is her.

574
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:27,800
Her name is A Lan.

575
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,119
I will inform you as soon as I have any news.

576
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,159
Miss Meng.

577
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,440
There is something I would like...

578
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,960
On my brother's birthday...

579
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,320
It's all because of that petty thief I left the Meng residence.

580
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,880
Otherwise, how could A Lan have gone missing?

581
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,599
My lord.

582
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,440
He is likely part of the same group as the assassin.

583
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,199
Once I catch that petty thief named He...

584
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,199
this young lady will definitely tear him to pieces!

585
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,880
My lord, you just said you had something for me?

586
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,199
Lord He

587
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,000
Do you think this petty thief looks like you?

588
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,280
They do seem somewhat similar.

589
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,920
Look more carefully.

590
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,199
How could they be alike?

591
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,840
Lord He has distinct brows and eyes.

592
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,239
This thief has a pointy face and beady eyes.

593
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,880
He looks dishonest at first glance.

594
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,480
How can he compare to you?

595
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,679
Don't you agree?

596
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,159
Miss Meng.

597
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,800
I have urgent business to attend to.

598
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,400
I must take my leave now.

599
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,159
Let's go.

600
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,360
Young Master.

601
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,199
I ordered an investigation into A Lan's whereabouts.

602
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,480
We discovered something strange.

603
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,679
Speak.

604
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,159
A clerk from the tailor shop in the next alley

605
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,039
said that two days before your birthday,

606
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,280
he accidentally saw the Grand Chancellor and A Lan

607
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,199
talking by the back door.

608
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,119
But he was too far away

609
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,199
to hear what they said.

610
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,280
Investigate the relationship between A Lan and Yuwen Rui.

611
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,719
Yes.
