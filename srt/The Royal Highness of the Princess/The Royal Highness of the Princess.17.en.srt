1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,439
Young Master Pan

2
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,640
Isn't this Carpenter Li who went missing not long ago?

3
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,519
What's wrong with him?

4
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,719
He's been poisoned.

5
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,560
Second Master Luo, what are you doing here?

6
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,520
I heard you entered the Miasma Forest.

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,319
I was very worried.

8
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,280
So I came to check on you.

9
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,680
Here, let me take him.

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
A ghost!

11
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,039
Miss Lin, a ghost!

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,319
Young Master Pan.

13
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,360
Do you have any more Antidote Pills?

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,879
Could you give me some more later?

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
You still plan to go to that Miasma Forest?

16
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,240
When we wait for Carpenter Li to wake up,

17
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,000
we'll know the whole story.

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,639
There's no need for you to take that risk again.

19
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,319
The person I saw in my dream was you.

20
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,400
The one I want to marry is also you.

21
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,159
It is now,

22
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,080
and it will be in the future.

23
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,360
I never thought about marrying and having children before.

24
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,719
Not until I met you.

25
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,719
Only then did I feel that the days to come

26
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,280
could take on other, more hopeful shapes.

27
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,639
A Lan.

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Would you be willing to grow old together with me?

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,759
Miss A Lan.

30
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,560
You were looking for me?

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,919
Yes.

32
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,199
I'd like you to help me inquire

33
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,080
if anyone has heard of the Celestial Frostbloom.

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
If there's any lead,

35
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,759
I will reward you handsomely.

36
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,759
Alright.

37
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,280
I thought you'd forgotten your mission.

38
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,719
Didn't you say the Celestial Frostbloom

39
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,719
wouldn't die for a while?

40
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,520
What's the rush?

41
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
But you haven't even found it yet.

42
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,199
You drew it looking like this monstrosity.

43
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,360
How am I supposed to find it?

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,719
The Celestial Frostbloom

45
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,680
just looks like this monstrosity.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,839
Why is A Lan looking for that Celestial Frostbloom?

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,560
I'll tell you all later.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,199
By the way,

49
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,399
Has Carpenter Li not woken up yet?

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,319
Young Master Pan has already given him medicine.

51
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,759
Whether he can wake up

52
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,759
depends on the next few days.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,240
However,

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,519
even if he wakes up,

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm afraid he won't live for many more days.

56
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,360
Young Master Pan has not yet found

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
a method to cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin.

58
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,439
You all go and investigate carefully

59
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,199
Miss Lin's death.

60
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
See if there's anything suspicious.

61
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm going out for a bit.

62
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,040
You all stay at the Benevolent Peace Hall for now.

63
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:51,839
Eldest Cousin.

64
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,920
Let me go with you.

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,720
No need.

66
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,480
I'll be back soon.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,439
Miss A Lan.

68
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,759
These books here

69
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,040
record all sorts of medicinal herbs

70
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,079
and myths related to the herbs.

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,120
Some I haven't even read myself.

72
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,000
See if you can find the one you're looking for,

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,759
the Celestial Frostbloom.

74
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Young Master Pan.

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,319
You really haven't heard of the Celestial Frostbloom?

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,839
Miss A Lan.

77
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
Please come outside with me for a moment.

78
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,800
Miss A Lan.

79
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,319
Throughout this entire Tianyin City,

80
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,439
every single white flower

81
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,120
is here.

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,079
Take a look.

83
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,600
See if the Celestial Frostbloom you want is here.

84
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,519
You had people gather these?

85
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,120
Yes.

86
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,120
Wasn't it you, miss, who told me to look for them?

87
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,079
Tell me the truth.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
Just speak honestly.

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,639
It was Young Master Yuwen who gathered them.

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,319
He told me not to tell you.

91
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,319
Miss A Lan.

92
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,759
You look first.

93
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,560
I'll go attend to other matters.

94
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,319
Before Young Master Yuwen went out today,

95
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,279
he also took some Antidote Pills from me.

96
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,319
So many flowers.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,319
What a pity, none of them are it.

98
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,519
Isn't that...

99
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,199
This one

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,319
is the Celestial Frostbloom.

101
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,120
I didn't expect

102
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,839
him to find it.

103
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,959
He doesn't know

104
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,879
that I'm looking for this Celestial Frostbloom

105
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,759
in order to return.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
Stop thinking about all that nonsense.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
Can't you see it's about to die?

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
This is...

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,399
Once its petals all fall off,

110
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,120
it will die.

111
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,720
Hurry up and think of a way to save it!

112
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,160
Tell me honestly.

113
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,759
Can this Celestial Frostbloom

114
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,519
cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin?

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,040
Why think so much?

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,040
The urgent task is to revive the herb.

117
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,120
Water it or fertilize it?

118
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,040
If it were that simple, would you need to save it?

119
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
I know it's not that simple.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,519
So I've figured it out.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,079
Rather than trying aimlessly like this,

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
I might as well give up completely.

123
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,120
If I can't save it, so be it.

124
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,639
At worst, I'll just stay here.

125
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,879
After all, who knows if the real world

126
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,279
isn't just some storybook novel?

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,439
Here,

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,160
I am, after all, the dignified Fifth Princess.

129
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,199
You...

130
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,519
Fine.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,879
You win.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,399
But I can only give you one hint.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,519
Far away on the horizon,

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,079
yet right before your eyes.

135
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,600
Folk Records of the Strange.

136
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,279
Why did you call me here?

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,480
I still have to go with A Zi

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
to investigate Miss Lin's death.

139
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,439
I want to ask for your help saving this flower.

140
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,399
Why should I help you?

141
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,240
Have you forgotten

142
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,879
you still owe me one thing?

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,399
But I don't know how to save it.

144
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,960
I know.

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,559
I've carefully gone through this book.

146
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,759
There are indeed a few entries inside

147
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,000
related to medicinal herbs.

148
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,159
Among them,

149
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,799
the stories about herbs gaining sentience are the most plausible.

150
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,559
Herbs gaining sentience is plausible?

151
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,000
Fine, fine, I'll listen to you.

152
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,799
Go on.

153
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,480
How do they gain sentience?

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,679
The male lead's tears.

155
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,360
A Lan.

156
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,480
Darn it, you're ruthless.

157
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,919
Hurry up.

158
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,080
This isn't even half a cup yet.

159
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,039
Enough, enough, enough!

160
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,799
Well?

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,039
Could it be...

162
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,159
this entry about the water lily transforming into human form?

163
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,360
How did the water lily transform?

164
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Are you deliberately messing with me?

165
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,639
Don't even think about it.

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,960
Seventh Cousin!

167
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
Let go of my hand.

168
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,039
If you don't agree to my request,

169
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll persuade Young Master Pan

170
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,919
to return to the capital with us

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
and become an Imperial Physician.

172
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,840
I...

173
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,080
You've worked hard.

174
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,799
Seventh Cousin...

175
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,320
I, I, I...

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,919
No!

177
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,279
She, she made me do it!

178
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,879
Really, you have to believe me.

179
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,320
It was all A Lan's idea!

180
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,279
Don't look at me like that.

181
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,960
Has Carpenter Li not woken up yet?

182
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,840
All medical texts state

183
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,399
that the Five-Fold Poison Herb is extremely toxic,

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,960
but none mention how to cure its poison.

185
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
So this is the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

186
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,960
Miss A Lan.

187
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,360
This storage room has a pile of old books.

188
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,440
The second volume of *Folk Records of the Strange* should be among them.

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,480
Would you like to take a look?

190
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,320
This lousy book actually has a second volume?

191
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,480
I never expected Tianyin City

192
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
to actually have the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
I've only ever seen it in books before.

194
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Miss A Lan.

195
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,200
Young Master Pan.

196
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
Your apprentice said that...

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
said that, um...

198
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
the second volume of *Folk Records of the Strange*

199
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,399
is in this storage room.

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,039
So I...

201
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,919
came to look for it,

202
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,159
to see if I can find

203
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,840
the method to save the Celestial Frostbloom.

204
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,519
Look, I found it.

205
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,080
Well, Young Master Pan, you carry on with your work.

206
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,879
I'll head out first.

207
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,440
Have you seen Young Master Yuwen?

208
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,559
No.

209
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Miss A Lan.

210
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,679
Wait a moment, please.

211
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,879
You're looking for Young Master Yuwen?

212
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,639
May I ask what it's regarding?

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,440
It's like this.

214
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
I read in a medical book that

215
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,039
some medicinal herbs react to music.

216
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,639
Since I'm quite skilled at the guqin,

217
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,559
I wanted to ask him to help me find one.

218
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
If you see him later,

219
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
please pass on the message for me.

220
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,200
Of course, Miss A Lan.

221
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm going outside the city to gather herbs.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
Remember to give Carpenter Li his medicine.

223
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,759
Yes.

224
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Then I'll be on my way too.

225
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,000
Miss A Lan, you may not know,

226
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,080
but the Five-Fold Poison Herb stains very easily.

227
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:18,960
You...

228
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,840
Eldest Cousin.

229
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,600
A Zi and I investigated.

230
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,600
The only ones who saw Miss Lin drown

231
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,720
were Second Master Luo and two other townsfolk.

232
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
Her funeral

233
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
was also arranged by those three.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Aside from Second Master Luo,

235
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,080
the other two are on the missing persons list.

236
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,799
You've just returned.

237
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,279
How is Carpenter Li?

238
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,519
He hasn't woken up.

239
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,440
It's been two days already.

240
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm afraid it will be difficult for him to wake up.

241
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,080
And A Lan?

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,039
Is she still reading that *Folk Records of the Strange*?

243
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,440
Miss A Lan isn't at the Benevolent Peace Hall right now.

244
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,759
She probably went out.

245
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,639
Oh, right, Young Master.

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Miss A Lan told me

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,039
that if I saw you,

248
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,840
I should pass on a message for her.

249
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,639
She wants you to help her find a guqin.

250
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,879
With her level of skill,

251
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,919
she'd just be ruining a good instrument.

252
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,039
How exactly did she say it to you?

253
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,480
Tell me word for word.

254
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,879
There's no use struggling, Miss A Lan.

255
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,799
You won't break free

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,159
from my silver threads.

257
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,240
She wants to use music to save that wretched flower.

258
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,639
You said Young Master Pan was there too?

259
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
My young master

260
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,679
was preparing to gather herbs outside the city at the time.

261
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,240
Young Master, I'll attend to my duties now.

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She wouldn't say

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,159
she's skilled at the guqin for no reason.

264
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,240
Pan Yu is suspicious.

265
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,879
He took A Lan away.

266
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,759
Where would he take her?

267
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,759
Carpenter Li was found in the Miasma Forest.

268
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,639
The Miasma Forest...

269
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
Miss Lin...

270
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,160
There's no need to be surprised, Miss A Lan.

271
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Nowadays, in Tianyin City,

272
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,279
everyone is living well.

273
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,559
Siqing naturally couldn't die before them.

274
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
They've all been poisoned by the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

275
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,000
You captured them

276
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
to have them test the antidote,

277
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,440
in order to cure Miss Lin's poison.

278
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,759
Miss A Lan, you are truly perceptive.

279
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,039
Young Master Pan practices medicine to save people.

280
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,359
Why seek living people to test the medicine?

281
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
For Tianyin City to have its present peace,

282
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,880
it's all thanks to Siqing.

283
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,920
Yet Siqing, because of the vile ones among them,

284
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,000
has been reduced to this state.

285
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,920
If Siqing dies,

286
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,359
I will make the entire Tianyin City perish with her.

287
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,519
What exactly happened

288
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,559
to Miss Lin?

289
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,960
Half a year ago,

290
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,960
a band of mountain bandits came to Tianyin City.

291
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,640
Siqing and I, to save the city's people,

292
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,039
found a way to force those bandits to retreat.

293
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,559
But a few months later,

294
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,400
that band of bandits came again.

295
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,480
That day, I was practicing medicine out of town.

296
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,400
Stop!

297
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,480
Help!

298
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,079
Don't run!

299
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,480
Where do you think you're going?!

300
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,359
Run!

301
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
Please, we beg you, show mercy!

302
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,079
Spare our lives, we beg you!

303
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,480
Earlier, several of my brothers

304
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,160
were tricked by you into the Miasma Forest.

305
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,880
We couldn't even find their bodies.

306
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,519
You think I can spare you?!

307
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,880
No, no, no!

308
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,240
It wasn't us!

309
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,279
It wasn't us!

310
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,119
It was...

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
It was Miss Lin and her husband!

312
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,640
They're the ones who harmed your brothers!

313
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
It was them!

314
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
It was that couple!

315
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,839
Miss Lin said she had a way to deal with you.

316
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
It was them!

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,640
Not us!

318
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,519
It really was them!

319
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,400
Spare us!

320
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,920
Please spare our lives!

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,119
Siqing saved them from the bandits' hands.

322
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,599
Yet, to save their own skins,

323
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,519
they handed Siqing over.

324
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,279
Behave!

325
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:35,880
Let me go!

326
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Sir, behave yourself.

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,279
We've brought the person to you.

328
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,000
If it weren't for me,

329
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,880
you'd have died by their blades long ago.

330
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,039
Let me go, sir!

331
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,640
You... you see,

332
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,519
those brothers of yours,

333
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,599
were all killed by her.

334
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,519
It has nothing to do with us!

335
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,279
Yes, yes, yes!

336
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:48,839
Sir,

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,279
we'll vent your anger for you.

338
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,240
Just let us go.

339
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,200
That's right, that's right.

340
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,279
Still trying to run?

341
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,519
Get back here!

342
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,720
This is all your fault!

343
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,160
Run!

344
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,519
You're still running? Where do you think you're going?!

345
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,279
You've doomed us!

346
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:00,960
It's all your fault!

347
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,480
Run!

348
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,960
You're still running?!

349
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,279
Hit her! Hit her!

350
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,119
Let's see you run now, sir.

351
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,440
We hand her over to you.

352
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,319
She's entirely at your disposal.

353
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,640
Still running?

354
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,279
Hold on.

355
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,279
What a beauty.

356
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,880
Get away!

357
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,119
Get lost!

358
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,759
Don't touch me!

359
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,640
Don't run away!

360
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,359
Get away!

361
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,279
Don't touch me!

362
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,279
Get away!

363
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,519
Don't run!

364
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,400
Save me!

365
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,079
Please, I beg you, save me!

366
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm begging you!

367
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,880
Save me!

368
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,759
Still trying to run?

369
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,240
Sir,

370
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,400
be careful.

371
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
Save me! This woman is skilled with poisons.

372
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,519
I beg you!

373
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,599
If you, sir, wish to have some fun,

374
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,920
I can have someone prepare some... stimulating medicine. Save me!

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,119
I beg you!

376
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,640
I beg you!

377
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
Come here, you!

378
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,400
In the end,

379
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
that band of bandits threw Siqing into the Miasma Forest,

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,759
into a bottomless pit.

381
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
She was injured

382
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,680
and poisoned by the miasma.

383
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,079
She thought her days were numbered.

384
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,279
Who would have guessed

385
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,720
that pit was filled with Five-Fold Poison Herb.

386
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
To survive,

387
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,759
she had to eat the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

388
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,279
She endured the agony of the poison daily,

389
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,519
waiting for someone to rescue her.

390
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,279
If I hadn't, two months ago,

391
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
developed that Antidote Pill

392
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,000
and come to the Miasma Forest,

393
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,200
accidentally fallen into the pit and found her,

394
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,759
who knows

395
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,599
how much longer she would have had to stay

396
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,680
in that sunless pit.

397
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Second Master Luo and the others, to cover this up,

398
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,319
claimed Miss Lin had perished.

399
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,759
They falsely announced

400
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,960
that Siqing died saving a drowning citizen.

401
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,200
They even held a funeral for her.

402
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,839
Therefore,

403
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,519
you seek revenge for Miss Lin.

404
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,599
Second Master Luo went on a long trip,

405
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
temporarily escaping his fate.

406
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,440
However,

407
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,200
he will die sooner or later.

408
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,279
There are six missing citizens in total.

409
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,559
Apart from the two who were with Second Master Luo,

410
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,599
the remaining four citizens

411
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,079
have no connection to this matter.

412
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,680
Young Master Pan,

413
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,359
every grievance has its perpetrator.

414
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,440
Do not implicate the innocent.

415
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,799
Innocent?

416
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,079
If not for Siqing,

417
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
Tianyin City would have been a city of the dead long ago.

418
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,519
Their daily joy and happiness

419
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,799
are built upon Siqing's suffering.

420
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,920
She endures the agony of the poison daily.

421
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,160
She doesn't have much time left.

422
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:00,799
Siqing

423
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,039
You don't need to plead for them.

424
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
If you die,

425
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,440
I'll make them all die with you.

426
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,000
No.

427
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,960
No.

428
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,079
A Lan.

429
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,519
A Lan.

430
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,519
A Lan.

431
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:16,799
A Lan.

432
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,720
Young Master Pan.

433
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,279
Miss Lin wouldn't want you to implicate the innocent.

434
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,279
No.

435
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,960
At this point,

436
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,839
there's no turning back.

437
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,160
They, and Carpenter Li,

438
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
are indeed unrelated to Siqing's plight.

439
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,640
But someone has to test the antidote.

440
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,599
It's their fault for entering the Miasma Forest.

441
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,279
And getting lost in illusions, unwilling to wake.

442
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,559
But using innocent people to test the antidote...

443
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,279
Miss Lin might not be happy about it.

444
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,759
I can't worry about that anymore.

445
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,359
As long as I can save Siqing,

446
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,839
I'm willing to do anything.

447
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,200
Siqing.

448
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,240
Siqing.

449
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Are you okay, Siqing? Miss Lin?

450
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,119
Siqing, it's okay.

451
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,599
It's okay, Siqing.

452
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,519
Siqing, it's okay.

453
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,640
It's okay, Siqing.

454
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,599
Carpenter Li

455
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,960
was found right here.

456
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,160
If Pan Yu wants to hide someone,

457
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,839
it must be nearby.

458
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,799
Split up and search.

459
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,559
Let's go.

460
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,519
Siqing doesn't have much time left.

461
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,759
I've just developed a new antidote.

462
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,880
Miss A Lan.

463
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,920
You will test it this time.

464
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:05,759
Young Master Pan.

465
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,799
Calm down.

466
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,880
Listen to me.

467
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,440
I have a way to save Miss Lin.

468
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,640
That Celestial Frostbloom

469
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,400
can cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin.

470
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,119
What Celestial Frostbloom?

471
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,799
I've never heard of it.

472
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,400
Miss A Lan, don't bother lying to me.

473
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,599
Young Master Pan, I'm not lying.

474
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,359
It's true.

475
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,440
Otherwise, why would I keep...

476
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,319
Young Master Yuwen.

477
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:06,880
No.

478
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,559
I should address you as Chief Grand Secretary.

479
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,720
I merely wanted Miss A Lan to test an antidote.

480
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,000
You want to test the Five-Fold Poison antidote?

481
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,960
If you dare harm her,

482
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,160
I will make you wish you were dead.

483
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,279
Now that Siqing has little time left,

484
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,440
I have nothing left to fear.

485
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
But you, Chief Grand Secretary, are different.

486
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,319
If I apply just a little force,

487
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,279
Miss A Lan will lose her life.

488
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,519
You want to test the antidote?

489
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,480
Let her go.

490
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,960
I'll test it.

491
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,039
Are you sure you want to test it?

492
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,799
Testing an antidote isn't as simple as you think.

493
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
At this point, I can only fight poison with poison.

494
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,599
If the antidote works,

495
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,799
everyone will be happy.

496
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,400
If it doesn't work,

497
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,240
the poison will invade the heart meridians.

498
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,240
Death is certain.

499
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
Young Master Pan.

500
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Enough talk.

501
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,440
Fine.

502
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,480
Since your mind is made up,

503
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'll grant your wish.

504
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,039
Chief Grand Secretary.

505
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,559
Proceed.

506
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,000
The antidote... the antidote still doesn't work.

507
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,319
Darn it.

508
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,039
It's all over.

509
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,920
Siqing.

510
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
What do I do?

511
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm useless.

512
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,839
I still can't save you.

513
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,559
Siqing.

514
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,000
I still can't save you.

515
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,039
Siqing.

516
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,160
Eldest Brother.

517
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,519
A Lan.

518
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,599
Eldest Brother.

519
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,960
A Lan.

520
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,759
A Lan.

521
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,839
Eldest Brother.

522
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:36,960
You're awake.

523
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,640
Eldest Cousin.

524
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,839
Where's A Lan?

525
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,319
A Lan is fine.

526
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,400
She just fainted.

527
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
What exactly happened?

528
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
When we found you and A Lan,

529
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,559
you were both unconscious.

530
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,960
You're still poisoned by the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

531
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
About me being poisoned...

532
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,759
don't tell A Lan.

533
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,359
A Lan.

534
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,880
You're awake.

535
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:22,839
Are you okay?

536
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,079
What on earth happened?

537
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's a long story.

538
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,480
How did you find me?

539
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,480
So, when Pan Yu was forcing me to test the antidote,

540
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,440
you arrived just in time.

541
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:56,960
After I arrived,

542
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,680
he fled with Lin Siqing.

543
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,839
Why are you so pale?

544
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:05,680
Are you alright?

545
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm fine.

546
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,400
I just used my inner energy in the Miasma Forest.

547
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,559
It's nothing serious.

548
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,880
Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate.

549
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,160
is the most devoted lover.

550
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,119
Because of Lin Siqing, one thought to be a saint,

551
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,119
another to be a demon.

552
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,759
Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate.

553
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,839
Pan Yu is Yun Shang.

554
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,960
Our purpose for coming south

555
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
was to find him.

556
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,720
By the way,

557
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,119
those three commoners who tested the antidote in the cave,

558
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,200
how are they?

559
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,519
They're all at Benevolent Peace Hall.

560
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,359
But they're all poisoned by the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

561
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:40,839
I'm afraid...

562
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,440
Lin Siqing probably won't live for many more days.

563
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,039
If she dies,

564
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate will make the entire Tianyin City

565
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,319
die with her.

566
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,440
Celestial Frostbloom

567
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,160
It might be able to cure the Five-Fold Poison Herb's toxin.

568
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,079
Really.

569
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,680
I'm not entirely sure.

570
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,400
It's just that...

571
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,440
Right now, that Celestial Frostbloom is dying.

572
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,279
I have to find a way to save it.

573
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,960
Send someone to watch Second Master Luo.

574
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,720
Pan Yu is sure to go looking for him.

575
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,920
You rest well.

576
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,440
I'll send people to find Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate.

577
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,480
Eldest Cousin.

578
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,200
Are you alright?

579
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,720
A Lan just said...

580
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,200
The Celestial Frostbloom can cure the poison.

581
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,279
You'll be fine.

582
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,000
This is a poison even Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate can't cure.

583
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,160
No.

584
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,039
There must be a way.

585
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,160
Don't worry about me.

586
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,279
Pan Yu will definitely make another move.

587
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,160
Now that I'm poisoned,

588
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,880
I'm not confident I can subdue him.

589
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,079
If something happens to me,

590
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,799
you take A Lan and the others back to the capital first.

591
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,440
Eldest Cousin...

592
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,480
What nonsense are you saying? I...

593
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
No need to say more.

594
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,799
My mind is made up.

595
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,160
I will inform the Shadow Guard of Yuwen Manor.

596
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,039
From now on, you will be their new master.

597
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,799
Eldest Cousin, you...

598
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,359
Don't think about glorifying the ancestors.

599
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
Live well according to your own wishes.

600
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,960
Do you hear me?

601
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,799
How are they?

602
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,359
The three newly arrived are not deeply poisoned.

603
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,039
They can hold on for a while longer.

604
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,079
It's just Carpenter Li...

605
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,200
When the poison flared up today,

606
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
he couldn't bear the agony.

607
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
He nearly bit his tongue to end it.

608
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,319
I'm afraid he doesn't have two days left.

609
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,320
Miss A Lan.

610
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,000
Did the young master really poison them...

611
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,039
to save Miss Lin?

612
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,079
The young master healed the sick in Tianyin City.

613
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,119
He and Miss Lin saved me.

614
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,199
How could he use people to test medicine?

615
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,039
I have something to tell you.

616
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,719
What do you want to tell me?

617
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,559
Before, you said...

618
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,679
you saw in the illusion that our engagement was called off,

619
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,519
and you were very happy about it.

620
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,400
Yes.

621
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,800
I will send a message to His Majesty,

622
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,719
asking him to issue an edict canceling our engagement.

623
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,360
Why bring this up so suddenly?

624
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,360
It's not sudden.

625
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,000
In the cave,

626
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,599
when Pan Yu threatened me with your life,

627
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,039
I didn't feel particularly scared or worried.

628
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,880
So...

629
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,719
You realized...

630
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,039
that you don't actually like me that much.

631
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,440
I understand.

632
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,920
Thank you for telling me.

633
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,119
Maybe it's for the best.

634
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,159
Since Pan Yu is Yun Shang,

635
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
why don't we send more people to find him

636
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,679
and force him to reveal the secret on the treasure map?

637
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
The Shadow Gate's top disciple,

638
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,760
his martial arts are unfathomable.

639
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,800
Our people are no match for him.

640
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,840
The master's meaning is...

641
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,280
to watch and wait.

642
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,679
Wait until Yuwen Rui

643
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,199
and Yun Shang fight to the death.

644
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,920
Then we'll make our move.
