Similar to

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
is the first impression of my master.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,280
But to be honest,

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
don't expect too much

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
from a non-scientific figure like him.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,200
I want to be a chef.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,720
I want to be a chef.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,760
What do you want?

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,760
A chef.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm so grateful for your help.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,920
Stop.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,880
Master,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm so envious of you

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
that you'd plot against me...

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,480
How could you do that?

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
As an adult.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,720
I作為摄影师,

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,840
the masters always get tortured.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,040
My mom knows

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,920
to make films.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Song Xiaoliun,

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,320
don't jump in to widows' shoes.

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,440
Do an interview with a few day-exec mic.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
But one day...

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,120
You can say

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Just—

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
But it's such a beautiful Earthly view!

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,120
This is the first time I hear my voice!

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,320
Then it's definitely is the shining star of my world!

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:21,760
So beautiful!

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I have a few more ministers to attend to.

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
You... Where are you going?

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm going to fall!

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,120
But I never thought that a woman would steal Feng Teng.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,120
It's said that a woman is like water.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
She is... open water.

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm going to fall!

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm going to fall!

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm going to fall!

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Open water.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm curious why she would bring me here.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
But it doesn't matter.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
What matters is that I suddenly feel mature.

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
The feeling of mature is like a earthquake.

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm going to fall!

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm going to fall!

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I'm Song Daliang. What about you?

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I... I'm...

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,120
This is the most popular tofu I've ever had.

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Where is it?

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,120
I won't take it from you.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
You're so big.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Why are you being locked up in the kitchen?

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,120
At this moment, I finally believe in the fate.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
I've been thinking about Daliang's love for me for many times.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
We're not compatible.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
It's said that you'll kill me.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
I heard him.

70
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
I'll change your name.

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Daliang!

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,120
I've heard enough of your name.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't want to see you again tomorrow or the day after.

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm with you.

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,120
I'll take care of you.

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
You're the rotten you that can't be overcome.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
You're even worse than the rotten Qionguangna.

78
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
You've never even done anything to me!

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
You'd better leave here.

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
I'll never see you again.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I've never thought that Daliang would leave me.

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,120
I never thought that he'd die because of me.

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Who is it?

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Me. Meiyu.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Why are you here this early in the morning?

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm here.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Why am I here?

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Wait for me.

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Our lady will be married in half an hour.

90
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Marry?

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Who are you talking to?

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Commander Gao.

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Tong Xiaoliu.

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
You're a man.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
You should go get married.

96
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Are you going or not?

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
You...

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
What the hell?

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm here.

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
You're going to die!

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Tell me.

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Have you thought about the wedding?

104
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
You haven't returned to the palace for the first time.

105
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
I'll see you after the wedding.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
You're not going to marry me?

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
What do you want me to do?

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Besides, I have a lot of money.

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
I have to do something.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm not a man of my word.

111
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
He's a man of my word.

112
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
As long as I'm here,

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I can only think of a way to save his life.

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Commander Gao.

115
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,120
You can give me a gift for the wedding of the three families.

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Why?

117
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
He ran away.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Anyway,

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Song San is my old soldier.

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I won't give him a gift.

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
If you don't go,

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I won't go.

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Bastard!

124
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Tong Xiaoliu.

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
You're shameless.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
I didn't agree to the thing

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
about you and Su Laosan.

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Now, you want to get me back?

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
You want to get me back?

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Master.

131
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
That's Meiyu.

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
That's Dalian's maid.

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't talk about this.

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Tong Xiaoliu.

135
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
What can I do to make you feel better?

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Let's talk about it with Master Guo.

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Your senior brother gave me a pair of jade balls.

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I'm not a good man.

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
He's a good man.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
He gave me a big table.

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
He's a good man.

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,120
But I'm not a greedy man.

143
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Your senior brother

144
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
brought me a big girl.

145
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I won't say it.

146
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Let's just say

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
what you gave me.

148
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
But

149
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,120
you had a problem when you were young.

150
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Every time you were in the exam,

151
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I didn't make you feel bad.

152
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
But you ran away.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
You've changed your family.

154
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Today is a big day of the exam.

155
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I can't break the rules

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
that I've been following.

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Looks like

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
you and Le Pingshuo

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
are really bad people.

160
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Since you don't want to get into the exam,

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
you can take your Japs away.

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Master.

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
You should hide in the exam.

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
You can't hide from the hero.

165
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
You're so insensitive.

166
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Japs again?

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
What's the big deal?

168
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Meiyu

169
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
will come to see you later.

170
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Meiyu is not here.

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Who's going to be my mistress?

172
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
We're not a mistress.

173
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
You're talking back, right?

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Shut up.

175
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm asking you about Meiyu.

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Tell me.

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I...

178
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you have the right to talk?

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
I've thought about you

180
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
and you're so insensitive.

181
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
You're so insensitive.

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Don't think I'm talking too hard.

183
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm just that temper.

184
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm just that temper.

185
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm just that temper.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Who's that temper?

187
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Handsome.

188
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
You're thirsty.

189
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm thirsty?

190
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm thirsty.

191
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Get me some water.

192
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Song San.

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Song San.

194
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Since you've used my trick,

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
you've changed this cigarette pipe into a tea pipe.

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Don't say that.

197
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Every time I come here,

198
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
my heart is beating fast.

199
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
If you're beating fast,

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
you'll be the one

201
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
who'll close the door for me.

202
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
I'll close the door.

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Hurry up.

204
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Let's have a cup of tea.

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Right.

206
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
You can't drink tea.

207
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
A little bit.

208
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Okay.

209
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Okay.

210
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Master.

211
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Master.

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
I've arranged the food for the two of us.

213
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
As long as that little one is here.

214
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't worry.

215
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Miss will surely come out smoothly.

216
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Why are you taking it out?

217
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I've packed all the food.

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Don't take it away.

219
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Take it away.

220
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Stop talking nonsense.

221
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
You're not going to get married today.

222
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Brother Xiao.

223
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Brother Xiao.

224
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I'll give you the money.

225
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
You'll give me the money.

226
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
You'll give me the money.

227
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
I think he's got a problem.

228
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
He's got a problem.

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm going to buy some food.

230
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm going to buy some food.

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't buy it.

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm going to buy some food.

233
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Okay.

234
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Tong Xiao Six.

235
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Who is it?

236
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Who is it?

237
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Xiao Cui.

238
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Xiao.

239
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You two go out first.

240
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Miss.

241
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
The man in the eye is going to get married.

242
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Why are you not anxious at all?

243
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Brother Xiao Six.

244
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Master.

245
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
My dear daughter.

246
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
That's right.

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
He's going to the top.

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
He's staying in the pit.

249
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Are you really not thinking about Tong Xiao Six?

250
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Tong Xiao Six is always idle and quiet.

251
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
He's always busy.

252
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't want to be in his control.

253
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
You're right.

254
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Yue Yue.

255
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Yes.

256
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Where did you go?

257
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
I went...

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I went...

259
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
You went...

260
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,120
I went to try the little red spring and the sky bridge that Mei Yu just bought.

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Dad.

262
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't worry about it.

263
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Let me see if it's okay.

264
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
If it's a pity,

265
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I bought it for you.

266
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
It's fun.

267
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Take it.

268
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll get you some medicine.

269
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Brother Xiao Six, you dropped something.

270
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Who's that?

271
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Come here.

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Let's go.

273
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Brother Xiao Six.

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Here.

275
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Dear.

276
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm not making a comment.

277
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
We are some family already.

278
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Why did you put away such a pretty jewel?

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Why do you want this?

280
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
You should return this.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
I'll take the jewel.

282
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Da Shuai.

283
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Here it is.

284
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
It's the same as the light.

285
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes.

286
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I mean, Gao Fushan,

287
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
you're so generous.

288
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
How can I...

289
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
I'll take it out.

290
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
The bride is here.

291
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,120
The star is a beautiful girl.

292
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,120
And a beautiful girl.

293
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
How do you know?

294
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm so mad.

295
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
That day,

296
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Luo Yisi and Daoxi

297
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,120
your mother told me to come here

298
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
and tell you that she's a bad girl.

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
She wanted me to find you a way out.

300
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
So I gave you a ride.

301
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I've been kicked out of the city.

302
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
It seems that I'm not far from these eight characters.

303
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
The fate is in your hands.

304
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
The world is in your hands.

305
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
The fate is hard to guess.

306
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
The world is hard to guess.

307
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
What do you mean?

308
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Stop!

309
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
The bride is here!

310
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
The bride is here!

311
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
The bride is here!

312
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
The bride is here.

313
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
The bride is here.

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Is this the legend?

315
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
The bride is here!

316
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
The bride is here!

317
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
The bride is here!

318
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Why are you here at this hour?

319
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,520
Why am I here?

320
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,520
Well...

321
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
There's still half an hour.

322
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
Our Miss is about to leave.

323
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
The bridegroom is a high-ranking handsome man.

324
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
How do you know?

325
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Yes.

326
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
How do I know?

327
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,120
Mingyue.

328
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Do you think it's a bit strange today?

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
What's strange is that

330
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
why don't you go to my Miss?

331
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Today is the day of the exam.

332
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,120
The rules of the old and the old are absolutely unlawful.

333
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Let's go. Wait a minute.

334
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,720
Put this on.

335
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
Stomach.

336
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
You brat.

337
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
Where did you go again?

338
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Gao Wuchuan.

339
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,920
You've thought about the wedding.

340
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
You can't find a way to start the work.

341
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,520
I still need to see you after the wedding.

342
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm not a big liar.

343
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
I can't get anything back.

344
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,320
What's so dangerous?

345
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,920
Have you prepared everything for the cousin?

346
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,520
Yes.

347
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,920
Here.

348
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
You should have told me earlier.

349
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
I was going to take Yan Hui away.

350
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
Be careful with this.

351
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Be careful.

352
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:26,920
Yes.

353
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,320
Someone has passed away.

354
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
This is the box of the palace.

355
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm not going to let you go.

356
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm not going to let you go.

357
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,120
I don't like you.

358
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,120
Go.

359
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,320
Mom.

360
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,720
Can you see it?

361
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,520
Yes.

362
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,520
Hold it.

363
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,520
You should go to the north first.

364
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
Then you should go to the west.

365
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
There is a roadway there.

366
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Take the watch from the northeast.

367
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,320
Don't forget to give the box to the palace.

368
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Then send it to the western province.

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,920
Let it go from the main road.

370
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,120
Do you understand?

371
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
Yes.

372
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,920
Repeat it.

373
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
From the main road?

374
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Don't take it away.

375
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,920
Why do you take it away?

376
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
You brat.

377
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
Wuchuan is getting married today.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
You are so stupid.

379
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Take it away.

380
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,920
Take it away.

381
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,720
Take it away.

382
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Go.

383
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,320
Go.

384
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,920
Go.

385
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Go.

386
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,920
What are you doing?

387
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,920
Go.

388
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
Brother Xiao Liao.

389
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
This flower is for you.

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
You are a big sister to me.

391
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,320
You brat.

392
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
The flower is here.

393
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,320
The flower is here.

394
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Go.

395
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,720
The flower is here.

396
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,520
The flower is here.

397
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
Chesu.

398
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
The flower is here.

399
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Chesu.

400
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,320
Take the money.

401
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
I bought all the flowers.

402
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
Don't stay on the street.

403
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,720
Go back and get the medicine for your mother.

404
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
I told you to get married.

405
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,720
It's not a proposal.

406
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Hurry up.

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,320
Brother Xiao Liao doesn't know.

408
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm going to get the medicine for my mother today.

409
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Brother Xiao Liao.

410
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Where is he?

411
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
I have to say that I am a daughter.

412
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I can't be as good as Tianxian.

413
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,720
By the way,

414
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Meiyu.

415
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Did you give that brat a call?

416
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
No.

417
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Dad.

418
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
You are too upset.

419
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
What if Meiyu gives the letter?

420
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,320
What if he comes back?

421
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
If he doesn't come,

422
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
it means he is dead.

423
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
If he comes,

424
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,320
I will make him die

425
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
as the face on the street.

426
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
I love to hear that.

427
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
Don't look for him anymore

428
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,920
after today.

429
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Of course.

430
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,920
As long as he doesn't keep you,

431
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,320
it's only a matter of time.

432
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
I know who that brat is.

433
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Brother Xiao Liao.

434
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You have changed so much today.

435
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,720
Is it for the brat who is to be protected?

436
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Brother Xiao Liao.

437
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm telling you the truth.

438
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Our Blue Hall is a third-party place.

439
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
It has a warehouse.

440
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,920
If he is lucky,

441
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,520
I can make him die.

442
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,720
Everyone has a life.

443
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,320
Who can protect whom?

444
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Who is the leader?

445
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
The leader.

446
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Come on.

447
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,320
Who is the leader?

448
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Give me the leader.

449
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
Who is the leader?

450
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Who is the leader?

451
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
I have a friend.

452
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I have a friend.

453
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I have a friend.

454
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
This...

455
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Right?

456
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,320
You are not a self-righteous person, are you?

457
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,920
Who... Who is not a self-righteous person?

458
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
Hurry and let me go.

459
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Fu Shuai has something important to do.

460
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,320
It's a matter of time.

461
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Follow me. I know a way.

462
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Come on.

463
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Come on.

464
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,520
Fu Shuai is married.

465
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
We have to split up.

466
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
We have to work hard to make him come back.

467
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Come on.

468
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Don't worry.

469
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Today, I have no interest.

470
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I will get some of the stock of the group.

471
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,320
If someone is worried,

472
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,320
we will buy a house.

473
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
This unlucky child loves to marry him.

474
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
That's right, my son.

475
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
I tell you.

476
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
The group of the group of generations

477
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
will not be old from you.

478
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
What?

479
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
The kid I was talking about yesterday.

480
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I was too into the mood.

481
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
He is so stubborn.

482
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
He wants me to sleep.

483
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Today, look at me.

484
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
You just stand there and stare at me.

485
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Okay.

486
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Look at you.

487
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
It's Su Su.

488
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
How could he come here?

489
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
I was so scared.

490
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I was so scared.

491
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
You are so selfish.

492
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Hurry and get back to work.

493
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Hurry.

494
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Yulan.

495
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Yulan.

496
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Yulan.

497
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Yulan.

498
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Go and have a look.

499
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I won't let you go.

500
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Yulan.

501
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Why do I look like Sister Mei?

502
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Stop.

503
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Hurry.

504
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Xiaoyu.

505
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
What's wrong?

506
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Something happened at home?

507
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Xiaoyu.

508
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Didn't you say that I was wearing a dress?

509
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
I asked my brother

510
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
to get me a dress.

511
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
What?

512
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Yang Qing.

513
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
What?

514
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Yang Qing.

515
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Yang Qing.

516
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Yang Qing.

517
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Yang Xiang.

518
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Don't stand there.

519
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Open the door.

520
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Xiaoyu.

521
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Why don't you say something?

522
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
What are you doing?

523
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Why are you closing the door?

524
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Who is he?

525
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
He...

526
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Brother, you misunderstood.

527
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Listen to me.

528
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I don't listen.

529
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
You say.

530
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
What am I saying?

531
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Drink some wine.

532
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
What's the problem?

533
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
I just passed by your Xiangshan Club.

534
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
There is a piece of shrew inside.

535
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
It's a shrew.

536
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
It's all because of you.

537
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
You can't survive.

538
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
You got angry because of your master.

539
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
I guess the master is playing with you.

540
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
My master always says that I got angry.

541
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Can I go in?

542
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
You can't.

543
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
It's a bit too much.

544
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
It's all because of the paper flower.

545
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Run.

546
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Run.

547
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Run.

548
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Run.

549
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Run.

550
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
The bride and groom are dead.

551
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,320
The bride and groom are dead.

552
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
The bride and groom are dead.

553
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
My queen.

554
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Who do you think you are?

555
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
My little cousin,

556
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I don't know you.

557
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,920
Our Le Ping Society is always fair and open.

558
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Don't be so hard on yourself.

559
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,520
Master, it's great to see you again.

560
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,120
Get up.

561
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,520
Master, this time, I'll be the one to be the witness.

562
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
You're...

563
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,920
Not this time.

564
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Really?

565
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,920
Yes.

566
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,720
Okay.

567
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,520
Then take this.

568
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,920
It's time to teach you how to keep yourself.

569
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll prove to the public that this must be your 8th grade.

570
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
This time...

571
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
I'll...

572
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,920
Don't do it yourself.

573
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
I'll be grateful.

574
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,920
I'll definitely pass this exam.

575
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,120
I'll be grateful.

576
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I'll be grateful.

577
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,720
I'll be grateful.

578
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,720
Come on.

579
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
Tong Xiao.

580
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,520
No.

581
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Don't follow me.

582
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Get on the road.

583
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay.

584
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,720
Why didn't you listen to the instructions?

585
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Excuse me.

586
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,920
We have a leader in the deputy council.

587
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,120
No one can pass.

588
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
I have a report.

589
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,120
Send me there.

590
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Deputy council has an important matter to deal with.

591
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,920
It's not a big deal.

592
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,120
You're...

593
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
You're not taking the word seriously.

594
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,320
The whole street is written in the same way.

595
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
You're not taking the word seriously.

596
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,520
You're so excited.

597
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
I'm going to read myself.

598
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,520
I have a colleague.

599
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,920
Hurry and let me go.

600
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
Deputy commander has an important matter to deal with.

601
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,920
You're not taking the word seriously.

602
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,120
Why are you still standing there?

603
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Hurry up, son. Hurry up and get into the drama.

604
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,920
Uncle Tong, are you okay?

605
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,320
What's the matter?

606
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,720
It's serious.

607
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm just a big boy.

608
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,520
I can't believe you're so strong.

609
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,920
I just feel like I'm a lucky man.

610
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I'm so strong.

611
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,520
Am I that strong?

612
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,520
Uncle Zhen, I've already opened it for you.

613
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Look.

614
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,720
It's more than you're strong.

615
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,920
The air is not enough. It's not too far.

616
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,920
It's more than enough. Look.

617
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,720
Are you lying?

618
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,120
I know you're young.

619
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
I don't want to be your colleague.

620
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,320
You want me to bring out another piece of chicken and fire.

621
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,120
The next step is to bring it out when the ice is hot.

622
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
Look, this is not good.

623
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
I really have something urgent to do.

624
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,020
I'll change my name. I still have to walk this path.

625
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,920
Can you touch me again?

626
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,520
Change your name?

627
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,920
That means you don't have money?

628
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,520
Fine.

629
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,720
Let me hear it again.

630
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,120
Go!

631
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,320
What are you doing?

632
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Who is it?

633
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,920
It's not me.

634
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,320
What's that sound?

635
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,120
Congratulations on your voice.

636
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,720
It means you're loved by the people.

637
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,920
Look.

638
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,120
They're all fighting for your honor.

639
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,720
They're fighting with you.

640
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,520
I'm so happy.

641
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,920
Go! Go! Go!

642
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,520
No! No!

643
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm still here!

644
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,320
Go! Go!

645
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Why are you still playing?

646
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,120
I can't take care of you anymore.

647
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,920
I can't even ride a bicycle.

648
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,120
Miss.

649
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,120
You two go out first.

650
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,720
Miss, you really didn't see the wrong person.

651
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,920
He said he'd let you wait for him.

652
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,320
What else did he say?

653
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,120
He said he'd let you not jump into the river.

654
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,320
Old Madam.

655
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,320
I've already told him what I should say.

656
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm going to be the one to be the vice-president.

657
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,920
Meiyu, don't waste your energy anymore.

658
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,520
My dear daughter, that's right.

659
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Isn't that obvious?

660
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,320
You married the vice-president,

661
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,720
then you're like a big eagle flying over the sky.

662
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,320
You married that poor kid.

663
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,120
Then you're like a white eagle flying into the hammock.

664
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,920
What's the point of being the vice-president?

665
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,520
According to me, he can still make a loud voice.

666
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,120
That kid,

667
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,720
he's just a life-long, short-tempered,

668
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,920
with a lot of water and a big tomb.

669
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,720
He's just a big man running around the earth.

670
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,920
If he wants to be the vice-president,

671
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,320
then that means that the line of the industry has become a small source of income.

672
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,720
Is that possible?

673
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,920
He's thinking about it.

674
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,120
What are you drawing?

675
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,720
A drawing of a paper.

676
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,520
In the future, when I become the vice-president,

677
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
I'll be by the water and the river.

678
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,720
I'll build a big house.

679
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,920
We'll live in the front yard.

680
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
The master will live in the back yard.

681
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,320
Moreover, you have to think about Meiyu for him.

682
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,220
He loves to eat.

683
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,520
When he's in the handsome man's house,

684
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,920
he can't eat anything.

685
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,320
He's a mountain king, he's not only a beast,

686
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,020
he can eat whatever he wants.

687
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,120
It's hard for someone to feed him.

688
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,920
When you're in the little family of the young man, what will you let him eat?

689
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
This little brat,

690
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,520
can he swallow it?

691
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,720
I'll go.

692
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,720
A'Li.

693
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,520
I'll stay here with you tonight.

694
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm hungry. Tell me.

695
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,720
I'll go.

696
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,920
Father, I know.

697
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,720
Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,920
You're so noisy.

699
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,320
Father, the cousin isn't here.

700
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,720
What?

701
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,520
What?

702
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,920
I'm late.

703
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,120
Do you know the cousin?

704
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,720
I'm just going to take a break.

705
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
It's been three minutes.

706
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,520
Gao Zhan, you didn't want to bring me anything?

707
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
You're here with your hands?

708
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,920
You have so many people.

709
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,520
You're a good person.

710
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,920
This is the gold bars.

711
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
What's wrong?

712
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
You're not going to relax?

713
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,720
I said I'll give you a big box of gold bars.

714
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,920
I wish you a happy and full of happiness.

715
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,120
What's wrong?

716
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,520
You're just going to order it?

717
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,120
The bride is here!

718
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
Da Lian.

719
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,920
Da Lian.

720
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,920
Da Lian.

721
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,920
Da Lian.

722
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
Da Lian.

723
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,320
Da Lian.

724
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,920
Da Lian.

725
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
Who are you?

726
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,920
You're not going to be here.

727
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
You're not going to be here.

728
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm going to be here.

729
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,920
Da Lian.

730
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Drink it.

731
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,520
Duan Lian.

732
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,920
What are you doing?

733
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,120
Why are you doing this to others?

734
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,520
Go back.

735
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
Third Brother.

736
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
Third Brother.

737
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Can you take me in?

738
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,720
It's urgent.

739
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,520
No, you can't get used to my car.

740
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,120
Brother Mei.

741
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,720
Can you take me in?

742
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
I'll ask you to listen to the year-end.

743
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,520
You're the one who said that.

744
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,320
Okay, hurry up.

745
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,720
It's really difficult to go this far.

746
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,120
Brother Mei.

747
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,320
What do you do?

748
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,520
What is going on?

749
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
Mum

750
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,120
I'll be in your life

751
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,480
Me

752
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,680
Thank you

753
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,420
You have this

754
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,720
Where is my bowl

755
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,220
Excuse me

756
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,240
Silly

757
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,720
What are you watching

758
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,600
My cards are clear and clear.

759
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,480
Where are my cards?

760
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,640
What are you looking at?

761
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,280
Two copies.

762
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,080
You go up there and give me the money for the repair.

763
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,200
I'll let you go.

764
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,880
I'm angry.

765
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,640
I don't have money now.

766
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,480
Cut the crap.

767
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,280
Since the time of the travel,

768
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,240
no one can go through anything from me.

769
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Brother Yu, I really have something urgent.

770
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,800
Look, is that okay?

771
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,200
I'll give you two copies.

772
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,600
I'll make sure you get the money for the repair.

773
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,200
I thought he was either in the mood for the repair or me.

774
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,720
But I didn't expect that he was in the mood for the repair.

775
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,800
Brother Yu, he's so arrogant.

776
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
He's the one who killed the man in the south.

777
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
Let's get it together.

778
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,520
I have something to see.

779
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,720
Who dares to touch my Yu De Gui's 36 copies?

780
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,160
Brother Yu, where are you going?

781
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,920
Go back.

782
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,520
Go back.

783
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,200
Go back.

784
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,760
Go back.

785
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,760
Go back.

786
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,800
My brother!

787
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,000
My brother.

788
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,320
Just run.

789
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,360
Run.

790
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,520
Run.

791
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,560
Run over us.

792
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,280
Run over us.

793
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,600
Run.

794
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,400
Mr. Jiu Jiu.

795
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,820
This is item number play.

796
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,560
Mr. Jiu Jiu,

797
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,540
Mr. Jiu Jiu,

798
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,260
Violet,

799
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,560
respectively good with Aunt Obing.

800
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,680
Add the tamper for faultszufu.

801
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,440
Okay, I'll be there any minute.

802
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,240
Don't rush.

803
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,100
Boss is there.

804
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,280
Someone will come.

805
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,500
Boss will come!

806
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,200
Remember the code of mind.

807
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,320
Come on.

808
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,520
Stay still.

809
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,360
Stay still.

810
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,120
Stay still.

811
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Don't run!

812
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
The bride is here!

813
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Go!

814
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Hurry up and get in the car!

815
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Hurry up!

816
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Get in!

817
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Hurry up!

818
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Don't run!

819
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Get in!

820
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
Stay here!

821
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Be careful!

822
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
Be careful!

823
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Don't run!

824
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Don't run!

825
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,200
The bride is here!

826
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,200
I have a command!

827
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,200
The bride has something important to deal with!

828
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
The bride has something important to deal with!

829
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
This matter is a mess!

830
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
The bride has something important to deal with!

831
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
This matter is a mess!

832
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
You just hide in the jade room.

833
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,200
You can't hide from the hero.

834
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,200
I have a plan.

835
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Help me to get rid of Gao Fushui.

836
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
How long can I get rid of him?

837
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Brother Xiaoliu!

838
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Hurry up and get out of here!

839
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Xiaoliu!

840
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Three.

841
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Two.

842
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Two.

843
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Two.

844
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
One.

845
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
I'll kill you!

846
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Two.

847
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,200
The bed is bright.

848
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,200
The bed is smooth.

849
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,200
The river is strong.

850
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,200
The foam is thick.

851
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
I didn't expect that

852
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,200
this poem is a great song.

853
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
No.

854
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Drive!

855
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
There's more!

856
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
There's more!

857
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
There's more!

858
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
Gao Lang!

859
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Today is the day we play the big show.

860
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Stop!

861
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
Who are you?

862
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Fushui is sick.

863
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
I'm the one who's in charge.

864
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
How do you know what you're talking about?

865
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
It's a serious matter.

866
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
You should know it better than me.

867
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Our fate is predestined.

868
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
No.

869
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,200
It's predestined.

870
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
No.

871
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,200
It's predestined.

872
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
No.

873
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Can you explain it to me?

874
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,200
Fushui, time is running out.

875
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
You're in charge of the game.

876
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Put it here.

877
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Hurry up.

878
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
Give it to me.

879
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Wait a minute.

880
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
What was the mission just now?

881
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
No.

882
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Fushui, there's more.

883
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
There's more?

884
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Our lady said

885
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,200
you should read all the letters before you get married.

886
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,200
But...

887
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,200
You go first.

888
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
Go!

889
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Go!

890
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Who are you?

891
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Fushui.

892
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Go!

893
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Go!

894
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Master, I heard a noise just now.

895
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,200
Did you hear it?

896
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
Nonsense.

897
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Master hasn't broken his ears yet.

898
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
It must be a close-up.

899
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Gao Fushui is Gao Fushui.

900
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
He's a sound of Li Pao.

901
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
He's more famous than others.

902
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
Su San.

903
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
With my experience as a soldier,

904
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
he must be a sound of Li Pao.

905
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,200
But he's definitely not Li Pao.

906
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,720
Detective Su,

907
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,200
what are you?

908
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
Are you sure?

909
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Yes.

910
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
What were you doing?

911
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
I was recording.

912
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,200
What else?

913
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,200
prices you can use on the Internet

914
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
as your un 라

915
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
are all!

916
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
Li Pao.

917
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Right.

918
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,540
Then what do you do in the town?

919
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,600
I just go to the town drivers.

920
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,340
That's it

921
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,060
to split up the steals.

922
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,200
It's not them.

923
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,600
Say it,

924
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,700
Clean protesting whore's record.

925
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,800
But who divorced 2 other men?

926
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,640
Nice clothes.

927
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,140
Noוג.

928
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,100
Noong.

929
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,680
Please forgive me.

930
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,880
Go back to the main squareAnd clean it.

931
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,440
of men's hospital company

932
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,880
Quan Ю

933
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,560
Quan Ю

934
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,280
It's true.

935
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,120
I've told you.

936
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
We're not together.

937
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,560
You're not afraid of death, are you?

938
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,720
Commander Gao will go there soon.

939
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,440
He can't come.

940
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,280
My brother has arranged for a life.

941
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,080
If you come...

942
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
I've come.

943
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,400
If you want your father to catch me,

944
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,200
call me.

945
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,840
Go.

946
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,800
You're not going anywhere with me.

947
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,840
Dalian.

948
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,200
You're going to be in trouble

949
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,920
every time.

950
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:31,920
Okay.

951
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,040
Okay.

952
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,680
You can stop talking.

953
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,280
But no matter what,

954
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,040
no matter who you marry,

955
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,240
I won't let you die.

956
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,040
I told you you might not believe me.

957
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,480
I'm trapped in the palace.

958
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,800
But

959
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,040
I can't let you die.

960
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,200
Come with me.

961
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,760
We can't do it.

962
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,320
How do you know?

963
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,600
How do you know?

964
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,200
Are you...

965
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,480
Dalian.

966
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,120
You're in such a hurry to see me.

967
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,080
What's the matter?

968
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,880
Master is in a hurry.

969
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,160
I have to go back.

970
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,640
Brother Liu.

971
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,480
Take me away.

972
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,120
Tonight,

973
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,320
you take me away.

974
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,560
We won't come back, okay?

975
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,560
Did you quarrel with your father again?

976
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,800
Dalian.

977
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,760
I have to go back now.

978
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'll listen to you

979
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,280
tomorrow.

980
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,160
Brother Liu.

981
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,920
Okay.

982
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,640
I'll take you back.

983
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,480
I'll see you in the future.

984
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,680
I'll marry you tomorrow.

985
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,280
Dalian.

986
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,040
I'll...

987
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,600
You...

988
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,120
Brother Liu.

989
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,400
Brother Liu.

990
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,480
I'll see you tomorrow.

991
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
I'll see you tomorrow.

992
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

993
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,040
Dalian.

994
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,520
You're in such a hurry to see me.

995
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,440
What's the matter?

996
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,480
Brother Liu.

997
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,440
What's the matter?

998
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,320
Take me away.

999
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,960
We won't come back, okay?

1000
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,200
We have to go back now.

1001
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,400
I'll listen to you tomorrow.

1002
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,680
I'll see you back.

1003
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,280
Let's go.

1004
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,080
Brother Liu.

1005
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:54,840
Miss.

1006
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,400
This is what Master wants.

1007
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,040
Brother Liu.

1008
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,040
I have to kill you.

1009
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,280
We have to leave here.

1010
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,080
Brother Liu.

1011
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,240
Tong Xiao Liu.

1012
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,080
Let's not meet again.

1013
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,960
We're not good at talking.

1014
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,400
You'll be dead if you die.

1015
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,920
Master said that

1016
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,080
you were in a critical situation.

1017
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,560
Miss said it clearly.

1018
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,200
She won't be with you.

1019
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,160
Why do we have to stick to it?

1020
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,200
Okay.

1021
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,160
Dalian.

1022
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,440
Dalian.

1023
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,320
Open the door.

1024
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,640
Open the door. I'll go out.

1025
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,320
Let's go.

1026
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,040
I beg you.

1027
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,680
Let me go.

1028
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,200
Let me go.

1029
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,040
I beg you.

1030
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,000
Dad.

1031
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,520
Tong Xiao Liu.

1032
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,520
You're not in a hurry to die.

1033
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:13,840
Mr. Zong?

1034
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,200
You can take it back.

1035
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,200
Dad.

1036
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,880
Can they solve your problems?

1037
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,200
Yes.

1038
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,040
Following my order from Gao Ying

1039
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,840

1040
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,840

You're such a fool!

1043
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,520
Are you stupid?

1044
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,440
CrazyRat!

1045
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,480
You dare toen't tell this?

1046
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,960

1047
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,480
Bastard

01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:18,760
We're doing great

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,280

1052
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,880
This time, I must join it with him

1053
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
I won't.

1054
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,880
The End

1055
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,880
Little Six.

1056
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Master.

1057
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,880
What's going on?

1058
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,880
I said Tong Xiaoliu.

1059
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
You're shameless.

1060
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,880
What's wrong?

1061
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
What's wrong?

1062
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Tong Xiaoliu.

1063
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,880
You...

1064
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
You...

1065
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,880
You've got the baby.

1066
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,880
Why are you kneeling?

1067
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Get up.

1068
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,880
You've grown up.

1069
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,880
I can't control you.

1070
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,880
I just said that.

1071
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Do you know what day it is?

1072
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
It's a living day.

1073
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,880
I know you've been looking forward to my birth.

1074
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Since you know...

1075
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,880
I'll save her.

1076
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
Master.

1077
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Since you've been taking me to the house,

1078
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
everyone around me is treating me like a son.

1079
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,880
I can't eat this dinner.

1080
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,880
You've always thought I was a fool.

1081
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,880
But I...

1082
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,880
I didn't do anything

1083
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
to put my words on the table.

1084
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
I'm sorry to you,

1085
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
but I must leave today.

1086
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,880
If...

1087
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,880
If I can't come back,

1088
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
I can't miss you.

1089
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Master.

1090
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,880
Master.

1091
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,880
I'm here.

1092
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
I'm going to kill you.

1093
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Stop.

1094
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,880
Old Huajie.

1095
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Youzi, we need to help you.

1096
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Good boy.

1097
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Liuzi.

1098
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,880
I still remember the three hundred and fifty gold steps Master taught you.

1099
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,880
The monster disappeared right away.

1100
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,880
The seven thousand and five thousand grand children of the Great Elder

1101
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,880
were all killed.

1102
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
The head was on the roof of the six cold and soft walls.

1103
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,880
The box was in the way.

1104
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,880
The dragon died.

1105
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,880
The gold was in the way.

1106
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,880
The sheep was in the way.

1107
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
The red skin was on the shoulder.

1108
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
The body was in the way.

1109
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,880
The tiger skin was on the side of the stone.

1110
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,880
The lion was in the back of the lotus.

1111
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,880
The dragon head was held by the lotus zodiac.

1112
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,000
The red Arm spots were on thelie

1113
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,880
but broke apart.

1114
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,880
They were destroyed by the slicer.

1115
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Before.

1116
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,880
Как drunken Heroine and schwieren ax

1117
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,240
That 알았어 sweet night

1118
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
They must be together.

1119
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
What?

1120
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:48,880
The legend says that he can unite two people who have the same interests.

1121
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,880
One person is lucky, the other is unlucky.

1122
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,880
The two people are together, they will live together.

1123
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,880
Remember, the spirit of the city is the most important.

1124
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,880
The spirit of the city is the most important.

1125
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,880
The spirit of the city is the most important.

1126
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,880
The spirit of the city is the most important.

1127
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,880
The spirit of the city is the most important.

1128
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
The spirit of the city is the most important.

1129
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Stop! Stop!

1130
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Uncle, stop listening to us.

1131
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
This is the wedding.

1132
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,880
There is no division between the two parties.

1133
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,880
Where do you get the medicine?

1134
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,880
What's your plan, Commander Gao?

1135
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,120
Who do you want to kill?
