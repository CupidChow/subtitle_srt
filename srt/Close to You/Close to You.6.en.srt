1
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:21,604
Hey

2
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,231
Are you mad?

3
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,745
Don’t touch other people’s stuff. Ever again

4
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,872
Alright, sorry

5
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,375
Can you show me the way later?

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,962
The convenience store didn’t show up on Google Maps.

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,759
...Okay

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,777
Nice place

9
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,489
There’s nothing here

10
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,241
That’s why I like it

11
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,040
You cold?

12
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:24,751
Just... a little

13
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,429
Did you use to work out?

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,099
Why?

15
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,768
Do I look fit?

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,229
Just...

17
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,439
kind of?

18
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,609
What does that even mean?

19
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,694
Hey

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,909
You look like a puppy

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,582
I should call you... Jjong-ie~

22
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,253
Cut it out...

23
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,018
Geez...

24
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,158
Hey

25
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,993
Oh? Thanks

26
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
It’s warm

27
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,454
Yeah

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,043
What else did you get?

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,963
Just snacks?

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,341
You bought cigarettes, didn’t you?

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,303
I don’t smoke

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,347
I saw you smoking outside the house

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,603
Only when I feel like crap

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,770
Come on, let’s go

35
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,215
What are you reading?

36
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,091
Just something

37
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,097
Is it good?

38
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,434
I like it

39
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,143
I like reading

40
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,482
Just looking at words gives me a headache

41
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,611
I’ve been doing sports since high school, even in college

42
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,614
What kind of sports?

43
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,199
Soccer

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,785
But I like anything physical

45
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,997
That’s... cool

46
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,510
What’s cool about that

47
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,053
It’s just kicking a ball

48
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,515
I’m not good with stamina

49
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,475
I can’t really run

50
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,146
so when I see people who can…like you...

51
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,650
it’s cool

52
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,450
Guess I should take Jjong-ie for a walk

53
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,535
Ugh...

54
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,997
Why

55
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,914
do you call me Jjong-ie?

56
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,298
It’s cute

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,685
Hey

58
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,020
Jjong-ie

59
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,520
Yeah?

60
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,908
You're just... cute.

61
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,419
Let’s go running tomorrow morning

62
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,404
[It…]

63
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,281
[had a bit of a salty taste]

64
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,006
This won’t do

65
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,716
Gotta take you on walks every day now

66
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,845
I’m not doing this again

67
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,389
Aw, come on~

68
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,933
You gotta run every morning to stay healthy and live long

69
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,451
It’s really nice here

70
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,996
The air’s clean too

71
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,499
Hey, Jjong-ie

72
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,543
Should I move in here?

73
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,087
Move in?

74
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:02,671
Yeah

75
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,007
Just kidding

76
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,927
Jeez...

77
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,139
Stop calling me Jjong-ie

78
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,432
Why not~

79
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,391
It’s cute

80
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,728
I’ll only call you that when it’s just us two

81
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,648
It’s just the two of us here

82
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,692
That’s what makes it nice

83
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,079
You cold?

84
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,417
Are you sick?

85
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,335
Nah

86
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,506
I’m gonna go lie down

87
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:06,277
[I went running with Kim Jungyeom]

88
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,489
[My heart pounded…]

89
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,823
[so hard it hurt]

90
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,830
[When I’m with him… I’m happy]

91
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,057
[I wish this break would never end]

92
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,078
Kim Jungyeom

93
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,204
You okay?

94
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,082
Want me to bring dinner to your room?

95
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,833
I’m good

96
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,879
Just bring me some water?

97
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,298
Uh... okay

98
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,308
I’ll leave it here

99
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,310
Yeah,

100
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,687
Thanks

101
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,109
I have to go into town tomorrow to run an errand for my mom

102
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,735
I’ll grab some meds for you

103
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,322
Nah, it’s fine

104
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,866
I’m just tired

105
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,453
I’ll be okay

106
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,731
Hey, Kim Jungyeom

107
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,024
I’m coming in, okay?

108
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:19,918
[Something urgent came up, so I had to go back]
[I’ll be in touch later]
[Don’t skip your runs, lol]

109
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,571
[Kim Jungyeom..]

110
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,365
[never came back after that day]

111
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,410
[I couldn’t reach him]

112
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,789
[And from that day on]

113
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,332
[I stopped writing in my diary too]

114
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,126
[Figures...]

115
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,420
[What a jerk...]

116
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,709
[One year later]

117
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,186
Honey, wash up and come eat

118
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,438
Okay

119
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,148
맞다

120
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,525
Oh, right. Do you remember Jungyeom?

121
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,026
Jeong-hee’s son?

122
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,569
What…?

123
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,950
Apparently he was sick

124
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,955
When he stayed here, it was for recovery too...

125
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:32,626
But I guess there were complications during surgery

126
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,547
Oh dear… So young… It’s just so sad.

127
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,309
[Hey, Jjong-ie]

128
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,145
[Take care of the house, okay?]

129
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,814
[Big bro will come see you again.]
