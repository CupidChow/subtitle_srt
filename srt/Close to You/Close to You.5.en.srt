1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,264
You’re not allowed to smoke here

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,337
Yeah, Mom

3
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,132
You’re eating well, right?

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,341
Uh, yeah, kinda

5
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,888
It’s getting cold this weekend
Leave the faucet dripping in the downstairs bathroom

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,222
Oh...

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,265
Okay

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,311
Oh, and Jeonghee’s son will be staying there for a few days

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,437
Out of nowhere?

10
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,148
He’s your age. Take care of him

11
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,275
I’ll send you some allowance

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,735
Bye, sweetie~

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,070
Ugh, Mom…

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,825
I don’t want to…

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,416
Didn’t wanna come either. Mom made me

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,381
Where do I go?

17
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,177
[What a jerk...]

18
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,506
I don’t drink coffee

19
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,053
I’ll eat the apple though

20
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,576
What kind of guy smokes but can’t handle coffee…

21
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,186
Hey!

22
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,276
Oh Ha-min!

23
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,757
Help me stretch

24
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,987
How do you know my name?

25
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,659
Grab this

26
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,165
My mom texted me

27
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,709
Pull it

28
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,174
Why…

29
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,300
did you come here?

30
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,888
Then why are you here?

31
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,849
Just… on break

32
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,352
Mom told me to house-sit

33
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,609
I came to rest

34
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,407
I’m Kim Jun-gyeom

35
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,043
[Still such a jerk.]

36
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,753
[But…]

37
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,297
[I don’t know why… but I keep looking]

38
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,343
Hey

39
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,348
Is the boiler busted?

40
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,350
Damn, it’s freezing in here

41
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,645
Ah…

42
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,525
Oh no… the boiler

43
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,657
Yeah, Mo

44
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,952
I’ll call the technician tomorrow

45
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,082
…Okay

46
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,253
I’ll give him my heating pad

47
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,381
My room’s warmer anyway

48
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,428
Yeah

49
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,805
I’ll call tomorrow

50
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,350
Forget it

51
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,643
You’re cold too

52
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,648
Let’s just sleep together

53
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,567
What?

54
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,782
I’ll grab my blanket

55
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,800
I… can’t sleep with someone

56
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,887
Same

57
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,273
So why are you here alone?

58
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,279
Ah… I used to live here

59
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,324
My family moved to Seoul ‘cause of Dad’s work

60
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:59,038
I just come here during breaks or weekends

61
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,749
So you got two houses?

62
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,002
Rich boy

63
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,172
I’m not…

64
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,886
Then why’d you come alone?

65
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,264
You really here to rest?

66
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,600
Just…

67
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,356
Got nothing else to do now

68
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,903
Why?

69
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,952
You sure got a lotta questions, huh?

70
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,247
Anyway, show me around tomorrow

71
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,456
Like where the store is…

72
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,542
Wait,

73
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,587
is there even a store here?

74
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,007
There’s a convenience store

75
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,928
Oh, nice

76
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,897
Night

77
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,016
Why were you reading that?!

78
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,101
Dude…

79
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,395
It was under my head

80
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,232
Hey…

81
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
So I caught your eye, huh?
