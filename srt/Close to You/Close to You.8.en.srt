1
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,276
If you're bored, you can leave

2
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,990
It's not that. I stayed up late working on an assignment yesterday

3
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,468
Do you even like movies?

4
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,680
I just like watching movies with you, sunbae

5
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,726
So what's the story about?

6
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:05,565
Does that woman like that man?

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,942
Yeah, she does

8
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,655
Then they'll end up together and be happy

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,993
Why do you think that?

10
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,995
It's a movie, after all

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,540
Who watches movies about love that doesn't work out?

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,169
That's a pretty narrow way to think

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,922
We'll see

14
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,304
But Hyun-woo sunbae

15
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,930
you kissed me once, didn’t you?

16
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,024
Why are you asking that now?

17
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,742
Planning to blackmail me?

18
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,785
Blackmail?

19
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,120
Wow,

20
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,207
so you did kiss me?

21
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,714
Honestly, I wasn't even sure

22
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,299
If it was real

23
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
or just a dream

24
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,516
It was nothing

25
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,310
Guess the movie was too romantic

26
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,896
No, it wasn't

27
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,234
After you ignored my texts and stopped coming to the club room

28
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,736
I ended up watching that movie alone

29
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,906
The guy shot the man he loved

30
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,408
Just like that

31
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,376
Is that what you call romantic?

32
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,796
Depends on your perspective

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,464
From mine, it was romantic

34
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,716
Then hear my perspective too

35
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,302
The sunbae I liked and followed around

36
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:26,766
suddenly kissed me, then completely ghosted me after that day

37
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,559
Tell me, who's really at fault?

38
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,859
...I hated that

39
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,945
Being pushed around by my feelings

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,321
Not being able to say anything

41
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,156
I did that to you?

42
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,449
I just liked you, sunbae

43
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,202
That's exactly what I hated. You saying you liked me

44
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,540
You like me?

45
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,626
Yes, I do

46
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,302
Mr. Kang Tae-yoon

47
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,182
sorry for spilling coffee 'unilaterally.'

48
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,189
I'll take care of the mess I made

49
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,359
Ah~

50
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,361
so that's why she pulled the trigger

51
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,488
Because she realized she couldn't have him

52
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,504
Hey

53
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,923
that's him, right?

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,427
Your first love?

55
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,763
He’s not my first love

56
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,975
Whatever

57
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,020
He’s the one you used to mope over back in college

58
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,525
Exactly how you described him

59
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,864
Oh

60
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,824
He's coming

61
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,619
I'm gonna grab coffee with Min-ho

62
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,578
You want anything, Min-ho?

63
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,754
I still have more to say

64
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't

65
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,552
And this is a workplace

66
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,227
Then, am I your first love, sunbae?

67
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,898
Are you crazy? You're not

68
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,359
Wow, crazy

69
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,319
So you really did love me?

70
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,198
You're crazy, bastard

71
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,455
Just like that movie, it ended a long time ago

72
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,125
You're lying

73
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,709
My movie...

74
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,591
My movie's just starting

75
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,226
Have you been watching too many movies or something?

76
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,867
I still like you, Hyun-woo sunbae

77
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,961
That...

78
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,297
Why are you telling me that now?

79
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,758
What? Do you have someone you're seeing?

80
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,386
No way, I checked already

81
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,400
I lived lukewarm on purpose, like a cup of coffee

82
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,792
I like you, Tae-yoon

83
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,253
I never stopped liking you, not even once,

84
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,423
in the past seven years

85
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,469
Let's grab another coffee

86
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,680
I've got so much to talk about

87
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,335
[Film, fall passionately in love again!]

88
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:21,239
[…Fall passionately in love again!]
