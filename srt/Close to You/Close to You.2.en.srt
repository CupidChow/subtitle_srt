00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,857
Jjae-yul

2
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,484
wanna wash up first?

3
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,873
...So cute

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,550
Ugh… what’s with this weather?

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,217
It’s freezing…

6
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,021
Jae-yul

7
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,902
Here. Put this on

8
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,653
What is it?

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,696
Earmuffs

10
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,990
No thanks. You wear them

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,452
Your ears are gonna freeze though…

12
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,769
What’s wrong?

13
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,981
My ears are freezing…

14
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,401
Here. Wear this

15
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,471
I’m going to the bathroom. You okay?

16
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,348
Yeah. I’ll wait here

17
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,556
You wear them

18
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,809
I’m fine

19
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,479
I don’t get cold

20
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,148
Keep them on

21
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:10,773
Let’s go

22
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,262
What happened?

23
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,932
Ah, crap…

24
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,433
The chain came off. What do I do?

25
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,559
Can’t we just fix it by hand?

26
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,065
Can’t you just put it back on by hand?

27
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,701
I think it’s back in place

28
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,286
No, I think it came off completely

29
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,329
Aren’t you pushing too hard?

30
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,208
Isn’t the problem over here?

31
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,563
Hey, Do-wan

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,358
Actually…

33
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,402
I’ve been meaning to say something

34
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:38,444
What?

35
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,116
Thanks

36
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,828
For hanging out with me… at school

37
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,456
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

38
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,084
Back in our first year…

39
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,629
I didn’t have any friends. I was just studying all the time.

40
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,008
Yeah,

41
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,718
you were such a loser back then

42
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,761
Shut up

43
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,771
How long do you think it’d take to bike to the end of the Han River?

44
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,566
I’ve never been there, so I’m not sure

45
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,402
Maybe… about two hours by bike?

46
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,822
No way. We’d never make it

47
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,379
Hold on a sec

48
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,512
Where are you going?

49
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,504
Let’s push our bikes that way

50
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,924
Forget it. You’re cold.

51
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,883
Let’s just go home

52
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,759
Come on

53
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,762
Just for a bit

54
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,305
Come on, follow me

55
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,184
Where are we going?

56
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,727
Just hurry up

57
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,421
Whoa…

58
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,506
This place is amazing

59
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,426
Yeah

60
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,760
It’s nice

61
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,013
Might be the first and last time we come here…

62
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,766
So take it all in

63
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,316
What do you wanna do… When you get to college?

64
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,487
I don’t know… What about you?

65
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,364
Me?

66
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,657
Hmm…

67
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,577
Guess I’ll try everything people normally do

68
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,624
You always just studied. Now you’re excited about college?

69
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,004
Well…

70
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,176
Planning to start dating or something?

71
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,138
Maybe..

72
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,272
I’m not going to date anyone

73
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,774
Even after college

74
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,027
Why not?

75
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,820
You’re pretty popular

76
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,947
Why never say yes to anyone?

77
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,200
It’s not about them

78
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,160
It’s about how I feel

79
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,371
You’re so mean

80
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,291
And you?

81
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,251
Why’d you ignore that DM last time?

82
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,922
Because I had to study

83
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,389
That’s over now

84
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,391
So… Are you going to date someone?

85
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,645
Hmm…

86
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,731
Not yet

87
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,406
Someday?

88
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,037
I hope you don’t

89
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,497
Hm?

90
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,540
Ah

91
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,584
By the way... why did you want to go to the Han River estuary?

92
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,212
You said it looked pretty… On Instagram Reels

93
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,297
Did I?

94
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,258
I don’t remember that

95
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,552
Yeah

96
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
I remember everything you like

97
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,101
You’re way too good at saying things like that

98
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,603
You should be the one dating

99
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,980
Dating..

100
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,533
Hey

101
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,576
Yeah?

102
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,868
Give me your hand

103
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,036
My… hand?

104
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,006
I like you

105
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,049
A lot

106
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,232
Was that okay?

107
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,443
You…

108
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,361
Idiot

109
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,917
Ah… It’s a shame

110
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,881
After we graduate…

111
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:40,306
We won’t see this view again, huh?

112
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,635
Even after graduation…

113
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,517
Let’s come here again. Together

114
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,982
Oh,

115
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,526
Without No Jun-su

116
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,278
Of course. He’s not invited

117
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,574
Let’s go

118
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,302
What about your broken bike?

119
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,848
I don’t know. I’ll just come back for it tomorrow

120
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,933
Wanna come with me?

121
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,227
Sure

122
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,520
We’ll see
