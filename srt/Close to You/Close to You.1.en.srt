1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,049
Come in

2
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,785
Still not warm yet

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,251
Hey, just get comfortable

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,962
It’s not my house

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,798
Damn, you make it sound like we’re strangers

6
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,508
What?

7
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,553
My mom gave me 100,000 won just for hanging out with you

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,263
100,000 won?

9
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,347
She likes you

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,891
Why?

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:00:59,768
Well…

12
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,978
you’re smart…

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,942
…and she thinks you’re cute

14
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,532
She told me to ditch No Jun-su and only hang out with you

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,415
Ah~

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,879
I thought things would feel better after the CSAT.

17
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,757
I like it

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,887
Of course, you do. You got into Hanguk University

19
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,435
Feels good, huh?

20
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,816
I’m hungry

21
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,528
What do you wanna eat?

22
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,450
When my parents go on trips, I get to order whatever I want

23
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,371
You pick

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,375
I’m fine with anything

25
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,086
Okay

26
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,342
What should we get?

27
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,553
Malatang?

28
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,639
Oh wait, you can’t eat spicy food

29
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,433
Ugh, weakling

30
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,434
Chicken?

31
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,811
No, had that yesterday

32
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,356
Burger, maybe?

33
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,958
Three-second rule

34
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,518
Man, you really need taking care of

35
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,687
How are you gonna get a girlfriend in college?

36
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,800
What

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,676
What, what?

38
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,262
Huh?

39
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,138
It’s all over your face

40
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,974
What…

41
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,100
what is?

42
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:38,944
Water?

43
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,489
Bathroom?

44
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,661
Dude, just make yourself at home

45
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,870
…Bathroom

46
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,998
Over there

47
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,553
The heater’s at 30°C. You’re still cold?

48
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,681
Is there a draft?

49
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,349
Is a window open?

50
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,393
Nope

51
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,026
Move forward a bit

52
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,875
This isn’t our soap

53
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,793
What body wash do you use?

54
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,670
It smells really nice

55
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,881
Ugh, seriously, get off

56
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,274
Boring

57
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,246
I’ll clean this up

58
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,623
You pick something to watch

59
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,820
You brought pajamas?

60
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,366
Where’s your teddy bear?

61
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,659
At home…

62
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,706
Hey

63
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,210
Why are you so quiet tonight?

64
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,255
Did I do something?

65
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,259
…Just turn off the light

66
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,774
Jae-yoolie~ are you mad?

67
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,818
You’re…

68
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,986
so annoying

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
…Why?

70
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,785
Why didn’t you tell me you’re moving in with No Jun-su?

71
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,287
Oh…

72
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,413
that’s why?

73
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,543
Well

74
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,921
we’re going to the same college, so…

75
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,633
Anyway, my mom doesn’t like me hanging out with No Jun-su

76
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,677
She might not even allow it

77
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,222
But if you were my roommate…

78
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,892
She would’ve told us to move in together right away

79
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,813
I…

80
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,815
only have you

81
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,025
friends..

82
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,659
It’s not about having a lot of friends

83
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,872
It’s about having the right ones

84
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,548
Like us

85
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,803
Now sleep

86
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,013
Let’s ride our bikes tomorrow

87
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,225
All the way to the end of the Han River

88
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:55,326
'Between our breaths, I can hear a heartbeat'

89
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,746
'This sound…'

90
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:04,043
'It’s coming from my heart'
