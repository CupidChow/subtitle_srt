1
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,006
What are you even saying...?

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,799
You like me?

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,343
...What?

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,896
What?

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,772
What’s wrong?

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,443
Hyun Joo-chan...

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,070
You bastard...

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,698
I like you!

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,993
I’ve liked you~ For seven years~

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,999
What the hell?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
Shit!

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,295
Ah...

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,504
My report...

14
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:49,793
'Haha...'

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
'Fuck...'

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,938
I like you, you bastard.

17
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,482
We're friends. Right?

18
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,696
What even *is* a friend?

19
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,157
Just being together... makes me feel calm.

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,993
Just having you around... It comforts me. And makes me happy.

21
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,161
Then, I guess I like you.

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,413
Don’t lie to me!

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,582
You said this was brand new when you sold it!

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,502
Friend...

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,170
You... like me?

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,962
'Did that work...?'

27
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,799
Yeah, man.

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,176
If your friend says they like you, be thankful!

29
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,178
Why are you so uptight about this?!

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
I hang out with you too much,

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,184
I’m turning into an idiot too.

32
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
You said you wanted to kiss me.

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,067
Did I... say something that fucking crazy...?

34
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,903
Ah~

35
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,032
I wanna kiss Hyun Joo-chan~

36
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,496
Just tell the truth already!

37
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,749
This thing was broken when I bought it, wasn’t it?

38
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,839
Yeah. You’re right.

39
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,799
I used to like you. A long time ago.

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,677
I was crazy, okay? But that’s all in the past.

41
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,387
I was drunk. It was a moment of weakness...

42
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,429
Now? Now we’re just...

43
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,017
just friends.

44
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,731
'From seven years of observation...'

45
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,859
'Hyun Joo-chan only raises his eyebrow'

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,443
'for three reasons.'

47
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,446
'One, when he's annoyed.'

48
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,407
'Two, when he's angry.'

49
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,999
'And three... when he's fucking *furious*.'

50
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,830
'Right now...'

51
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,060
'Yeah, he's fucking furious.'

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,300
Hey. You remember this?

53
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,303
The friendship bracelet? The one you gave me for my birthday?

54
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,682
I thought I lost it. But I found it the other day. By accident.

55
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,893
Hey,

56
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,522
Are you messing with me?

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,776
'Shit... It's over.'

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,573
Sorry...

59
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,246
But... Can we... Can we still be friends?

60
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,249
Ha...

61
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,961
'Shouldn’t have drunk that night...'

62
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,602
'What...?'

63
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,187
'What the hell...?'

64
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,246
Ah, shit!

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
Ah!

66
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,374
My report!

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,000
What...?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
That guy... again...?

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,171
In this kind of situation...

70
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,924
Most people wouldn’t get it. They’d be confused.

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,634
'But me? I figured it out right away.'

72
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,718
'This is...'

73
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,552
'A time loop.'

74
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,429
'How do I know?'

75
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
'One.'

76
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
'The guy yelling.'

77
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,061
'About his report. Again.'

78
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,145
'Two.'

79
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,064
'The clock turned back ten minutes.'

80
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,400
'It was 3:10 before. Now it's not.'

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,401
'Three.'

82
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,778
'The café worker mopping the same spot.'

83
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,822
'No way they clean that often.'

84
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,740
'And the kicker?'

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,410
'I’ve watched Hyun Joo-chan's face for seven years.'

86
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,577
'I know his every expression.'

87
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,122
'So yeah.'

88
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,999
'This is 100%'

89
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,074
'a time loop.'

90
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,640
[FIRST TIME LOOP]

91
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,388
'This is my second chance...'

92
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,849
About me confessing drunk?

93
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,349
What?

94
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,479
"You bastard... I like you~"

95
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,357
"I’ve liked you~ For seven years~"

96
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,276
That...

97
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,610
Wasn't even meant for you!

98
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,489
Who the hell have you known for seven years besides me?

99
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,616
Nobody.

100
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,868
But hey, I'm planning to meet someone now.

101
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,911
Don’t lie to me!

102
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,205
You said it was new when I bought the laptop!

103
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,166
'God, that guy is annoying as hell...'

104
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,000
You said you wanted to ki...

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,545
..Kiss your best friend and win the dare!

106
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,632
It was... A drinking game!

107
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,095
Why...? Were you surprised?

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,724
'Ugh, this is so pathetic...'

109
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,435
That was a joke...?

110
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,270
'Did that... Work...?'

111
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,773
Fine. Let’s say that was a joke.

112
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,399
But you called me the next day.

113
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,319
And that time...

114
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,866
Hey... Joo-chan...

115
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,163
Want to sleep with me? Just once...?

116
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,873
You’re insane, Yoo Si-hwan.

117
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,208
Stupid.

118
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,084
Freak.

119
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,668
Pervert!

120
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,297
Just tell the truth already!

121
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,467
'Is this... really the end...?'

122
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,014
'One, two, three...'

123
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,724
'Six?'

124
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,811
'It’s rainbow colored... But why are there only six?'

125
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,439
'Huh...?'

126
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
'The red one's missing!'

127
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,984
What the hell are you talking about?

128
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,653
So... I can loop six more times?

129
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,071
But how...?

130
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,697
What did I do before...?

131
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,263
Ah, shit!

132
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,932
Ah! My report!

133
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,186
'Yes! I’m back!'

134
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:18,847
[SECOND TIME LOOP]
'Yes! I’m back!'

135
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:20,267
'Wait.'

136
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,026
'So turning the bracelet counter-clockwise works...?'

137
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,697
'What if I turn it more? Like, Go back even further... Before the confession!'

138
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,490
'God,'

139
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,908
'I’m a genius!'

140
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,120
Hey! Hyun Joo-chan!

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,163
I fucking love you!

142
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,049
Let’s go! To the past!
