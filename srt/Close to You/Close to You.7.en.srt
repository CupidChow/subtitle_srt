1
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,872
Hyunwoo sunbae

2
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,097
…Sorry, who?

3
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,100
Wait…

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,768
Don’t you remember me?

5
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,394
Sunset Boulevard!

6
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,981
Sunset Boulevard?

7
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:05,908
["Film, fall passionately in love again"
– Film Club “Sunset Boulevard”]

8
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,970
Ah, that guy

9
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,221
Wow...

10
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,806
"that guy"?

11
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,767
You don’t remember my name?

12
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
Kang Taeyoon?

13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,999
Of course I remember

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,333
How could I not?

15
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,961
Right?

16
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,465
I’m not exactly… forgettable.

17
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,221
Sunbae, if you’re not busy… would you like to grab a coffee with me...

18
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,682
Ah, I’m so sorry

19
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,851
I have something urgent to handle right now

20
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,481
I’ll message you if I get some time

21
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,774
Sorry about that

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,697
Then I’ll go get it

23
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,160
You like lukewarm coffee, right? A little ice in a hot cup?

24
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,662
I’ll be quick

25
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,289
Just stay right here

26
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,541
Oh… right, you’re already here

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,876
I’ll be right back

28
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,576
Just leave it there

29
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,495
thanks. I’ll get the next one

30
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,830
Wow. That was... impressively rude

31
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,755
Hyunwoo Sunbae

32
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,966
do you have just a minute?

33
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,305
I really don’t have time right now..

34
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,483
Wow. That went spectacularly wrong

35
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,086
Are you okay?

36
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,507
I’m so sorry

37
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,343
I’ve been swamped… I wasn’t thinking straight

38
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,513
Why are you speaking formally to me?

39
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,097
Huh?

40
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,559
You never used to talk to me like that

41
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,769
It’s...

42
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,105
work?

43
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,858
Just talk normally, sunbae

44
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,195
Ah…

45
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,159
Oh..

46
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,411
I’m really sorry

47
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,164
Do you have a T-shirt underneath?

48
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:32,581
Huh?

49
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,626
Can I borrow your shirt?

50
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,797
Ah...

51
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,258
Sure… just a sec

52
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,060
You’re still… beautiful

53
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,909
Don’t people usually say “handsome” instead?

54
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,639
Good thing I like lukewarm coffee

55
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,310
If it were hot

56
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,728
you could’ve been burned

57
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,356
I always wondered…

58
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,525
why do you like lukewarm coffee?

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,402
I like mine ice cold

60
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,447
Or,

61
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,616
you know... scalding hot

62
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,120
When it’s too hot...

63
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,579
I can’t handle it

64
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,916
This is a little tight

65
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,502
It looks good on you

66
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,339
Do you use expensive cologne?

67
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,216
Smells nice

68
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,554
It’s not that expensive

69
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,934
Back in college, I really liked you
I even bought clothes to match yours

70
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,770
Really?

71
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,025
I just thought you liked movies

72
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,735
Or maybe the drinking parties

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,279
No

74
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,322
I joined the film club because of you

75
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,787
I’m honored

76
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,666
Hearing that from Kang Taeyoon—the guy everyone like

77
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,175
I’ll wash this and bring it back

78
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,349
Hyunwoo sunbae

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,687
Back in the club room…

80
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,898
You kissed me once, didn’t you?
