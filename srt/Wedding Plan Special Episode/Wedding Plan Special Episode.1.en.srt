Hey.

Don't smile like that.

18
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,200

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,890

Well... I am wiping your face slowly like this

to show you're mine.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
What are you doing, Lom? There are so many people here.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,870
This is how you show I'm yours.

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,720
But what if someone takes a picture of us and send it to your mom?

29
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,220
You've been hiding it for more than ten years. Are you going to be exposed today?

39

Yes.

40
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,300
Mom. Aren't you going to say anything?

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,050
Yes.

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,400
Mom?

43
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,030
I said yes.

Hello, Mr. Nuea.

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,770
Long time no see.

48
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,250
Yes. It has been a long time since the wedding.

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,930

54

Mom, Nuea is my guest. Don't be rude.

55
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,090

56

59
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,490
How dare you ask? Didn't you see her face just now?

60
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,870
I'm sure she doesn't like me.

61
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,250
Why are you saying this? Are you giving up?

62
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,250
Don't discourage me with words.

63
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,640
You know that I'm not someone who gives up easily.

64
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,650
If I wanted to give up, I wouldn't be sitting here.

65
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,330
Yes.

66
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,810
But, I'm just

67
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,409

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,370
I have good news for you.

69
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,330
If my mom doesn't like you,

70
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,240
she won't let you see her.

71
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,310
If we really met her, she must be here to kick us out.

72
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,100
But now, she's just...

73
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,330
She's just

74
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,140
preparing herself.

75
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,540
Ah, Lom, is this helping?

76
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,650
I'm telling the truth, Nuea.

77
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,560
My mom always knew when I was the groom,

78
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,630
who was there for me.

79
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,180
See?

80
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,700
If she didn't agree,

81
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,590
she would have come out to scold us.

82
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,000
What we need to do is to make her accept us.

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,180
That's easy to say.

84
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,770
Aren't you going to help me?

85
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,380
Are you really not going to help me?

86
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,190
Yes, we made a pinky swear.

87
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,960
Goodness.

88
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,010
Please help me.

89
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,290
Don't think too much.

90
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,440
I can't stop.

91
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm exhausted. Why are you running?

92
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,790
This is all because of you.

93
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,630
What? Why am I the only one to blame?

94
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,470
You too. We all ran out of the office together.

95
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,430
We arrived together.
Enough, you two.

96
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,860
What are you arguing about? I can't work anymore.

97
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,470
Okay, okay. I can say it myself.

98
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,760
What is it?
Here's the thing.

99
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,870
When we came out of the office,

100
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,970
we met Nuea

101
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,420
at the corner of the stairs.

102
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,810
You know, face to face.

103
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,340
Ah.

104
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,120
But thanks to my strong survival skills,

105
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,280
I managed to escape.

106
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,430
Wait. You skipped so much.

107
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,490
Why don't you talk about yourself? You almost spilled out about the wedding.

108
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,960
Why did you ask me to come with you?

109
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,090
Otherwise, she'll kill you.

110
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,880
Let's skip

111
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,690
unimportant things.

112
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,210
The point is

113
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,110
we escaped, right?

114
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,930
Yes.

115
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,700
By the way, isn't the customer here yet?

116
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,590
How would I know?

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,170
I'm not a cell in the customer's brain. How would I know?

118
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,000
My goodness. That's so cruel.

119
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,110
Seriously.

120
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaking of the devil.

121
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,630
The devil's kind of handsome.

122
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,630
Hello, everyone.

123
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh my god, what time is it?

124
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,510
3:58 pm.

125
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,820
We're supposed to meet at 4 pm, right?

126
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,290
Or did I remember the time wrong?

127
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,490
When did they have a grudge?

128
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,350
I think it's more about jealousy.

129
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,980
Yes, Mr. Lom, we're supposed to meet at four.

130
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,000
Have a seat. Let's talk.

131
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,240
Yes. I sent the update to your e-mail. I wonder if you've checked it.

132
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes, it's better than I thought.

133
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,900
As expected from a wedding planning company.

134
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,080
I hope no one will ruin the wedding this time.

135
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,570
Don't worry. There won't be any.

136
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,600
This is what you want.

137
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,230
How is it? Do you like it?

138
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,760
I like it very much.

139
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,450
Then let's get back to work.

140
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,960
According to the schedule, we don't have much time.

141
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,430
Okay, let's continue.

142
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,490
Thank you for the information.

143
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
I'll get going then.

144
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,500
I have an appointment with Nuea this afternoon.

145
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,020
I'm afraid I won't be able to get back to the company in time.

146
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,230
Oh my god. Go wherever you want.

147
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,040
We still have a long meeting. You're not much help here.

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,380
Oh, my. He's a customer.

149
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,320
If he doesn't pay, he's not my client.

150
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,760
Mr. Lom, you should go first. We still have a lot of things to prepare.

151
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,530
I trust you.

152
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,960
Okay. You don't have to cheer us on.

153
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,630
We'll do our best anyway.

154
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,320
But you have to do your job well.

155
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,430
If our friend Nuea turns you down,

156
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,750
we won't be able to help you.

157
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,610
What do you think?

158
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,280
Gosh.

159
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,730
You two...

160
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,660
I hate him so much!

161
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,130
It's okay. Anyway, it's about our brother.

162
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,220
No matter how much we hate him, we have to do our best.

163
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
Yes, let's do it.

164
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,850
Come on.

165
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,690
Hello, Mr. Sailom. Are you busy?

166
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,470
I've been working all day. I'm done.

167
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,760
Then...

168
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm good at timing.

169
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,490
Yes, I just saw your secretary.

170
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,640
But she doesn't look at me with weird eyes anymore.

171
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,890
But whenever we meet,

172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,700
she grins at me.

173
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,880
Are you listening to me?

174
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Yes, that means she knows.

175
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,840
What's your relationship with me?

176
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,460
Then what's our relationship?

177
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,790
I want you to tell me.

178
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,210
You go first.

179
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,060
You know what? If we were in a drama,

180
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,140
at this time, your secretary

181
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,590
will come in and say,

182
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,380
oh, I'm sorry, then run out.

183
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,220
Do you believe that?

184
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,310
So, in order to prevent this from happening, I won't let you kiss me?

185
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,340
I want to see someone anxious.

186
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,730
Lom, if you care about work,

187
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,900
we can postpone the vacation.

188
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,710
That's not what I meant.

189
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,740
That means you don't like

190
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,310
me using our time to visit Chiang Mai.

191
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,690
Not that either.

192
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,100
I knows how much you want to go to Chiang Mai with me.

193
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,460
Okay. What's in the drawer?

194
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,470
Nothing.

195
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,990
We're going to a restaurant, right?

196
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,810
Oh, right. I heard the reservation takes months.

197
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,620
Is it too late? What time is it?

198
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,650
Oh, yes.

199
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,540
It was so hard for me to book this restaurant.

200
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,050
Yes.

201
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,810
Are you ready?

202
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,530
Yes.

203
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,490
Let's go. How do I know what's good there?

204
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,870
What would you like?

205
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,340
Order according to my preference.

206
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,620
Of course we'll order according to your preference.

207
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,120
So cute.

208
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,120
Let's go.

209
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,750
[YUNG7]

210
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,270
Sister.

211
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,090
Do you think Nuea knows

212
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,830
how tired we were when we prepared a surprise for him?

213
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,600
It's better if he doesn't know. How else can it be a surprise?

214
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,910
I'm tired.

215
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,340
Stop complaining and get back to work.

216
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,240
I wonder if

217
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,550
there will be such a perfect man

218
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,340
to surprise me?

219
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,210
Before it comes to surprises and handsome guys,

220
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,690
find a man first.

221
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,710
Got you. All you do is interrupt others. Were you a fork in your previous life?

222
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,620
You...

223
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,050
I'll hit your head.

224
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,580
What's wrong?

225
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,350
Ah!

226
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,290
Prize, Jom, everyone. I can't stand it anymore.

227
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,720
Order plane tickets to Chiang Mai.

228
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,600
I can't do online work. I need to go to the site. Right away.

229
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,290
Wait, don't go yet.

230
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,490
What about the things we left behind?

231
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,310
Call for leave, medical leave, vacation. We can take any leave.

232
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,490
I have to go to the scene.

233
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,230
I don't know how to design Nuea's wedding.

234
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,700
Let's go.

235
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,690
Take a leave.
Are we really going?

236
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,430
What should we tell the boss? The whole team will be gone.

237
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,700
It doesn't matter what we say to our boss.

238
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,660
What matters is... If we don't follow her, she'll go alone.

239
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,800
Wait for me.

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,120
Aren't you going to clean up with me?

241
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,410
Sister, wait for me.

242
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,080
[Chiang Mai Airport]

243
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,170
Is the air in your hometown

244
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,609
refreshing?

245
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,280
Oh, my God. PM2.5 filled my lungs.

246
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,410
I will help you.

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,190
Here. I can carry it myself.

248
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,200
Give it to me.

249
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,790
Did you do something wrong?

250
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,420
You were helping me on the plane too.

251
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,850
Now you're here to help me with my stuff.

252
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,110
Tell me what is up with you.

253
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,760
You talk like I'm not usually a gentleman.

254
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,740
It's just a joke.

255
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,130
Unless...

256
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,390
Lom, Nuea.

257
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,740
The most handsome Sun

258
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,260
and beautiful Ryu are here.

259
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,190
I'm sorry, Nuea. There was a traffic jam.

260
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,650
I told you I could rent a car later.

261
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,480
There's no need to pick us up.

262
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,580
I'm afraid you won't go back to play with us.

263
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,360
It's more like you're afraid of the one next to me.

264
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,150
It's okay.

265
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,050
Long time no see.

266
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,650
Your muscles have become strong and you're more handsome.

267
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,630
Awesome.

268
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,460
Cool.

269
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,540
Lom is looking for things as soon as he gets here.

270
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,830
I'll block the girls for you later.

271
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,530
Good job, bro. Go ahead.

272
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,870
Hey. Lom. Is there something that I don't know?

273
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,930
Aren't we going back together?

274
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's go on a trip first.

275
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,690
If we go back now, those relatives

276
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,500
won't let me stay with you.

277
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,510
We need to enjoy this vacation first

278
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,090
before we start working as farmers.

279
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,390
By the way, you were good-lookng even when you were in the fields.

280
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,640
Because your body

281
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,300
sweats.

282
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,520
Sexy.

283
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,530
Did you forget that Ryu and I are still here?

284
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,810
Look at my partner's face.

285
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,830
It's as red as an apple. Look.

286
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,170
By the way, if you take the car,

288
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,710
how are you and Sun going back?

289
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,040
Camp will pick us up later.

290
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,450
You guys should go on a trip first.

291
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,850
And...

292
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,450
Good luck, Nuea.

293
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,300
Go ahead. Otherwise we'll spend less time together.
Okay. Let's go.

294
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,890
Drive safe. See you later.
Thank you.

295
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,670
Okay. See you later.
Why wish me good luck?

296
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,780
Let's go.
What?

297
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,680
I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry.

298
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,810
Who would be angry with that face?

299
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,340
I'll explain. It's okay.

300
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,130
The next task is

301
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,490
to wait for the people on the next flight.

302
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,550
Look over there.

303
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,120
The noodles here are really good.

304
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,370
And that one.

305
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,280
You're from the north,

306
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,150
only noodles from this restaurant will do.

307
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,550
The tourists don't come here often.

308
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,410
But it's really delicious, Lom.

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,030
Over there, Lom. Drive towards the Maeka River.

310
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,490
There are many fun places in Chiang Mai.

311
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,260
Everyone says there's a lot of snacks.

312
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,310
I also want to go Tha Phae to find some snacks.

313
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,510
Let's go there this afternoon.

314
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,360
I heard it myself.

315
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,110
Why is it all about food? Are you homesick?

316
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,440
I haven't been home for a year.

317
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,580
Then let's have fun today.

318
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,190
Lom. The water is so beautiful.

319
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,990
I have been here to play since I was a kid.

320
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,410
Even if it has been a long time, it's still the same.

321
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,400
Look over there. It's really the same as before.

322
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,340
But the water is murky.

323
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,920
We can finally go back to Thailand, right, Rine?

324
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,510
Yes.

325
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,060
Yes. And we're not just here to visit family.

326
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,630
Let's go.

327
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,440
We are back as the relative of the groom.

328
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,430
This way, please.

329
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,270
Okay.

330
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,150
Everyone, the handsome Sun is back.

331
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,000
Where did you go?

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,500
I just asked you to send Nuea a car. Where are they?

333
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,270
You know this place is short of people.

334
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,570
You're even more fierce than a dog.

335
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,690
How dare you order me around on the first day we met?

336
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,240
Is this Nuea's boss

337
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,030
or his relative?

338
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,270
Are you saying that I'm a dog?

339
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,080
I meant a fierce beauty.

340
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,770
You don't have to say anything. Sun is familiar with this smile.

341
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,690
What can I do for you? You can tell me anytime.

342
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,380
You don't have to do anything. Just stay by my side.

343
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,600
Or you'll get tired.

344
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,450
Stop! Go and decorate that place for Jom.

345
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,780
I can tell from your face that you do physical work.

346
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,460
Goodness. Can't you let me have a boyfriend?

347
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,770
I don't have one, you can't have one either.

348
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,080
How can I help you?

349
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,700
Can you arrange flowers?

350
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,010
Sister. He looks like a prince. What can he do?

351
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,380
I can do it.

352
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,920
I arranged flowers for my mom.

353
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,900
And you didn't make them in Lanna style.

354
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,250
It should be like this.

355
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,420
Really? Sit down. How should we do it? Tell us.

356
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,410
Use this and do this.

357
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,850
This?

358
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,460
Why are you standing there?

359
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,690
Go do what you should do.

360
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,810
Jom, pull him over.

361
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,750
You are not doing what you should be doing.

362
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,120
Sister. Are you under a lot of pressure lately?

363
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,460
Sun, help me with the flowers here.

364
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,670
Brother. Can't I look at my boyfriend's gentle side first?

365
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,670
There are plenty of opportunities.

366
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,230
There are so many more. Didn't the relatives of the groom come with you?

367
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,850
I took them to the lounge.

368
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,130
They should be unpacking.

369
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,920
They'll be here soon.

370
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,460
Slave. How dare you!

371
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,860
Do it properly. Did you make it with your hands or feet? The flowers are ruined.

372
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,880
That flower is too fragile.

373
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,550
And my name is Prize, not slave.

374
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,660
Surprise. Say surprise with me.

375
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,960
Surprise.

376
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,430
You can say it normally.

377
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,610
It seems Nuea's wedding will probably

378
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,020
be the one with the highest number of people among the ones we've ever had.

379
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,340
Right?

380
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,830
So many people.

381
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,580
It's good to be home.

382
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,760
Doesn't Rine like the life there?

383
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,290
Do you not like it?

384
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,600
Look at your face.

385
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,490
As you know, no matter where we are,

386
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,140
as long as you're there, I'll be satisfied.

387
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,120
You're such a sweet talker.

388
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,870
Do you want to try it?

389
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,180
Let's go help prepare Lom's wedding.

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
I wonder how they are now.

391
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,660
Lom, look over here.

392
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,760
The atmosphere here is great.

393
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,120
It's not a rainy day now. The atmosphere is still so good.

394
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,210
Lom, look at the scenery. Why are you looking at me?

395
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,870
I'm looking at the scenery too.

396
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,350
I'm looking at my NamNuea.

397
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,490
Who would talk like that?

398
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,820
I think someone is smiling too.

399
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,650
[CG: new message] [Not ready yet.]

400
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,410
Lom, let's play in the water.

401
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,180
[CG: new message] [Not ready yet.]

402
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,180
Lom, what are you doing?

403
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,780
Oh, nothing. It's just a work problem.

404
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,280
Where did you go? You're sweating all over.

405
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,570
I just went for a walk.

406
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,190
Let me see.

407
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,710
Lom, I'm tired. Let's go home.

408
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,130
Lom, what's wrong? Why are you trembling?

409
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,390
Are you okay?

410
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,760
Why don't we go home first? We can go back to the fields from here.

411
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,560
Let's go now.

412
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,680
Nuea, I already booked a room.

413
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,520
It's a bit hot, isn't it? Let's go straight to the hotel. Let's go.

414
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,340
Sailom. What hotel?

415
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,670
Are you not going to wear shoes?
I booked this hotel.

416
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:11,250
[CG: new message] [Not ready yet.]

417
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,890
Okay, put it there. Can you lift it higher?

418
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,780
Put it up a bit.

419
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,680
Okay.

420
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,830
Be gentle, Sun. Otherwise it'll break soon.

421
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,710
When will this end?

422
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,310
Stop complaining and just do it.

423
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,190
It's not done yet.

424
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,230
Why are you blowing? Okay, send.

425
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,020
All you know is blowing.

426
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,680
Hurry up. Our client is dying to get married.

427
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,390
You too. Hurry up. Don't just talk about others.

428
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,160
I give up.

429
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,280
Lom, I'm tired.

430
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,670
Why are we hiking today?

431
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,580
To exercise.

432
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,610
It's because you don't have much strength. So you need to exercise.

433
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,070
But I want to go home.

434
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,960
I want to go back and play with my nephew.

435
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,800
Just a little bit more, okay? Let's go up and enjoy the scenery.

436
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,180
Let's go and see the scenery.

437
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,200
Watch the slope.

438
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,150
Walk properly.

439
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,720
Whatever. I'm going home. I'm tired.

440
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,500
If you're tired, let me carry you up.

441
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,570
No, I'm going home.

442
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,740
Let's stop making a scene, okay?

443
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,300
I want to make a scene.

444
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,860
[CG: New message] [It's ready. Come back.]

445
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,010
I promise. If you go somewhere with me, I'll take you home.

446
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,160
Okay, my baby?

447
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,020
Nuea won.

448
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,610
Didn't you just say you wanted to go home?

449
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,950
The bridge gives me motivation.

450
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
I remember now.

451
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,590
At that time, you lifted your clothe to block others when we were kissing.

452
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,300
At that time, I thought

453
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,020
I was like a heroine in a drama.

454
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,260
I miss it so much.

455
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,260
Did you bring me here again to give me a surprise?

456
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,740
For example, a proposal?

457
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,850
I really feel it.

458
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,820
Lom.

459
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
You might know what I'm about to do.

460
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,450
I'm sorry. Your imagination is limited. That's all you can think of.

461
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,090
I must know what you're up to.

462
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,380
Because I have helped  many people propose.

463
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,060
But at least,

464
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,550
I hope I'm the only one to propose to you.

465
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,030
I may not be the most romantic boy,

466
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,780
or the most considerate boy,

467
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,400
or the sweetest boy,

468
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,160
or a man who can take the whole earth down and give it to you.

469
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,240
But I'm sure I'm the one that loves you the most.

470
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,870
Let me be the one who can protect you.

471
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,310
Marry me.

472
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,800
Okay?

473
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,170
Of course.

474
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,090
You don't have to give the whole earth to me.

475
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,200
Because now,

476
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,230
you are my whole world.

477
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,870
I swear I'll do my best to take care of you.

478
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,360
I swear I'll take good care of you too.

479
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,800
Lom, are you going to cry?

480
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,410
Can I cry?

481
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,790
Of course.

482
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,540
From now on, you're not alone.

483
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,550
And you don't have to watch the sunset alone.

484
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm sure I will be the one by your side

485
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,550
and the one who sheds tears for you.

Will mom and dad be scared by the wedding ring?

It's normal for them.

496
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,990
What do you mean?

497
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,700
Where should we start?

498
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,760
Here.

499
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,370
Is there an event in the field?

500
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,840
No one told me.

501
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,560
The event will be held tomorrow.

502
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,870
[NamNuea&Sailom]

503
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,320
What is this?

504
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,080
What took you so long?

505
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,420
It's said that Nuea accepted the proposal eight hours ago.

506
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,660
If you want to get married, go to bed early.

507
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,580
Or the cosmetics won't last long.

508
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,930
What are you looking at? Go to bed.

509
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,660
Get up and put on makeup at 3 a.m. tomorrow.

510
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,260
Lom. Look at Nuea. He just stares at me

511
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,820
as if he saw a ghost.

512
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,480
You can go to bed now.

513
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,020
All the staff have gone to bed.

514
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:19,850
Let's go.

515
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,870
Weren't you in London?

516
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,020
When did you come back to Thailand?

517
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,070
Let's go.

518
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,920
Where are we going?

519
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,860
Let's go.

520
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,600
Lom.

521
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,320
Let's go.
Please explain.

522
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,830
Lom.

523
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,910
Sleep. Don't let me play the bad role.

524
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,550
You too, Lom.

525
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,870
Have a sweet dream. You're such a trouble.

526
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,050
Good night, Nuea.

527
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,840
Hey, Lom.

528
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,100
Don't sleep yet. Get up and explain.

529
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,160
If you don't go to bed, I'll get violet with you.

530
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,620
Go to sleep.

531
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,590
Hurry.

532
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,150
Go to sleep.

533
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,880
Sleep.

534
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,390
Get up if you're awake. Don't keep lying in bed.

535
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,090
The makeup artist is waiting.

536
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,640
You too, Lom.

537
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,480
Then I'll take a shower next door. It will save some time.

538
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,040
The groom did well.

539
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,180
Groom!

540
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,560
Why are you yelling?

541
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,420
Wasn't Wa talking about the groom?

542
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,140
Who's marrying whom?

543
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,150
It's Nuea. Who else could it be? He's wearing the ring.

544
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,940
How could he propose to someone else?

545
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,280
Wa would be angry.

546
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,860
You...

547
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,710
Get up if you're awake. Otherwise you'll miss the auspicious time.

548
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,360
I'm getting married today.

549
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,700
You don't want to marry me?

550
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,010
No.

551
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,860
It's not like that.

552
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,830
You know that I want to marry you.

553
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,010
Otherwise, why would I have the ring?

554
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm afraid you will think that I'm forcing you.

555
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,200
We were supposed to prepare the wedding together,

556
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,730
but I think I was too anxious.

557
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,950
Others might think so.

558
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,240
Who told you to prepare the wedding alone?

559
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,520
But I didn't think so.

560
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,780
I don't know how many times I have prepared weddings for others.

561
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,000
So I think

562
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,510
if I really have my own wedding,

563
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,210
I also want others to prepare it for me too. You prepared it for me.

564
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,610
Although this wedding is arranged by Wa and others,

565
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,680
it's also prepared by you for me.

566
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,690
I'm just...

567
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm just nervous. Everything is going so fast.

568
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,150
Don't be mad at me.

569
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,050
Why would I be mad at the groom of mine?

570
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,220
Nuea isn't yours until the wedding is over.

571
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,330
Watch your manners, groom. The ceremony is about to start.

I love you.

575
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,050
Save it for your groom.

576
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,440
I wish you happiness, Nuea.

577
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,670
Don't be jealous.

578
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,900
I can give in on this.

579
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,400
The ceremony is about to begin.

Love each other well.

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,520
Yes, Mom.

583
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,140
We'll love each other forever.

584
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,150
Thank you.

Be together for a long time,

00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,500

No, I'm not.

727
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,710
I really like this new identity.

728
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,220
Then... Can you let me call you that all day?

729
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,400
I don't mind.

730
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,760
Exciting things happen every day these days.

731
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,560
Then, I will be lying down today.

732
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,820
Then my plan will be ruined.

733
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:37,470
We haven't gone on our honeymoon yet.

734
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,200
It's raining.

735
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,140
Yes, it's raining.

736
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,970
That's why someone puts on a long face

737
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,140
and even reserved here for three days.

738
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,520
But on the first day,

739
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,540
I'm under NamNuea's spell.

740
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,890
Smile.

741
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,960
It's cold.

742
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,760
I think it'd be nice to have someone hug me now.

743
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,080
Are you feeling better?

744
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,080
Not yet.

745
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,840
It's windy.

746
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,870
How can I be fine in such a short time?

747
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,400
It's a little better.

748
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,430
And I know that

749
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,700
whenever I'm cold,

750
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,630
I will be hugged

751
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,250
by a man called Sailom till now.

752
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,110
I know the answer.

753
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,010
Lastly, I fell into the trap of this groom.

754
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,180
I'm going to hold you tight.

755
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,710
Nuea will do it too.

756
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,690
Nuea's groom.

757
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,740
Hey, Lom, the rain has stopped.

758
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,120
Let's go.

759
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,180
Hurry up, Lom.

760
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,470
Wait for me.

761
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,110
Look over there.

762
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,650
♫It's a simple thing, if we share the same thought♫

763
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:23,000
♫No need to pause, nor think at night♫

764
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,100
♫This is just a small matter, don't worry♫

765
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,800
♫No need to force yourself, don't force yourself if it doesn't work♫

766
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,960
♫No matter what others think, so what? I don't care♫

767
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,080
♫Just the way friends, seniors and juniors look at us♫

768
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,580
♫Don't waste time thinking. It's not their business♫

769
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,610
♫It's between us. It has nothing to do with others♫

770
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:56,030
♫There's no definition of our love. It's always good♫

771
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,880
♫Even in the answer sheet, there is no correct answer♫

772
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,690
♫There's no problem♫

773
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:10,000
♫There's no reason. I chose him because I like him♫

774
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,270
♫Love has no definition♫

775
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:21,340
♫Just follow your heart. That's all♫

776
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,810
♫There's no reason. I chose him because I like him♫

777
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:56,130
♫No matter what, love is beautiful♫

778
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:04,110
♫I want to tell you in the past that I love you♫
