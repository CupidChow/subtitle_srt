1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,304
Yeah.

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,766
- Okay.
- Yo…

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,894
Yo…

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,980
Look how many floors there are.

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,106
Cursed vibes.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,488
This place is crap.

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,825
Yo…

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,495
This is dope.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,707
Babe, let's do an intro here.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,586
All right. And welcome to
the most haunted place in Taiwan,

11
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,254
Xinglin Hospital!

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,339
Wish us luck.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,967
We don't need it, we got talent.

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,802
Yo, did you hear that?

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887
Hear what?

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,139
- Something…
- Babe.

17
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,059
- Like back in that hole or something.
- Babe. Come on.

18
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,603
- I wasn't kidding. I heard something.
- Babe.

19
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,520
Okay, let's go--

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,774
Ethan!

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,108
You're such a jerk!

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,235
- Look at that bat.
- No fucking way.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,077
The comments section's gonna say
that bat was a paid actor.

24
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,413
I ain't got health insurance though.

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,085
Yo. What is this?

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,088
Are those fucking bones?

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,593
- That's legit, that's a skull! What?
- Baby, there's blood.

28
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,345
- What the fuck?
- There's blood.

29
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,471
What the fuck?

30
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,972
- Babe. No!
- Yo.

31
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,599
I don't wanna be here anymore.

32
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,768
Holy fucking shit!

33
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,270
Look at this place.

34
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,731
- Where did we come in from?
- I don't know.

35
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,778
Yeah, but I was recording,
I didn't see anything. I think…

36
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,446
You hear that?

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,031
No, wait, babe.

38
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,077
What?

39
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,996
- Yo, is someone there?
- Babe.

40
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
Babe, don't shout.

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,251
I'm not.

42
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,377
Don't shout.

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,339
- I think they're calling for help.
- What?

44
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,425
- Do you hear that?
- No. What are you talking about? Babe.

45
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,095
Something doesn't feel right. Ethan!

46
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,930
- It's all right, babe.
- Ethan!

47
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,224
Ethan, come back. Please.

48
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,352
Ethan, don't go.

49
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,188
- I'll be back.
- Don't, babe. Babe!

50
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,231
Shit!

51
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,941
Ethan.

52
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,783
Babe?

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,080
Ethan.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,678
<i>Another terrible incident</i>
<i>has been reported in Tainan…</i>

55
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,599
<i>According to the authorities, the yet to</i>
<i>be identified victims died from suicide.</i>

56
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,268
<i>As police investigate,</i>
<i>speculation runs rampant.</i>

57
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,979
<i>Was it accident, mischief,</i>
<i>or something more sinister?</i>

58
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,566
<i>The couple were ghost hunters</i>
<i>shooting for their YouTube channel…</i>

59
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,067
<i>Check this out. Holy shit!</i>

60
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>They went to Taiwan</i>
<i>just to commit suicide?</i>

61
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>- You don't think that's legit?</i>
<i>- …was it an accident, was it negligence…</i>

62
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,535
<i>The hospital was abandoned 30 years ago</i>
<i>following countless lawsuits</i>

63
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,580
<i>from alleged medical malpractice</i>
<i>and wrongful deaths.</i>

64
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>Since then, it has become infamous</i>

65
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,876
<i>for ghost sightings</i>
<i>and unexplained phenomena.</i>

66
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>Dude, this shit's spooky as fuck.</i>

67
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,465
<i>Are you brave enough to explore</i>
<i>the secrets of the Xinglin Hospital?</i>

68
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,824
Guys. Listen, okay?

69
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,493
I know we're all feeling nervous.

70
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,163
Especially since we don't have permits
and this is really kind of sketchy.

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,457
But that's why we're here, right?

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,417
We all want to do something different

73
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
and we're all willing to take that risk.

74
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,297
- We're done playing safe.
- Yes!

75
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,883
What if we actually
capture something inside?

76
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,884
Right?

77
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,761
We're not just going go viral.

78
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,554
We're gonna break the Internet.

79
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,891
Whole world could be watching.
Could be the biggest thing we've done.

80
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,851
Yes! We'll be seen worldwide!

81
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,769
Worldwide!

82
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,313
Exactly. And one more thing, guys.

83
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,315
I was able to negotiate bonuses.

84
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,859
So if we hit three million views,

85
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,278
we all get double the pay.

86
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,863
And even more if we exceed that.

87
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,573
What do you guys think?

88
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,909
You should've started with that.

89
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,245
Money talks. Okay.

90
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,254
Quen, tell us about
your new show, <i>Strange Frequencies.</i>

91
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,966
Yes, <i>Strange Frequencies</i>
is the next project I'll be producing

92
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,759
under my own production company.

93
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,722
So basically, with my fellow
celebrity guests, we are ghost hunters.

94
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,181
We investigate and explore

95
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,101
the most notorious and haunted
places around the world.

96
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,437
We were thinking of doing
something different.

97
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,981
So we decided
to live stream the entire thing.

98
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,359
But why this kind of show?
And why ghost hunting?

99
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,405
I've always been a fan of horror
ever since I was a kid.

100
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,740
And I'm really weird.

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,117
I collect a lot of horror memorabilia.

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,370
And it's always been a dream of mine
to be doing a show like this.

103
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,955
How about Jane?

104
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,125
Are you now shifting
from action to horror?

105
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,710
Right, horror.

106
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>For me, Gretch, as an actress,</i>

107
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,589
I'm good with any kind of genre.

108
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,633
So when Quen invited me,
even though it was last minute,

109
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,262
I said yes right away.

110
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,681
This is a concern.
You should've known this.

111
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,350
Why would we shoot there
if it's off-limits?

112
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,603
- No risk, no glory, right?
- Yeah!

113
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,063
No risk, no glory, so…

114
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,857
- My last movie was with Rob.
- It's Rob!

115
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,442
Yeah, it was horror also.

116
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,694
I guess by extension, Quen invited me too.

117
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,490
It's up to us to sell the fear
to the viewers.

118
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,992
Plus, we're all actors here, right?

119
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,203
- Yeah, well, that's right.
- Even MJ.

120
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,829
What?

121
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,581
Why am I being singled out?

122
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,083
And, MJ,

123
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,877
won't this horror show
ruin your beauty?

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,630
You know being a beauty queen

125
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,383
is being able to handle yourself
in any given situation with grace.

126
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>Even if there are ghosts.</i>
<i>So I'm game, girl.</i>

127
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,596
Just focus on yourself, okay?

128
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,973
- Oh, my God.
- You're mad?

129
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,975
- Spicy.
- I love that this is horror,

130
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,478
but it's feeling more like a drama.

131
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,522
Zarckaroo, my man.

132
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>He's a real ghost hunter and explorer.</i>

133
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,943
<i>He has a famous YouTube channel.</i>

134
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,945
What's your reaction when Quen called?

135
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,446
I thought he was a scammer.

136
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,743
But we had a video call.
I was both surprised and excited

137
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,454
when he said
that we'll do it on live stream.

138
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>So I find it different</i>
<i>from what I'm doing.</i>

139
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,002
And, Raf, is a tarot reader on TikTok.

140
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,755
Yes. I don't really know
what I'm doing here.

141
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,716
- You didn't foresee it?
- I didn't see it!

142
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,886
Alexa, this is a horror show.
What made you say yes?

143
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,347
I got invited by one of your friends,

144
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,267
who's also my friend
because we run in the same circles.

145
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>We have a lot of shared interests.</i>

146
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,146
And the timing was perfect.

147
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,649
Because our noontime show
just finished, yeah.

148
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm all in.

149
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,778
I promise to do everything I can
to make this show a hit.

150
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,071
- Promise!
- Love you!

151
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,157
- Promise.
- That's the spirit, guys!

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,493
You'll do everything for a hit show,
right, Alexa?

153
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,288
- You're not done?
- Shots fired.

154
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,541
You know what, bro, fuck it,
I'm in, I'll rock with you.

155
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,127
- Let's go.
- Thank you, brother. Let's go. Okay.

156
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,044
Raf?

157
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,172
For the money, go.

158
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,091
- Nice, thank you.
- Love it.

159
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,844
Jane?

160
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,929
Okay, sure.

161
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,098
All right!

162
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,393
Awesome! Let's give them
a good show, guys.

163
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,895
- Yes!
- Let's do this shit!

164
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,356
<i>Yes, I'm inviting everybody</i>
<i>to please watch</i> Strange Frequencies.

165
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,817
<i>Watch it live.</i>
<i>It's coming soon. Stay tuned.</i>

166
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,078
<i>Good morning from…</i>

167
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,581
<i>- Taipei!</i>
<i>- Taipei!</i>

168
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,000
- This is Alexa and this is Jane…
- Yep.

169
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,377
…and we just got here
from a red-eye flight.

170
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,630
But we're super excited. Are you excited?

171
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,924
Yes, but I didn't get any sleep at all.

172
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,841
I have circles.

173
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,051
I don't see it!

174
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,094
- Where?
- Oh, right, the power of makeup.

175
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,429
- Concealer.
- Wait.

176
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,140
- I think my phone rang…
- Oh, yeah, the boys are outside.

177
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,391
Let's go!

178
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,393
We're really excited!

179
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,271
- Wait. Guys! Come on!
- We're here!

180
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,067
- Welcome to Taiwan!
- Let's do this shit!

181
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,528
- Let's go!
- Finally, man, we're here!

182
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,072
- Gorgeous cameramen.
- Where are the girls?

183
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,865
Where are the girls?

184
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,368
- Hi, boys!
- They're here!

185
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,246
- Finally!
- How are you?

186
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,876
I think Lee Fung's here!

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,503
He's our tour guide.

188
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,921
Hey!

189
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,590
- Hey, guys! How are you? Good?
- Good.

190
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,883
- I'm Lee.
- Hi, Lee!

191
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,260
- Good morning.
- Hi.

192
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,347
- Welcome to Taiwan!
- Hi, Lee. Nice to meet you. Finally.

193
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,309
But seriously, Enrique,
thank you so much for inviting us here.

194
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,353
- Yes.
- Actually I've been really praying

195
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,480
for this moment since one week ago.

196
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,316
- You manifested it?
- I manifested that

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,485
all your followers will go to my channel.

198
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,279
That's crazy!

199
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,197
In the name of clout! Kidding.

200
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,283
Guys, I just want to say,

201
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,577
thank you guys so much
for doing this show.

202
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,454
We don't have a glam team or a crew,
you're on board.

203
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,123
So thank you guys so much.

204
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,291
You guys are solid.

205
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,502
<i>Strange Frequencies,</i> let's go!

206
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,964
<i>- Strange Frequencies!</i>
<i>- Strange Frequencies,</i> let's go!

207
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,109
Show me the model walk!

208
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,823
Enrique!

209
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,409
Shut up!

210
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,495
Enrique!

211
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,292
Philippines!

212
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,587
We're shooting a show
called <i>Strange Frequencies.</i>

213
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,465
Watch us tomorrow, on a live stream.

214
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
- Hi!
- Thank you, guys.

215
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,885
<i>Strange Frequencies!</i>

216
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,974
It's all good.

217
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,726
Careful!

218
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,439
MJ!

219
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,986
You like it?

220
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,947
- Enrique!
- Thank you, guys!

221
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,741
<i>Strange Frequencies!</i>

222
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,707
Watch out, guys, tomorrow's the night!

223
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,795
Let's go!

224
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,173
<i>Strange Frequencies!</i>

225
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,182
Okay, guys. Come on.

226
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,018
- Quen.
- Yo.

227
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,436
What's up with this place?

228
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,565
We'll interview a Taiwanese medium.
Someone who works with the paranormal.

229
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,533
- How's the framing?
- Perfect.

230
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,034
Is the camera ready?

231
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,619
- All right.
- Okay.

232
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,874
Sarah says she sees an evil spirit
clinging to one of you.

233
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,672
To who?

234
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:56,882
What?

235
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,176
- Jane?
- What?

236
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,720
- Me?
- Dude, what the fuck?

237
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,390
Jane, calm down.

238
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
Sarah says she's just joking.

239
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,155
Sorry.

240
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,200
But that's a good one.

241
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,037
I've seen many. Too many.

242
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,417
I've seen lost souls
who have unfinished business,

243
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,294
ghosts who are out for revenge,

244
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,923
senile ghosts who have forgotten
why they are still here.

245
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,513
She advises you to be respectful always.

246
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,601
Don't touch anything or take anything
from the places where they roam.

247
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,519
Otherwise, you might anger them

248
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,439
for disturbing their peace
and taking what's theirs.

249
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,653
Sarah warns that you should be very afraid
of some of these ghosts.

250
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,326
Especially ones that want to
play tricks with you and harm people.

251
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,455
Can you tell us more
about the nurse in Xinglin Hospital?

252
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,920
Sarah warns that
if you push through with this plan,

253
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,380
terrible things will happen to you.

254
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,929
<i>Don't use the spirits</i>
<i>of the departed for entertainment.</i>

255
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,348
<i>It's disrespectful.</i>

256
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>A haunted place is not a zoo.</i>

257
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,146
<i>These used to be people.</i>

258
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,982
<i>Have some decency and respect.</i>

259
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,911
There's a lot of things
I have not translated,

260
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,580
but she kindly asks you to leave.

261
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,893
Quen.

262
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,019
Yeah?

263
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,480
- You sure about this?
- Just like the Philippines.

264
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
I don't know.

265
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,068
I think he paid him off.

266
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,905
He's coming.

267
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,160
- Hey, guys. Let's go!
- He's sketchy.

268
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
Okay.

269
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,751
Here are all the gear.

270
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,712
Nice!

271
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,630
- Is there water?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,049
Let's get these inside.

273
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,676
Okay, next.

274
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,052
Nothing's up.

275
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,723
- Good?
- There's more.

276
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,433
- This shit's heavy.
- Wait.

277
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,597
What was that?

278
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,723
Why was it like that?

279
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,808
What?

280
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,477
Lee?

281
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,479
Excuse me, Sir Lee.

282
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,314
- Are we locked inside?
- Yeah.

283
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,775
So what?

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,110
What if there's an emergency,

285
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,488
- like fire, earthquake?
- Come on!

286
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,989
Don't worry, okay?

287
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,075
I can call Wei, I have his number.

288
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,035
Come on, take a look!

289
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,797
Oh, my gosh.

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,758
Oh, my God.

291
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,885
This place is so sick.

292
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,679
Really?

293
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,682
- Holy shit.
- Zarck, you're used to this, right?

294
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,351
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- What?

295
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,103
- So awesome!
- Guys!

296
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,730
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- I told you.

297
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,109
What the hell?

298
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,320
Honey, we're home!

299
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,488
Stop it, Rob!

300
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,489
Let's go, guys.

301
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,074
Let's set up base camp here?

302
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,410
- Yes.
- Sounds good, man.

303
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,370
Open the lights…

304
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,080
There we go. Let there be light.

305
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,373
Let there be light.

306
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,125
Can I have some?

307
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,502
- Later.
- Midnight snack.

308
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,712
This is my favorite.

309
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,672
- What's up, bro?
- What's up, man?

310
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,673
How about you, bro?

311
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,342
We have set up the transmitters over here.

312
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,553
- We have our monitors.
- What is this?

313
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,638
They're heavy.

314
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,224
- Check this out.
- Water.

315
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,728
- Oh, my goodness!
- You guys okay?

316
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,730
- What was that?
- What the fuck was that?

317
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,023
- Gosh.
- You guys okay?

318
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,941
- Wait.
- Our comms.

319
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,568
- Tumbler.
- Where's the water?

320
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,861
Extra lights.

321
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,822
- A lot of lights.
- Let's go.

322
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,869
So first, we have this EMF.

323
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,413
It goes off, and if it blinks red,

324
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,789
it means there's something.

325
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,293
If you see that while exploring,
tell Quen right away.

326
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,462
- So we just hold it up?
- Yep.

327
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,548
So this is the ghost balls or cat balls.

328
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:34,261
So basically, we place them on the ground.

329
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,347
They will light up if they are moved.

330
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,807
This is the holy grail.

331
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,018
- What's that?
- The REM pod!

332
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,311
- So nice.
- The what?

333
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,313
REM pod! Horror fan.

334
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,732
When something comes near it…

335
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,028
Oh, my God.

336
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,363
Let's see if it goes off.

337
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,115
- That works.
- Yep.

338
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,202
This is what we call EVP or spirit box.

339
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,328
Oh, I know this.

340
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,831
- So…
<i>- FM mode.</i>

341
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,334
It will scan for signal.

342
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:11,131
You can talk to spirits,
they usually respond through this.

343
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,720
- Zarck, you good?
- Rolling.

344
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,679
We're rolling.

345
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,098
Let's go upstairs?

346
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,603
Bro!

347
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,521
What?

348
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,899
Nothing. Just practicing.

349
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,818
Jerk.

350
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,237
You suck.

351
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,696
I'm just kidding.

352
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,073
This is a good distraction.

353
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,826
Let's hope that
it would be a good reading.

354
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,954
Okay.

355
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,249
Pick three cards.

356
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,708
- Hand them to me.
- Any?

357
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,626
Yeah.

358
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,857
Babe, that's scary.

359
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,778
The aura's a bit off, don't you think?

360
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,448
Yeah. I can feel a heavy presence.

361
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,951
- You feel it too?
- Anyway-- Of course.

362
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,370
- What?
- Yeah.

363
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,539
Anyway, let's try again.

364
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,629
Why do I feel nervous?

365
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,929
No way.

366
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,434
Are you serious?

367
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,437
- Did you shuffle it?
- You're the one who picked.

368
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,314
Is this a trick?

369
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,232
You picked the cards, not me.

370
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,695
Do you think I'm safe?

371
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,742
Get this one.

372
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,871
Babe, do you think I'm safe?

373
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,958
You can keep it in your pocket
or you can wear it.

374
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,002
And let's pray that we are all safe.

375
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,132
Shit.

376
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,636
This place is spooky.

377
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>Shit.</i>

378
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,935
<i>- Lee.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

379
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,603
<i>What is this for?</i>

380
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- What's that, Lee?</i>

381
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,190
It's a prop.

382
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,484
More views.

383
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,319
We don't need that.

384
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,072
We don't need to fake things.

385
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,450
Well, Lee's right, bro.

386
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,453
<i>For safety, just in case nothing happens.</i>

387
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>Anything for three million views, right?</i>

388
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,251
Fucking got you, motherfuckers.

389
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,336
Good job.

390
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,463
All right, guys.

391
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,632
- Got the monitors set up.
- Yep.

392
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,344
Comfortable?

393
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,887
- Wait. Hold on.
- Guys…

394
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,183
It's kind of uncomfortable at first,
but don't worry, you'll get used to it.

395
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,726
Zarck, why is it like this?

396
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,063
This angle isn't working for me.

397
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,233
- It's unfair.
- You should be confident.

398
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,442
Hey, Ems.

399
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,862
- My posture.
- You got this, girl.

400
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,449
Actually, I got that design
from the horror movie <i>Gonjiam.</i>

401
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,244
- Oh, yeah!
- That's a good one!

402
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,793
All right, monitors are good.

403
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,961
Lee, you rolling?

404
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,137
<i>Another terrible incident</i>
<i>has been reported in Tainan…</i>

405
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,057
<i>According to the authorities, the yet to</i>
<i>be identified victims died from suicide.</i>

406
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,435
All right, here we go, guys.
Time to crush it.

407
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,228
- You guys ready?
- Yes!

408
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,272
All right. All eyes on you.

409
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,523
Going live in five…

410
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,734
Four…

411
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,944
- Three…
<i>- …brave enough to explore…</i>

412
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,071
- Two…
<i>- …secrets of the Xinglin Hospital?</i>

413
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,456
<i>Hi, viewers!</i>

414
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,499
<i>Welcome to</i> Strange Frequencies,

<i>We're inside Xinglin Hospital</i>

00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,389
<i>this is one of the most haunted locations</i>

421
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,683
<i>And the question is, can we handle it?</i>

422
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>Will we encounter</i>
<i>supernatural entities here?</i>

423
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,189
<i>So buckle up, guys, because tonight,</i>

424
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,358
<i>we're taking on the unexplainable here on…</i>

425
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,360
Strange Frequencies!

426
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,671
Spirits, if you are present,

427
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,592
we welcome you to reveal yourselves.

428
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,114
Spirits of Xinglin,

429
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,658
if you are with us,

430
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,329
please let your presence be known.

431
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,002
O wandering spirit from all directions,
if you are present…

432
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,089
I beseech you,
reveal yourself without delay.

433
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,310
Ghosts!

434
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,438
Come out! We're not afraid of you!

435
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,691
What the fuck?!

436
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,609
- Shit!
- Oh, my gosh!

437
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,236
What was that?

438
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,613
Is there someone else here?

439
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
Something's off.

440
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
<i>Rob, go check it.</i>

441
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,451
Zarck! Come on, bro.

442
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,661
Hold on.

443
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,163
We're not splitting up.

444
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,790
We don't even know what that is
and in horror movies,

445
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,500
loners die first.

446
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,169
- Let's be smart.
- Die?

447
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,171
You know what, let's just all go.

448
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,755
- Let's check it out.
- Game!

449
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,674
- That's right.
- Go, this is perfect.

450
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,217
- Here we go.
- Should be here.

451
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,307
This is it.

452
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,852
Go, go, go.

453
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,402
- Oh, my God.
- It feels heavy.

454
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,614
- Zarck.
- It's heavy, I swear.

455
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,074
I think the noise came from here.

456
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,285
Someone's scared.

457
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,244
To the right.

458
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,875
- I'll check here, go check there.
- Okay.

459
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,635
Oh, my God.

460
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,511
It smells awful.

461
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,847
Fuck.

462
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,266
I don't like this.

463
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:19,976
It smells awful.

464
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,855
What the fuck?

465
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,399
Don't touch anything, okay?

466
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,110
That looks like real intestine.

467
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,779
- Yeah, it is real.
- Jump.

468
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,407
Can we go now?

469
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,119
Smells terrible.

470
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,122
- Is that an eyeball?
- Is this a fetus?

471
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,584
Guys, check this out!

472
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,878
- Fuck!
- What the fuck?

473
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,005
- What the heck?
- What is that?

474
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,674
- Rob.
- Oh, my God.

475
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,591
MJ!

476
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,718
Stop!

477
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,636
Stop!

478
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,514
Stop it!

479
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,682
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

480
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,891
<i>You're disgusting!</i>

481
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,310
Wait. wait.

482
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,436
What the heck?

483
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,729
No!

484
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,523
- Stop it!
- Rob!

485
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,983
- Rob, stop it.
- Stop it.

486
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,359
Put that down!

487
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,402
Not me!

488
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,029
Oh, my God!

489
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,364
That's disgusting!

490
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,824
Rob, what the heck?

491
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,741
The fuck, Rob?

492
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,618
- Stop playing around!
- Just a joke!

493
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,619
What joke?

494
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,204
That's too much, Rob.

495
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,164
- Let's go.
- Sorry!

496
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,252
Don't be stupid.
What if we get sick because of that?

497
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,964
<i>- Guys, that's okay.</i>
- You're screwed. Whatever.

498
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,550
<i>Rob, bro, just be more careful. Okay?</i>

499
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,303
Is Zarck okay?

500
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,639
Actually, guys,
whatever you're doing, it's working.

501
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,017
We're trending, so good job, everyone.

502
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,268
Let's just keep it up.

503
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,937
MJ and Zarck, go to the fourth floor,

504
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,106
then you'll proceed to the surgery wing.

505
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,484
Jane and Rob will explore
the children's ward on the second floor.

506
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,945
The story behind that
is about the killer nurse.

507
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,031
- Right.
- Okay.

508
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,408
<i>Jane, you did your research, right?</i>

509
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,577
Let's set up here.

510
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,537
- Right here?
- Yeah.

511
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,830
All right.

512
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,167
Raf and Alexa,
you guys will be going to the OR.

513
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,961
<i>Raf, I really need you</i>
<i>to feel out the place, okay?</i>

514
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,963
<i>I need your third-eye sightings on this.</i>

515
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,008
No holding back, everyone, okay?

516
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,384
Everybody, 100%.

517
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,427
Got it?

518
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,806
<i>We'll proceed to the surgery wing</i>
<i>of the Xinglin Hospital.</i>

519
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,561
And it already feels strange.

520
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,188
Like…

521
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,065
Something's off.

522
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,444
My chest is pounding.

523
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,404
You? How are you?

524
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,656
Yeah, guys.

525
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,492
It's so scary here. Gosh.

526
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,912
Alexa, Raf, it's your moment.

527
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>Go.</i>

528
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,835
<i>Thank you so much, guys,</i>

529
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,463
<i>for the 3,000 plus new followers!</i>

530
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,383
<i>It's only been a few hours,</i>
<i>but you guys are showering us</i>

531
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,759
<i>so much with support!</i>

532
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,387
<i>And now</i>

533
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,515
<i>we're about to enter the operating room</i>

534
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,267
<i>of Xinglin Hospital which is said to be</i>

535
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,897
teeming with paranormal occurrences.

536
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,024
Exciting, right?

537
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,527
- And scary.
- Super.

538
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,490
They say, this OR used to be a place
where they do rituals and traditions.

539
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,452
Or, according to urban legend,

540
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,079
cult activities.

541
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,833
Let's find out together.

542
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,085
So keep on watching and sharing, guys.

543
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,171
Don't stop and keep the hype going.

544
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,757
Let's discover the mysteries here on…

545
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,218
<i>- Strange Frequencies.</i>
<i>- Strange Frequencies.</i>

546
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,136
<i>Nice one.</i>

547
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,512
<i>Just keep exploring guys.</i>

548
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,430
Perfect.

549
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,223
I'm switching now to Jane and Rob.

550
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,934
<i>Going live in five seconds.</i>

551
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,519
All right, Quen, we're ready.

552
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,980
<i>In four, three, two,</i>

553
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:53,857
<i>one.</i>

554
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,945
So we're here outside
the children's ward of Xinglin Hospital

555
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,531
where paranormal reports have surfaced.

556
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,366
Before this hospital closed down,

557
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,244
this ward became a place
of unspeakable tragedy.

558
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,663
Many babies were killed,

559
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,458
and all under suspicious circumstances.

560
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,753
People became angry and scared
of Xinglin Hospital.

561
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,255
But they eventually found who did it.

562
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,340
It was a resident nurse.

563
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,760
Imagine, 15 infants

564
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,553
were poisoned and killed.

565
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,637
But up until now,

566
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,348
we still don't know why she did that.

567
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,602
That's why we're here to investigate
and look for some artifacts,

568
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,772
to connect to the mysteries
happening until today.

569
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,899
So, Rob, are you ready?

570
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,734
I was born ready.

571
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,319
- Let's go.
- Quen, let's do this.

572
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,947
Shit.

573
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,533
Look, I got goosebumps.

574
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,162
Do you have the EMF?

575
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,079
Of course.

576
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,674
This is what I'm saying.

577
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
EMF is going off.

578
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,392
Holy shit.

579
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,270
See, guys,

580
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,522
it's real,

581
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,232
authentic,

582
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,900
and functional ghost meter.

583
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,610
FYI.

584
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,113
Down the hall.

585
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,867
It's a beanie.

586
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,661
Come close.

587
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,084
By the looks of it,

588
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,962
it's fairly new.

589
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,380
Yeah, I think so.

590
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,134
- Zarck.
- I wonder whose…

591
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,805
Zarck!

592
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,140
Are you okay?

593
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,141
You want water?

594
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,519
Remember, guys,

595
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,854
always hydrate.

596
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,858
Zarck!

597
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,863
This is one of the signs

598
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,240
that we are not welcome…

599
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,367
Zarck!

600
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
Zarck!

601
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,625
Oh, my God. Zarck.

602
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,585
<i>Why?</i>

603
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,628
<i>Yo, Zarck. You okay?</i>

604
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,715
<i>- Zarck.</i>
<i>- I'm okay.</i>

605
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,884
<i>MJ, just get back here.</i>

606
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,093
<i>Zarck needs a break.</i>

607
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,386
<i>Just don't cut.</i>

608
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,263
Always be rolling, okay?

609
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,353
This way.

610
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,272
Okay.

611
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:48,406
And we're now here inside
the infamous OR of Xinglin Hospital.

612
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,826
I'll show you guys
what's inside this room.

613
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,497
There you can see

614
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,583
dried blood.

615
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,003
I think they really did rituals here.

616
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,921
Look.

617
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,258
There's hair, food offerings,

618
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:13,181
candles, incense, and <i>fulu</i> talisman.

619
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,516
Right, it looks like…

620
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,855
It doesn't look like an operating room,
but more like an offertory room

621
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,733
because there are unusual items

622
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,903
you can find here at their OR.

623
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,905
But it's so cool.

624
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,784
<i>Zarck. Shit.</i>

625
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,661
<i>Shit!</i>

626
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,578
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

627
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,375
<i>MJ, where are you?</i>

628
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,543
<i>I can pick you guys up.</i>

629
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,797
I'm okay.

630
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,674
Continue the live stream.

631
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,176
Zarck, you're not okay!

632
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,596
Let me remove your rig.

633
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,015
Zarck.

634
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,352
Zarck.

635
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,399
All right, Raf, do your thing.

636
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,234
Tell the viewers what's the vibe

637
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,902
<i>and don't be afraid to sell it.</i>

638
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,320
- Okay, so…
- You know that.

639
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,407
So generally, guys,

640
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
besties,

641
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,079
the energy here is kind of heavy.

642
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,832
I can't pinpoint why,

643
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:25,378
I can't tell where
the heaviness is coming from.

644
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
And…

645
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,510
I can tell that
rituals were performed here…

646
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,345
What happened? Did we cut?

647
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,430
Alexa!

648
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,556
Hey!

649
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,183
Alexa, what are you doing?

650
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,310
- What?
- The hell are you doing?

651
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,396
Why did you take your rig off?

652
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,815
- I'm paying my respects!
- Paying respects?

653
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,108
That's not respect!

654
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,485
- You might offend someone.
- It's a prayer.

655
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,654
- Paying my respects.
- You don't know that.

656
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,074
You don't know what religion,
what cult, who used that,

657
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,492
- what god…
- Okay.

658
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,452
Relax!

659
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,494
Jeez.

660
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,626
Let's leave!

661
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,712
No, I have to check it.

662
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,547
Wait!

663
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,715
No.

664
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,508
It'll be quick. Promise.

665
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,093
Alexa, don't.

666
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,720
I don't feel good about this.

667
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,431
Come on. Just trust me.

668
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,017
- No, trust me.
- The unknown is calling me.

669
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,770
Danger is calling you, not the unknown.

670
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,104
Come on.

671
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,272
Let's go!

672
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,443
Hold on.

673
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,613
Come with me.

674
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,031
Quick.

675
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,658
- You took it off.
- It's like a secret door.

676
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,705
Okay.

677
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,041
- Are you going with me?
- Do I have a choice?

678
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,919
Something might happen to you.

679
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,046
<i>Raf, you two can't split up.</i>

680
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,256
This is what you came here for.

681
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,424
<i>Okay.</i>

682
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,967
Come on, you can do this.

683
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,052
Goodness!

684
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:56,969
<i>Just go check it.</i>

685
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,137
Let's go!

686
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,807
Go slowly, all right?

687
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,691
Guys, check this out.

688
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,779
Okay, be careful.

689
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,951
This is so cool.

690
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,077
Oh, my God.

691
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,039
Be careful.

692
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,752
- Fuck.
- I wonder what these prayers mean.

693
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,963
Or are they warnings?

694
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,589
Let's find out.

695
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,515
Okay.

696
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,516
No way.

697
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,475
Oh, my God.

698
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,230
What the… What?

699
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,940
Oh, my gosh.

700
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,529
Oh, my God, this is so cool!

701
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,364
Oh, my God!

702
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,868
Check this out.

703
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,120
Look at that, I think it's real blood.

704
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,204
Yes, yes, yes!

705
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,956
Look at that.

706
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,959
What is it?

707
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,628
Who is that?

708
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,172
What is that?

709
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,424
Shit.

710
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,925
It's a ritual!

711
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,304
- My God.
- That explains the candles!

712
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,723
- I don't feel good about this…
- The candles.

713
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,641
This…

714
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,934
The fuck is this?

715
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,354
Quen, do you see this?

716
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,566
Check out these bones. Oh, my God.

717
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,483
Hey!

718
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,902
- So cool!
- What's with you?

719
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,653
- It's real animal bone.
- Alexa!

720
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,571
Don't touch!

721
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,990
- We don't know whose those are.
- What's wrong?

722
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,117
Drop it!

723
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,702
Okay, drop it!

724
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,704
Don't just touch things.

725
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,207
Didn't Sarah say we shouldn't touch
anything here?

726
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,083
You'll believe in everything.

727
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,170
- Of course, I believe it!
- It's blood. Is it fresh?

728
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,422
- Oh, my God.
- Hey! The hell's wrong with you?

729
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,423
What?

730
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,800
That's blood, don't you see?

731
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,260
I know! So what?

732
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,720
- It's just blood!
- Stop!

733
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,597
Why touch that? It's blood!

734
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,932
<i>Use your brain!</i>

735
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,642
<i>- You're mad?</i>
<i>- Quit being stupid!</i>

736
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,018
<i>You want a hit show,</i>

737
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,978
<i>- but that's not…</i>
<i>- What did you just say?</i>

738
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,438
<i>You want a hit show, right?</i>

739
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,607
<i>You're being real stupid!</i>

740
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,192
<i>Fucking "hit show"?</i>

741
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,818
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- Are you serious?</i>

742
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,153
<i>That's what you all think?</i>

743
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,281
- That's what you want!
- If you're so scared, just leave!

744
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,199
I'll do this!

745
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,284
- I'm being conscious!
- I'll do this!

746
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,410
- Look!
- Just leave!

747
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,703
Look around!

748
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,207
You don't even know
what these offerings are for.

749
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,001
- I'll finish this alone.
- Alexa. Are you good?

750
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,588
Am I wrong for wanting to get this done?

751
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,756
Of course not.

752
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,264
Alexa!

753
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,517
Where are you?

754
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:54,897
Shit.

755
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:56,899
Fuck.

756
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,532
Oh, my God.

757
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,747
My god, Alexa!

758
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,757
<i>Look at that.</i>

759
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,094
<i>What is it?</i>

760
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,680
<i>Who is that?</i>

761
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,726
<i>Okay, guys, we're about to enter the room</i>

762
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,438
and the ceiling is damaged,

763
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,480
as you can see.

764
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,649
Are you okay?

765
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,067
Yeah, go inside.

766
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,449
There's medicine.

767
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,663
We don't know what happened here,

768
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,542
but I think it's filled with sad memories

769
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,085
of the babies.

770
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,131
Shit.

771
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,929
- You okay?
- Yeah.

772
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,474
I just broke a cabinet.

773
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:26,155
These are drawings by the children.

774
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,436
Jane!

775
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,231
Check this out.

776
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,028
Quen, dude, do you see this?

777
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,780
<i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

778
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,823
<i>Are there names?</i>

779
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,119
Yeah, dude.

780
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,830
It's "Lin Lìhuá,"

781
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,165
"Wang Měilíng,"

782
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,959
"Wu Shūzhēn."

783
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,168
<i>Rob, hold on.</i>

784
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,671
<i>Read the last one again. The name.</i>

785
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,923
"Wu Shūzhēn."

786
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,218
<i>That's the serial killer nurse.</i>

787
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,644
Wu Shūzhēn, Wu Shūzhēn,

788
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,147
if you are here right now,

789
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,482
tell us why you did what you did.

790
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,067
Show yourself!

791
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,154
<i>Nice! I like the suspense, Rob.</i>
<i>Keep it up.</i>

792
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,282
Rob, maybe that's a bad idea.

793
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,658
Nothing's going to happen.

794
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,579
Wu Shūzhēn, Wu Shūzhēn,

795
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,790
tell us why you did what you did.

796
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,376
Why did you kill all of those babies?

797
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,795
Don't be an idiot, Rob!

798
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,592
The fuck?

799
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,969
Yo. Hello, guys?

800
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,055
What's happening?

801
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,316
Fuck!

802
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,776
Oh, God!

803
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:29,987
Hello?

804
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,780
Jane.

805
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,907
Can you hear me?

806
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,036
Shit.

807
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,961
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

808
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,755
<i>Rob?</i>

809
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,673
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello? Quen?

810
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,051
Bro, do you hear me?

811
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,261
We're okay. We're safe.

812
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,096
Jane's safe, I'm safe.

813
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,474
- We're safe.
- Safe?

814
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,517
We're not safe.

815
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,810
I saw something!

816
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,354
Quen, did you see it?

817
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,396
Wow, bro.

818
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,397
Amazing!

819
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,982
You really got Jane.

820
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:07,983
You got her good.

821
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,735
Too bad, I didn't see it bro.

822
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,403
<i>Hold on, I'm checking it out.</i>

823
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,490
I'm serious. I saw something.
I saw it, I promise.

824
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,702
If I didn't see it
something would've happened.

825
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,454
What the fuck is that?

826
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,881
<i>Holy shit.</i>

827
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,174
What?

828
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,551
What did you see?

829
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,678
Bro, don't…

830
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,804
That must be Lee.

831
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,305
Please tell me it's Lee.

832
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,309
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

833
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,228
<i>Jane, Rob.</i>

834
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,521
<i>Relax, all right?</i>

835
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,481
Jane, you're fine, okay?

836
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,108
Rob's right.

837
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,819
Maybe it's just a part
of Lee's horror tour.

838
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,070
Okay?

839
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,365
Okay.

840
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,452
- Yeah?
- No.

841
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,706
- No.
- Let's just finish this, Jane.

842
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,082
I said no.

843
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,959
I told you what I saw was real.

844
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,378
Does it look like I'm kidding?

845
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,296
Jane.

846
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,172
Jane.

847
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,675
It's all part of the show.

848
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,679
Nothing bad is really gonna happen.

849
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,016
Relax.

850
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:24,768
Right, Quen?

851
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,123
Jane.

852
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,250
No, no.

853
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,016
No.

854
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,144
Jane.

855
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,854
It's okay.

856
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,198
Fuck.

857
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,009
What the fuck?

858
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,393
Alexa!

859
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,566
That bitch left me behind.

860
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,817
Alexa!

861
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,869
Alexa?

862
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,263
Quen!

863
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,182
I know everybody's freaked out, okay?

864
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,350
I am too!

865
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,393
Let's hit our target,
then end the stream.

866
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,562
We should leave. I'm leaving.

867
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,397
- No, wait. Just relax.
- I'm leaving.

868
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,398
Just wait.

869
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,025
Holy shit!

870
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,151
Holy shit!

871
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,070
You startled me!

872
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,613
What's wrong with you?

873
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,615
- There's weird shit!
- What?

874
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,825
There's weird shit! There's a ritual!

875
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,036
We're calling you,
but you're not responding!

876
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,663
Where's Alexa?

877
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,830
About Alexa…

878
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,583
I said something, then she stormed off.

879
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,960
I think she got mad.

880
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,046
Then I felt some kind of evil spirit.

881
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,257
- Just sit down. Relax.
- Is that for real?

882
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,716
- Water! Water!
- Yes, yes.

883
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,510
- Give him water!
- I got it.

884
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,053
Fucking annoying.

885
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,097
"Hit show" again?

886
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,890
You're just being a coward.

887
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,808
All of you.

888
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,394
All I want is…

889
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,814
I was just here.

890
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,191
Quen?

891
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,277
Base camp?

892
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,237
Anybody?

893
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,738
Can anyone hear me?

894
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,783
Shit. I think I'm lost.

895
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,580
What the fuck is up there?

896
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,540
Alexa, are you there?

897
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,874
Come in, over.

898
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,544
What a drama queen.

899
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,254
Where the hell are you?

900
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,964
Hello? Alexa!

901
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,259
Let's call the guard and leave.
There's weird shit here.

902
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,553
There are rituals,
weird stuff is happening,

903
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,971
and Alexa is missing.

904
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,848
Let's leave. Just keep my fee.

905
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,391
You can all split it.

906
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,434
- I'm out.
- Guys!

907
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,686
Isn't this all part of the plan?

908
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,645
What happened?

909
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,524
You were selling it real good,
but look at you now.

910
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,485
It's easy for you to say
because you don't feel anything.

911
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,322
I'm sensitive to these things, MJ.

912
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,867
And I've been in this situation before.
And believe me when I say

913
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,370
that this place is bad.
This place is strange. I can't explain…

914
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,457
Guys, relax. None of this is real…

915
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,374
Zarck!

916
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,668
What the fuck?!

917
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,340
<i>Zarck.</i>

918
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,050
<i>Bro, what the fuck, dude?</i>

919
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,763
<i>Does that look fake to you?</i>

920
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,850
- What is happening?
- The fuck, dude?

921
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,893
What the fuck?

922
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,604
Lee, call Wei.
We need to bring Zarck to a hospital!

923
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,897
- Please.
- Go!

924
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,524
- Get some water.
- Yeah, let's clean this.

925
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,609
The fuck?

926
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,944
- I have water here.
- The fuck is going on, guys?

927
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,113
I tried to tell you.

928
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,949
This is bad.

929
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,285
Our numbers are on track.

930
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,703
We'll get to three million.

931
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,791
You're still thinking about that?

932
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:21,750
Hey, guys.

933
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,794
- I can't reach Wei.
- What?

934
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:27,089
His phone must be off
or out of coverage area.

935
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,757
- The fuck, dude?
- What?

936
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,009
Call an ambulance!

937
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,427
Call someone else.

938
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,428
- Call anyone.
- No.

939
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,263
How do you use this?

940
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,556
- Stop.
- Calm down.

941
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,892
- You shut up!
- Lee, just stop!

942
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,227
- Stop it!
- No, stop!

943
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,520
- What's with you?
- Hey!

944
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,771
Stop it!

945
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,606
Guys, we don't have a permit!

946
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,817
We'll get arrested if we get caught!

947
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,568
Can everybody just please relax?

948
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,362
Relax? Look at Zarck!

949
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,698
- I know! No use panicking!
- Wait!

950
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,616
I can see Zarck! Okay?

951
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,535
- Calm down!
- Don't call anyone.

952
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,577
Calm down.

953
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,579
Alexa is still missing.

954
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,998
Something bad might've happened to her.

955
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,293
We're all locked in here,
so she's not going anywhere.

956
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,712
Okay?

957
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,671
Just relax.

958
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,674
- Rob, help me out, bro.
- Yo.

959
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,842
- Come on.
- Sure.

960
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,594
Here's the plan.

961
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,140
Raf, take MJ.
Go to the last location you saw Alexa.

962
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,684
Jane, you stay here to watch over Zarck.

963
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,103
- Okay.
- Lee, just try to contact Wei.

964
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,479
- Okay.
- Rob, you're with me.

965
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,231
- Check the upper floors.
- All right.

966
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,607
Here's a better plan.

967
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,235
We get out, we ask for help

968
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,070
so we can all look for Alexa.

969
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,280
How about that?

970
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,448
Come on, Jane.

971
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,992
I'd rather stay here
for a few more minutes

972
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,119
than go to jail in Taiwan, okay?

973
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,372
Let's just look for Alexa,
finish the job so we can all go home.

974
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,624
We're all going to die here then!

975
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,171
Guys, look.

976
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,758
We're going viral. We can't stop now.

977
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,178
See, everything's going to be fine.

978
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,179
Just relax.

979
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,891
Lee will take Zarck to the hospital
and we'll finish the stream.

980
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:01,892
All right?

981
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,728
We got this, guys.

982
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,979
Let's go.

983
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,068
<i>Nice.</i>

984
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,737
<i>Always be rolling.</i>

985
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,947
<i>Always be rolling.</i>

986
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,034
Gosh! I got this.

987
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,535
I don't need anybody.

988
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,536
Let's do this.

989
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,708
What is this place?

990
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,505
Alexa?

991
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,549
Quen?

992
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,885
Fuck, thank God.

993
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,429
Quen, is that you?

994
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,981
Alexa.

995
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,568
Quen?

996
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,696
Shit.

997
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,535
Are you here?

998
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,419
Quen, is that you?

999
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,468
You're okay.

1000
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,638
There's no one here. Okay.

1001
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,139
No, maybe here.

1002
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,025
Oh, my God.

1003
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,862
Oh, my God.

1004
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,949
Shit, shit, shit.

1005
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,661
Fuck.

1006
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,042
Alexa!

1007
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,300
Okay.

1008
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,553
Alexa!

1009
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,182
Fuck.

1010
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,507
Alexa.

1011
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,659
Alexa.

1012
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,335
Alexa!

1013
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,345
Alexa!

1014
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,727
Alexa!

1015
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:34,854
Yoo-hoo!

1016
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,108
Fuck.

1017
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,698
- Yo, Bro.
- What?

1018
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,743
I know I promised not to break character.

1019
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,661
And?

1020
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,456
But I think we should tone it down
a bit with the scares.

1021
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,499
We're overdoing it.

1022
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,918
I mean, everybody's already freaking out.

1023
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:57,836
Bro.

1024
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,840
How many times do I have to tell you,
this isn't a setup. Okay?

1025
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,509
Whatever's happening here
is fucking real, all right?

1026
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,262
Whatever Jane caught
on her camera is fucking real.

1027
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,014
You don't have to hide it from us!

1028
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,018
I saw you plant the doll, man.

1029
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:16,771
I think even Lee's part of it,
helping you make those sounds and noises!

1030
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,064
Bro, you know what?

1031
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,191
Bro, I'm done with this, fuck it.

1032
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,153
If you don't want to
believe me, fine. Don't.

1033
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,030
Believe what you wanna believe.

1034
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,450
But put your fucking comms back on
and help me look for Alexa.

1035
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,576
Fine.

1036
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,577
For Alexa.

1037
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,287
Fucking hell.

1038
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,663
Shit.

1039
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,876
You know what, let's just split up. Okay?

1040
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,793
All right.

1041
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,587
Please.

1042
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,672
Fuck.

1043
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,590
And, Rob.

1044
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,258
- What?
- For the love of God,

1045
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,261
don't touch anything, all right?

1046
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,263
All right, don't touch anything.

1047
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,809
I swear to God.

1048
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,896
Shit!

1049
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,567
Zarck!

1050
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,111
Oh, shit.

1051
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,786
Hello?

1052
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,703
Rob?

1053
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,371
Quen?

1054
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,498
Alexa?

1055
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:18,958
Hello, MJ?

1056
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,044
Oh, my God, fuck.

1057
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,128
Nobody's responding.

1058
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,343
Zarck. Hang on, okay?

1059
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,976
Guys, we need help!

1060
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,292
Zarck.

1061
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,711
I'll look for a way out, okay?

1062
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,556
Help!

1063
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,808
Wei!

1064
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,217
Help!

1065
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,677
Help us!

1066
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,708
<i>Is it working? Okay.</i>

1067
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,505
- …kidding. I thought I heard something.
- Babe. Okay, let's go--

1068
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,924
Ethan!

1069
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,675
You're such a jerk!

1070
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,677
You see that?

1071
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,180
Yeah, it's so cool.

1072
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:38,681
Is it cool?

1073
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,517
I think it's scary, dude.

1074
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,352
Holy shit. It's that thing again.

1075
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,436
That mural's back.

1076
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,063
It's the thing again.

1077
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:46,981
Babe.

1078
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,693
Something doesn't feel right. Ethan!

1079
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,570
- It's all right, babe.
- Ethan!

1080
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,739
Ethan, come back. Please.

1081
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:58,117
Ethan, don't go.

1082
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,912
- I'll be back.
- Don't, babe. Babe!

1083
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:01,829
Shit!

1084
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
Ethan?

1085
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,470
There's something in here

1086
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,889
that looks

1087
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,892
like Ethan.

1088
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,406
<i>Someone help me!</i>

1089
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,036
- MJ.
- What?

1090
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,915
I don't feel good
about the tarot reading with Jane.

1091
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,502
Raf, no offense.

1092
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,795
But I'm not a believer.

1093
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,006
No, I swear!

1094
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:57,093
I think something is going on.

1095
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,803
And now, Alexa's missing.

1096
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,139
Raf, let's be practical here.

1097
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,766
Alexa could just be
pretending to disappear.

1098
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,726
My God!

1099
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,977
- You know.
- Seriously?

1100
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,563
She wants all the attention, right?

1101
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,608
Those tactics? I know them all.

1102
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,359
We have awakened something.

1103
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,612
This is not just a show anymore, MJ.

1104
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,071
In any case,

1105
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,074
can it be just more searching
and less talking?

1106
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,409
Go search!

1107
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:29,917
Alexa?

1108
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,923
Hey, Alexa!

1109
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,312
Alexa!

1110
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,526
Hey.

1111
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,156
Where are you? We're packing up!

1112
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,620
Alexa?

1113
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,047
My gosh.

1114
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,095
Shit.

1115
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,638
Alexa!

1116
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,567
Hey.

1117
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,206
Alexa?

1118
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,424
Alexa!

1119
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,805
Alexa!

1120
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,606
My gosh.

1121
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,421
So fun.

1122
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,183
Alexa?

1123
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,039
Alexa.

1124
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:26,761
The fuck?

1125
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:34,936
Rob?

1126
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,188
I swear to God, bro.

1127
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,871
The fuck?

1128
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,171
The fuck? Fuck.

1129
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,807
Base camp?

1130
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,109
No.

1131
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,450
Raf.

1132
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,261
Raf.

1133
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,351
Alexa?

1134
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,607
Alexa?

1135
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:30,194
Where the fuck are you, dude?

1136
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,618
Alexa?

1137
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,830
Come on, bro!

1138
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,422
Alexa, where are you?

1139
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,384
Alexa!

1140
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,016
Ghosts, come out.

1141
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,934
We're not afraid of you.

1142
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,401
Don't fuck with me!

1143
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,238
I'm not afraid!

1144
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,282
Tell us why you did what you did.

1145
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,743
- Fuck!
- Tell us why you did what you did.

1146
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,371
Tell us why you did what you did.

1147
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,316
Rob?

1148
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,529
<i>Fuck!</i>

1149
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,990
Rob?

1150
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,335
Rob.

1151
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:23,557
Rob?

1152
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,102
Shit.

1153
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:33,859
A BOUNTIFUL SPRING
IN THE REALM OF HEALING.

1154
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,281
Rob.

1155
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,166
Rob.

1156
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,759
That's enough, please.

1157
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,309
Rob, drop it.

1158
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,186
Rob.

1159
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,634
Quen?

1160
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,802
Do you hear me?

1161
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,056
Quen?

1162
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,766
Anybody?

1163
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,977
Where am I?

1164
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,746
Rob.

1165
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,549
Rob?

1166
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:29,350
Jane.

1167
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,817
Rob, come on.

1168
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:42,821
Rob!

1169
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,993
Rob, I don't have time for this.

1170
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,468
Jane.

1171
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:12,643
Rob?

1172
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,025
Rob, I'm scared.

1173
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,821
Rob, I'm scared.

1174
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:02,985
No!

1175
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:06,697
No!

1176
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,532
- Stay away! Back off!
- Alexa?

1177
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:10,034
Dude, what the fuck?

1178
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,660
It's me! What the fuck?

1179
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,662
Alexa, it's me. All right?

1180
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,956
What the fuck? What the fuck happened?

1181
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,418
We've been looking for you.

1182
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,463
What happened? Are you okay?

1183
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:23,380
Are you okay?

1184
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,050
- You have to see this.
- Fuck.

1185
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,053
Zarck!

1186
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,221
Zarck, let's go!

1187
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,474
Zarck. Zarck!

1188
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,893
Let's leave!

1189
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:36,810
Zarck!

1190
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,382
Jane. Jane!

1191
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,687
Rob.

1192
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,022
Rob!

1193
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,254
Rob?

1194
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,548
Rob.

1195
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:53,720
I'm so sorry.

1196
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,723
I saw something also,

1197
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,183
up in the owner's apartment.

1198
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,353
Alexa, we shouldn't have come here.

1199
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,773
Let's go get the team,
let's get the hell out of here.

1200
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,024
Let's go, come on.

1201
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,235
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

1202
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,778
- Let's go. Come on.
- Wait.

1203
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,409
Let's go. We've got to go.
We've got to fucking get out of here.

1204
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,162
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

1205
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:20,873
<i>Hello?</i>

1206
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,458
<i>Base camp, anybody?</i>

1207
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:26,086
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>
<i>We're getting out of this fucking place!</i>

1208
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,004
Quen?

1209
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,797
<i>Hello, Jane?</i>

1210
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,424
We're on our way back.

1211
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,009
I got Alexa.

1212
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,219
Tell everyone we're getting out of here.

1213
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,512
<i>Everyone?</i>

1214
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:36,430
Quen.

1215
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,064
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1216
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,232
Where are you?

1217
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,276
They're all dead.

1218
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,322
<i>Raf, Rob, and Zarck.</i>

1219
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:54,531
What?

1220
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,949
<i>They're all dead.</i>

1221
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,368
Can we stop, please?

1222
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,539
Tell me where you are. We'll come to you.

1223
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,698
Do you think I'm safe?

1224
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:44,039
Do you think I'm safe?

1225
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,463
Do you think I'm safe?

1226
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,191
Here.

1227
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,187
No!

1228
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,397
Quen!

1229
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:38,945
Quen!

1230
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:42,783
Jane?

1231
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,703
Quen!

1232
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,415
Quen!

1233
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:56,963
Help!

1234
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:32,874
Jane!

1235
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:33,917
Jane!

1236
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,836
- Jane!
- Jane!

1237
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,338
- Jane!
- Jane, where are you?!

1238
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:40,716
- Jane!
- Jane!

1239
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:44,803
Jane!

1240
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,806
Jane!

1241
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,228
Let her go!

1242
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:54,771
Jane!

1243
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,359
Jane!

1244
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,944
Stop it!

1245
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,408
Jane.

1246
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,624
Jane, I'm sorry.

1247
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:19,963
I tried. I'm so sorry.

1248
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,011
Alexa, what do we do?

1249
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,972
Alexa, what do we do?

1250
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,557
What the fuck?

1251
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,933
Quen, we're gonna die.

1252
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,692
Fuck!

1253
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,278
Shit.

1254
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,533
- No.
- Alexa.

1255
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,787
No.

1256
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,956
- Alexa, we have to go.
- No.

1257
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,917
- Alexa, we have to go.
- No.

1258
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,210
Look at me.

1259
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,377
Look at me!

1260
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,754
We're leaving.

1261
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:02,547
Okay?

1262
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,508
Come on, let's go.

1263
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:06,343
Come on!

1264
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,011
Fuck!

1265
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:10,430
Oh, shit!

1266
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:30,951
Shit.

1267
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:36,248
Zarck!

1268
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,334
- He's dead.
- Zarck.

1269
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,711
- No!
- The fuck?

1270
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,213
Quen!

1271
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:44,840
- Quen, let's go!
- No!

1272
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,384
- Quen!
- No, no, no!

1273
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:48,426
No!

1274
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,719
- Quen!
- What the fuck?

1275
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:51,805
Quen! Let's go!

1276
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,807
Let's go!

1277
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,935
Lee!

1278
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,019
Help!

1279
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,146
Lee!

1280
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:01,940
Let us out!

1281
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,066
Hey!

1282
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,368
Lee!

1283
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,078
Help! Where are you?!

1284
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:18,790
Quen!

1285
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,059
To the rooftop.

1286
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:40,937
Quen!

1287
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:45,108
MJ.

1288
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,069
Alexa!

1289
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,154
MJ!

1290
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,364
Quen, no!

1291
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,824
- Quen.
- What?

1292
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:54,659
No.

1293
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,203
- What?
- No.

1294
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,288
It's not her.

1295
01:21:58,371 --> 01:21:59,915
But what if it's MJ?

1296
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,876
- What if it's not?
- We can't let her end up like Jane.

1297
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:06,713
But what if it's really not her?
What if you get killed?

1298
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:09,341
We can't just leave her. Okay?

1299
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:13,094
We have to check.

1300
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:27,108
Quen!

1301
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,487
- The fuck?
- Alexa!

1302
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:32,822
MJ.

1303
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:36,451
- No.
- What? Wait.

1304
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,372
Please listen to me.

1305
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,018
- MJ?
- MJ?

1306
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:04,980
MJ?

1307
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,356
MJ.

1308
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:07,816
- Are you--
- Alexa!

1309
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,569
Help!

1310
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:16,533
What the fuck?!

1311
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,173
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1312
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,844
Fuck.

1313
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:42,767
What the fuck?

1314
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:50,859
Fuck.

1315
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:53,028
Shit, shit, shit.

1316
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,572
Alexa!

1317
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,242
Alexa!

1318
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,036
Alexa!

1319
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,042
Alexa!

1321
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:15,675
No!

1322

No, stop it!

1323
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,304
No!

1325
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,148

01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,357
No!

1327
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:32,400
Stop it!

1328
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,610
<i>Good job, everyone.</i>

1329
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:34,611
No!

1332
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:51,336

1334
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:58,676
Yeah.

1335
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,679
This is what I fucking wanted.

1336
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:16,778
Always be rolling, right?

1337
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,367
Fuck you!

1338
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,025

- Quen, this is my last question for you.
- Yeah.

1348
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,613
Does this mean that you're quitting
doing movies for good?

1349
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:45,074
Of course, not.

1350
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,620
If the script is good and something
I've never done before,

1351

I'm always up for it.

where I die in the end, so…
