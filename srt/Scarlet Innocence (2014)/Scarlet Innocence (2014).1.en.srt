<i>These scentless petals covering</i>

7
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,801
<i>the road endlessly make me forget</i>

8
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,677
<i>why I decided to come here.</i>

9
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,955
<i>When a ridiculous misunderstanding
forced me to leave the school</i>

10
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,660
<i>I just wanted to hide</i>

11
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,267
<i>where nobody could find me.</i>

12
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:46,507
<i>I hoped to find something pure
that is vanishing from me,</i>

13
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,207
<i>to prove myself writing a novel
with a new story I find there.</i>

14
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,062
<i>But my strong intention faded
away as soon as I arrived.</i>

15
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,066
<i>The old and weary mood this town held</i>

16
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,070
<i>almost choked me.</i>

17
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,407
<i>What is this kid?</i>

18
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,812
<i>Never seen a man in a suit?</i>

19
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:33,247
<i>She stared me with the inquisitive eyes.</i>

20
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,209
<i>That's how I met her.</i>

21
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:51,450
<i>DIRECTED BY
YIM PIL-SUNG</i>

22
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,744
He's too young to be a professor.

23
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,915
Guess he had a drink.
Look at his ruddy cheeks.

24
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,908
You know the writer...

25
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,880
needs a drink to talk
or write on something.

26
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,159
<i>INTRODUCTION TO WRITING A NOVEL</i>

27
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,562
- You want to write novels?
- Yes.

28
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,299
You think anyone can write one?

29
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,271
That's why we're here to learn.

30
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,613
There's an expression
called literary youth.

31
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,705
But no such thing like literary old.

32
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,043
Do you know why?

33
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,320
You are telling we old folks
don't deserve writing?

34
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,917
Yes, the old can't write.

35
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,917
They can only keep a diary.

36
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,956
The old man with an old mind
only can write corny things.

37
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:59,362
Only the one with an open
mind can do the literature.

38
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,870
So if you want to write novels,

39
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,573
you need to be young at heart again.

40
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,670
You need to love!

41
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,908
At our age? How?

42
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,306
But it sounds good!

43
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,226
- Hello.
- You're coming home now?

44
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,058
- Tofu and zucchini, please.
- Sure.

45
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,857
Mom!

46
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,337
Just now. What do you want to get?

47
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,536
Tofu and zucchini?

48
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,438
I got them already. Let's go.

49
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,074
Will make you delicious bean paste stew.

50
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,785
You raised Deokee well.
So pretty and filial.

51
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,391
You must be proud!

52
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,422
- Good night.
- Good night.

53
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,630
Mom, store owner told me

54
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,599
this town will be redeveloped.

55
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,142
So are we getting lots of compensation?

56
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,110
Well... guess it would some.

57
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,718
Much enough to move to Seoul?
What do you think?

58
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:28,258
I hope the money is big
enough for your wedding.

59
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,682
My wedding? No kidding!

60
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:35,826
You should get married
when you meet a decent guy.

61
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,104
If there is a decent guy,
I need to date him first.

62
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,233
But problem is we can't
find a decent man here.

63
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,803
The store owner will set
you up on a blind date.

64
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,977
A guy working at a car company.

65
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,719
A car company?

66
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,710
Boring!

67
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,782
You don't get married for fun!

68
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,087
Are you worried about me?

69
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,665
Don't worry.

70
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,664
I won't live like this forever.

71
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,339
I believe in you.

72
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,688
The machine is too old.

73
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,715
It needs some bashing once in a while.

74
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,624
What do you want to ride?

75
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,990
Pardon?

76
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,566
The rides in this park. Which one?

77
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,433
I didn't come for that.

78
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,436
Are you working here?

79
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,340
Right there.

80
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,315
At the ticket office, I see.

81
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,784
I've never seen a small
amusement park like this.

82
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,956
They'll tear it down next year
and will build a public park.

83
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,865
Nobody came to ride in full dress like you.

84
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,301
I'm not here for the ride,

85
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,297
but for the work. At the
lifelong education center.

86
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,974
No one's dressed up there, either.

87
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,399
I remember!

88
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,342
You were in front of the store yesterday.

89
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,147
So are you a professor?

90
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,108
Yes.

91
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,950
- Literature writing class.
- Wow.

92
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,753
Thought that class would
be really interesting.

93
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:08,044
She didn't get along with anyone,
and responded to no one.

94
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,816
She simply existed there still and sound.

95
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,889
As if she couldn't see

96
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,398
or hear anything.

97
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,163
She was cowering like a caterpillar

98
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:35,136
waiting for the spring with
every fiber of her body.

99
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,606
The time she would transform
into a beautiful being.

100
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,790
As you are here, you should have a drink.

101
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,847
Need to leave soon.

102
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,261
Of course, you must be busy writing.

103
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:57,301
But a drink could smooth your writing.

104
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,460
- Just one glass!
- Then just one.

105
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,997
There you go.

106
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,972
Handsome ones look cool
even drinking monkey swill.

107
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,379
- I'll pour you one.
- Thank you, professor.

108
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,222
It's good!

109
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,796
Deokee, I know you had a
blind date yesterday.

110
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,929
- What?
- She did? With whom?

111
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,638
The second son at the photo studio.

112
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,535
He works at the motor factory.

113
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,270
So you'll get married soon!

114
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,073
No.

115
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,771
Why not? That kid is okay.

116
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,247
- Yes, he is.
- Right.

117
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:50,648
- How many babies?
- You're so silly.

118
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:55,219
She needs to square it with parents first.

119
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,285
I'll get going.-

120
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,285
- Why so early?
- We want to hear more.

121
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,765
It wasn't fun at all.

122
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,796
Tell us later!
Promise!

123
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,203
Where's your house?

124
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,694
Mine?

125
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:48,771
The fifth house under the stairways.

126
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,780
Mine is here.

127
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,580
Guess you need to walk back.

128
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,212
Yes...

129
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,491
Good night.

130
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,995
Hello, professor.

131
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,728
- Kimchi stew and soju as usual?
- Yes.

132
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,662
<i>Are you writing something?</i>

133
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,157
<i>I'm so bored here, same old shits.</i>

134
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,466
So what did the dean say?

135
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,470
<i>He doesn't want to meet you.</i>

136
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,632
Why?

137
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,310
<i>He's being cautious as
it's a sensitive issue.</i>

138
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,675
<i>Be patient. I'll try to persuade him.</i>

139
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,421
<i>We're collecting evidences to prove
that you're falsely accused.</i>

140
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,016
<i>Try to take it easy there.</i>

141
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,856
<i>It'll take some time as
she's so persistent.</i>

142
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,629
<i>You must feel depressed
in that backcountry.</i>

143
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,832
<i>Find some hobby to spend time.</i>

144
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,098
<i>Hang in there.</i>

145
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,766
This place closes early.

146
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,912
Yes, at 6 PM.

147
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,878
Where are you going once it's demolished?

148
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,546
Wherever.

149
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,980
I'll be happy just escaping
from this boring town.

150
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,919
Then you should try something not boring.

151
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,626
Like what?

152
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,062
Not the right one to ask.
I'm a boring person.

153
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,668
You must be lonely not boring.

154
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,330
Do I look lonely?

155
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,043
I can tell as I see many people
coming here alone for a ride.

156
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,677
The angry ones scream
riding on the pirate ship

157
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,450
while lonely ones ride a merry-go-round.

158
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,376
And the ones to be lost to the world

159
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,788
get on the Ferris wheel.

160
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,922
Then I should try all!

161
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,462
Can I have a look at the bottle?

162
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,246
It's... bitter!

163
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,753
Guess you can't drink.

164
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,657
Yes, I can.

165
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,544
What brought you here, anyway?

166
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,240
They say I did something wrong.

167
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:25,850
I did nothing but I became the guilty one.

168
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:33,862
I'll go buy things. Tend
the shop for me, Deokee.

169
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,628
The bad things blindly
hit you like the lightening.

170
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:46,102
My mother says we have to
take a shelter for a while

171
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,678
until it clears up.

172
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,440
Not the case for where I came from.

173
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:59,286
It's a swamp boiling with the jealousy.

174
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,355
If I waited like that,
I'd be bogged down deep.

175
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,727
But thank you, Deokee.

176
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:17,839
For listening to me
and believing what I said.

177
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,434
Nobody did.

178
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,443
It's my pleasure. I enjoy listening to you.

179
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,150
When are you coming home?

180
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,589
Can you come tonight?

181
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,898
Daddy will be coming.

182
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,333
Do you have to go to Seoul?

183
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,476
You'd better get going, too.

184
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,613
Yes.

185
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,658
I might be in a trouble as
my wife hates me drinking.

186
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,334
Then go tomorrow when you sober up.

187
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,235
I'm leaving.

188
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,101
So hot.

189
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,244
It's so hot in here.

190
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,146
Or is it me because of drinking?

191
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,418
You're warm.

192
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,714
Mom, tie my hair.

193
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,982
Your dad is with a girl again.

194
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,430
See he's not coming.

195
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,661
He said he's coming today.

196
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:13,172
Like father, like daughter.
You little liar.

197
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,589
See you later, professor.

198
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,456
Hello, sir.

199
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,260
Hello.

200
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,070
He's working too hard.

201
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:49,636
He must be bored to sit still.

202
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,847
I imagined it would be
quite scary at night here.

203
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,783
Are you scared?

204
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,249
Not at all. Because I'm with you.

205
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,517
This is the switch.

206
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,480
Are you sure about this?

207
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,916
Let's stay this way for a while.

208
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,818
Why?

209
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,321
Just to remember this moment.

210
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,695
It's my first date with a man I love.

211
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:16,482
She comes in and out of
his house all the time.

212
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:21,587
The guard at the park
told me he even saw them

213
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,152
doing this! Shameless.

214
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:32,261
We went wild and shameless
at our early days, too.

215
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:39,198
As the old saying goes
it's always the quiet one.

216
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,707
Oh my, she must've heard us!

217
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,042
It's a nonsense. She's deaf anyway!

218
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,340
- Deaf she is but gets what we say.
- It's okay.

219
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,481
Don't know what to do. Oh my god.

220
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,358
She must be really worried.

221
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,204
What do you think?

222
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,719
Do you like it?

223
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,058
So pretty...

224
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,745
Professor, when did you buy these?

225
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,186
Try a walk?

226
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,692
Professor!

227
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,476
You like it?

228
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,774
I like whatever you like.

229
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,007
I'll never let you go.

230
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,388
Never. Hear me?

231
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,969
I like this phrase.

232
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,407
Rustling sunlight falls like the fireworks

233
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,242
glowing her hair all over.

234
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,811
It tickles!

235
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,670
I've never tasted coffee like this!

236
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,072
So good!

237
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,584
<i>ARRIVING IN 10 MINS
- DONG-WOO</i>

238
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,023
What's up? Why didn't you call me ahead?

239
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,791
<i>I wanted to deliver the good news myself.</i>

240
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,901
Good news? I'll meet you at the terminal.

241
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,066
My friend's coming. Need to go out.

242
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,810
Bring him home. I'll prepare the dinner.

243
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,507
Don't worry about it. He might leave soon.

244
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,984
Thank you! How did you find that?

245
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:06,025
A student came with the thing
she shot with her mobile.

246
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:11,104
It had that bitch coming on to you.
All drunk!

247
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,362
And she accused you of
sexual harassment? Bullshit!

248
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,835
Thank you anyway.

249
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,844
You'll be teaching from next semester

250
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,240
as the disciplinary period is over.

251
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,110
It must've been difficult for you.
I trusted you no matter what!

252
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,648
- You're a true friend.
- Where's your place?

253
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,079
Let me see how you live
and have lunch together.

254
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,381
No need as I'm leaving soon.
Let me take you to the best in town.

255
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,419
We need to drink! It's been a while.

256
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,519
It sounds good.

257
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,969
<i>I'LL BE LATE. GO HOME BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</i>

258
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,881
<i>LET'S TALK A LOT MORE TMR.
- PROFESSOR</i>

259
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,948
What was the good news?

260
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,545
I'm reinstated, Deokee.

261
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,583
Congratulations.

262
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,061
Where did I put my writing...

263
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,862
Here it is!

264
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:55,209
Deokee, can you check the
bus timetable for Seoul?

265
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,281
It's time for lunch.
I'd like to have dumplings.

266
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,613
I'll eat something on my way.

267
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,921
I'm pregnant.

268
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:49,424
<i>OBSTETRICS</i>

269
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,607
Sorry, Deokee. For putting
you in this trouble.

270
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,843
Will call you when I'm settled.

271
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,368
<i>15 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM</i>

272
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,421
Deokee!

273
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:24,816
Deokee, wake up.

274
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,523
Let's go home.

275
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,151
Have you eaten?

276
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,397
Like you care.

277
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,893
The medicine?

278
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,031
Excited to be back?

279
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:10,998
Well... you know.

280
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,406
Must be excited to flirt with
all those pretty college girls!

281
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,249
You haven't slept again?
Take the medicine first.

282
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,136
And time for bed.

283
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:55,107
I know that you're a good person

284
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,753
and I must not act like this.

285
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,481
I'm...

286
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,626
happy to have you back, too.

287
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:11,694
I'll...

288
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,070
try to get better.

289
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,329
Stop! That's enough!

290
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,105
Stop!

291
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:12,115
- Please give some hints on the exam!
- Please go easy on us!

292
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,220
Professor!

293
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,493
Told you I'll be coming soon.

294
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,430
You've been telling that
four times already.

295
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,005
Let's meet outside later.

296
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,307
Why didn't you tell your wife about us?

297
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:39,517
Go home and wait for me.
I'll meet you there.

298
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,289
No, you won't.

299
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,619
I promise I will.

300
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,295
You promise?

301
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,600
What are you doing?

302
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,001
What brings you here?

303
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,573
Congratulations on the new project!

304
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,655
The dean is so happy, he's
bragging about you all over.

305
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,924
By the way, who was that girl?

306
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:19,950
You saw her?

307
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,359
- Remember you just came back.
- I know what I am doing.

308
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,455
- If they catch you this time...
- I would like to ask you...

309
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,572
to knock before you come in.

310
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,309
I knew you'd be coming.

311
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,578
Deokee.

312
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:20,717
Yes?

313
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,055
What is this?

314
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,360
Don't wait for me.

315
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:44,538
Why can't I?

316
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,806
Just don't.

317
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,979
You're afraid the school will find out

318
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,813
about an affair and the abortion?

319
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,350
Calm down and be quiet.

320
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,053
I did everything you told me to.

321
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,431
Keep waiting.

322
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,436
And now you want me to shut up?

323
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,367
Why should I?

324
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,806
If you can't, I can do it for you.

325
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,439
Talk to the school

326
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,408
and to your wife.

327
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,284
- Who knows if I already did?
- Listen.

328
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,145
Let's end it here.

329
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,383
Don't wanna hurt you anymore.

330
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,323
I cannot be the one you want.
You know that.

331
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,093
Professor.

332
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,463
I love you.

333
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,866
I love you so much.

334
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:44,093
Kiss me please.

335
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,471
Please stop.

336
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:46,598
Don't!

337
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,291
What's with you, Chungee?

338
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:15,796
What?

339
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:21,601
Stop crying and stay still.
I'll be right there.

340
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:24,543
Mom! Mom!

341
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,109
Deokee, come back!

342
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,779
It's dangerous!

343
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,107
Deokee!

344
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,524
Deokee!

345
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:49,767
<i>It's 911 .</i>

346
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,802
<i>Hello?</i>

347
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,972
Mom! Mom!

348
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,260
What shall we do? Poor Deokee!

349
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,563
Somebody help here!

350
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,060
Please help here!

351
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,439
- Are there people inside?
- Yes! Please hurry!

352
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,161
Dad...

353
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,498
Mom's still inside the room?

354
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,417
Ma...

355
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:35,809
<i>On that day, the big wave</i>

356
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,708
<i>completely swept away our lives.</i>

357
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,469
So the text can contain several meanings...

358
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,266
which can be changed
upon the interpretation.

359
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,540
For example, the characters of Chun-hyang

360
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,370
in Pansori 'Chun-hyang',

361
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,837
in 'Flower in the Jail',
the modern novel version,

362
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,377
and in the film version, 'Chunhyang'.

363
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,953
Are different from one to another.

364
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:28,529
<i>The last piece of purity inside me
was burn to ashes with them.</i>

365
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,299
- So the text can contain...
- You said it already.

366
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:42,800
<i>After that day, everything
seem blurred to me.</i>

367
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:48,444
<i>8 YEARS LATER</i>

368
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,981
Do you expect this one
to be another bestseller?

369
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,487
<i>But ironically my books became
the bestsellers one after another.</i>

370
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:05,694
<i>And I lived life hard and wild
to escape from the past.</i>

371
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,682
Damn it.

372
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,529
Professor!

373
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,767
Professor!

374
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,373
Who are you going with
to the conference in Tokyo?

375
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,079
Why do you care?

376
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,013
Can I come along?

377
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,246
Wanna date with you in Shibuya.

378
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:41,884
It would be romantic.

379
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:45,119
Do we need to go to Shibuya to be romantic?

380
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:48,623
What about your thesis and TV show?

381
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,392
You don't have to worry about it.

382
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:58,264
Told you that our love can only
be completed in the closed room.

383
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,307
You want people to gossip
when they see us together?

384
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:06,208
Embarrassed to be seen with me?

385
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,543
Think of this place as outside.

386
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,110
It's a nonsense! Since I met you...

387
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:17,923
It's outside. Outside
of your house and mine.

388
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,588
Just change your way of thinking.
Not that difficult.

389
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:03,134
<i>For the youth, dream can be the love...</i>

390
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,228
<i>that sweeps you away.</i>

391
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,432
I'm going out.

392
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,105
Going where?

393
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,786
To see a sis next door.

394
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,725
What did you do to your lips?

395
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,887
<i>My only concern was my daughter, Chungee.</i>

396
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,091
<i>We should search for a job
as we do for pure first love.</i>

397
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,867
<i>Well, I guess so.</i>

398
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,408
<i>Then the fearsome price of my lust</i>

399
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,235
<i>knocked at the door.</i>

400
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:50,975
It is blurry in the center and
everything goes out of focus.

401
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,618
You've got retinal macular degeneration.

402
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,383
What's that?

403
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,989
A problem at macular inside your retina

404
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,159
causes the failing vision.

405
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,630
You have diabetes.

406
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,761
But you keep drinking and smoking

407
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,406
as well as writing which
stresses the sight.

408
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,978
I think you've developed the complication.

409
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,741
But I can get better with
some treatment, can't I?

410
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:27,115
I'm afraid there's no perfect cure yet.

411
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,393
You're telling me

412
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,223
I could lose my eyesight completely?

413
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,027
In the worst case scenario, yes.

414
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,462
But we can at least delay the progress.

415
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,263
Be sure to take diabetes medicine.

416
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,762
And no excessive exercise.

417
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,504
Also absolutely no alcohol and cigarettes!

418
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,540
How about sex?

419
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,409
Pardon?

420
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:05,323
I heard you visit the luxurious
villa in Gangnam regularly.

421
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,319
Pardon?

422
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,531
The rumor says
it's an illegal gambling place.

423
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:22,640
I heard some public figures were
involved in Group K's slush fund.

424
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,040
I know you went to college with
Lee, the CEO of Group K.

425
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:32,585
We won't make a fuss as it can
ruin school's reputation.

426
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:33,776
Mr. Dean.

427
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,316
I feel bad doing this as you're
the face of our faculty.

428
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:40,656
You'll get the leave allowance right away.

429
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,058
All gone?

430
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:45,321
I can't believe how this
bastard could be CEO

431
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:48,428
being so clumsy handling the work.

432
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:54,296
You know how much I bet for that?

433
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,675
My new car is gone too!

434
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,714
- At least you have a bestselling book...
- Shut up!

435
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:04,052
I put all my 3 year advance
and down payment!

436
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,613
<i>Chungee always strayed and
didn't care about me at all.</i>

437
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,824
<i>She seemed to desperately</i>

438
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,392
<i>search for someone to rely on
even for a short moment.</i>

439
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,172
<i>SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT</i>

440
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,332
<i>PROVISIONAL ATTACHMENT ON IMMOVABLES</i>

441
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,085
Notice of seizure? What is it?

442
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,518
Nothing. Mind your own business.

443
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,509
- You're living next door?
- Yes.

444
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,822
I guess Chungee's not home.

445
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,191
Brought some pancakes for her.

446
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,692
She's at school now.

447
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,896
You don't like the pancakes?

448
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,744
You must be Professor Shim.

449
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:16,573
I've heard from Chungee

450
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,878
that your visions are failing lately.

451
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,718
Guess you're close to my daughter.

452
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,923
Yes, we got along very easily.

453
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,799
Rustling sunlight falls like the fireworks

454
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,694
glowing her hair all over.

455
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,235
I like this novel.

456
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:41,937
You do?

457
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,505
Professor, treat me as a fan of your work.

458
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:53,218
You can be at ease with me.

459
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,120
My name is Se-Jung. Yoon Se-Jung.

460
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:04,090
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Yoon Se-Jung.

461
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,867
How's your father lately?
He seemed quite lonely.

462
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:20,011
He's a lonely man with a failing vision.

463
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,778
But I hate him.

464
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,987
You should not. He's your father anyway.

465
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,518
I typed his writing yesterday.

466
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:34,856
You did what? Why?

467
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,459
I like his novels a lot.

468
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,702
Can I help him writing?

469
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,533
Then can I go to see you every day?

470
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,573
What is it?

471
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,453
I can't read your handwriting.

472
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,652
Which part?

473
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,552
What would it feel like
if the whole world disappears?

474
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,921
And then?

475
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,133
What did I write?

476
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,165
How is your sight lately?

477
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:26,942
It got worse than when I
first saw you, right?

478
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,646
Think so, but can't tell exactly

479
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,377
as I haven't been to the hospital lately.

480
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,221
Things were just out of focus before...

481
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:40,192
but everything became blurry at some point.

482
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,793
The glasses don't help actually.

483
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:52,364
Let's see an eye doctor with me.
I know a good one.

484
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,035
Come with me.

485
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:59,540
I really hope your eyes get better

486
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:03,180
so that you can write again.

487
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,414
The handwriting's bad,

488
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,985
but your recent writings are powerful.

489
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,492
It won't be easy but can be cured.

490
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:21,661
Really?

491
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,738
There's a cutting-edge
treatment from England.

492
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,400
We'll perform medication
for a month then surgery.

493
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:33,510
The chances are not high
but it's worth to try.

494
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,415
Thank you so much.

495
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,315
Happy birthday, Chungee.

496
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,944
Make a wish!

497
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,744
I can see you are pulling
a long face again.

498
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:19,883
Professor.

499
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,224
You should see the doctor tomorrow.

500
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:26,793
- I'll go with you.
- Thanks.

501
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,071
It's time for your medicine.

502
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,465
How do you feel?

503
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:10,098
I could see the shapes
even though it's blurry

504
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,340
with my left eye before.

505
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,473
But now the dim contour only...

506
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:17,739
Wait a second.

507
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,348
How about now?

508
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,122
I only see the black-ringed contour.

509
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,059
It's all faint.

510
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,830
It's a routine reaction
to the medication treatment.

511
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:34,667
We can now move on
to the next step.

512
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,262
You mean the operation?

513
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,638
Yes.

514
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:45,407
You'll see the whole bright world soon.

515
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,310
Thank you.

516
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,611
But how much does it cost?

517
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:56,049
Will discuss it with your guardian.

518
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,161
Why don't you tell me the cost?
Is it that big?

519
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,493
Let me find a way.

520
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,904
You've spent most of money
to stop the foreclosure.

521
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,700
Se-Jung!

522
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,976
Let's go to the gambling house.

523
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,612
I need to relieve the stress.

524
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,550
So please do as I ask. Now!

525
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,885
I still got money.

526
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:31,658
As you wish.

527
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,754
- Diamond K, raise anyone?
- Raise one thousand.

528
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:08,818
Raise one thousand.

529
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:11,686
Fold.

530
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:12,587
Go one thousand.

531
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,795
One thousand received and one more, fold?

532
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:19,102
- Fold. One thousand.
- Call.

533
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,270
Call received. Will open the river.

534
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,305
- Diamond 6. Raise?
- Raise one thousand!

535
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,470
Raise one thousand.

536
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,071
Raise one thousand.

537
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:33,251
- Re-raise by 5 thousand.
- Re-raise, 5 thousand.

538
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,944
Call for 5 thousand?

539
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,820
- Call!
- Call it is.

540
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:40,622
Will open the cards.

541
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,292
Luck is coming my way today.

542
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,976
The room upstairs isn't open yet?

543
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,283
<i>Se-Jung!</i>

544
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:12,881
<i>Yes.</i>

545
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,030
<i>I think I can do anything today.</i>

546
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,333
<i>I can earn the money for
the operation at one shot.</i>

547
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,868
<i>It will be tens of thousand at most, right?</i>

548
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:28,232
<i>You should go all the way
on a day like today.</i>

549
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:34,046
<i>All right, professor.
Let's go crazy tonight.</i>

550
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,240
<i>Open the cards.</i>

551
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,259
- Ten thousand.
- Call.

552
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:33,934
Call for ten thousand.

553
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:35,497
Fold.

554
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,311
- Re-raise by 20 thousand.
- 20 thousand

555
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:42,971
Fold!

556
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:44,143
Call for 20 thousand?

557
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:46,308
Call!

558
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,418
- 20 thousand!
- 20 thousand it is.

559
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,519
I'll take a call and put all in.

560
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,562
- Call.
- Call taken. Will open the cards.

561
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,947
- Call the banker.
- Please stop.

562
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,613
I should get my money back.

563
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:22,789
Where's the banker?

564
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:27,983
<i>BOND OF DEBT</i>

565
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,684
<i>AMOUNT: $90,000 AT MONTHLY RATE OF 45%</i>

566
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,961
<i>DEBTOR: SHIM HAK-KYU
DUE: SEPT. 30, 2014</i>

567
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:02,391
Have some pancakes.

568
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,035
Is it good?

569
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,771
- Se-Jung.
- Yes?

570
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,875
You remind me of my mom.

571
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:32,955
She was pretty but wrecked.

572
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,093
She stayed in bed all day
'cause of depression.

573
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,266
It wasn't just her fault, though.

574
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:49,468
I guess you are what a mom should be.

575
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,181
Sweet and tender.

576
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:57,344
But!

577
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,523
I don't want you to be my mom.

578
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:09,189
Are you going to marry my dad?

579
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:18,830
No, I am not.

580
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,669
- What should I do?
- About what?

581
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,213
The money.

582
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,516
I could do anything if I can see things.

583
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,513
I really want to see you, too.

584
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:43,651
I can't imagine how terrible it must be

585
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,893
if I were blind like you.

586
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,930
But you don't have to worry.
You've got me and Chungee.

587
01:13:55,731 --> 01:14:00,737
Give me some time.

588
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:09,914
I will find away.

589
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,197
Where's Chungee?

590
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,670
She went to bed a while ago.

591
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,010
Who's that?

592
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:17,818
Is it Chungee?

593
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,356
It was her, right?

594
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:22,794
She saw us, did she?

595
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,429
It should be okay.

596
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:33,373
She'll understand if I tell her
we're going to get married.

597
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,065
Of course, she will.

598
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,245
How can't she?

599
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,241
She's daddy's little girl.

600
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:51,914
Who is it?

601
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,317
It's banker Choi, professor.

602
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,226
I'll come in for a bit.

603
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,994
Your debt with a huge interest...

604
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,872
What should we do?

605
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:12,476
I can pay you back.
Just let me in some high games.

606
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:19,310
Nonsense to pay your debt
by winning money gambling!

607
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,720
You must be Chungee. Back from school?

608
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:30,957
I'm your daddy's buddy.
Don't be so guarded.

609
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,300
You're much prettier in person.

610
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,994
Go to your room.

611
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,265
We should go, too.

612
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,264
As the little one's back home.

613
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,105
How old are you?

614
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,710
I will see you around.

615
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,327
Can't believe this!

616
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:08,424
What?

617
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,433
What is it?

618
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:20,042
I'm so scared. I can't even go home.

619
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,346
He's coming to our house every day.

620
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,878
It's driving me crazy.

621
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:31,547
<i>Me and clad, what should we do?</i>

622
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,555
<i>I would feel safer. If you married him.</i>

623
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,858
<i>Don't worry too much. Let
me take care of this.</i>

624
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:02,284
What are you guys doing?

625
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,246
You ruthless bastards.

626
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:09,127
Are you okay, professor?

627
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,998
What's all this about?

628
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:15,126
I apologize, sir. Let him seated.

629
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:22,342
My apology. They were so rude.

630
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,837
What the hell were you doing?

631
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,775
I'm really sorry.

632
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:35,351
I have an idea to end all your troubles.

633
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,259
Let's send Chungee to Japan.

634
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,864
What're you talking about?

635
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:45,788
No way.

636
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:49,357
I will protect her whatever it takes.

637
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:51,360
Let me finish first!

638
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,031
Listen carefully.

639
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:56,106
Consider it as the overseas training.

640
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,336
All she needs to do is to talk
with the high-class clients.

641
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,675
It could be a chance for her.

642
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:03,909
Why don't you just kill me
and sell my corpse?

643
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,777
It could make you some money.

644
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:11,483
What is the use of dying?
Want to make a child an orphan?

645
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,627
If you agree with my plan,
I can pay for your surgery.

646
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,565
I can write novels.

647
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:23,364
I'm a bestselling writer.

648
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:29,466
- Let me write a book for you.
- Whatever. Hold him!

649
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,670
Please don't do this!

650
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,771
You should cure your eyes first

651
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,677
to bring your daughter back

652
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,444
and see your pretty chick's face.
Ain't it right?

653
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,447
I got it!

654
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,794
Son of a bitch!

655
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,357
Why make things complicated
by resisting in vain?

656
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:54,357
Take him home.

657
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,995
Don't forget the money, sir.

658
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:02,136
I will make you pay for it
when I have my sight back!

659
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,146
Thanks to my money, you motherfucker!

660
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,899
What happened to your face?

661
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,970
Let me have the surgery with this money.

662
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,868
What the heck did you do?

663
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,344
This is way far from enough.

664
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,717
I even released my bar for you.

665
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,922
What are you talking about?

666
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:58,930
Where's Chungee?

667
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,893
Where's my girl?

668
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,603
Chungee! My daughter!

669
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:17,747
My poor little girl...

670
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,746
Chungee...

671
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,574
Chungee...

672
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:15,236
Are you awake?

673
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:18,071
You'd better behave.

674
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,410
You know what it is?

675
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:26,584
It's a memo that your daddy
sold you for money.

676
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,889
You bastard must've threatened him!

677
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:32,219
Watch your language.

678
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,592
Didn't threaten anybody.

679
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:39,229
He signed for the money
to open his eyes again.

680
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,465
It's a bullshit, scumbag!

681
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:43,962
Watch your mouth, I warned you.

682
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,863
Of course, it took him a while.
He's the father after all.

683
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:53,542
How about Se-Jung?

684
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:55,849
How did you find me there?

685
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,172
You mean Deokee?

686
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:02,745
You naive little girl...

687
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:07,118
Didn't you get suspicious at all

688
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:11,525
when the new neighbor treated you too kind?

689
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,244
I'm pretty excited.

690
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,256
<i>6 MONTHS LATER</i>

691
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:07,536
I made your favorite. Kimchi stew.

692
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,543
You got a problem with my cooking?

693
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,836
It tastes weird.

694
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,347
You think I'll give you things not eatable?

695
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,051
I'm working my hard ass off

696
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,456
to take care of you.

697
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:53,921
Be at least grateful.

698
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:00,528
I know, I know. My bad.

699
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,429
Let's not argue. Please help
me wash myself instead.

700
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,045
Got any news about Chungee?

701
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:29,086
I had a baby.

702
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:30,852
What?

703
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,100
Where's your baby now?

704
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:39,267
Dead.

705
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:45,707
Because of its dad.

706
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:52,084
I was just an innocent girl

707
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,482
working at the small
amusement park.

708
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,282
I knew nothing about the world.

709
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:12,431
- My mom couldn't speak,
- Mom, do you love me?

710
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,731
- But loved me dearly.
- I love you, too.

711
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,574
That son of a bitch ruined everything!

712
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:28,849
That bastard killed my
unborn baby and my mom.

713
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,058
Do you get it?

714
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,461
You ruined everything!

715
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,259
You destroyed my life, motherfucker!

716
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,095
So

717
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:49,068
It was you.

718
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,869
I suspected...

719
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,983
but wish it were never you.

720
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,187
I went totally wrecked,

721
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,255
but did whatever it took to survive.

722
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,058
I swore that I'll make you
go through all the same.

723
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,029
My resolution grew weaker,

724
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,770
but then I saw you.

725
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:28,581
You didn't change a bit.
Still same selfish bastard!

726
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:30,873
Do you know?

727
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,841
You understand?

728
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:34,409
You know that?

729
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:37,183
How selfish you're? You know that?

730
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:48,790
You're satisfied now?

731
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:03,172
Your daughter is dead.
Couldn't even find the body.

732
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:05,083
You caused it to yourself.

733
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:49,578
Deokee.

734
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,214
He can never see again

735
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:54,153
unless he gets the transplant.

736
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,911
<i>My body and soul were
completely ravaged already.</i>

737
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,218
<i>So I couldn't even feel the pain.</i>

738
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:12,829
<i>But I wished she would stay
even if it's only to celebrate</i>

739
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:17,264
<i>the fulfillment of her revenge.</i>

740
01:33:56,698 --> 01:34:00,305
<i>HERE'S THE SECRET NOBODY KNOWS.</i>

741
01:34:10,178 --> 01:34:13,125
Let's go get some fresh air.

742
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,525
This is so beautiful.

743
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,700
You're incredible, professor.

744
01:34:24,926 --> 01:34:27,202
Typing this perfect while
you cannot see anything.

745
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:31,072
Also this is the best thing
you've ever written.

746
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:39,083
Here's the secret nobody knows.

747
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,386
I wander around the dim stars

748
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:45,581
to reach out to your heart.

749
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:49,419
I haven't finished it yet.

750
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:56,994
Why couldn't you write this
when you had it all?

751
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,871
Why do you write so good

752
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:06,142
just when you're left helpless?

753
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,517
Deokee!

754
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:21,921
Miss me?

755
01:35:21,983 --> 01:35:25,294
Is that you, Chungee?

756
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:29,494
My gin!

757
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,563
Hi, dad.

758
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,398
Nice sunglasses.

759
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:39,304
I want to eat the pancakes.

760
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:43,774
You don't know how much
I missed your pancakes.

761
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:48,777
It's great to be back.

762
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:53,222
That old man asked me
where I wanted to live.

763
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:55,619
So I answered, 'With you!'

764
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,527
Then he gave me one bill every day.

765
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:02,299
Guess how much it was.

766
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,499
One bill?

767
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:08,463
One grand.

768
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:10,634
I told him I didn't need the money

769
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:12,905
but just wanted to be with him.

770
01:36:14,635 --> 01:36:17,047
Then he asked me if I didn't like money.

771
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,044
I told him that I didn't
care just any money

772
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,215
but did care the money he had.

773
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:27,757
Then he flicked me on the forehead
with his finger.

774
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:30,862
He's like a child.

775
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:35,434
Are you listening to me?

776
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:37,829
Sure.

777
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,801
I missed this, so yummy!

778
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:44,300
You guaranteed she would
never come out of there!

779
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:46,733
<i>The girl seemed to get out</i>

780
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:50,375
after paying off all her debt.

781
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:54,847
Also she seems to be
quite spiteful and strong.

782
01:36:56,511 --> 01:37:00,049
I guess it's time for you two spiteful
women to handle it yourselves.

783
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:13,399
This scar...

784
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:17,903
It's because of my dad, right?

785
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,408
You paid back quite enough.

786
01:37:24,272 --> 01:37:25,876
Why do you still linger?

787
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,289
You must've suffered much.

788
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:42,559
As a sweet little girl just
like I was when I met you.

789
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,365
I guess that's why you did
all that to me and dad.

790
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:48,936
I...

791
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:53,373
I even hoped you could be my mother.

792
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:54,673
I...

793
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:56,573
I suffered a lot too.

794
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,912
I was near to death because of you!

795
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:07,682
I'll give you back what you did to us.
Just same.

796
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:09,221
Out of my way!

797
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:17,699
I told you not to come again.

798
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,103
You should end what you started.

799
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,466
Cut it off.

800
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:27,973
I'm officially out of this.

801
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:30,742
It's your battle to fight now.

802
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:34,880
Brother, he's here.

803
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:47,060
Sir, it's an honor to have you here.

804
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,801
It's been a while.

805
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,896
Please follow me.

806
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:09,717
<i>Come to the clinic right now!</i>

807
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,684
<i>Got some strange visitors!</i>

808
01:39:35,236 --> 01:39:36,772
I'm starving.

809
01:39:40,675 --> 01:39:46,626
You find all this funny?

810
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,518
Deokee!

811
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,335
What the hell are you doing?

812
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:36,540
I told you...

813
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:40,010
I will pay back exactly
the same you gave to us.

814
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:47,584
I know that doctor helped
you make my dad blind.

815
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:52,318
So?

816
01:40:57,351 --> 01:41:00,161
I think there's nothing you can do for now.

817
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,529
You came too far.

818
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,004
Don't blame me.

819
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:15,575
Let me see him for once.

820
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:19,073
You will.

821
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,946
And dad will see you too.

822
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,457
Through your eyes.

823
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:26,310
Chungee said she brought the best doctors.

824
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:32,120
We even took a walk together.

825
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:39,291
She's changed a lot.

826
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:48,505
I can't be with you anymore.

827
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:51,468
Why not?

828
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:57,776
I will get my job back and
publish new book after surgery.

829
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:04,020
I feel really confident about my new book.

830
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:05,915
Deokee!

831
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,724
We can start all over.

832
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,763
Please give me

833
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:20,232
the second chance

834
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:23,873
to make it up to to you and Chungee.

835
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:25,204
Don't say that!

836
01:43:28,636 --> 01:43:30,946
Don't act like a good man!

837
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:37,711
You should stay as a jerk!

838
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:48,930
You have to be the evil till the very end!

839
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,771
I am really sorry.

840
01:44:04,872 --> 01:44:06,146
Professor.

841
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:12,119
What was the thing we had then?

842
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,265
It was love, too.

843
01:44:28,796 --> 01:44:31,572
But I had no other choice.

844
01:44:38,706 --> 01:44:40,344
Please forgive me.

845
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,151
I hurt you too much.

846
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:53,426
I am really sorry.

847
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,971
I gave you too much pain.

848
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:02,262
<i>Deokee, let's go home now.</i>

849
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:29,107
<i>I love you Deokee.</i>
