report it earlier.

She was stubborn and refused to heed any advice.

00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
She only has herself to blame

However, after a long time,

92
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,279
Before you know it, you would clean your plate

93
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,119
before you put away your chopsticks.

94
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,600

108
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,039
why must you

109
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,400
deliver the dishes personally?

110
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,479
The cook is injured but still tries hard to cook.

111
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,880
His Majesty witnessed that

112
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,760
and might graciously

113
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,159
allow me to finish talking.

114
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,159

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,080

in front of His Majesty.

118
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,679
It's fine.

119
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,239
I'm going.

120
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,559
Don't worry, Matron.

130

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,479
looked delicate but made people thirsty

136
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,000
because they were heavily seasoned.

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,719
If one sets store

138
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:38,000

139
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,479

140
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,840
The real purpose of using fresh ingredients,

141
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,799

159
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,880
This is one of the Zhou Dynasty's eight treasures.

160
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,400
It's the roasted suckling pig.

161

The pig belly is filled with dates.

162
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,039
The piglet is wrapped in reeds and cob

163
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,599
and roasted over high fire.

164
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,280
The skin is removed and the piglet is coated

165
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
before being

166
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,679
double boiled for three days and nights.

167
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,239
I think

168
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,119
the method maintains

169
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,119
the original taste,

170
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,599
but it is too complicated.

171
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,599
Today, I'm trying a new method

172
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,919
of roasting in a rotating pit
over a low charcoal fire

173
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,080
so that it tastes better.

174
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,440
Your Majesty,

175
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,640
I heard that after roasting,

176
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,960
the suckling pig

177
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,119
acquires an amber color.

178
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,799
The skin is crispy and the meat is tender.

179
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
It is unusually delicious.

180
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,919
I'm looking forward to eating it.

181
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,520
What is that?

182
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,559
A Qilin pattern.

183
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,280
Your Majesty, this is a Qilin pattern.

184
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,000

you've put a lot of thought

190
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,880
into preparing this suckling pig.

191
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,919
They are pleasing me.

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,640
can have

194
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,960
any roasting pattern.

195
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,200
Your Majesty is wise.

196
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,080
After improving the dish,

197
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,000
I call it Engraved Suckling Pig.

198

[Engraved Suckling Pig]

199
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,400
Come on.

200
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Proceed. Proceed.

201
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

202
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,359
Crown Princess,

203

what if the cook is not careful

204
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,919
and engraves

205
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,760
a golden dragon on the pig?

206
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,880
Father.

207
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,119
Your Majesty.

208
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,440
Send His Majesty back.

210
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,679
Catch the assassins!

211

Chen Wu!

212

214

Quick! Save His Majesty!

215

Over here!

216
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,280
How dare you?

217
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,359
Go quickly!

218
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,280
Come on!

219
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,400
Save me! Save me!

220
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,599
Come quickly!

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,400
Over here!

223
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,880
Father!

224
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,680
Go away!

225
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,880
Had I waited for you to rescue me,

226
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,560
I'd be dead already.

227
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,880
Summon the imperial physician now.

228
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,079
Sir!

229
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,479
Your Majesty!

230
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,319
My consort!

231
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,439
I was scared to death.

232
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:36,959
I'm fine.

233
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,199
Are you all right?

234
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,160
I am relieved

235
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,599
that Your Majesty is unharmed.

236
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,040
Go back to the palace.

237
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,119
Help me back to the palace.

238
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,119
Walk slowly.

239
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,640
Your Highness, are you hurt?

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,040

241
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm fine.

242
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:55,920
Send my mother back.

243
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:56,680
Yes.

244
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,479
Go.

245
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Chen Wu,

246
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,319
take care of the aftermath.

247
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes.

248
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:41,959
Matron Hu.

249
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,800
Go away.

[Xingyun Cottage]

251
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,800
Your Highness,

252
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,160
you are injured.

253
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
I'll report it.

254
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,319
Stop.

255
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,400
Your Highness.

256
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,959
My mother

257
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,079
is in shock.

258
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,439
Don't make her worry.

259
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,199
Get Sheng Yin

260
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,199
to examine me.

261
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,560
Yes, I'll go now.

262
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,199
Your Highness, it's a superficial wound,

263
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,199
but the wound is narrow and deep.

264
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,760
I'll write

265
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
a prescription to stop your bleeding
and replenish qi.

266
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,599
Additionally,

267
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,000
you might have a high fever
in the second half of the night.

268
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,839
Attend to His Highness carefully.

269
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't be careless.

270
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,839
Eunuch Yuan, the supper is here.

271
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,599
Your Highness.

274
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,959
Please eat a bit.

275
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,800
Wait.

276
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,959
Your Highness,

277
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,839
your injury is serious.

278
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,000
You

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,359
must be careful about your diet.

280
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
What's in there?

281
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,400
What is it?

282
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,359
Your Highness,

283
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,079
there's a bowl of white porridge

284
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,400
and crispy blood-enriching walnut cakes.

285
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,760
In addition,

286
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
there are two light side dishes.

287
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,800
Walnut cakes

288
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
warm the spleen and stomach
and nourish the blood.

289
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,560
This is good.

290
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,400
Does Kunning Palace

291
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,719
know about Your Highness' injury?

292
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,239
I forgot to prepare

293
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,880
the ingredients for breakfast tomorrow.

294
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,160
You go back first.

295
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
What?

296
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,560
You know for whom

297
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,839
you are preparing them.

298
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,640
Go back.

299
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,040
Come out.

300
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,400
Manager Yao.

301
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,000
Matron Hu asked me to give you a message.

302
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
I knew you would come.

303
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,959
I took care of you and promoted you.

304
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,599
I was sincere.

305
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,280
Before I leave,

306
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,959
you would visit me.

307
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:51,560
The roasted suckling pig's skin is crispy

308
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,239
and the meat is fresh and tender.

309
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,520
It is indeed

310
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,959
a rare delicacy.

311
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
After suffering for many years,

312
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,079
I thought I would feel exalted.

313
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,839
What happened was unexpected.

314
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,239
Fated.

315
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
You lost.

316
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,119
In fact,

317
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,479
I chose Pearl and Emerald and White Jade Soup

318
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,319
to dispel

319
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,640
His Majesty's prejudice.

320
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,800
Eventually,

321
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,160
the real test

322
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
is the food itself.

323
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,160
You chose a dish

324
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,040
with a unique pattern

325
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,959
to please His Majesty.

326
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,800
You are no different from officials

327
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,880
who offer auspiciousness.

328
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,079
Pigeon soup

329
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,959
and...

330
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,760
Coconut milk and dates.

331
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
You used coconut water instead of water.

332
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,400
The soup base is nourishing and sweet

333
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
but not greasy.

334
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,160
Good.

335
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,880
The sour taste in this fish soup...

336
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,880
(It was a clear soup made from water
that was soaked with glutinous rice.)

337
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,439
(The water was poured into bamboo tubes)

338
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,839
(and repeatedly heated.)

339
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,719
(After natural fermentation,)

340
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,359
(you get an appetizing sour soup
that nourishes the spleen.)

341
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,959
Therefore,

342
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
the nine different soup bases

343
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
were painstakingly prepared.

344
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,359
Each has its merit.

345
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,839
Good.

346
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,439
The student has surpassed the master.

347
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,199
I deserve to lose.

348
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,520
Sit down.

349
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,959
He Shu told me

350
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,520
that before you leave the palace,

351
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
you have something to tell me.

352
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,479
Do you hate me?

353
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,520
You helped me

354
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,439
but also destroyed my right hand.

355
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,839
I don't have

356
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
anything to say to you.

357
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,359
I did all these

358
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,680
for atonement.

359
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
I joined the Hu family

360
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,520
when my third sister was born.

361
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,760
She weighed only slightly over 3 jin

362
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,040
at birth.

363
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,439
Everyone said she wouldn't live long.

364
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,000
Even my father and grandmother

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,280
thought she'd be a burden.

366
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,880
I was always afraid that my sister

367
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,280
wouldn't grow up safe and sound.

368
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,400
I didn't know why,

369
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
but I told a lie.

370
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,760
What was the lie?

371
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,079
I told everyone

372
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,119
that the day my third sister was born,

373
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,880
I saw red and white rays coming out of the door.

374
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,280
Soon,

375
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,160
this became an auspicious sign

376
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
in that place.

377
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Fortunately, my third sister survived.

378
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,160
Who would have thought

379
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,439
that what a child said in fun

380
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,839
had, in the end, became the starting point

381
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,719
of the Hu family's meticulous plan.

382
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,280
My third sister was weak since small.

383
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,040
She was often rejected by others.

384
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,400
My father said

385
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,319
that if I entered the palace,

386
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,520
the family would be exempted
from conscript labor.

387
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,239
I was

388
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,199
betrothed at that time,

389
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
but because of her,

390
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,479
I agreed.

391
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,319
Sell her! Sell her!

392
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,359
Hu family's daughter

393
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
is no different from goods.

394
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,439
Every night,

395
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,119
I would carve like this.

396
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,880
I won't even stop for a moment.

397
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you know why?

398
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,479
I was afraid

399
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,959
and lonely.

400
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,880
I couldn't even look in the mirror

401
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,119
because I didn't

402
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,520
want to see my face,

403
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,000
which had become cold and abominable.

404
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,479
You've told me everything.

405
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,199
Aren't you afraid I'll report it?

406
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,439
When the Late Emperor said it was auspicious,

407
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,359
it had to be.

408
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,439
You won't get back

409
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,439
all that you lost.

410
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,280
I'm the root of all evils.

411
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
You can blame me

412
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,599
and hate me,

413
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,000
but leave the Crown Princess out of this.

414
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,640
If you hate me,

415
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,760
you can kill me.

416
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,319
Don't implicate her.

417
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,040
The source of this evil

418
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,000
is me.

419
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,719
You promised

420
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,160
that you'd leave

421
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,000
the Forbidden City if you lost

422
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,719
and never became a cook again.

423
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,719
Have a safe journey.

424
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,079
Zijin.

425
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,520
Your Highness!

426
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
(I sincerely pray to heaven)

427
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,839
(that you live in peace and joy forever.)

428
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
(This is my only wish.)

429
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,800
It's late.

430
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,040
Excuse me.

431
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,160
Why did you do it?

432
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
You put something in the seasoning.

433
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,880
Why did you scheme to bring Hu down?

434
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,359
In the past,

435
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,839
I blamed you

436
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,119
and hated you,

437
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,560
but I could never deny

438
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,640
that I wished

439
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,399
that we'd be united as mother and daughter.

440
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
However, people in the palace
are sinister.

441
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,080
My existence

442
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,719
would only be your weakness.

443
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,159
I do not blame you

444
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,159
for rejecting me,

445
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,800
but I can't stand it

446
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,199
when others hurt you.

447
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
So,

448
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
this was the only thing

449
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,760
I thought I could do for you.

450
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,239
Father married a stepmother

451
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,280
and I have siblings.

452
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,199
No one cared about me anymore.

453
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,120
So,

454
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,080
no matter how hard it was,

455
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,800
I had to locate you,

456
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,879
the person

457
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,959
who gave me life.

458
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,040
Go back.

459
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,959
Mother!

460
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
When I first entered the palace,

461
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,199
I was reckless and ignorant

462
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,479
and was only a burden to you.

463
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,879
However, it's different now.

464
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I've learned everything

465
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,360
and I can assist you.

466
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,360
I can be your arm.

467
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,399
I'll be better

468
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,639
than anyone.

469
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,320
Mother,

470
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,479
are you rejecting me?

471
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,320
Mother.

472
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,399
It's you.

473
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,479
Tell me.

474
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,879
How did my master die?

475
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,840
She left me a book that wasn't completed.

476
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:48,919
My master

477
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,000
wasn't a quitter.

478
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:51,879
She sacrificed herself

479
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,360
to protect you,

480
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,600
but you killed her

481
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,919
to cover up the truth.

482
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,159
Are you even human?

483
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,439
She knew too much about me.

484
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
She would be a threat if I let her live.

485
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,280
No one can guarantee

486
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,760
that she'd never reveal the secret.

487
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
Was that why you killed her?

488
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,399
Yes.

489
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,239
You know the truth now.

490
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,560
Well?

491
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:21,959
Will you kill me

492
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,040
to avenge her?

493
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,959
Do it.

494
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,560
Kill me.

495
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,639
Thank you

496
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,959
for sending me off on my last journey.

497
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,120
Your Highness.

498
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
Matron Hu only instructed me

499
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,919
to invite Manager Yao.

500
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,879
I don't know what happened.

501
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

502
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,719
Leave.

503
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:43,760
Yes.

504
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,959
Don't cry.

505
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,600
Look.

506
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,479
Isn't this adorable?

507
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,919
Sister.

508
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:06,840
-Sister.
-Young Lady.

509
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,919
-Wait for me.
-Young Lady.

510
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,040
-Young Lady.
-Sister.

511
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,479
-Wait for me, Sister.
-Go back, Young Lady.

512
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,120
Don't leave me.

513
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,199
-Go back, Young Lady.
-Don't leave me.

514
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Sister.

515
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,080
Sister.

516
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,679
Have you all heard?

517
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,399
Matron Hu...

518
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,919
Matron Hu committed suicide.

519
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,919
Really?

520
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,560
Not so loud.

521
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,280
People from the Court
of Imperial Entertainments

522
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
and the Palace Surveillance are here.

523
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,280
It's a great taboo in the palace

524
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,239
and we shouldn't mention it.

525
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,679
What's wrong?

526
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,919
Nothing.

527
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,479
She kicked down the ladder.

528
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,320
I told Matron Meng

529
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,560
that before my right hand recovers,

530
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,639
I'll stay at the Imperial Food Service

531
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,479
and do chores.

532
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,080
I can help the palace maids.

533
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,639
Isn't it better to be the Crown Prince's concubine

534
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,199
than

535
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,439
be treated with disdain over here?

536
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:45,439
Give me.

537
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,399
Don't do it.

538
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,320
You reject glory and wealth

539
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,040
so that you can dry Chinese cabbages here.

540
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,399
What are you doing?

541
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:57,679
Do you see this?

542
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,199
My face is green with anger.

543
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,919
It is greener than this cabbage.

544
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,600
Su Yuehua can't overtake me

545
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,239
just like that.

546
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,719
Zijin.
