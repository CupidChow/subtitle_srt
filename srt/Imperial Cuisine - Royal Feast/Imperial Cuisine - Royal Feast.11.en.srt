00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,599
He conspired to poison Your Majesty

194
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,400
with wine at the banquet;

195
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,679
take the Palace Armory and imperial seal;
and detain dukes, marquises, earls,

196
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,440
and five chief military commissions
and six ministries' officials.

197
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,960
We found a fake unsealed edict.

198
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
With the seal, they can abolish

199
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,719
the Crown Prince and endorse

200
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,159
the Prince of Zhao.

201
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,679
My good son indeed.

202
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm just a bit sick and didn't attend

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,239
imperial court assemblies.

204
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,359
Are you concerned about

205
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,239
the dragon throne and your big brother's head?

206
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:37,919
Third Brother.

207
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,479
Third Brother!

208
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,479
Wake up!

209
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,119
Third Brother!

210
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,799
Third Brother!

211
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,599
Did you conspire with others
to poison our father

212
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,960
and usurp the throne?

213
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm tipsy.

214
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
What is it,

215
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,479
Big Brother?

216
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,559
What are you talking about?

217
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,000
What's wrong?

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,119
Why did you make such a cruel remark?

219
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,239
Heaven can attest to my loyalty

220
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,000
and filial piety to our father.

221
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
Why would I concoct a plot

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
with others?

223
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,280
Who said that?

224
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,559
Did you?

225
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Who asked you to frame me?

226
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,719
Shut up!

227
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,000
Leave.

228
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes.

229
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes.

230
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,440
Third Brother,

231
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,200
you command the Changshan Guard.

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,719
You're the only one who can mobilize it.

233
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,919
The men were detained, but you still deny it.

234
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,520
No.

235
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,359
Father,

236
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,599
I drank too much

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
and fell asleep.

238
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,479
I don't know what happened.

239
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,479
Someone is definitely framing me.

240
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,000
He wants me to look unrighteous, Father.

241
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,839
Let him drink this.

242
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:18,880
Your Majesty.

243
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,520
Go.

244
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,359
Your Highness, Prince of Zhao.

245
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,239
If you're innocent,

246
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
why don't you drink it?

247
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,400
Father,

248
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,520
I don't command elite soldiers and generals,

249
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,000
and I have no military confidante.

250
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,199
I am alone.

251
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,199
I stayed in Beijing for several years

252
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,359
and had never dared to do anything wrong.

253
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,880
Who formed partisans in the army

254
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,079
and is endorsed

255
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,079
by military officers?

256
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,599
Third Brother, you undermined me.

257
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm innocent.

258
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,680
In the early years of war,

259
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,599
many military officers and I
were like blood brothers

260
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,239
because we fought in tough battles.

261
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,880
After I went to my fief,

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,719
I haven't contacted the military officers.

263
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,880
I don't know about the endorsement.

264
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,040
Big Brother

265
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
is the one favored by courtiers.

266
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
Those jealous civil ministers
in the imperial court

267
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,839
always say that the Crown Prince is kindhearted.

268
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,119
Father,

269
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,719
I am innocent.

270
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,199
Alright, stop talking.

271
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:24,839
Father,

272
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll drink

273
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,319
the wine.

274
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,719
Before I drink,

275
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,119
I swear to heaven

276
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,239
that I didn't stage the insurgency.

277
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,319
Someone wanted to frame me.

278
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,880
Someone is the oriole behind the mantis.

279
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,239
Father,

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,959
if I must drink this wine

281
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,199
to prove my innocence,

282
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,560
I will drink it!

283
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,000
Father,

284
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,560
no!

285
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,640
Third Brother is humble and wise.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,359
He is never disobedient.

287
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm sure he is innocent.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,760
If this is a glass of poisoned wine,

289
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,560
I'll drink it instead.

290
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,079
Let me.

291
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,319
Big Brother.

292
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,880
Let me.

293
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
Big Brother.

294
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,319
Third Brother.

295
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,119
Big Brother.

296
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,640
Third Brother.

297
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,239
Big Brother.

298
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:15,760
Alright.

299
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,800
If you two want to drink to prove

300
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,959
your innocence, I will too.

301
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm innocent too.

302
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:21,839
Give me.

303
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:22,959
Give me.

304
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,239
Enough.

305
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,319
Grandfather,

306
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,280
permit me to continue.

307
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
Meng Xian and Peng Xu

308
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,439
are just commanders

309
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,880
with few soldiers.

310
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,520
It is impossible for them to hijack

311
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
the heavily guarded vault.

312
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,479
The two uncles are smart

313
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,560
and won't do such a stupid thing.

314
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,199
I found out

315
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,719
that some stupid subordinates did it.

316
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,000
My uncles aren't involved.

317
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,319
Zhanji,

318
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
you should have said it earlier.

319
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm timid.

320
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
You scared me.

321
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,920
Uncles,

322
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,479
you reacted

323
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,199
before I could finish.

324
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,640
Although they weren't the masterminds,

325
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,760
they are arrogant and indulgent.

326
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,119
As a result, their subordinates
became greedy and wanted to

327
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,800
usurp power and the throne.

328
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,599
Your Majesty, don't get angry.

329
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Relay my edict.

330
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,199
Wang Shecheng enticed others
with a celestial phenomenon.

331
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,920
He is sentenced to death.

332
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,079
The others who were involved

333
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,599
will be tried in the Imperial Prison.

334
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,719
Yes.

335
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
As for you two,

336
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,920
the Prince of Zhao will introspect himself
in his room.

337
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes.

338
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,640
You

339
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,680
go back to your fief tomorrow.

340
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,400
Yes, Father.

341
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,280
The Prince of Han is here.

342
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,880
Sister-in-law?

343
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:22,719
Mother,

344
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,920
the Princess has a chronic illness.

345
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
Why didn't she rest in the fief

346
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,680
to nurse her health?

347
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,560
Who told you what the eight famous chefs

348
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,359
of the Directorate would serve?

349
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,880
Who reminded you to use

350
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,520
egg whites

351
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,119
in the stir-fried pig's kidneys?

352
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,760
Egg white.

353
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,839
The Princess of Han is chronically sick.

354
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,280
She takes poached eggs in the morning for health.

355
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
(Cook the stir-fried pig's kidneys)

356
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,280
(with egg white.)

357
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,560
It's him!

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,479
Mother,

359
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,520
believe me.

360
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,599
I didn't do anything.

361
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,719
I don't know the Princess

362
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
and that she has asthma.

363
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,520
Mother,

364
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
believe me.

365
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,719
You won't murder the Princess of Han.

366
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,760
You just wanted to frame me.

367
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,640
What?

368
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,040
You knew that if the Princess of Han
died from her illness,

369
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,479
the seal-holding official

370
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,719
will be held for negligence.

371
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,119
You intentionally framed me!

372
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,079
Negligence?

373
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,760
You are angry

374
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,719
not because the Princess of Han died,

375
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,839
but you're afraid of losing your position.

376
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
You mentioned him.

377
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Who was it?

378
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,880
Tell me.

379
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,439
Say it.

380
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,520
Who instructed you?

381
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,599
No one.

382
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I did it myself.

383
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,199
I did it.

384
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,719
You're the seal-holding official.

385
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,599
Someone died on New Year's Eve.

386
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,079
Of course, you are guilty.

387
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,079
I deliberately planned it

388
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,319
to see

389
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,079
what you'd look like when you lost everything.

390
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,239
To see how a woman who abandoned her family

391
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,800
will end up.

392
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,800
I did everything.

393
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,880
I did it all.

394
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,439
Are you satisfied?

395
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,760
You disappointed me.

396
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:33,959
Matron Meng,

397
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,880
the Crown Princess summoned you.

398
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,880
No need for courtesy.

399
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:22,880
Grandfather.

400
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,040
Wasn't it a joke

401
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,520
that you found an edict for rebellion
in the traitor's mansion?

402
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,319
My third son

403
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,119
is usually meticulous.

404
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,040
He won't leak the information

405
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,000
and let everyone get caught.

406
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
A mansion

407
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,560
will surely

408
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,760
attract thieves

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,319
if it is filled with treasures.

410
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,000
However,

411
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,520
a ruined temple

412
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
in the countryside

413
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,520
only has spider webs.

414
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,199
Not even

415
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,239
rats will go there.

416
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
The Emperor's position, dragon throne, and power

417
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,079
are tempting.

418
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
Your two uncles

419
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,880
colluded and exchanged messages

420
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,880
with eunuchs

421
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,439
when I am old and sick.

422
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,000
I turned a blind eye to them and they thought

423
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,119
I am deaf and blind.

424
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,959
Who asked you to scare them?

425
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,000
Grandfather,

426
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,839
you were the one scaring them.

427
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
How dare you?

428
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,280
I won't wrongly accuse anyone.

429
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
I fought many wars and killed

430
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,719
unhesitatingly.

431
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,119
I keep a close watch on my children.

432
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,800
I was criticized for being cruel and violent.

433
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Am I?

434
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,959
Tell me.

435
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,560
When I was small,

436
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
you explained to me

437
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,160
what a leader is.

438
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,640
At first, when people were hunters,

439
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
they elected the bravest man

440
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
as their leader.

441
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,520
This man

442
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,359
killed the greatest number of beasts.

443
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
He had weapons and formed an army

444
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,239
to protect his tribe and food.

445
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
That's what makes a leader.

446
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
A tribe is like this,

447
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,319
let alone a country.

448
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,680
If a commoner wants to be a good person,

449
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,119
they only need to do good deeds.

450
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,959
However, for an emperor,

451
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,079
blindly upholding righteousness

452
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,280
will only make him a mediocre emperor.

453
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,319
What is a good emperor?

454
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,079
For the people

455
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,280
and the country,

456
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,640
he forgets benevolence, righteousness,

457
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
and his close relatives.

458
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,680
He endures the condemnations of many people,

459
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
puts the country on the right path,

460
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,160
and defends his territory and people.

461
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,119
This is an emperor.

462
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,040
You always take care of family love

463
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,599
and forgive the family.

464
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,479
Was that glass of wine poisonous?

465
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Even if it was,

466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,160
it'd only poison rebellious hearts

467
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,959
but not a true dragon and son of heaven.

468
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,719
Come on,

469
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
walk with me.

470
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:33,560
[Precious and Blessed]

471
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,160
Your Highness,

472
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,959
what happened at the banquet

473
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,560
was my fault.

474
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,760
Please punish me.

475
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,199
Don't you want to defend yourself?

476
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm a humble woman.

477
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,839
My achievement is due to

478
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,680
the protection of the Crown Princess.

479
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,959
I should repay your kindness,

480
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,079
but I was negligent

481
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,160
and allowed a villain to make trouble.

482
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,479
At this point,

483
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,520
I have no justification to defend myself.

484
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,280
Matron Meng,

485
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,280
who is the villain?

486
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,160
Righteous people

487
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,199
will understand the principle of hierarchy

488
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,839
for the ruler and his subjects.

489
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,520
They will not overstep their bounds.

490
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,640
I was not strict with my people

491
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,160
and I kept forgiving them.

492
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,359
So I gave a villain a chance to make trouble.

493
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,760
It was my mistake.

494
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,719
Matron Meng.

495
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,319
Directress Hu.

496
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,000
I serve Your Highness wholeheartedly.

497
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,079
I overlooked a danger near me.

498
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,520
I did not check the menu again

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
and gave the villain a chance to frame me.

500
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,439
It was my fault.

501
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,839
This was my second mistake.

502
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,479
I am deeply grateful

503
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,400
and will boldly say this.

504
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,880
A person who betrays her superior

505
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
cannot be trusted.

506
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,239
How can she stay by your side?

507
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
The Imperial Physician diagnosed the Princess.

508
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
He said she had a chronic disease.

509
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,560
She made a long trip to Beijing against an advice

510
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
and had a relapse.

511
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,119
He couldn't save her.

512
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,280
The menu of the Court
of Imperial Entertainments was alright.

513
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,959
The Imperial Food Service made the foods
according to the menu. Nothing is wrong with that too.

514
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
And His Majesty enjoyed the crab soup very much.

515
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,119
The Imperial Food Service
will still get to prepare meals.

516
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,359
If the Imperial Food Service is not to be blamed,

517
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,959
why...

518
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,880
Someone tipped me off

519
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,719
that you sent private messages
to the Prince of Han.

520
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,800
Do you plead guilty?

521
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,280
That's a false accusation.

522
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Directress Hu,

523
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,920
how can you tell lies without evidence
in front of your master?

524
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,119
Greetings, Your Highness.

525
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,160
That day at Qianqing Palace,

526
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,239
she saw Official Yuan being
kicked out of the main hall.

527
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,920
Matron Meng said that His Majesty
was taking an elixir

528
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,079
and he is unhealthy.

529
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,640
She said with certainty
that the palace wouldn't be peaceful.

530
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,760
I gave a second thought to it later

531
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,479
and I was afraid.

532
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,880
So I reported it.

533
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,479
Matron Meng,

534
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,839
had you not contacted the Prince of Han,

535
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,599
how would you know that something would happen?

536
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,280
I was sharp

537
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,839
and noticed minor details.

538
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,359
Your Highness,

539
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,000
our ancestors instructed

540
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,119
that the empress, consorts, and female officials

541
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,839
shouldn't interfere in outside affairs.

542
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
It is a great crime for Matron Meng
to peep at His Majesty.

543
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,800
Not to mention she passed messages
to the Prince of Han.

544
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040
She also went against your will to repay

545
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,520
the grace of the Prince of Han.

546
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
Matron Meng,

547
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,599
those who send or receive letters
or information to or from outside

548
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,040
shall be beheaded.

549
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,239
You are the matron,

550
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,719
but you knowingly committed the crime.

551
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,239
How do you plead?

552
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,479
You can make any accusation against me.

553
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,239
Your Highness,

554
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,800
you are wise.

555
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,160
Do you believe her provocative remark

556
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
and doubt my loyalty?

557
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,400
Over the years,

558
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
you served His Majesty

559
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,959
and supervised the Imperial Food Service

560
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,800
wholeheartedly.

561
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,520
Your Highness.

562
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,400
However, you peeped at His Majesty
and talked about an upheaval.

563
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,400
You were out of line

564
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,359
and you cannot be forgiven.

565
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,839
By the rules of the palace,

566
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,239
you're no longer a matron.

567
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Receive your punishment
at the Palace Surveillance.

568
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
You're on your own from now on.

569
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I bid farewell.

570
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,119
Take care, Your Highness.

571
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,280
Congratulations.

572

Matron Meng.

573
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
You're not a matron anymore.

574
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,959
How should I address you?

575
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm curious.

576
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
I trust you and give you important work.

577
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,640
Why did you seek refuge from her?

578
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,479
I entered the palace when young.

579
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
We have been inseparable friends.

580
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,520
Later, we joined the Imperial Food Service.

581
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
You were domineering and suspicious.

582
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,439
You suppressed and evicted

583
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,199
anyone you disliked.

584
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,640
To fool you,

585
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
we pretended to be on bad terms.

586
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,319
Ten years.

587
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,719
You pretended for 10 years.

588
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
Impressive.

589
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,839
Wei.

590
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,920
Don't pity her.

591
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,360
I know.

592
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,959
Other than being domineering,

593
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
she was still fair.

594
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,360
But as long as she was there,

595
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,320
I'd never get promoted.

596
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,479
For 10 years,

597
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
she fooled everyone.

598
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,919
We are best friends,

599
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,320
but we had to pretend we aren't.

600
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That was hard.

601
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,439
From now on,

602
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,320
we don't have to do that anymore.

603
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,520

We're finally safe!

610
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,560
It's all right.

611
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,040
I was scared to death.

612
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,719
What happened?

613
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,320

some things,

644

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
I have no blessing.

648
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,439
They were all empty.

649

Serving Your Highness

650
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,040

651
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,479
It's you!

652

Why did you frame me?

653

We are not enemies.

Why...

655
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,280
It's a fair trade.

656
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,600
You did something for me,

657
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,679
and I gave you the menu
from the Directorate for Palace Delicacies.

658

Do you know

659
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,600
that I became a murderer because of you?

660
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,479
It was your fault.

661

Stay away.

Are you asking for trouble?

666
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,800
Just like your mother who murdered someone.

667
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,080
My mother is not a murderer!

will anyone understand?

that this mistake

00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,520
would cost a life.
