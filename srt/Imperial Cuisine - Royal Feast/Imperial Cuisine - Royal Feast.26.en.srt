00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,680
I think

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,239
that she should be conferred the title
of the Crown Prince's Concubine

5
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,919
so that

6
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,440
she can accompany Zhanji forever

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,959
and assist him.

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,080
Father,

9
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,800
if you think highly of her,

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,279
let her stay in the Imperial Food Service

11
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,720
to cook for you without any distraction.

12
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,000
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,239
Your Majesty said

14
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,919
that the child looked familiar.

15
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,520
She was chosen by the Late Emperor

16
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,479
to be the Great Imperial Grandson's Concubine
for Zhanji.

17
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,679
Of course, she looks familiar.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
So, it is her.

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,559
Mother.

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,039
You promised me.

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,479
Your Majesty finally remembered.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Actually,

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
I should have informed Your Majesty earlier.

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,199
However, this child is very stubborn.

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,639
So, I sent her

26
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,520
to the Imperial Food Service

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,759
to temper her.

28
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,839
By a strange twist of fate,

29
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,399
I nearly ruined her.

30
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,080
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,399
Observe courtesy in the royal presence.

32
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,160
I have enough people to serve me.

33
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,479
You should let me

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,880
choose who I want.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
Moreover,

36
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,320
I don't like her.

37
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,639
Zhanji,

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,639
the Late Emperor always loved you.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,479
You never disobeyed

40
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,960
his orders.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,759
The Late Emperor

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
couldn't be wrong.

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Alright.

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,600
Well said.

45
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,080
This is a match made in heaven.

46
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,520
No wonder

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
she looked familiar.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,639
Since it was a match chosen by the Late Emperor,

49
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,880
we should

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
choose an auspicious date
to bestow the title on her.

51
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,759
Yes.

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
No, Father.

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,639
I feel a tightness in my chest
after talking so much.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,399
Leave.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,279
Father.

56
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,479
Your Majesty.

57
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,759
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,600
You have a disharmony in the body.

59
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,919
I'll worry about you

60
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,279
if I go back now.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,919
Let me take care of you.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Congratulations.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
You may leave.

64
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,600
Mother,

65
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,880
you promised

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,279
that you wouldn't bring this up again.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,399
Why did you rake up the past?

68
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
Honestly, do you dislike her?

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
Should I pick a flower

70
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,480
simply because I like it?

71
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,160
Why can't I leave it in the garden

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
to bloom freely?

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
You tried your best to procrastinate

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,519
because you want to protect her.

75
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,679
However, we both know

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,679
that in the imperial family,

77
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,720
she was already chosen for the title.

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,119
It's just a matter of time.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,679
You saw it with your own eyes.

80
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,239
Your father's health is deteriorating.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,559
Yet, he still worries about you.

82
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,959
Do you have the heart
to reject his good intention?

83
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,239
Permit me to leave.

84
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,760
Since small, he doesn't have to

85
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,040
say what he wants.

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
If he

87
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,000
takes a look at something,

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,679
and people will kneel and present it at his feet.

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,200
Everything under heaven

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,399
is his to take,

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,239
not just one flower,

92
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,000
but

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,079
the whole garden.

94
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,519
I'd never

95
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,399
heard him talk like this.

96
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Send a secret letter to inform Le'an Prefecture

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
about what happened in the palace today.

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,679
Yes.

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,959
Leave us first.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes.

101
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,640
I've done what you told me

102
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,679
to do.

103
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,799
His Majesty is having a relapse.

104
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,320
This is a great crime
punishable by nine kinship exterminations.

105
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,440
If His Majesty falls seriously ill

106
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,040
and news of the Crown Prince's disaffection

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
reaches Le'an Prefecture,

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,760
what do you think

109
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,720
the ambitious Prince of Han

110
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,079
will do?

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,959
Are you plotting a rebellion?

112
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,440
Wrong.

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,679
The Prince of Han is plotting one.

114
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,160
What does that

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
have to do with you?

116
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,200
What?

117
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,519
Are you scared?

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,440
In the Forbidden City,

119
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,880
the only person who cared about me

120
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,600
was gone.

121
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,519
I don't care about

122
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,559
any subversion.

123
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,519
However, I don't understand this.

124
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,040
You are in a high position despite your age,

125
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,079
and His Majesty

126
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,320
trusts and relies on you.

127
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,440
What more do you want?

128
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,519
You mean,

129
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,679
I should spend my life being the Emperor's lackey

130
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,040
and be ordered around at will?

131
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,279
Zhu Zhanji might not be able

132
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,320
to take this.

133
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,399
Here.

134
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,519
Noodles.

135
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,359
Yin Ziping.

136
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,119
I heard that dumplings and noodles

137
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,440
are offered before and after
going onto the bridal sedan chair.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,280
I'd never heard about

139
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,320
eating noodles before getting married.

140
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,039
Can't bear to part?

141
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,119
A bit.

142
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,719
Zijin.

143
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,359
My mother said

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
that music, weiqi, calligraphy, painting,

145
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,280
needlework, and cooking were tools.

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,679
All tools are dispensable.

147
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,119
Is there anything that we shouldn't part with?

148
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,239
The Avataṃsaka Sutra says

149
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,880
that those who remember their initial resolve

150
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,719
in the past, present, and future
will be protected by Buddha.

151
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,280
My mother said

152
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,559
that I must adhere to my initial resolve.

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,119
I don't understand.

154
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,599
I know.

155
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,799
Ziping,

156
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,880
a fortuneteller told me

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,679
that I'd be
the Great Imperial Grandson's Consort.

158
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
It was heaven's will.

159
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,280
Later, he said
that someone else would be the consort

160
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,559
and I didn't have such great blessings.

161
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't care,

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,359
but I refuse to give in.

163
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,239
Even if fate repeatedly taunt me,

164
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,520
I will still challenge fate.

165
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,359
Moreover,

166
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,320
China is a big country and has many talents.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,840
I am not indispensable in the kitchen.

168
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,919
A cook tosses with her hand
and takes charge in the kitchen.

169
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,599
My right hand is not good anymore.

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,280
I'll go where I'm needed

171
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,520
and do what I do best.

172
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,440
Are you still thinking about Consort Zhuang?

173
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,200
Don't think about it or touch it.

174
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,799
That's the ancestral system.

175
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,799
Who says the system can't be changed?

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,039
You are

177
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,599
an insignificant Crown Prince's Concubine.

178
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,280
Who said that I'd be a concubine

179
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
forever?

180
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,520
You!

181
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,119
Ziping,

182
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,200
someone won't let me hide

183
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
or dodge.

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,679
Well then,

185
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,760
I will not hide or dodge.

186
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,880
Even the families of rebellious ministers

187
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,679
could be released.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,280
Is there anything

189
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
that one cannot achieve under heaven?

190
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
Hold it.

191
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,119
Your Highness.

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,479
Your Highness, don't worry.

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,520
The wound

194
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
will heal after you rest

195
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,400
for seven or eight days.

196
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,239
Sheng Yin,

197
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,799
His Majesty has a relapse.

198
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
His condition is serious.

199
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,679
Tomorrow,

200
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,239
go to the Qianqing Palace with me

201
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:25,880
and diagnose him.

202
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,760
This...

203
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Leave us.

204
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,599
Yes.

205
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,080
Your Highness,

206
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,400
I won't be able to do anything.

207
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
His Majesty hates me intensely.

208
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,719
He will never let me

209
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,000
treat him.

210
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,280
His Majesty

211
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,760
will not hold grudges against you

212
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,359
for treating my mother before.

213
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,359
It's not just that.

214
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,239
I...

215
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,479
I got drunk once

216
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,799
and joked with my colleagues.

217
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,119
I don't know how,

218
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,760
but His Majesty

219
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,640
heard about it in the Eastern Palace.

220
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,359
My father is magnanimous and gentle.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,039
He is rarely angry with his officials.

222
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
What did you say

223
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,479
to make my father hate you to this day?

224
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,440
For a physician,

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,520
diagnosing by looking is more important than

226
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,919
smelling, listening, and feeling the pulse.

227
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,440
By looking at a patient,

228
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,479
I can tell about his internal organs

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,080
and his illness.

230
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,760
Don't worry.

231
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,119
You can tell me.

232
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
His Majesty

233
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,919
doesn't have the look of longevity.

234
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,919
Presumptuous!

235
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,719
Your Highness,

236
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,520
it's getting late. You should sleep.

237
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,200
Get out.

238
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,479
Leave us first.

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
His Majesty refuses to see me.

240
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:12,840
I do not know

241
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,799
what I've done wrong.

242
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,239
Aren't you

243
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,719
good at giving advice?

244
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,320
Why are you so quiet now?

245
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,760
Your Highness.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
This isn't

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,400
the time to worry about His Majesty's favor.

248
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,559
A disaster

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,159
is approaching.

250
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,359
You mean...

251
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
It's impossible.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
His Majesty is in his prime

253
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
and is deeply blessed.

254
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,159
He'll be back to normal soon.

255
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,239
Your Highness,

256
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,000
how are His Majesty's complexion and gait today

257
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,320
compared to before?

258
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,280
Safety can become a danger,
and blessings, misfortune.

259
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,679
You are smart.

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Must I remind you?

261
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,840
I wish His Majesty a speedy recovery

262
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,840
so that he can comfort Your Highness.

263
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,599
If not,

264
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,000
Your Highness

265
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,039
should take precautions early.

266
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,520
Kneel.

267
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,599
First bow.

268
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,599
Rise.

269
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,479
Second bow.

270
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Rise.

271
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,479
Third bow.

272
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,119
Rise.

273
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Fourth bow.

274
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,239
Stand up.

275
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,719
Crown Prince's Concubine,

276
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,680
this is against etiquette.

277
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,359
The Crown Prince personally sent you back.

278
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,920
He doesn't want you to feel insulted.

279
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,199
Mother thinks the people in my palace are clumsy,

280
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,400
and especially gave you these people

281
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,079
to take care of your daily needs.

282
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,400
These brocades, hairpieces, and bracelets

283
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,280
are my gifts.

284
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,040
Please accept them.

285
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I thank the Crown Princess for your kindness.

286
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,599
You are now in the Eastern Palace

287
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,119
and therefore we are sisters.

288
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,719
You don't have to be so courteous.

289
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,959
You must be tired from the greeting ceremony.

290
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,560
Go back and rest early.

291
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,959
Take good care

292
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,560
of the Crown Prince's Concubine.

293
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,319
Yes.

294
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,575
[Xingyun Cottage]

295
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,680
Your Highness.

296
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Your Highness.

297
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm not deaf.

298
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,000
Your Highness,

299
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,520
the Crown Prince's Concubine

300
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,319
is waiting for you in the hall at this moment.

301
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:43,880
Your Highness.

302
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,640
Your Highness.

303
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,599
What is it?

304
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
Your Highness, where are you going?

305
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
The Crown Prince's Concubine is still waiting.

306
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,760
Has your injury healed?

307
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,800
I have been lying down for too long.

308
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,160
My arms have become weak.

309
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
If I don't get up and about,

310
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,280
I won't be able to draw the bow anymore.

311
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,880
Why is Your Highness here?

312
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,359
Good wine!

313
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,119
Officer You is drinking alone under the moon.

314
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
Too bad that the bright moon
doesn't know how to drink.

315
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,239
Let me

316
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,920
be your drinking buddy.

317
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Highness, you cannot drink.

318
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,119
Your injury hasn't healed.

319
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,239
People say Shaojiu is a strong liquor

320
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,400
and one shouldn't drink too much.

321
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,400
You should drink Shaoxing rice wine
if you're alone.

322
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,439
However,

323
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,239
it is rare to meet like-minded people.

324
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,040
I like it.

325
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,520
Your Highness.

326
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
You can't get drunk tonight.

327
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,400
My courtesy name is Yunzhou.

328
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,400
Great.

329
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,479
Yunzhou.

330
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,359
At the Lantern Festival Banquet,

331
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,479
you displayed exceptional martial arts skills.

332
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,439
Let's have a friendly match.

333
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,199
Your Highness.

334
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,319
I won't dare.

335
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,119
Your Highness, be careful.

336
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:30,800
Again.

337
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,640
I have read your memorials.

338
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,280
How dare you?

339
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:02,959
Your Highness.

340
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,400
Your old wound has reopened again.

341
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,760
What should I do?

342
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,079
I was rude.

343
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,280
Your Highness, please forgive me.

344
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,599
It was just a friendly match.

345
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,439
Swords have no eyes.

346
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,520
How can I blame you?

347
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,239
Stand up.

348
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,439
Your Highness is magnanimous.

349
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,719
I am forever grateful.

350
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,880
Didn't you say...

351
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,160
I said I read

352
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,239
your memorials.

353
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,239
Since taking office,

354
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
you've submitted countless memorials

355
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,719
to my grandfather and His Majesty

356
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,599
about salt administration,

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,719
water transport of tribute grain,

358
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,719
tax law,

359
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
sea ​​defense,

360
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,079
and military affairs.

361
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
Every word was precious

362
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,319
and drove straight to the point.

363
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,359
Unfortunately,

364
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,319
these memorials

365
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,439
were thrown aside

366
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,199
and weren't taken seriously.

367
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,839
We are two patients

368
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
who couldn't fight to our hearts' content.

369
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
When your injury heals,

370
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,160
we'll fight again.

371
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,479
Yes.

372
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,959
Sir,

373
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,520
you are also injured.

374
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
Are you alright?

375
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,719
Sir.

376
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,319
Sir!

377
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:55,800
Sir!

378
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,680
It is late.

379
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Where are you going?

380
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm going to take a walk.

381
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,199
Eunuch Chen,

382
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,160
why is His Highness not here yet?

383
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Please inform the Crown Prince's Concubine

384
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,239
that His Highness's wound reopened

385
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,160
in a sword practice tonight.

386
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm afraid he can't come.

387
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,160
The Crown Prince's Concubine should rest early.

388
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,800
Your Highness,

389
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,119
you shouldn't do this.

390
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,280
Don't worry,

391
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,199
His Highness will be back soon.

392
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,800
His Majesty is not feeling well.

393
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,880
The Crown Prince
has always been sincere and filial.

394
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,040
He'll be worried sick.

395
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,560
At this moment,

396
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,760
he is not in the mood to have a concubine.

397
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,719
He won't come.

398
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,040
You all get some rest.

399
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,880
I said don't fight,

400
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,560
but you insisted.

401
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,280
Imperial Physician Sheng advised you

402
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,239
not to practice swords and spears.

403
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,359
You also drank wine.

404
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
Imperial Physician Sheng,

405
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,160
is he alright?

406
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,359
This is great.

407
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
You have to rest for a while again.

408
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,839
You Yifan is in deep trouble.

409
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,880
Seriously, Your Highness.

410
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,359
He knows

411
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,439
you are still recovering from a serious injury

412
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,800
but still had a friendly match with you.

413
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,560
When Her Majesty returns to the palace,

414
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,079
I will report to her

415
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,239
and he'll be punished severely.

416
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,719
None of your business.

417
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,680
Permit me to leave now.

418
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,079
Your Highness,

419
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,239
you should rest.

420
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,000
Bring me my book.

421
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,640
It's late.

422
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:12,040
Your Highness, I informed her.

423
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,199
Is she angry?

424
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,959
No.

425
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,760
Did she say anything?

426
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,400
Nothing.

427
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,920
Not even a single word?

428
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,040
Your Highness,

429
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,160
she endured the complicated ceremony
of conferring

430
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,079
the title of Crown Prince's Concubine
for days on end.

431
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,319
She has lost weight.

432
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,719
She won't be able to stay awake

433
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,079
and wait for you the whole night.

434
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,280
That's why she slept.

435
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,000
What do you know?

436
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,400
Don't talk nonsense.

437
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,280
If His Highness doesn't go back,

438
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,640
she has to stay awake

439
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,839
until the next day regardless.

440
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,760
Your Highness.

441
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,599
Your... Your Highness!

442
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:05,920
Leave.

443
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,959
I thought you'd give me the cold shoulder.

444
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,199
Instead,

445
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
you didn't even look at me.

446
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,479
Why do you keep staring at me and laughing?

447
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,199
Your Highness,

448
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,439
did you sleep well last night?

449
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,600
Last night?

450
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,679
In the Eastern Palace, you have

451
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,159
the highest status after the Crown Princess.

452
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,959
The others should come to greet you.

453
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,000
I've instructed the Imperial Food Service

454
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to prepare a small feast.

455
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,800
Jin,

456
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,320
you served Consort Zhuang

457
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,360
in the past.

458
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,000
Now, Her Majesty tells you to serve me.

459
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,560
Don't you feel insulted?

460
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,000
Your Highness,

461
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,080
no one wanted to help my mistress back then.

462
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,800
Had you not lent her a hand,

463
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,520
she might not die in peace.

464
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,360
I will always remember your kindness.

465
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:56,879
Her Majesty

466
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,159
wanted to send someone to the Eastern Palace,

467
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,159
and I volunteered for the assignment.

468
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,000
I will do my best

469
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,280
to perform any chores you have.

470
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
It's getting late.

471
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,159
I will get everything ready.

472
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
It may not be what you expect.

473
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,280
Nothing. You may go.

474
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes.

475
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:52,919
Your Highness,

476
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,159
it's ready.

477
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,239
Jin.

478
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,679
Yes.

479
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,399
All of you may leave.

480
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes.

481
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,280
Sit here.

482
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,479
Being the mistress is different.

483
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,800
This is much better than
in the Imperial Food Service.

484
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,439
However, it is rude for me to sit here.

485
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,560
What should I do

486
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,479
if His Highness finds out?

487
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,080
He hasn't been here yet.

488
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:42,639
He hasn't been here?

489
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,679
That's not possible.

490
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,879
He didn't come to you

491
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,959
and you didn't go to him?

492
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,560
Haven't you reconciled yet?

493
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,080
I know.

494
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
What do you know?

495
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,959
You blamed Her Majesty
for forcing you to enter the palace.

496
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,280
Consequently, you hate the Crown Prince.

497
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,239
That's why you promised to marry him.

498
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,360
You will spend your whole life

499
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,520
torturing him.

500
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,439
Am I right?

501
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,199
I can't sit here.

502
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,360
In a while, when the concubines
of the Eastern Palace

503
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,320
come to greet you,

504
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,199
It'll be disrespectful if I sit here.

505
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,120
Sit there.

506
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,080
Your Highness.

507
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,479
Today...

508
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,320
There's no need to wait.

509
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,320
Today,

510
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,520
you'll eat with me.

511
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,800
How dare they give you a cold shoulder!

512
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
They've gone too far.

513
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,919
Your oil was too hot

514
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,919
when you fried the dough.

515
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,239
How can that be?

516
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,679
It's fragrant and crispy.

517
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,719
I fried it.

518
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,325
[Xunchong Pancake]

519
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,919
Don't try to talk your way out.

520
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,439
Manager Yin.

521
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,199
Manager Yin.

522
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,199
You must personally handle the puffer fish

523
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,919
that the Court of Imperial Entertainments
brings in.

524
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,159
Don't let other people do it.

525
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,320
Her Majesty

526
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,560
doesn't like asparagus soup.

527
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,800
Change it to burclover soup instead.

528
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,800
Cook more napa cabbage

529
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,280
and Indian wormwood herb.

530
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,439
Always be kind and gentle

531
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,080
to palace maids.

532
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't order them around

533
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,239
or they will hate you.

534
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,520
In my absence,

535
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,719
be on guard against Yuehua.

536
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,560
Don't worry.

537
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,159
However,

538
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
you must find a way

539
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,320
to attract the Crown Prince.

540
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,000
To get a permanent foothold
in the Eastern Palace,

541
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
I must be careful of every one of

542
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,719
His Highness's consorts and concubines.

543
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,000
However...

544
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,679
Crown Princess,

545
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:44,879
none of them

546
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,360
greeted the Crown Prince's Concubine.

547
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,159
Miaoxian,

548
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,199
haven't you

549
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,360
greeted the Crown Prince's Concubine today?

550
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:53,760
Crown Princess,

551
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,399
according to rules,

552
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,120
we should greet the new Crown Prince's Concubine,

553
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,840
but...

554
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,000
This year's asparagus

555
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,159
don't look very tender.

556
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:02,879
Miaoxian,

557
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
early next morning,

558
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,760
go and ask for her forgiveness.

559
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,760
Do you hear me?

560
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,719
Crown Princess Sister,

561
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,479
I didn't mean to be rude.

562
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,239
I can't bear

563
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,560
the smell of smoke on her.

564
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,120
What smell?

565
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,239
She cooked in the kitchen all day long.

566
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,399
She smelled of lard and fish.

567
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,760
Who dares to approach her?

568
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,560
Perhaps His Highness

569
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
is very displeased with her also.

570
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,360
On the day the title was conferred upon her,

571
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,479
he didn't spend the night with her.

572
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
I should be slapped.

573
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,959
Is it true that the Crown Prince

574
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,439
did not spend the night with her?

575
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,639
His Majesty and Her Majesty

576
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,719
showed her all the kindness.

577
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,080
I thought she must be

578
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
an amazing person.

579
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,719
Who would have guessed
that she entered the Eastern Palace

580
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,000
and went right into "the cold cellar"?

581
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,760
Just now I saw the maids

582
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
opening the cellar to air the peony.

583
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,399
I wonder when will the Crown Prince

584
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,239
remember

585
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,439
the Crown Prince's Concubine

586
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:55,840
and ask her to get some air?

587
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,360
Things get rancid after being kept for too long.

588
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,879
His Highness' injury reopened.

589
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,199
That was why

590
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,639
he didn't go to the Xinuan Pavilion.

591
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,760
You mustn't be rude

592
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
to her because of this.

593
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,840
Neither should you

594
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,159
disturb His Highness when he is recovering.

595
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,120
You, in particular,

596
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,199
should not fool around,

597
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,600
or I won't let you off lightly.

598
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,239
Yes.

599
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,439
A while ago,

600
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,360
I made a new incense.

601
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
It can help you sleep.

602
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,399
Can it?

603
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,679
Come and visit me one day.

604
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,199
Who said the Crown Prince's Concubine
was not favored?

605
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,479
We should go and greet her.

606
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,560
Did she accept?

607
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,080
Yes.

608
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,320
What did she say?

609
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,639
What else can she say?

610
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,239
She expressed 1,000 thanks and 1,000 gratitudes.

611
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,639
I didn't witness that.

612
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:10,360
You didn't?

613
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:11,879
Then...

614
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,479
The Crown Prince presented gifts
to the Crown Prince's Concubine

615
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,199
to openly dote on her.

616
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,800
Had the Crown Prince's Concubine known,

617
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,239
she'd thank him profusely.

618
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,760
However, I went at the wrong time.

619
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,760
I was afraid that Your Highness
would be worried sick waiting.

620
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,080
So, I came back to report.

621
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,120
Had the Crown Prince's Concubine known,

622
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,399
she would come

623
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,399
to specially express her gratitude.

624
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,280
Your Highness,

625
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,479
you haven't gone to thank His Highness.

626
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:49,639
That is improper.

627
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,080
If His Highness finds out

628
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,760
and gets mad,

629
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:53,719
then...

630
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:56,719
After I reapplied my makeup,

631
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,399
two hours would have passed

632
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:02,879
and the palace commissioner
would be waiting outside.

633
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,919
If people heard about that,

634
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,080
they'd think I was disrespectful.

635
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,439
I can only blame

636
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,959
the gifts for arriving at the wrong time.

637
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,280
Did I come at the wrong time also?

638
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:19,719
Your Highness.

639
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,280
Jin, my clothes.

640
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,199
Yes.

641
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,800
Go out.

642
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:23,879
Don't touch.

643
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,679
Yes.

644
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,199
Jin!

645
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,320
Your Highness.

646
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,919
Please wait in the outer hall.

647
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:37,719
I'll be there to greet you soon.

648
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,040
I have something to ask you.

649
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,919
I'll leave after asking.

650
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,560
What do you want to ask?

651
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:45,199
Your Highness.

652
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,280
I don't want to ask anything now.

653
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,479
I'm staying here tonight.

654
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,800
Get ready.

655
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,120
Jin.

656
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,679
Jin!

657
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:58,360
Jin!

658
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,399
Your Highness has not healed fully.

659
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,159
The imperial physician admonished you

660
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,399
to rest properly.

661
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,199
If

662
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,040
I let Your Highness stay overnight,

663
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,280
tomorrow Her Majesty will call me over

664
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
and rebuke me.

665
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,479
Do not worry.

666
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,520
Mother won't blame you.
