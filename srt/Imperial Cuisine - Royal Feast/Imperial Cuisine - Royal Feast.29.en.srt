[Episode 29]

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,599
Is he still kneeling outside?

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,959
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
His Highness hasn't eaten all day.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Please talk to him.

00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:15,875
[Glutinous Millet Dumpling]

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,039
I'm here to pay my respect, Your Highness.

9
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
That woman tried to harm the Empress.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can never pardon her.

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,360
So don't speak of it.

12
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,759
You refuse to eat.

13
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,479
Her Majesty is concerned about you.

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,160
Everyone at the Imperial Food Service is fearful.

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,600
If you're not willing to have this plain congee,

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,240
how about trying
the glutinous millet dumpling I made?

17
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,559
Leave us.

18
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,639
Your Highness,

19
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,679
Matron Meng is a witness

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,119
to the incident at Yongning Palace.

21
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,479
Crown Prince's Concubine,
please speak with discretion.

22
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,559
I...

23
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,279
The Imperial Food Service provided
all the drinks for the banquet.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,320
If Lady Guo brought in poison,

25
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,639
how could it slip from Matron Meng's eyes?

26
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,320
If Matron Meng knows about this,

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
why did she keep quiet about it?

28
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:29,880
As to what had happened,

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,559
who should we ask

30
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,160
if not you?

31
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,960
Speak.

32
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,800
Your Highness,

33
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,360
Noble Consort Guo did have the intention
to take Her Majesty's life.

34
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,119
But as the person in charge
of the Imperial Food Service,

35
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,919
how could I do something like this?

36
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,000
So I reported this matter to Her Majesty.

37
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,199
Then,

38
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
His Majesty suddenly arrived that day

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,479
and failed to stop him from taking the cup.

40
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,720
Her Majesty knocked over the wine cup.

41
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,399
That's how His Majesty found out
Noble Consort Guo poisoned the wine.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,479
His Majesty was extremely angry,

43
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,759
and so his disease suddenly worsened.

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
When the imperial physician arrived,

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,440
he was unable to save the situation.

46
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,000
Who was the imperial physician?

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Your Highness,

48
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,440
it was Imperial Physician Sheng.

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
Summon forth, Sheng Yin.

50
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,920
Yes, Your Highness.

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Your humble servant is here
to pay his respect to Your Highness.

52
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,359
I wasn't at Yongning Palace that day.

53
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:48,079
When I rushed to Qianqing Palace
to treat His Majesty,

54
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,839
it was already too late.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,679
Imperial Physician Sheng is skilled
in the art of healing.

56
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,959
Since the day of His Majesty's demise,

57
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,640
you've been staying in His Majesty's chambers

58
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,880
to keep the truth from going out.

59
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,200
Aren't you curious

60
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,640
how His Majesty died?

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,359
I...

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,040
I'm not a coroner.

63
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,200
I want to hear the truth.

64
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,359
Your Highness,
Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified states

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
any victims who died from poisoned

66
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,559
usually have their mouths and eyes opened.

67
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,480
The face would look purplish or bluish.

68
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,640
The lips would be dark.

69
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,920
The toenails and fingernails
would look bluish-black.

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
There will be blood
from the mouths, eyes, ears, and nose.

71
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,359
To stop the smell of the corpse from getting out

72
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,200
and startling the people,

73
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,040
I've taken care of His Majesty's body.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
His Majesty's lips may look bluish
and bloated on his lower limbs.

75
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,160
But there weren't any symptoms of being poisoned.

76
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
In that case,

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,079
Father found out
Noble Consort Guo poisoned the wine.

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,440
So he had a heart attack from being angered?

79
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,760
I heard

80
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,200
on the day of Her Majesty's birthday banquet,

81
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,920
Censor-in-Chief Li Shimian submitted
a memorial and discussed state affairs

82
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,519
and infuriated His Majesty.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,959
He was sent to prison on the spot.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,239
Why didn't you report this to me?

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,799
Your Highness,

86
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,320
Official Li talked back
at His Majesty's defiantly.

87
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,559
His Majesty was furious

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,799
and ordered the palace guard to break his ribs.

89
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,399
Fortunately, he's still alive.

90
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,440
He's still in prison now.

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,040
No one dares to mention this matter after that

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,239
for fear Your Highness might be upset.

93
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,519
What exactly did he say

94
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,079
to upset Father that much?

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,239
Well,

96
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,359
I don't know.

97
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,679
Order the imperial bodyguard to bring him here.

98
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,119
I want to ask him in person.

99
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,160
Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:39,920
Your Highness,

101
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,839
His Majesty wasn't poisoned

102
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,559
but had relapsed from anger.

103
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,399
Prince of Wei hasn't eaten

104
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,959
and has been kneeling outside all day.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,799
Give this to him.

106
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,519
Also,

107
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,040
send some of his favorite
glutinous millet dumplings.

108
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,959
Father had always been kind.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,399
Even if the officials talked back at him,

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,839
he never criticized them harshly.

111
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,519
Li Shimian has suffered such harsh punishment.

112
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,239
I'm certain he's guilty beyond forgiveness.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,839
No need to bring him here.

114
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,040
Execute him.

115
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,600
Yes, Your Highness.

116
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,239
Your Highness.

117
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,119
[Li Shimian, Censor-in-Chief]
A sinner is here to pay respect, Your Highness.

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,920
Didn't I say to execute this man?

119
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,959
Your Highness, please calm down.

120
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,359
Commander Wang must have departed

121
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,359
from the west gate with the second edict,

122
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,200
while the ones who brought
Li Shimian must have come from the east gate.

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,679
As they come and go,

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
they've missed out on each other.

125
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,839
Li Shimian,

126
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,399
do you know the unforgivable crime
you've committed?

127
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
Are you deaf?

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,160
How did you behave defiantly
towards His Majesty that day?

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,799
Tell the truth.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
If you want to live,

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,559
you can only say these two sentences

132
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,320
when you meet the Crown Prince.

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
I said

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,239
His Majesty shouldn't be closed
to the concubines during mourning.

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
The Crown Prince shouldn't be away from his side.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,280
Just these two?

137
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
Yes, I spoke of nothing else.

138
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,760
It's just...

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,119
I wasn't articulate

140
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,200
and used the wrong choice of words,

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,039
which annoyed

142
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,880
and offended His Majesty.

143
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,679
I regretted my action.

144
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,719
You were just being frank.

145
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
A loyal official indeed.

146
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,919
Where's the memorial, then?

147
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,479
His Majesty was furious at the time

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
and burned it.

149
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,359
Burned?

150
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,719
Yes.

151
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,799
You can leave now.

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,719
Thank you for your mercy, Your Highness.

153
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,239
Your Highness,

154
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,159
His Majesty has passed away.

155
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,880
Concubines are to be buried along with him.

156
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
How many nameless palace maids will be buried?

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
The people follow the examples
of the imperial household.

158
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,640
Burying people alive is getting
more and more serious.

159
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,119
Can't you...

160
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:00,960
Zijin,

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
this is the ancestral instructions.

162
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,200
Can't ancestral instructions

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
be amended?

164
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,840
Only Noble Consort Guo

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,359
has three sons.

166
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
She's exempted from the sacrificial burial.

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,159
The crime of plotting poison

168
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,520
shall be dealt with

169
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
after the funeral.

170
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,679
This is great! It's great!

171
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,559
My mother doesn't have to die anymore.

172
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
My mother is saved!

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:45,799
Prince of Wei!

174
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,400
-My mother is saved!
-Prince of Wei!

175
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,799
-That's great!
-Be careful!

176
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,239
-Prince of Wei!
-My mother is saved!

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,799
-Prince of Wei!
-My mother is saved!

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,400
-It's great!
-Slow down!

179
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,080
Be careful!

180
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,919
Her means are impressive.

181
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,039
She's still too young.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,239
Your Majesty, His Highness has exempted
Noble Consort Guo from the burial.

183
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,919
Your Highness.

184
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,280
Your Highness, His Highness has exempted you
from the burial.

185
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,119
What's today's dish?

186
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,280
It's chamomile cold noodles.

187
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,725
[Chamomile Cold Noodles]

188
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,599
(A handful of picked chamomile leaves)

189
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,200
(with the morning dew washed away.)

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,280
(Wring the extract and add it into the flour.)

191
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,640
(Knead well and roll the dough thinly.)

192
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,039
(They're cut with a silver knife.)

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,039
(They're boiled and rinsed in cold spring water.)

194
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,960
(Such green noodles are more fragrant)

195
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,200
(than fragrant thoroughwort and sweet flag.)

196
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,719
How nice.

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,039
It tastes exactly like the ones
my grandmother made.

198
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,479
How nice.

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,840
Your Highness,

200
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,039
are you thinking about Lady Yan?

201
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,000
Lady Yan?

202
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,119
When my grandfather was alive,
he helped Jianwen Emperor to attack Prince of Yan

203
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,559
and almost got himself killed.

204
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,559
After that, the Guo family fell.

205
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,119
He had dozens of wives and concubines
and dozens of sons.

206
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,280
My father was sickly.

207
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,840
No one took care of us.

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
My father was critically ill once.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,159
I kneeled in the mansion for two days.

210
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,479
It was my grandmother
who carried me back on her back.

211
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,960
She pawned off her winter clothes

212
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,479
to buy medicinal herbs for my father.

213
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,200
At night,

214
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,479
I saw my grandmother crying
with her back against everyone.

215
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,479
Do you know why?

216
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,239
She cut off her long hair to sell it.

217
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,239
But no one wanted to buy it

218
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,440
because she was prematurely aged

219
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
and her hair had turned gray.

220
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,840
She cried because she could save her son's life

221
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,280
even after she had cut off her hair.

222
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,159
After that,

223
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,400
I took the initiative to enter
the Eastern Palace.

224
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
I've been walking
on eggshells anxiously for 20 years.

225
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,599
I don't ask that the Guo family prosper forever.

226
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,320
I only want my grandmother
to spend her remaining years in peace.

227
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,320
I want them to remember

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,400
that I gave them their glory and wealth.

229
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
I want them to hold

230
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,599
my grandmother in high regard.

231
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,239
I want them to revere the concubine

232
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,159
whom everyone despised.

233
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,039
Twenty years.

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,760
It's been 20 years.

235
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,159
Just one step.

236
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
Just one step away.

237
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
Your Highness,

238
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,599
Prince of Wei has been kneeling outside all day.

239
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,039
His Highness, the Crown Prince, has told him
to go back and rest.

240
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,159
He'll come to pay his respect to you tomorrow.

241
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,760
You can finally reunite.

242
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,640
Why did you help me?

243
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,760
Sacrificial burial is cruel.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,359
I want to help as many as I can.

245
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,440
You're a kindhearted

246
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
and smart person.

247
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,159
Remember this.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,559
There's a long journey ahead of you.

249
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,640
You must live.

250
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,559
Your Highness,

251
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,559
please get some rest.

252
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,039
I'll bring Prince of Wei
to pay you a respect tomorrow.

253
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:03,960
Your Highness,

254
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,760
don't you blame me at all?

255
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,839
You were from Kunning Palace in the first place.

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,199
Why would I blame you?

257
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,000
Your Highness,

258
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,599
I may be from Kunning Palace.

259
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,599
But I never had any intention to harm you.

260
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
I was afraid of being implicated.

261
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,560
I was just scared...

262
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,839
His Highness has promised
to spare Noble Consort Guo.

263
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,560
You don't have to be scared anymore.

264
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Come, comb my hair.

265
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,439
Your Highness,

266
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,000
Noble Consort Guo...

267
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,520
She hung herself

268
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,119
and had gone with His Majesty.

269
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,319
-Your Highness, you can't go in.
-Mother.

270
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,719
-Your Highness, please go back.
-Mother!

271
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,959
You shouldn't come here.

272
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,760
-Your Highness, please go back.
-Mother!

273
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,479
-Shan.
-Your Highness.

274
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,800
Big Brother, why?

275
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,359
Mother has been pardoned.

276
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,640
But why?

277
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,479
It was my fault.

278
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,319
Big Brother, what should I do now?

279
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,880
Father and Mother are no longer here.

280
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,439
What would happen to me after this?

281
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,239
Rest assured.

282
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,479
I'm here, am I not?

283
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,119
As long as I'm here,

284
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,199
I won't let anyone harm you.

285
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,359
Send Prince of Wei back.

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,760
Yes, Your Highness.

287
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,640
Let's go, Your Highness.

288
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Your Highness, your edict has been sent
to Qingning Palace.

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,119
Why did Noble Consort Guo...

290
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
(In the sixth month of the first year
of Hongxi Reign,)

291
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,280
(the Crown Prince, Zhu Zhanji,
ascended the throne.)

292
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,040
(A general amnesty was proclaimed to the empire.)

293
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,959
(Empress Zhang is elevated to Empress Dowager.)

294
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,359
(The Crown Princess
of the Hu clan was made the Empress.)

295
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,359
(It's for the Great Ming's Xuande Emperor.)

296
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,839
-Long live Your Majesty!
-Long live Your Majesty!

297
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,079
Long live Your Majesty.

298
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,239
(Xuande Emperor has ascended the throne.)

299
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,199
[Qingning Gate]
(Empress Dowager moved back to Qingning Palace.)

300
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,839
Mother,

301
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,680
in terms of age, seniority, and family background,

302
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,160
the He clan is the most profound.

303
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,439
She's best to be appointed as a consort.

304
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,760
As for the positions of other concubines,
it's on this register.

305
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,839
What are your thoughts

306
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,280
on Lady Sun's position?

307
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,959
Sun is gentle, virtuous, and modest.

308
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
She's the most likable.

309
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,520
No one can be compared

310
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,040
to her position in His Majesty's heart.

311
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Her position

312
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,160
should be decided by Mother and His Majesty.

313
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,719
I wonder what position you would...

314
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,640
Is there anything else?

315
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
When Your Majesty ascended the throne,

316
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,839
Prince of Han and Prince of Zhao sent envoys
to offer their congratulations.

317
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,520
Your Majesty also doubled
their monetary rewards.

318
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,359
Such grace is unprecedented.

319
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:14,479
Prince of Han proposed to provide
the basic needs to benefit the people.

320
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,119
Your Majesty carried it out immediately.

321
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,880
You shouldn't treat these feudal lords

322
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
with ulterior motives with such generosity.

323
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,520
Is there something wrong
with Prince of Han's memorial?

324
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,359
It's relevant

325
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
to the empire and the people.

326
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Prince of Han has the courage to speak frankly

327
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,959
and lament the shortcomings of the times.

328
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,359
Every word is beneficial
to the people's livelihood.

329
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,920
I'd naturally accept his points.

330
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,119
My dear ministers,

331
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,760
Grandfather often told the Late Emperor and me

332
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
that we must take precautions

333
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,000
because my second uncle has an ulterior motive.

334
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,199
But the Late Emperor considered
their brotherly affection

335
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,119
and tolerated my second uncle.
It's all to repay evil with kindness.

336
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,880
But now, he has changed.

337
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,959
So I'll live up to the family relations
of the imperial household.

338
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,160
No one is allowed
to doubt my second uncle in the future.

339
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,280
Your Majesty is wise.

340
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,359
Shiqi.

341
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,520
Shiqi,

342
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,079
I think Prince of Han is trying
to sound out His Majesty.

343
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,079
He definitely harbors bad intentions.

344
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
You must warn His Majesty of this.

345
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,119
Don't underestimate
how ambitious Prince of Han is.

346
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,000
He's right.

347
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,199
Official Yang, why are you standing so far away?

348
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,000
Come and join us.

349
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,520
Sorry about that. My old sickness is relapsing.

350
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,599
Have you seen the bamboo forest His Majesty drew?

351
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,280
The strokes are broad and organized.

352
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,199
I'm sure

353
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,959
he knows how to draw.

354
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,000
-Yes.
-So, don't worry.

355
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,959
You really like joking. Come on, let's go.

356
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,520
Let's go.

357
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,880
Sir,

358
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,400
Prince of Han asked about His Majesty

359
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,199
in all his three letters.

360
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,560
How should we reply?

361
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,040
What do you think?

362
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,800
From what I see,

363
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,680
His Majesty ignored

364
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,439
the officials' criticisms against Prince of Han.

365
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,880
Instead, His Majesty praised
and rewarded the Prince of Han.

366
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,239
He even wrote a letter personally.

367
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,800
It can be seen that he wants
to win some good name

368
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,959
with kindness and generosity like
the Late Emperor.

369
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,959
After all, Prince of Han is his uncle.

370
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

371
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,199
I hope you can guide me.

372
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
You're right.

373
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,959
His Majesty is trying to win
this uncle to his side.

374
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,160
Someone from Zhangde is here too.

375
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,560
Please spare some time to meet him.

376
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,400
All right.

377
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,400
Prince of Han invites Father to rebel?

378
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:02,959
What did Father say?

379
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,959
His Lordship dare not agree to it easily.

380
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,319
So he ordered me to sneak into the capital

381
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,760
to ask for your advice.

382
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:29,640
Accept his offer.

383
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,319
What about the new emperor?

384
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,920
When Zhu Zhanji ascended the throne,

385
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,479
the imperial court and the empire may look calm.

386
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,560
In fact, the dark tide is surging.

387
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,680
To Father,

388
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,680
this is a good time to start his great cause.

389
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,280
Tell Father

390
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,319
that it's not the time yet.

391
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,079
Don't be impulsive.

392
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,760
Yes.

393
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,800
[Foods Office]
Greetings, Matron Meng.

394
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,319
The Empress Dowager had ordered

395
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,199
to restore the old system
in the early years of the Hongwu Reign.

396
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,959
She ordered me to take charge
of the affairs of the whole palace.

397
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,920
I'll be assisting the Empress Dowager
to reset the palace rules.

398
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,439
So I won't have time to manage
the Imperial Food Service.

399
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
For the time being,

400
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,959
everything here...

401
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,560
Hanying has been in the palace the longest

402
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:36,959
and has the most experience.

403
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,839
She's also the calmest.

404
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,719
You shall take charge.

405
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes, Matron Meng.

406
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,959
As for the selection of the matron,

407
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,119
I still need to think about it again.

408
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,119
During this time,

409
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
you must do your duty

410
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,520
and don't slack off.

411
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,280
Yes, Matron Meng.

412
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:07,920
Xiang Qin.

413
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,199
Isn't it just moving
from the Imperial Food Service

414
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,599
to the General Palace Service?

415
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,040
Silly,

416
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,560
the Imperial Food Service is only
in charge of food.

417
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,239
General Palace Service is
one of the six major services in the palace.

418
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,800
It controls the Records Office,
the Communications Office,

419
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,359
the Registration Office,
and the Inner Gates Office.

420
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,040
It's the head of all six services.

421
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,680
Every regulation, protocol,
food, clothes, and utensils used

422
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,760
must be reported to the matron
before being carried out.

423
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,719
Now, our Matron Meng is among the six services...

424
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean,

425
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,640
she should be the most powerful female official

426
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,400
in the Forbidden City.

427
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,040
You always lower your head
whenever you're here to pay your respects.

428
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,880
You look fearful.

429
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,520
Am I really that scary?

430
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,079
I wasn't.

431
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,359
Do you think

432
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,560
I was the one who forced Noble Consort Guo
to kill herself?

433
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,280
The Empress Dowager asked you a question.

434
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,160
It's disrespectful to stay silent.

435
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,760
Noble Consort Guo was raised

436
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,280
by her grandmother, Lady Yan.

437
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,880
They're very closed to each other.

438
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,400
Old Madam entered the palace today.

439
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,640
She made the chamomile cold noodles.

440
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,199
You're already in power.

441
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,640
Why did you have to force her?

442
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,560
She was the woman
whom the Late Emperor loved the most.

443
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,160
She also brought fatal harm to the Late Emperor.

444
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,719
That's why

445
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,959
I send her off to accompany him.

446
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,760
Then are you letting her be buried
at the mausoleum

447
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,719
and place her memorial tablet
enshrined at the mausoleum?

448
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,239
I have no right to ask you to pardon her.

449
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:05,119
But you could've asked her to be a nun,
guard the mausoleum,

450
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,719
or even take her own life as an apology

451
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,000
instead of publicly forcing her
to be part of the burial.

452
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,640
She still dies. What's the difference?

453
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:18,959
Being part of the burial
for being childless is already a tragedy.

454
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,599
Now one has to die a martyr
even when they're not childless.

455
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,079
Those in the imperial harem are frightened.

456
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
When this gets out,

457
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,800
there'll be endless disasters.

458
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,680
Noble Consort Guo's martyrdom shook
the imperial court and the people.

459
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:37,119
Her eldest son, Prince of Teng,
fears dying from illness.

460
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,040
Even the youngest son,
Prince of Wei cried day and night

461
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,400
in constant fear.

462
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Your Majesty,

463
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,400
they're His Majesty's brothers.

464
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,479
The brothers aren't united now.

465
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,959
How would His Majesty feel?

466
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,319
Won't he feel sad at all?

467
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,199
Your eyes are filled

468
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,239
with dissatisfaction.

469
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,319
Are you secretly determined

470
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,560
to seek justice from me one day?

471
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
I dare not.

472
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,199
All these years,

473
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,760
I protected my husband,

474
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,359
my sons, and the imperial harem.

475
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,920
After this, I'll do my best

476
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,839
to protect the country
and the people of the Great Ming.

477
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,400
That's how Empress Ma and Empress Xu had lived.

478
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,199
While Noble Consort Guo, Hu Shanxiang,

479
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,079
you,

480
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,000
and most of the women in the imperial harem,

481
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,160
what can you do if you're in power?

482
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,800
Fighting for a man's favor

483
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,680
or protecting the family?

484
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,640
Forget about that.

485
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,400
You can't do anything.

486
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,439
So

487
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,560
as long as I live,

488
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,800
all of you have no say.

489
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:37,319
[Guang'an Gate]
You did your best, but you failed to save her.

490
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,280
Are you disappointed?

491
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,920
Under this blue sky

492
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,719
where the sunlight shines,

493
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,280
no one can go against the Empress Dowager.

494
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,760
So you shouldn't feel disappointed.

495
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,280
You should feel hopeless.

496
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,719
From now on,

497
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,560
stop having unnecessary thoughts.

498
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,520
After being harmed by others,

499
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,599
one ends up as the person

500
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,000
who uses power to harm others.

501
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,199
Why?

502
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,920
Directress Hu was certain

503
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,000
that only one of us could live.

504
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,239
What is it based on?

505
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,280
The founding emperor established
ancestral instructions.

506
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,000
There's a certain number of the concubines
and palace maids being buried alive.

507
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,760
The high-ranking officials, nobles, officials,
and landlords compete to follow suit.

508
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,640
How many innocent lives will be buried?

509
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,719
Is it still countable?

510
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,319
Do you think you can change this?

511
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,839
Well, not now.

512
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,239
Not now?

513
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,479
Huaping.

514
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,640
Yes, Your Majesty?

515
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,199
Did you see that?

516
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,479
There's another person
who wants to defy heaven's will.

517
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:19,920
Your Highness.

518
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,599
There's a long life ahead.

519
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,119
How can everything go smoothly?

520
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,000
But I won't feel hopeless.

521
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,640
But a journey of thousands of li

522
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,880
should start from the beginning.

523
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,639
Are you done painting?

524
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:47,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,439
Something's wrong.

526
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,199
If I may be bold and ask what's wrong?

527
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,879
Everything is wrong.

528
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,600
Come and paint me.

529
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,399
I can't paint

530
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,639
if your order is unbeknownst to me.

531
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,479
That painting of me looks

532
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,639
handsome and unrestrained.

533
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,560
But it lacks valor.

534
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,040
I see.

535
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,679
Valor.

536
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:41,840
The appearance of an emperor

537
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,600
should be dignified and extraordinary.

538
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,280
So the people would feel in awe

539
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,800
with respect and admiration.

540
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:50,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

541
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,919
You want to look majestic.

542
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,120
Are you done?

543
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:07,919
Your Majesty, don't move.

544
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,679
I can't paint well if you move.

545
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,159
Your Majesty,

546
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,520
take a look.

547
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,879
Does he look mighty

548
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:42,959
and majestic to you?

549
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,479
Does he look dignified?

550
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,760
I like the portrait you draw very much.

551
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,120
I painted this based on your requests.

552
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,679
I like it very much.

553
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:00,679
Keep it.

554
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:06,280
I'll paint one for you next time.

555
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,080
I assure you it'll be exactly the same.

556
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

557
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

558
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,679
Perhaps I could make you look mightier.

559
00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:58,500
[The First Year of Hongxi Reign, Mid-Autumn]

560
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,280
[Qingning Gate]

561
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,159
You want to appoint Lady Sun as the Noble Consort?

562
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:38,280
Yes.

563
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,120
Your late grandfather picked Lady Sun

564
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,399
as your official wife.

565
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
It's too bad that she has a poor fate.

566
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,159
So she's not worthy of being the Empress.

567
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:51,600
Now,

568
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,320
you've conferred Hu as your empress.

569
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,800
Both of their places are set.

570
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,199
Don't tell me

571
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Lady Sun complained

572
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,000
about this.

573
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
Mother, you've misunderstood.

574
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,439
Zijin...

575
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,120
Lady Sun made no complaints.

576
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,639
It's my wish.

577
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,199
The position of Noble Consort ranks
second to the Empress.

578
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
You must choose someone who's obliging, virtuous,

579
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,320
and respected by those in the imperial harem.

580
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,679
Let's put this matter aside for a while.

581
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,199
I need to consider this.

582
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,040
Why?

583
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,000
Are you not happy?

584
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:27,959
Mother,

585
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,800
I didn't mean that.

586
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,000
Please wait for a while.

587
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,239
I heard

588
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,879
you have preferences towards Lady Sun

589
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,399
among all the concubines in the imperial harem.

590
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Isn't that so?

591
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,959
Lady Sun is gentle,

592
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,719
and we had a predestined fate.

593
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,879
I'm inevitably

594
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,399
more tolerant towards her.

595
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
But I won't tolerate it

596
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
if she acts like a spoiled child

597
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,120
and causes trouble everywhere.

598
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,040
Don't worry, Mother.

599
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,479
All the concubines in the imperial palace

600
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,840
are the same in my heart.

601
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
It's the same

602
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,639
with Lady Sun too.

603
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,760
Zijin, you're here?

604
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,040
Let her come in.

605
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,919
Your Majesties.

606
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,080
Rise.

607
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

608
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,239
Since Your Majesty is busy with state affairs,

609
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,320
I won't keep you here, then.

610
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:41,679
Zijin can stay

611
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,120
and accompany me.

612
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,280
You can leave now.

613
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,719
Yes, Mother.

614
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,080
I'll take my leave now.

615
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,380
[Qingning Gate]

616
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,760
Your Highness,

617
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,800
His Majesty invites you to have a meal together.

618
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,239
Eunuch Yuan,

619
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,479
please convey my message to His Majesty.

620
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,879
I'm ugly

621
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,360
and not gentle.

622
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,280
I don't want

623
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
to defile His Majesty's eyes.

624
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,040
Also,

625
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,919
ask His Majesty to invite

626
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,120
the other concubines.

627
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,439
Since all women
in the imperial harem are the same.

628
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,879
You're defying His Majesty's edict.

629
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,439
Your Highness, look.

630
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,360
Fresh meat, fruits, mixed nuts,

631
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,760
egg yolk, and lotus paste.

632
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,679
They're all prepared.

633
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,719
Can we send these

634
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,800
to Qianqing Palace now?

635
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:13,800
Never mind.

636
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,000
According to the usual practice
in previous years,

637
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,360
all the mistress of the palaces

638
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,520
would send moon cakes to Qianqing Palace.

639
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,560
You're...

640
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,879
Which one looks nicer?

641
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,399
It's the mid-autumn.

642
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,639
Of course, it's the red one.
It's the color of celebration.

643
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,439
Here.

644
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,639
Thank you.

645
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,639
Do you like it?

646
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,719
Yes.

647
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,360
Big Sister.

648
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,719
Look at the lace.

649
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,080
How did you embroider it?

650
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,959
I knitted it with gold thread.

651
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,439
If you like it,

652
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:16,679
I'll teach you next time. Is that all right?

653
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:17,719
All right.

654
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,000
Good.

655
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,800
Your Majesty,

656
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,080
should we send someone

657
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,040
to deliver the moon cakes to Qianqing Palace?

658
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,959
Isn't that person good at preparing food?

659
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,919
No matter how nimble my hands are,

660
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,679
I can't be compared to her.

661
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:43,840
Why waste my time?

662
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,399
I prefer this one.
