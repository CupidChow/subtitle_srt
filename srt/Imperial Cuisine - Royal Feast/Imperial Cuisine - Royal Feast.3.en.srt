00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,000
Father, are you okay?

4
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,199
Such audacity!

5
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,279
How dare you do that!

6
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,279
How dare you go berserk!

7
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,759
Big Brother was almost hurt because of you!

8
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,440
You deserve to be slain!

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,360
How dare you!

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,240
Second Brother, you mustn't do so!

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,639
Protect His Majesty!

12
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,160
Grandfather, be careful!

13
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,600
[You Yifan]
[Vice Commander of the Imperial Bodyguard]

14
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,520
Your Majesty, please pardon me
for being late to the rescue.

15
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,839
You may drop the formality.

16
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,839
Father.

17
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,080
Father, don't worry.

18
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,320
I am fine.

19
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,679
How dare you do so?

20
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,720
That horse was crazy.

21
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,240
How dare you try to keep it in check
when it has such a fierce personality?

22
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,160
Grandfather,

23
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm fine, aren't I?

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,199
I told you to practice your horse riding skill.

25
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,679
All of my sons

26
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
are mighty in both the pen and the sword,

27
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,559
except for you, a useless fatso.

28
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,440
Are you not ashamed as a father?

29
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,759
My precious grandson
had to step in just to save you.

30
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,720
Father, please be appeased.

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
It's all my fault.

32
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,800
The rest of you didn't try to save
the Crown Prince even though he was in danger.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,080
Why should I keep you around?

34
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,559
Take them away!

35
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,440
-Your Majesty, please spare us!
-Your Majesty, please spare us!

37
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Whoever tries to convince me to do otherwise
will be punished severely.

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,519
From today onward,

39
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
the Imperial Food Service

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,399
is to cut down the Crown Prince's food intake.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
If he's still

42
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,000
as fat and useless after three months,

43
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,600
if he still can't ride a horse by then,

44
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:41,079
all of you will be beheaded.

45
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,839
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,079
Father.

47
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:48,679
Slowly.

48
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,559
Even from my fief,

49
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,559
I had heard that another exceptional talent
had entered the capital.

50
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,000
Now that I've seen you personally,

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
you're mighty indeed.

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,000
It's no wonder you've won His Majesty's heart

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
and were promoted as an exception.

54
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,239
Prince of Han, you flattered me.

55
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
I don't deserve such praises.

56
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,559
Wait!

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
This is...

58
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:45,760
Your Highness.

59
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,279
What's the matter?

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,239
It's nothing.

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Let's return to the palace.

62
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,720
Be careful.

63
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,540
[Xingyun Cottage]

64
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,920
(Why is Yao Zijin sneaking around?)

65
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,640
The Crown Prince isn't willing to take his meals.

66
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,359
If this continues, I'm afraid
His Highness's body can't stand it.

67
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
I've summoned everyone here today

68
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,640
for you all to prepare meals
for His Highness in turns.

69
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,960
Anyone who can solve this issue
for the Eastern Palace

70
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,559
will be heavily rewarded by the Crown Princess.

71
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,440
If not, if something happens to His Highness,

72
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,599
the entire Imperial Food Service
will be punished.

73
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,239
But His Highness is a meat-eater.

74
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
He has a huge appetite as well.

75
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,159
But now, His Majesty has issued a decree

76
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
that His Highness isn't
allowed to consume any meat.

77
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
How can we solve this predicament?

78
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,159
That's right.

79
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,719
Both Directress Hu and
Directress Wang have given it a try.

80
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,679
But no matter what dishes they prepared,

81
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,320
His Highness wasn't willing to take them.

82
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,239
Even if we give this a try,

83
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,159
would we be able to achieve something
that the two directresses couldn't?

84
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
You all are the best cooks

85
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,559
we've selected from all around the nation.

86
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,599
The Ming nation is vast
with a plethora of unique dishes.

87
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,880
If we brainstorm a solution together,
it might work.

88
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,400
Are you guys going to give up

89
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
without even trying?

90
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,640
Look at this.

91
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,679
Your Highness,

92
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,719
why don't you try this dish?

93
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,840
Your Highness.

94
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,400
You...

95
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,599
Fine.

96
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,280
Lancui, what exactly is going on?

97
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,559
How did you manage to

98
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,200
make His Highness
like the stir-fried vegetables?

99
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,640
That's right. Tell us about it.

100
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,359
Hurry and tell us about it.

101
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,719
That's right.

102
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,000
Tell us about it.

103
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,039
This is a secret.

104
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,919
How can I tell you guys about it?

105
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Why can't you tell us about it?

106
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,280
Just tell us.

107
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Why can't you tell us?

108
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:28,719
Arrest her.

109
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,679
Sir!

110
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
Officer You, please pardon me for my rudeness.

111
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
But this is the Imperial Food Service.

112
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,799
Why did you come without notifying us?

113
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,200
Give her the strokes!

114
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,400
Officer You!

115
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,820
[Fine Meal, Divine Work]

116
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,400
Officer You!

117
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,840
Manager Fang!

118
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,880
Officer You!

119
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,479
Officer You!

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,400
You!

121
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,919
You.

122
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,559
Are you trying to tip someone off?

123
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,280
Hurry and tell us!

124
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,719
Ziping!

125
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,559
Ziping.

126
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Sir,

127
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,599
the Imperial Bodyguard

128
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,799
has the right to investigate,
interrogate, and arrest suspects.

129
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,559
You and your subordinates
are revered by all palace personnel.

130
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,520
But this is the Inner Court.

131
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,280
You cannot mete out illegal punishment
without permission.

132
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,599
Who are you?

133
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,679
Officer You.

134
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,039
What did you say just now?

135
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,880
Officer You,

136
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,119
if a maidservant has committed a mistake,

137
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,440
the Palace Surveillance will deal with them.

138
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Please show mercy.

139
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,960
Officer You!

140
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,840
Back then, our founder wanted
to punish a palace servant out of rage.

141
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,640
As Empress Xiaocigao was afraid
of His Majesty's wrath,

142
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,359
she insisted on handing the maidservant
to the Palace Surveillance.

143
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Even Empress Xiaocigao did the same thing.

144
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,640
Officer You, if you insist on meting out
punishment in the imperial harem,

145
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,039
you'll go against the palace rules
and our founder's teaching.

146
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,919
Officer You, you're a trusted aide of the Emperor.

147
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,159
You should handle the matter impartially.

148
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,119
Officer You,

149
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,000
the things she said just now...

150
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,280
You tried to stop me
even though your body was shaking.

151
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,719
So how tough is your neck?

152
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,479
I wish to give it a test.

153
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,479
So that's all you got?

154
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,000
There are countless pitiful people in the world.

155
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,960
How many of them can you help?

156
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
You should care for your own safety first.

157
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,159
Take both of them away.

158
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,960
Yes, Officer You.

159
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,479
Officer You,

160
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,239
that was an impressive performance.

161
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,880
Matron Meng.

162
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,960
Officer You, I know you're favored by His Majesty

163
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,960
and that your rank is high.

164
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,919
But this is the Imperial Food Service.

165
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,119
This is the place where
we prepare meals for His Majesty.

166
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,799
If they commit mistakes,

167
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,440
those who have committed lesser mistakes
will be sent to the Palace Surveillance.

168
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,359
Those who have committed serious mistakes
will be sent to the Directorate of Ceremonial.

169
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,919
We don't need to trouble
the Imperial Bodyguard for this.

170
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:17,840
Show it to them.

171
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
His Majesty has already issued a decree long ago.

172
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,599
The Imperial Bodyguard is to
protect the Eastern Palace at all times.

173
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,760
This concerns the Crown Prince's health.

174
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,760
Even though it's something as simple as a meal,

175
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,559
we need to report them to His Majesty.

176
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,520
You and your subordinates
have supplied the Crown Prince with meat.

177
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,119
You have gone against the imperial decree.

178
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,520
Take them away.

179
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,359
Wait.

180
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,320
They're cooks responsible
for preparing the Crown Prince's meals.

181
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,280
If you take both of them away,

182
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,400
will you guards prepare dinner

183
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
for His Highness today?

184
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,320
Officer You,

185
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,119
it seems like you can only

186
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,760
take one person with you today.

187
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,200
Fine.

188
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,359
If so, I'll stay here

189
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,559
and observe how you will act
according to the imperial decree.

190
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,359
But let me say this first.

191
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,119
His Highness is not allowed
to have any meat in his meals.

192
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,039
If anyone dares to go against
the imperial decree again,

193
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,119
Matron Meng, I'm afraid even
you can't handle the consequences.

194
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,799
Your Highness.

195
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,820
[Sharp and Sensitive]

196
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,520
Your Highness, it's me.

197
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,719
Miaoxian, what fragrance did you put on?

198
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,520
Your Highness, I knew that
you don't like the smell of rouge.

199
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,920
That's why I chose to put on
the elegant jasmine fragrance.

200
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,760
Change it.

201
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
You don't like it?

202
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,560
Yes, Your Highness.

203
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,040
Please wait for me.

204
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,920
I'll be back immediately.

205
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,640
Your hair.

206
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,079
I didn't even dare to use any osmanthus oil.

207
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
I plucked this rose personally.

208
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,599
It has a faint fragrance.

209
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,760
Your Highness, you don't like it either?

210
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,760
I'll wash my hair then.

211
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,319
Please don't leave. Please wait for my return.

212
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,880
Your Highness, please wait for my return!

213
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,040
Your Highness,

214
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,439
please take a bite. This can nourish the lungs.

215
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,359
Who had touched this paper before?

216
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,680
Do not delay His Highness's meal.

217
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,199
Hurry and prepare the meal.

218
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,239
Officer You, what do you mean by this?

219
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,079
Matron Meng, didn't you say

220
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,479
that they're needed to
prepare His Highness's meals?

221
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,400
If you need the three of them
to help you out with everything,

222
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
then the rest of them must be useless.

223
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,119
Why don't you leave them to me

224
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,280
and let me bring them to the imperial prison?

225
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,400
Prepare the meals immediately!

226
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,439
As a cook,

227
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,239
even if our lives are in danger,

228
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,079
we mustn't forget our duties.

229
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,199
From now on,

230
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,920
everyone will prepare the meals
for the other palaces.

231
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,439
As for His Highness's dinner...

232
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,040
Let me do it.

233
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,560
Yuehua,

234
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,680
you mustn't do so.

235
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay.

236
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,439
I'll leave it to you.

237
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,599
Yukuai.

238
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,239
Xuelu.

239
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,959
What about the two of them?

240
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,359
Prepare the meals right now.

241
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes, Matron.

242
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
What should we prepare?

243
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,280
During the meal preparation process,

244
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,839
we must be focused.

245
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,680
If any of the meals are delayed,

246
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,040
I will punish you personally

247
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,280
before the Palace Surveillance
punishes you guys.

248
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,959
What will happen to us

249
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,359
if we fail?

250
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,040
Today, we'll prepare a vegetarian meal.

251
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,560
I will draw up the menu.

252
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,119
Ziping,

253
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,640
you're in charge of making pain noodles.

254
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,319
Thank you, Officer You.

255
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:30,599
You're too courteous.

256
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:44,920
Let's go.

257
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,560
The heat is too high.

258
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,040
It's irritating my eyes.

259
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,079
Officer You, do you know that servant?

260
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,800
Sorry for being nosy.

261
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
These palace servants

262
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,959
must be new to the palace.

263
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,170
[Vegetarian Yellow Croaker With Vinegar]

264
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,160
Is the fish gill made from mushrooms?

265
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:15,040
Your Highness, please try this.

266
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,720
[Shrimps in Two Styles]

267
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,599
Good.

268
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,880
It's been a long time since I had

269
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,760
something so delicious.

270
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,119
Slow down.

271
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,920
How did you make them?

272
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,359
Your Highness,

273
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,719
the head is made by putting
shredded peanuts on top of the pastry crust.

274
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,560
The body is made from egg rolls, lotus roots,

275
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,239
and Chinese yam.

276
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,239
The tail is made from shredded carrots.

277
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,239
Look at the shrimp's body.

278
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,239
It even has stripes.

279
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,079
Your Highness,

280
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,479
the stripes on the shrimp

281
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,359
is made from shredded egg roll,

282

black and white sesame seeds.

283
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,439
They're seasoned separately,
fried, and arranged on the plate

284
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
to form the shape of a shrimp.

285
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,359
Very meticulous.

286
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,040
Your Highness,

287
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,359
it's rare for the Imperial Food Service
to be this thoughtful.

288
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:11,800
They should be rewarded.

289
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,439
Reward them.

290
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,520
Come on, try this bowl of noodles.

291
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,319
Delicious!

292
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:42,680
Where are they?

293
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,719
Eunuch Yuan, what brings you here?

294
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,479
Where are the rest of you?

295
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,199
They're sending meals to the respective palaces.

296
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:53,640
Eunuch,

297
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
did the Great Imperial Grandson
give us any instructions?

298
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,040
Who went to the thatched cottage today?

299
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,920
It was me.

300
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,640
Eunuch,

301
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,119
did something happen?

302
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:11,800
It's nothing.

303
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
You're in luck. Follow me.

304

[Qingning Gate]

305
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,920
Officer You.

306
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,920
How did you get rid of the stain on the paper?

307
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,560
Your Highness,

308
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,199
I used the Huishan Spring Water
that was given to us last year.

309
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,880
Such audacity!

310
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,479
How dare you spout such nonsense?

311
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
It's true.

312
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,959
The spring water wasn't filtered by fine sand yet.

313
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,959
It has a strong aftertaste.

314
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,040
It has to be aged for one to two months

315
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,839
for it to be nourished by the night dew.

316
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,439
Only then, it can be used to make tea.

317
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Your Highness, when I was
sending the snacks to you,

318
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,599
I saw that your paper was stained.

319
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,280
That's why I gave it a try.

320
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

321
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,520
His Highness has already finished his dinner.

322
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,839
We never went against
the imperial decree in any way.

323
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
What else do you guys want from us?

324
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,079
Officer You.

325
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,839
This clay pot contains the stock
for tonight's noodles.

326
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,880
It is white in color indeed.

327
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
It has a rich smell.

328
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,319
So what do you think is inside?

329
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,959
What else could be there?

330
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,319
It's just a normal stock.

331
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,239
Do you want me to expose you in public?

332
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,479
What did you use to cook the stock?

333
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,640
Ziping has a habit.

334
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,040
She loves to collect leftover ingredients,

335
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,719
especially

336
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,640
chickens, ducks, pork, fish,

337
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,199
meatless bones,

338
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,199
even shrimp heads and its tomalley.

339
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,839
By cooking these ingredients in a pot,

340
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,319
it'll create a white broth.

341
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,079
It has a rich and pleasant taste to it.

342
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:33,280
Yin Ziping.

343
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,359
I've told you already.

344
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,599
You have gone against the imperial decree

345
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,119
and you deserve to be beheaded.

346
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,000
Arrest her.

347
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,199
Officer You,

348
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,800
are you sure you don't want
to get to the bottom of this?

349
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,400
Officer You,

350
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,160
this is just plain water.

351
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,839
There's no broth.

352
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,520
Ziping!

353
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:15,800
Officer You,

354
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,359
plain noodles are made
by cooking the noodles in plain water.

355
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,959
No broth is used.

356
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Officer You, you misunderstood us.

357
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,920
Officer You,

358
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,560
if you'll excuse us.

359
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,119
Officer You, is there anything else
I can help you with?

360
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,119
Take her away and give her 20 strokes.

361
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,760
Expel her from the palace.

362
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Give her 20 strokes and expel her from the palace.

363
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,160
Someone.

00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,560

Your Highness!

369
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,560
Your Highness, I know my mistake now!

370
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,640
Your Highness!

371
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,319
Your Highness,

372
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,719
so why did you...

373
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,119
She's claiming other people's credit for herself.

374
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,520
She harbored evil intentions,
so she deserved to be punished.

375
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,199
You're back?

376
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,560
Your Highness,

377
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,959
I've visited the officials who were implicated

378
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,160
and sent to prison during the feast.

379
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,319
I've provided them with monetary aid as well

380
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,719
so that they won't starve.

381
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,160
Your Highness was right.

382
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,839
Government officials do receive
too little wage.

383
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,719
And those officials are honest and uncorrupted.

384
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,119
If I didn't aid them,

385
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,959
they wouldn't have enough coals
for them to last through the winter.

386
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,000
How did you know
that she was impersonating the real deal?

387
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,839
I verified it myself.

388
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
The stain didn't disappear

389
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,000
because of the Huishan Spring Water.

390
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,439
It's the plum rain water
that was aged for three years.

391
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
The Huishan Spring Water she had gathered

392
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,319
was infused with the plum rain
of the southern region

393
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,800
and transported all the way here to the capital.

394
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,000
It hasn't been aged for two years yet.

395
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,599
I'm sure that person has other secrets
that we don't know about.

396
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,800
The maidservant just now kept mentioning
the Huishan Spring Water.

397
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,560
She doesn't understand the secret to it at all.

398
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,880
But she's daring enough to impersonate her.

399
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Doesn't she deserve to be punished?

400
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:06,400
Your Highness,

401
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,439
I was ignorant.

402
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,159
I was wrong.

403
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
I will head to the Imperial Food Service now.

404
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,600
Wait.

405
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,080
Your Highness,

406
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,800
what other instructions do you have?

407
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,800
Forget it.

408
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:20,479
Let's go.

409
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,080
It's time for me to visit my grandfather.

410
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,280
Your Highness,

411
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,639
your ink is ready. Regarding the painting...

412
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,199
Maybe,

413
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:29,760
someone will be able to utilize this.

414
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,040
How did you figure out to make a broth like that?

415
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,280
Matron Meng,

416
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,159
when I was young, I was living in poverty.

417
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,399
The restaurants often
throw their leftovers away.

418
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,320
I collected them

419
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,639
as I thought it was a waste.

420
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,760
After that, I realized that you'd get
different results and tastes

421
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,239
by combining

422
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,320
different ingredients.

423
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
If so,

424
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,919
why did you use plain water
to cook the noodles in the end?

425
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,639
Matron Meng,

426
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,280
for vegetarian meals,

427
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,159
it'll taste fresh and refreshing
on the first and second day.

428
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,360
But it's hard to make them
interesting all the time.

429
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,399
I used plain water to cook the noodles.

430
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,199
As His Highness is wise,

431
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,800
he'll be reminded of
His Majesty's imperial decree

432
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
and understand the situation immediately.

433
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,560
That's why he won't make
things difficult for our Imperial Food Service.

434
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,679
Even though you're new to the palace,

435
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,879
it seems like you understand His Highness well.

436
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,399
His Highness was in charge of governing
the nation when His Majesty was on an expedition.

437
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,159
He reduces the taxes and aids
the natural disaster victims every year.

438
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,040
He serves the people well.

439
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,080
His Highness's benevolence

440
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,399
was spread throughout the nation.

441
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Everyone in the country knows about it.

442
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,080
Matron Meng,

443
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,639
Zijin was the major contributor
in preparing the vegetarian meal tonight.

444
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,360
Can you please not transfer her away?

445
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,040
Matron,

446
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,159
Zijin is very intelligent.

447
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,159
It'll be a waste of her talent
if we do transfer her to

448
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,399
the Directorate of Imperial Parks.

449
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,679
From today onward,

450
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,399
you can stay in the Imperial Food Service

451
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,280
and study the art of cooking.

452
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,800
Matron Meng!

453
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,600
Thank you, Matron.

454
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,520
Honestly speaking,

455
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,399
we did cook the noodles with plain water.

456
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,800
But the noodles

457
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,399
were made

458
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,919
from the mackerels I got

459
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:24,679
from Jiaxing.

460
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:26,919
(Although it doesn't taste like fish,)

461
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,239
(it's delicious and refreshing.)

462
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,679
(I added ginger and spring onion to the soup)

463
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,520
(to cover the fishy taste.)

464
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,800
(They won't be able to find this out.)

465
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,239
But I didn't see you making it.

466
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:49,320
So did you plan to solve this issue
for the Eastern Palace from the start?

467
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,879
It's good that His Highness
is taking vegetarian food.

468
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,239
But he needs some time to get used to it.

469
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,919
We cannot rush the process.

470
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
I'm sure that jinx has too much
free time on his hands.

471
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
He kept haunting us.

472
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
He's here to monitor the Eastern Palace
under the imperial decree.

473
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,239
We were just implicated for no reason.

474
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,639
I've long heard of

475
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,679
His Majesty's hostility
towards the fat crown prince.

476
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:20,919
His Highness needs to ask for
His Majesty's permission to drink a sip of water.

477
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,080
When the titans clash, the mortals suffer.

478
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,919
Lower your volume.

479
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,919
Let me see.

480
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,879
No need for that.

481
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,639
You taught me how to read,

482
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
and I helped you to get a spot here.

483
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:39,919
This is a fair trade.

484
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,040
We're even now.

485
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,760
I didn't beg you to save me.

486
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,600
Fine then.

487
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,280
Does it hurt?

488
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,120
If it hurts, let me apply this for you.

489
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:56,639
Come here.

490
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,560
Be gentle. It hurts.

491
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Just stop it.

492
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,239
I suddenly remembered something.

493
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,520
I have something else to do.

494
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,360
I shall take my leave.

495
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,600
It's late.

496
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,239
Where are you going?

497
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,800
I...

498
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,520
I'll retrieve the food box

499
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,000
and deliver the medicine.

500
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,300
[Xingyun Cottage]

501
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,360
So he's insulting me by saying that I'm a sneaky rat.

502
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,239
(Miss Yao,)

503
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,159
(His Highness has a message for you.)

504
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,239
(You can use the ink and the brush.)

505
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,360
Your Highness.

506
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,360
Your Highness?

507
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:37,959
The moon looks exceptional today.

508
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:38,840
Let's go.

509
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,760
Let's enjoy the night view.

510
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,280
Your Highness,

511
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:18,800
we could've captured the rat just now.

512
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,760
Isn't it interesting

513
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,360
to have a friend you have never met

514
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:23,760
and is not noisy?

515
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:25,959
Your Highness, don't you wish

516
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,600
to know how this thoughtful person

517
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
looks like?

518
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,040
No.

519
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,040
Maybe I'll be disappointed after I see her.

520
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
It's better for me not to see her.

521
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,520
Everyone here knows

522
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,360
that Manager Zhao and Manager Bai
have left the palace.

523
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,679
The slots for the managers are empty.

524
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,520
The Table Maid, He Shu is calm and dependable.

525
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,879
She will be promoted to the ranks of manager.

526
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,719
As for the last slot, we'll hold a fair competition.

527
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,320
This year, we'll make an exception.

528
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,439
If the new maidservants can
pass the Inner Court Academy exam,

529
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:05,360
they can participate
in this competition as well.

530
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,959
I will use this opportunity

531
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,840
to select a disciple too.

532
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,679
I will impart everything that I've learned to her.

533
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,159
All right. That's all for today.

534
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:17,959
You all are dismissed.

535
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,719
Yes, Matron.

536
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,840
Zijin,

537
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,679
don't let me down.

538
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:50,360
Your Highness,

539
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,399
she's thoughtful, excellent at cooking,

540
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:54,800
and exceptional at drawing.

541
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,239
Aren't you curious about her at all?

542
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,000
Not at all.

543
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,760
The memorial that my grandfather
was supposed to send to me isn't here yet.

544
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:01,800
Go and inquire about it.

545
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:02,800
Yes, Your Highness.

546
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,919
Something seems amiss.
