00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,519
Are you also in charge
of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs?

4
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,839
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,440
I don't know anything.

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,160
I really don't know anything, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,480
It wasn't me.

8
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,959
Your Majesty!

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm innocent.

10
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,319
I'm innocent!

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,959
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

13
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm innocent!

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,559
Your Majesty!

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm innocent.

16
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,760
Your Majesty,

17
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,879
please speak for me.

18
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,279
I'm really innocent!

19
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:08,880
Your Majesty!

20
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,320
Your Majesty!

21
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,199
Your Majesty,

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Yuan Qi has to attend

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,759
to your needs day and night.

24
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:14,880
He's also responsible

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,440
for the tasks at the Directorate of Ceremonial.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,479
He also temporarily supervises
the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs

27
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,720
because it's short of hands.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,399
How can he handle so many things at once?

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm sure

30
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,720
Yuan Qi would never

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
have the nerve to...

32
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,000
Ignorant woman!

33
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,000
How dare you speak blatantly.

34
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,320
Leave!

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,759
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
is everything I say

37
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,399
so unpleasant to you?

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,600
Yuan Qi.

39
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:51,679
I'll go after

40
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,839
Her Majesty right away.

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,639
I didn't tell you to do that.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Liu Guan wanted to execute

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,039
seventy bandits, right?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,160
Tell him to send the name list to me.

45
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,919
I want to reinvestigate it.

46
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,320
Go now!

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,240
you said you'd have a nice talk

49
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:25,800
with His Majesty

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,479
when you visit him.

51
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,479
Why did you leave right away?

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Empress Dowager always says

53
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,399
we need to speak frankly

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,679
and give earnest advice
as the Empress and imperial concubines.

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,839
I spoke up for Yuan Qi

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
because I didn't want his anger
to affect his health.

57
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:41,759
Moreover,

58
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,960
Yuan Qi had served him for many years.

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
There's bound to be some mutual affection.

60
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,559
He scared him to such an extent.

61
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,880
How is he going to carry out
his tasks in the future?

62
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:50,960
It's a pity that he doesn't heed my advice.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,119
He can't bear the sight of me.

64
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,800
So everything I say is not pleasant to him.

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,279
Get lost.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,079
I want all of you to get lost.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,359
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
why are you losing your temper

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,239
out of a sudden?

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,519
The Empress is worried

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,559
about your health.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,320
That's why she offered you advice.

73
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,040
Why did you

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,200
chase her away?

75
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:57,679
Yes.

76
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,279
All of you are right.

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm the one at fault.

78
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,720
Leave. I don't want to see you either.

79
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,000
Guards!

80
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,480
His Majesty is unwell.

81
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,040
Get Imperial Physician Sheng.

82
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
I don't want to see anyone.

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,200
I forbid you to go.

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Yuan Qi,

85
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,600
go now.

86
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,720
Close your eyes and get some rest.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,440
You'll be all right after taking your medicine.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,239
I'll order

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,119
them not to come

90
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,119
and bother you for now.

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,839
Sitting on this throne,

92
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,040
I must live up

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
to the predecessors of the Great Ming

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,679
and also don't let

95
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,200
the people down.

96
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,480
Zijin.

97
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,720
It's hard on me.

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
Do you understand?

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,239
Did that really happen?

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Your Majesty,

101
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,959
His Majesty smashed his cup in Qianqing Palace.

102
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,200
It could be heard from outside.

103
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,279
Everyone in the palace is talking about it.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,679
The Empress offered her sincere advice.

105
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
But it made His Majesty angry.

106
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Instead,

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,760
His Majesty seems to prefer

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,640
the villain who's clever with flattering words.

109
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,440
I was out of line.

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,559
Summon Noble Consort Sun.

111
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:34,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:50,799
Your Majesty.

113
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,119
I summoned you at noon.

114
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,559
Why are you only here now?

115
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,440
Your Majesty,

116
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,519
I met

117
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,519
Imperial Physician Sheng, who was summoned
by Qianqing Palace by chance

118
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,440
and found out His Majesty is unwell.

119
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,239
I was worried.

120
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,160
So I asked about His Majesty's condition.

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,279
That's why I was late.

122
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,359
The Emperor is ill?

123
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,119
When did this happen?

124
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Why did no one report this to me?

125
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,600
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

126
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,239
Imperial Physician Sheng has said

127
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,399
His Majesty caught a cold.

128
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,200
It's nothing serious.

129
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
His Majesty fears you might worry.

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
So His Majesty ordered

131
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,200
not to trouble Qingning Palace.

132
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,640
His Majesty

133
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
is a filial son.

134
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,920
So they wouldn't dare to defy his edict.

135
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,080
You can get up now.

136
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,239
The Emperor is usually busy with state affairs.

138
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,320
So everyone

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,559
must be meticulous when attending to him.

140
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,919
How could no one notice

141
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,479
of such a serious matter?

142
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,320
It's my negligence.

143
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,039
Never mind.

144
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,359
It's not entirely your fault.

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,760
There are

146
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,559
too many problems in the palace.

147
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,599
The Empress is always sick.

148
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,239
So you're taking all of the responsibility.

149
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,559
It's hard for you to manage
so many things at once.

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,880
Is there anyone

151
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,239
in the imperial harem

152
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,039
who can share your burden?

153
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,960
Since Your Majesty asked,

154
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,520
I'll speak without fear.

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
Previously,

156
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,159
the Empress had been sick.

157
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,520
So I had to handle palace affairs on her behalf.

158
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,640
But the Empress has recovered.

159
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,960
It's right for her to manage the imperial harem.

160
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,000
The Empress is weak in health.

161
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,239
She'd often fall sick now and then.

162
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,599
The palace affairs are cumbersome

163
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,599
with complicated people.

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,359
It's not easy to manage.

165
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,280
Aren't you putting her in a difficult position?

166
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,760
Your Majesty,

167
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,479
the Empress

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,760
is generous, benevolent, and righteous.

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,960
Even if

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,039
a servant made a mistake,

171
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,760
Her Majesty doesn't have
the heart to punish them.

172
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,840
It's the blessing of the imperial harem

173
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,039
and the Great Ming.

174
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,280
It's just that Her Majesty has just recovered.

175
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
It's not advisable for her to overwork.

176
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,880
How about requesting
Gracious Consort He to assist?

177
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,440
She's been in the palace the longest.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
She's capable and intelligent.

179
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,280
She also handles things appropriately.

180
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,960
Among the imperial concubines,

181
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Lady Wu is the most talkative.

182
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,039
She would gossip

183
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,200
about you in front of others.

184
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,919
I want to punish her severely. What do you think?

185
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu

186
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,440
is still young.

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,719
So she's a lively girl.

188
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,719
But I'm sure she meant no harm.

189
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,200
His Majesty happens to order people
to create Xuande incense burner.

190
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
But the designs produced by the craftsmen

191
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
are not to His Majesty's liking.

192
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,280
Since Lady of Bright Deportment Wu
loves incense,

193
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,559
why not send her to supervise this matter?

194
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,320
It's what she likes,

195
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,320
and she can help His Majesty solve a problem.

196
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,400
Also...

197
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,159
Go on.

198
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,239
Since the Hongwu Reign,

199
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,640
Hongwu Emperor created

200
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,520
the Six Services based on
the Tang and Song Dynasties

201
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
for female officials to manage
the palace affairs.

202
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,559
But the female officials

203
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,039
lost their power after a while.

204
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Many palace eunuchs

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,039
indulged in power and greed.

206
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,719
Matron Meng

207
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,679
took back the power overnight.

208
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,760
All affairs in the imperial harem

209
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,039
must be reported to their superiors

210
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,799
regardless of big or small.

211
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,799
Let's put aside the Empress, who's frail.

212
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,760
It's even difficult for me

213
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,080
to manage everything.

214
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,919
You were saying all these

215
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,320
because you want to restore the old system.

216
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,159
Your Majesty,

217
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,960
female officials always carry

218
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,919
heavy responsibilities.

219
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,719
In my opinion,

220
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
Cao Jieyu is a meticulous person.

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
She can manage the Imperial Ceremonial Service.

222
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,919
Worthy Lady Jiao is good at needlework.

223
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,239
She can manage the Palace Workshop Service.

224
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,559
As for Lady Xu and Lady Yuan,

225
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,719
they love clothes and adornments.

226
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,880
It would be best

227
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
if they could manage
the Imperial Wardrobe Service.

228
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,919
It's not against the old practice either.

229
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,440
Every Six Services has persons in charge.

230
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,280
The imperial concubines only need
to pay more attention

231
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,599
and pick out important matters

232
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,640
to report to the Empress.

233
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,000
When imperial concubines have their own duties,

234
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,679
there will be less fighting
over the Emperor's attention.

235
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,640
The female officials will also have
someone to rely on.

236
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,039
That way, they'd focus more on their tasks.

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
Then the imperial harem
would naturally be in peace.

238
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,159
Only the Palace Surveillance
will be responsible

239
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,039
for maintaining discipline

240
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,080
and punishment.

241
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,440
This matter can't be put in the hands of others.

242
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,679
The Empress

243
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,840
must attend to this in person.

244
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,239
It's also up to the Empress to reward or punish

245
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,280
those who manage the Six Services.

246
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,760
If someone is not competent enough,

247
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,559
we can choose someone else
to take over in the following year.

248
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,039
So you're saying

249
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,679
to give everyone something to do,

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,719
so they don't

251
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,440
have the time to stir up trouble.

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,799
You haven't finished
what you said just now, right?

253
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,840
Yes.

254
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,640
There are some candidates

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,280
that I can't decide on.

256
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,880
I ask that Your Majesty decide on it.

257
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,799
I understand.

258
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,400
If we want them to work seriously,

259
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,640
we'll have to promote them.

260
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,400
Your Majesty is wise.

261
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,760
There's one more thing that I want to report.

262
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:42,640
What is it?

263
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,520
This year, Kaiping wants

264
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,359
to reward its soldiers at the border.

265
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,919
But

266
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,280
the cotton cloth needed for winter clothes

267
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
is not enough.

268
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,520
I know there's some unused cloth

269
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,080
in the storehouse.

270
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,679
I ask that Your Majesty
give me some instructions.

271
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,200
All right.

272
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,159
I'll take my leave now.

273
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,119
Go.

274
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,159
Come out.

275
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:26,960
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,

276
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,119
did you hear that?

277
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:30,880
Your Majesty,

278
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,119
a person who does good

279
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,039
for fame

280
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,119
is the real bad person.

281
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:34,960
No.

282
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,960
People usually

283
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,159
call such a person a hypocrite.

284
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,359
I'm at a disadvantage

285
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,760
because I was too frank.

286
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,440
People with their true nature

287
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
are always misunderstood.

288
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,679
Slap her.

289
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:43,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,520
Your Majesty,

291
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,960
was I wrong?

292
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,840
Your Majesty,

293
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,960
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu
made a slip of the tongue.

294
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,200
Please forgive her.

295
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,640
Please forgive her.

296
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,919
You say it's hypocrisy

297
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,760
when she does things seriously
and considerately.

298
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,960
You called yourself true nature?

299
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,159
If being true to one's nature

300
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,520
is about saying and doing

301
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,799
whatever one pleases,

302
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,320
I'd have ordered someone

303
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,679
to drag you out

304
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,440
to be flogged 40 times

305
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,679
if I were to follow my true nature!

306
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,960
If Noble Consort Sun

307
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,599
behaves like your true nature

308
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,840
and badmouths you in front of the Emperor,

309
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,799
would you still be alive?

310
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,039
Your Majesty,

311
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,880
I've misunderstood Noble Consort Sun.

313
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,359
I regret my actions now.

314
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,559
When I go back,

315
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,640
I'll change my ways

316
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,119
and never dare to speak recklessly again.

317
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,440
I don't care if it's true nature

318
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,960
or hypocrisy.

319
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,520
I only care

320
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,960
if anyone does their duties

321
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,919
and brings benefits to the imperial harem.

322
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,320
You can leave now.

323
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

324
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,280
Rise.

325
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,440
Empress,

326
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,080
you did right

327
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,599
to speak honestly

328
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,679
in front of the Emperor.

329
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
But

330
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,559
you're not the imperial censor
of the imperial court, after all.

331
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,119
You must learn

332
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,679
how to use good words.

333
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,041
[Peace with the world
and indifferent with worldly success]

335
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,840
Our Empress is

336
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,159
frail and often sick.

337
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,159
She doesn't even have a child.

338
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,400
She could only watch Noble Consort Sun
being pampered at the imperial harem.

339
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,599
I'm afraid someone else will take over

340
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,000
the Empress's place soon.

341
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Lady Sun is cunning

342
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,479
and seduces the Emperor.

343
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,400
If you ask me,

344
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,479
this Emperor is too young.

345
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,559
He lets this evil consort

346
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,799
confuse his mind

347
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,840
that he forgets

348
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
about the Great Ming's ancestral system.

349
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,919
Poor Empress.

350
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,080
She's a virtuous lady

351
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
who is never at fault.

352
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,599
She's truly a rare good empress.

353
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,760
Forget about the ancestral system
of the Great Ming.

354
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,880
This new emperor...

355
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,559
What's the story?

356
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,640
You really don't know?

357
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,159
Tell us about it.

358
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,719
Everyone is talking about it now.

359
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,640
Come on, tell us.

360
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,599
It wasn't even a year
the Late Emperor ascended the throne.

361
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,919
He suddenly passed away.

362
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,159
Think about it.

363
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,559
Don't you find it strange?

364
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,640
He finally couldn't wait.

365
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,479
Do you mean...

366
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,359
Prince of Han is ready with everything.

367
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,080
He's now waiting

368
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
for the right time.

369
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,760
Right time?

370
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,559
An emperor who gained his throne the wrong way

371
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,159
and betrayed his family.

372
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,559
How can

373
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,919
this country last long?

374
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,079
I'm willing to use my own hands

375
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:55,640
in exchange for her chance
to turn over a new leaf.

376
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,719
Did you see that?

377
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,439
Did you see that with your eyes?

378
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,479
Who else in this world

379
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,319
would do this

380
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,959
for you?

381
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,920
I have nightmares every night.

382
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,640
These hands were always smeared with blood.

383
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,479
I fear

384
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
that they won't be here one day

385
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,400
when I woke up one day.

386
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,160
Your hands are fine.

387
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,479
If they can take them away once,

388
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
they can take them away the second time.

389
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,719
As long as I don't get rid of the hidden danger,

390
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,760
I'll have to live in fear.

391
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,719
Are you really that scared?

392
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,520
Yes.

393
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,439
I'm scared.

394
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,280
But I have more hatred.

395
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
They knew how important

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
these hands were to me.

397
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,839
How could they do such a cruel thing?

398
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,280
I won't forgive.

399
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I'll never forgive them.

400
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,680
I shouldn't be here.

401
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,079
But I have no one else

402
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,520
to talk to

403
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
other than you.

404
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,079
I'm sorry. I should leave now.

405
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,280
That's not the real reason I'm here.

406
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,599
The truth is...

407
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,800
The truth is I've always wanted to tell you...

408
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,560
Actually...

409
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,160
No need to say it.

410
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,880
I knew it.

411
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,479
Mother,

412
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,319
Master,

413
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,040
and close friend.

414
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,560
They're all nothing but dreams.

415
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,479
How could you be an exception?

416
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,839
Directress Su.

417
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

418
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,119
You look

419
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,520
in a hurry.

420
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,800
Where are you going?

421
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,959
Your Highness,

422
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm on my way to the Palace Condiments Service

423
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,000
to verify this year's account book.

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Since Noble Consort Sun

425
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,199
takes charge of the palace affairs,

426
00:21:59,199 --> 00:21:59,959
she has been

427
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,280
ordering everyone about.

428
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,800
If you have no other orders,

429
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,520
I'll need to take my leave

430
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,680
to attend to other affairs.

431
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:11,920
Directress Su,

432
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,400
you're good at everything

433
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,680
from family background to cooking skills.

434
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,040
You can't help

435
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,359
when Noble Consort Sun is partial to Yin Ziping

436
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,119
because of her selfish reason.

437
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,400
You lost your chance at becoming the matron.

438
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,599
You did your best to serve the Empress.

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
At a critical time,

440
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,079
the Empress chose Yin Ziping instead of you.

441
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,479
It made you a laughingstock in the palace.

442
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:41,680
Are you

443
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,400
content with this?

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Noble Consort Sun is very influential

445
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,479
because she's the Emperor's favorite.

446
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Her Majesty

447
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is the Empress, the mother of the nation.

448
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,959
In the end,

449
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,199
masters will always be masters.

450
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
A female official like me

451
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,880
is only

452
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,160
a servant who'll be ordered about.

453
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,839
Even if I'm not content,

454
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
what can I do about it?

455
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I can help you.

456
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,560
You?

457
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,040
What did you say?

458
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Ruan Ju and the rest aren't back yet?

459
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,439
What about Wu Mang?

460
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,479
Chen You? Wang Gui?

461
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,839
What about Yang Sibao?

462
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
None of them

463
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,680
come back alive?

464
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,199
None.

465
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Not even one.

466
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Any news from Guangdong?

467
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,680
They followed the merchants by water

468
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,119
from Fujian.

469
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,680
They traveled passed Zhejiang and Suzhou.

470
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,400
The fleet should arrive at Tianjin's dock

471
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,400
in the middle of the last month at the latest.

472
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,800
Even if they travel by road,

473
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:47,959
there are relay stations in every place.

474
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,239
It's not likely to have no news at all.

475
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
We haven't heard from them for a long time.

476
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,239
Do you think something happened to them?

477
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,560
Something happened.

478
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,160
Come here.

479
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,239
Something bad happened.

480
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,040
Things have gone wrong!

481
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,839
It went wrong!

482
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,439
Get lost!

483
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,560
You can leave now.

484
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,239
What brings you here,
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu?

485
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,560
Why didn't you announce her arrival?

486
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,319
What do you take this place?

487
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
If His Majesty finds out,

488
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,280
he'll skin you.

489
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,839
Well,

490
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,439
this is the design

491
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,640
of the copper incense burner
that His Majesty wants.

492
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,119
I should give this

493
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,520
to you in person.

494
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,959
Thank you,
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

495
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,599
You look flustered.

496
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
What is it that you're looking for?

497
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,839
Your Highness,

498
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
His Majesty needs to recuperate in peace.

499
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,319
If there's nothing else,

500
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,800
please leave the design

501
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
and see your way out.

502
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,719
Eunuch Yuan,

503
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,640
look.

504
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,239
[Not used outside of the capital]
What's this?

505
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,600
[Loyalty No. 38]

506
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,920
Eunuch Yuan,

507
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,560
you rely on His Majesty's favor

508
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,479
and you secretly sent people

509
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,719
to collect and plunder
the people's wealth in Guangdong

510
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,640
on the pretext
of the imperial court's procurement.

511
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,959
Do you know of your crime?

512
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,560
If His Majesty

513
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,959
finds out about your crimes,

514
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,479
you'll lose your head.

515
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,479
Your Highness,

516
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,199
forgive me.

517
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,800
Please show me mercy.

518
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,199
Spare me, Your Highness.

519
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,319
Your Highness,

520
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,520
I know my mistake.

521
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,839
I know my mistake.

522
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:22,719
Hurry.

523
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:27,920
(If His Majesty)

524
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,119
(finds out about your crimes,)

525
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,239
(you'll lose your head.)

526
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,239
Your Highness,

527
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,520
I know my mistake.

528
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,199
I know my mistake.

529
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,520
Your Highness,

530
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,560
I know I've committed a crime.

531
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,680
I know my mistake.

532
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,520
What are you doing?

533
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,479
Get up.

534
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,520
Come on.

535
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:04,719
You...

536
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,239
Tea.

537
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:17,920
Tea.

538
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,160
Eunuch Yuan.

539
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:25,719
Tea.

540
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,760
Eunuch Yuan.

541
00:28:59,239 --> 00:28:59,959
The tea is cold.

542
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:01,599
We need a new one.

543
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,239
Eunuch Yuan,

544
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,199
let me do it.

545
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,719
Yuan Qi.

546
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

547
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,520
Bring me the memorials.

548
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,359
I'll get them now.

549
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll read it for you.

550
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,239
"I, Zhou Gan, have something to report.

551
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,719
Haiyan County of Jiaxing Prefecture is close

552
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,839
to the sea and has been attacked

553
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,359
by Japanese pirates.

554
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,959
A total of 2,000 guards were stationed

555
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,359
at Haining, Ganpu, and Zhapu
since the Hongwu Reign."

556
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,479
Nothing seems to work.

557
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,439
It hasn't eaten for three days now.

558
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,239
It looks dispirited all day.

559
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,319
Noble Consort Sun dotes on Yantai the most.

560
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,400
If she knows,

561
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,560
what should we do?

562
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,680
Can we get the female physician
to take a look at it?

563
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,199
It won't work.

564
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,520
Let me check on it.

565
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,119
Your Majesty,

566
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,439
what brings you here?

567
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,439
Didn't Noble Consort Sun go to Qianqing Palace

568
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,280
to wait on His Majesty?

569
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,719
The Empress is worried

570
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,119
that no one is taking care of His Majesty's pet.

571
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,400
So she especially comes to visit it.

572
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,439
How pitiful.

573
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
You can even say when you're hurting.

574
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,319
If I knew,

575
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,359
I'd rather have you run away from me

576
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,079
than see you sick.

577
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,599
I'll take it back to take care of it.

578
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,599
Go and prepare.

579
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

580
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,000
Imperial Physician Sheng.

581
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,680
Noble Consort Sun,

582
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,119
His Majesty is vexed from fever,

583
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,239
thirst, and fatigue.

584
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,920
The summer heat causes all these.

585
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:43,719
Put it down.

586
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,119
I'll prescribe

587
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,000
Liuyi Powder to dispel and clear heat.

588
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,319
He'll be fine after two to three days.

589
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,199
All right.

590
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,119
I'll prepare the prescription.

591
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,800
Fu Jiang,

592
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,839
is Yantai feeling better now?

593
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,199
The Empress went to the study.

594
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,760
She said she'll take care of it.

595
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:15,640
Why don't we take it back?

596
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,239
Her Majesty

597
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,520
truly loves Yantai.

598
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,920
We'll have to trouble her
to take care of it these two days.

599
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,560
Later, I'll list down

600
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:25,920
some of Yantai's

601
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,560
favorite things to be sent over.

602
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,680
You've been up for days.

603
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,400
Why don't you get some rest?

604
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,680
When His Majesty is awake,

605
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,880
I'll wake you up.

606
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,439
He'll ask

607
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,920
if today's memorials

608
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,160
are sent over

609
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,439
when he wakes up.

610
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
Where are the memorials?

611
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,640
Your Majesty.

612
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,719
Yuan Qi.

613
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:54,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:34,879
From tonight onward,

615
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:37,280
all memorials from the Office of Transmission

616
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,239
will be handed over

617
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,520
to Yang Shiqi to read

618
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,439
and draw a conclusion

619
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,479
before sending them to Qianqing Palace.

620
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

621
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,040
Huaping,

622
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,320
get my medicine box.

623
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,760
Huaping,

624
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,800
I want to save it.

625
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,199
Your Majesty,

626
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,280
this is His Majesty's

627
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,560
favorite pet.

628
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,600
He spoils it every day.

629
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,719
We can't take the risk.

630
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,719
You heard

631
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,239
how it cried sadly at night.

632
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
I want to give it a try.

633
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,399
Even if there's a glimmer of hope,

634
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,520
I still want to save it.

635
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,399
Does Her Majesty know how to treat a cat?

636
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,840
Her Majesty said

637
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,520
this medicine is specially prepared for Yantai,

638
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,479
and it has a pain-relieving effect.

639
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
We must not let anyone consume it by mistake.

640
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,479
Life and death are natural orders.

641
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,159
It's the same with a cat.

642
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,439
Why must we use medicine to prolong its life?

643
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:35,959
This vegetarian food smells good.

644
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,560
No, it's not.

645
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,120
What's wrong with you today?

646
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,120
Your Majesty,

647
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,560
the vegetarian dishes

648
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,639
for the Zhongyuan Festival are ready.

649
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,719
Deliver the dishes to His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager first

650
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,080
before delivering them to the imperial harem.

651
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,199
Your Majesty's illness has improved greatly.

653
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,800
But you haven't eaten

654
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
since noon yesterday.

655
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,399
I'm afraid you might suffer from a heat stroke.

656
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,360
Your body won't be able to stand it.

657
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,520
I've sent someone to prepare your meal.

658
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,239
Please have some before getting some rest.

659
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,159
I'm not hungry.

660
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,239
I have no appetite.

661
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,320
Your Highness.

662
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,439
Noble Consort Sun,

663
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,760
today is Zhongyuan Festival.

664
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,840
The Empress had prepared vegetarian dishes

665
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,760
for everyone in the imperial harem.

666
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:56,719
I can smell its aroma

667
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,040
from the food box.

668
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,479
Your Majesty.

669
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,919
Your arrogance

670
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
almost killed me.

671
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:05,719
You won't even

672
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,919
let Zijin go this time?

673
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,959
I don't understand what you're saying.

674
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,479
Yuan Qi.

675
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,040
Your Majesty.

676
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,320
Send the Empress back to Kunning Palace.

677
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,560
Without my order,

678
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,760
she's not to leave the palace.

679
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

680
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,399
Your Majesty,

681
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,080
what did I do wrong?

682
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:31,879
You should give me a chance to explain.

683
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,199
Your Majesty.

684
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:33,879
Your Majesty,

685
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,840
His Majesty is furious now.

686
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,520
Please say no more.

687
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,719
Please return to your palace.

688
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,639
Your Majesty,

689
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,479
I've known the Empress for many years.

690
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,520
I know her very well.

691
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,040
She would never do something like this.

692
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,840
But...

693
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,879
I bear firmly in my mind

694
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,120
what you've taught me.

695
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,360
But this concerns the Empress.

696
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,479
I dare not keep it a secret.

697
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:35,479
Noble Consort Sun

698
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,040
has always been on good terms
with Directress Yin.

699
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,679
How do we know if they didn't plot

700
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,679
to gain sympathy?

701
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:44,159
Your Majesty, Directress Yin is here.

702
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,399
Summon her.

703
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

704
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,159
Greetings, Your Majesty.

705
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,080
Rise.

706
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:00,320
I'd like to hear

707
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:01,800
your opinion

708
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,120
on what happened today.

709
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:03,800
Your Majesty,

710
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,280
Her Majesty is a kind person.

711
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,199
To relieve Yantai from pain,

712
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,719
Her Majesty ordered me
to add medicine to the cat's food.

713
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,840
I did as I was ordered.

714
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
After that...

715
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,479
(Because the medicine bottle
is from Kunning Palace,)

716
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,879
(I was afraid someone might eat it by mistake)

717
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:24,840
(or dispute about it.)

718
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,399
(So I got rid of it right away.)

719
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,719
Everyone at the Imperial Food Service

720
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,639
was busy preparing vegetarian dishes
because it was Zhongyuan Festival.

721
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,800
I was going to report it the next day.

722
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,280
But I didn't expect

723
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,959
Noble Consort Sun would vomit blood
and fainted that night.

724
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,439
I was reminded of the medicine.

725
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,320
So I checked under the peach blossom tree.

726
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:42,280
Someone had indeed stolen it.

727
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,399
Do you think

728
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,840
Noble Consort Sun's serious illness

729
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,679
has anything to do with Kunning Palace?

730
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,439
Noble Consort Sun is unconscious,

731
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,280
and the Empress becomes the suspect.

732
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,639
If we look at the intention
of the person behind this,

733
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,199
it's to drive a wedge between them

734
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,080
and bring chaos to the imperial harem.

735
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm more worried

736
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,439
that the Emperor would wrongfully

737
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,840
accuse the Empress out of rage.

738
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,360
If I may be bold,

739
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,919
I hope Your Majesty would take
this matter into your hand

740
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,239
and protect the Empress.

741
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,800
You said it in such a sensible manner.

742
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,800
Who taught you to say that?
