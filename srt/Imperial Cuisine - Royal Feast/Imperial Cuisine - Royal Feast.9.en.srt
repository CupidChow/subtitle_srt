[Royal Feast]

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,119
Help me organize the books.

4
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,000
[Xingyun Cottage]

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Highness,

6
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,399
verifying the yearly consumption

7
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
of military provisions all over the country

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
is an arduous task.

9
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,479
Our ministry is already undermanned,
to begin with.

10
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
This sudden edict

11
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,880
is basically putting us

12
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,440
in a great flurry.

13
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,279
Of course,

14
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,440
I'll carry out

15
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,080
Your Highness' orders.

16
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
It's just that the year is coming to an end.

17
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,759
I hope Your Highness could grant a grace period

18
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,199
for me to return and draft up a solution

19
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,199
and report back to Your Highness.

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
Your Highness,

21
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,440
there are officials

22
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,279
at every granary.

23
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,039
Filling in the statistics
based on their reports will do.

24
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,039
If we must send personnel to verify on site,

25
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,440
the selection of this personnel alone

26
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,039
needs to be done after countless

27
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,880
deliberations.

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,080
We must be extremely cautious.

29
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,440
In my opinion,

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
how about we put it aside first

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
and come up with proper planning?

32
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,679
Official Song, you have a point.

33
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,039
However, I sought an audience
with His Majesty yesterday.

34
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,000
He said eight months are too long.

35
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
So he only gave six months.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,399
So,

37
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,039
Official Song,

38
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm counting on you.

39
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,919
Sir,

40
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,360
this way, please.

41
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,119
I'll take my leave.

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
What's so funny?

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Have you done sorting the books?

44
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,079
Your Highness.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,239
Your Highness,

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
I have a question.

47
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,679
If I may be bold to ask,

48
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,679
what is this that Your Highness drew?

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,799
This is the fruit of the tribute from Sumatra.

50
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,119
It's called durian.

51
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
Grandfather dislikes its smell.

52
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,720
But I've tried it once.

53
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
It's fragrant and sweet.

54
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,119
Your Highness,

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,239
where are the foreign countries

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,239
and what are the local customs?

57
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
It's a task by the Imperial Food Service.

58
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,679
I have to come up with a daily menu
for the foreign envoys.

59
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,000
You sounded

60
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,839
like you couldn't wait to board a ship

61
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,959
and escape out of the country.

62
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,279
There were capable people
and scholars in the past

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,239
who were keen on seeking immortals
in foreign lands.

64
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
They didn't find any immortals.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
But there are several navigation logbooks.

66
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
If you're interested,

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,119
you can find it yourself.

68
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,359
Perhaps it's out on the shelf that's named "travel".

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,399
Your Highness,

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Consort Hu has sent someone
to invite you over again.

71
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:55,920
Your Highness.

72
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,239
You can clear the table.

73
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
His Highness won't be coming tonight.

74
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,959
Yes, Your Highness.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Eunuch Yuan.

76
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,359
Your Highness,

77
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
His Highness doesn't want you to wait in vain.

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,679
So he sent me to inform you.

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
So

80
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,079
he's not coming, right?

81
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,119
His Majesty has been keeping
His Highness busy with state affairs.

82
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,040
So His Highness is too busy.

83
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
When His Highness has spare time,

84
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm sure you're the first he'll think of first.

85
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,399
You can leave now.

86
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,839
Your Highness.

87
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,799
Jinshu,

88
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,279
it's my fault.

89
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,839
I broke his heart.

90
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Take a walk with me.

91
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,640
If someone disappoints you,

92
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,040
will you forgive her

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
if she wants to change her ways now?

94
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,760
Why aren't you saying anything?

95
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Your Highness,

96
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,320
who doesn't make mistakes?

97
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
It's never too late to change.

98
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,279
So, it's a good thing.

99
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
You're a strange one.

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
You did so much.

101
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,760
Yet, you keep quiet when you see me.

102
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
You knew I was talking about her.

103
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,559
Yet, you still want me to see her.

104
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
I told you to go

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
because you wanted to go.

106
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,839
Your Highness has doubts.

107
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,320
If you don't let it out,

108
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,760
how can you move on?

109
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
Why don't you be honest and ask for peace of mind?

110
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,200
Don't you agree?

111
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,519
As part of a royal family,

112
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,359
I don't ask for a true love
who'll live and die with me.

113
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,200
But I ask for a wife
who treats each other with respect.

114
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,200
But when I sit with her,

115
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
we don't feel comfortable.

116
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
Do you think

117
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
there's such a strange couple in this world?

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,359
Who will not cherish

119
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,400
a sincere heart?

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,039
As long as Your Highness treats her sincerely,

121
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
there will be a day she'll understand.

122
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
Are you happy

123
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,400
if I see her?

124
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,200
Seeing you worry

125
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
makes me worry.

126
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,400
Seeing you happy

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
makes me happy.

128
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,799
(Your Highness has doubts.)

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
(If you don't let it out,)

130
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
(how can you be move on?)

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,760
(Why don't you be honest
and ask for peace of mind?)

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,239
To Hongqing Palace.

133
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes, Your Highness.

134
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,020
[Uphold Grand Prosperity]

135
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,119
Greetings, Your Highness.

136
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,200
Your Highness,

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,359
Consort Hu is greeting the Crown Princess.

138
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,479
She'll return soon.

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,719
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

140
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,479
This is the Seventh Young Lady of the Hu family.

141
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,119
She's here to visit Consort Hu.

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,719
Why didn't you tell me earlier

143
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,840
that His Highness came back?

144
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,880
You were in the middle of a conversation
with the Crown Princess.

145
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,119
I dare not interrupt.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,599
Shanyuan?

147
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Why are you here?

148
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,159
No one informs me of this visit.

150
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,119
What's going on?

151
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,799
Why aren't you answering?

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,280
The Crown Princess granted Mother

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,599
a favor of visiting the palace previously.

154
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,799
Now you are ill,

155
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,119
Mother has been missing you.

156
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,039
But she can't walk freely.

157
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,239
So they sent Shanyuan to visit you instead.

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Me? Ill?

159
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,599
I'm not ill.

160
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
The Great Imperial Grandson's Consort
and Great Imperial Grandson have no children

161
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
after being married for a long time.

162
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,039
Not only the Crown Princess is worried about it.

163
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,799
Father and Mother are worried about this too.

164
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Big Sister,

165
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,919
I always think of my family.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
It doesn't matter how much I resent or hate you.

167
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,159
I still think of you as my only support
in the palace.

168
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,479
You're the only person I could trust.

169
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,799
Just because I bear no children

170
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,280
and fail to bring more glory to the Hu family,

171
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,919
all of you...

172
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,599
Each and every one of you...

173
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Why do you treat me so ruthlessly?

174
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,200
Why?

175
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
Answer me.

176
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,080
Third Sister.

177
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,880
No wonder His Highness left

178
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,919
the moment he arrived.

179
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,679
He thought as his wife,

180
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,799
I was offering my own sister to my husband

181
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
for my selfish desires

182
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,919
to appease my family.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,679
All right.

184
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,320
Since you turn your backs on me,

185
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,039
I'll go along with you.

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Guards!

187
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,799
Take this servant away.

188
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Punish her with 30 strokes

189
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,039
and chase her out from the palace.

190
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Your Highness,

191
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,799
you're...

192
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,919
Your Highness!

193
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,799
Your Highness!

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
Please have mercy on me!

195
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,200
Your Highness!

196
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,760
Your Highness!

197
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,159
Young Lady, save me!

198
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,239
I was following your orders.

199
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm only doing what I was told!

200
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,400
-Your Highness!
-Jinshu has been your maid since young.

201
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,559
She's your closest maid.

202
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,799
I'll never keep a maid

203
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
who could betray me and deceive me anytime

204
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,919
for the Hu family.

205
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,599
Get her out from the palace now.

206
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,840
From now on,

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
no one from the Hu family

208
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,760
is allowed to enter the palace without my order.

209
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,599
You better listen too.

210
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,400
From today on,

211
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,479
I'll live by following my heart.

212
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
If you

213
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,159
or Father

214
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,039
disobeys me again,

215
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
don't blame me for being ruthless.

216
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
Big Sister,

217
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,280
Third Sister...

218
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Why did Third Sister change so much?

219
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,599
This change is a good thing.

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
If she's still ignorant

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,159
like before,

222
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,640
she won't survive in this palace.

223
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,119
With this change,

224
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
she behaves more like
the Great Imperial Grandson's Consort now.

225
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,239
Let's go.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
I'll send you out of the palace.

227
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,239
Your Highness.

228
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,559
Your Highness.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Your Highness.

230
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
Consort Hu is still waiting outside.

231
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,880
No need to inform me
of anything regarding her in the future.

232
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes, Your Highness.

233
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,479
Wait.

234
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,719
I'll lead the way for Consort Hu now.

235
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,559
Your Highness.

236
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,320
I... I'll go...

237
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,559
Tell her

238
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,919
that it's a mess here.

239
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,479
Tell her to arrange them.

240
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,000
Your Highness,

241
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
I understand.

242
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,880
Can you tell His Highness

243
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,119
that I need to see him urgently?

244
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,159
Your Highness,

245
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm sure you know His Highness' temper.

246
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,960
The more you want to see him,

247
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,239
the more upset he will be.

248
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,320
How about this?

249
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,400
Go back for now.

250
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,520
When His Highness is no longer upset,

251
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
you can come and apologize to him.

252
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,400
It'll be in the past, then.

253
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,440
Your Highness,

254
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,479
the wind is strong.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,159
Let's return for now.

256
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,919
[Navigation Logbook]

257
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,719
I can't find the book I want.

258
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
Do you know how to organize them?

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
Answer me when I ask you a question.

260
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Your Highness,

261
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,760
are you asking me

262
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
or asking a maidservant?

263
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,719
What's the difference?

264
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,559
Your Highness is right.

265
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
I'm a maidservant.

266
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
What did you say?

267
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
I advised Your Highness to meet Consort Hu.

268
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,359
Now, you're venting your anger on me.

269
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,239
Your Highness should know

270
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,159
that everything I've done for you

271
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,599
isn't what a maidservant would do for her master.

272
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,520
You...

273
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,919
I adore you.

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Everything I did for you

275
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,840
was what a woman would do for a man she admires.

276
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,960
To please Your Highness,

277
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,319
I can endure disappointment

278
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
and heartbreak

279
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,359
to advise you to meet Consort Hu.

280
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
However,

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
Your Highness threw the books I organized

282
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,079
like worn-out shoes here.

283
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,439
It's not the books that Your Highness threw out.

284
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680
But my heart.

285
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,439
You...

286
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,959
How dare you speak to me this way.

287
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,319
Your Highness,

288
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,239
you treat me the way a master would treat
a maidservant.

289
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
From today on,

290
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,839
I'll also

291
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,239
treat you the way a maidservant
would treat her master.

292
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,920
It's not my duty to tidy up the study.

293
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,719
It's normal if Your Highness is not satisfied.

294
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,920
However, I'll accept any punishment.

295
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,439
If Your Highness has no other instructions,

296
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,520
I'll take my leave now.

297
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,719
What did she just say?

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,319
She...

299
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,640
She said she adores you.

300
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
She said she would treat me

301
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
like a maidservant would treat a master.

302
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
Get her back here.

303
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,280
Go!

304
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,599
I'm going to get her now.

305
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
His Highness demands you to come back!

306
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Come back here!

307
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,599
You're done for this time.

308
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
Your Highness.

309
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,199
How about ginseng pig or cured fish roe?

310
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,280
No.

311
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,359
Someone used those already.

312
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,640
What other ingredients are left?

313
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,760
I'll find a way.

314
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,359
Are you sure?

315
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,359
You can go.

316
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,160
Get back to work.

317
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,680
Quickly now.

318
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,719
Go now.

319
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,000
Look at that.

320
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,359
Why is she slicing cucumber?

321
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,000
Is she giving up?

322
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,359
Is he here?

323
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,760
He's coming.

324
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,520
Your Highness, please have a seat.

325
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,119
Father,

326
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,479
I heard you're ill.

327
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,760
Have you seen the Imperial Physician?

328
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,040
What illness are you suffering from?

329
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,160
I have a headache.

330
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:13,680
I mean,

331
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,839
it's over here.

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
My heart beats...

333
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
Something is wrong.

334
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,119
I'm aching

335
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
all over.

336
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,599
Since you're not well,

337
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,079
you should recuperate in peace.

338
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,520
If there are any errands,

339
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
I can help you do them.

340
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:41,760
Really?

341
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,439
Yes.

342
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:45,680
That's great.

343
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,560
Officer You.

344
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
No need to be serious.

345
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm not here looking for trouble.

346
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,959
Official Liu enters the palace

347
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,119
to check the daily menu for the envoys.

348
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,479
I was only leading him the way.

349
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,599
Matron Meng,

350
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,119
last year, the Court of Imperial Entertainments'
daily menu almost caused trouble

351
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,079
because the taste was unfit.

352
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,800
The Crown Prince will personally supervise
this matter this year

353
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,719
by order of the Emperor.

354
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,319
There must be no mistakes.

355
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,319
Officer You had dealt with those people a lot.

356
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,959
That's why I invited him for a tasting.

357
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,280
Sirs,

358
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,479
please come this way.

359
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,900
[Lion's Head]

360
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,119
The meat is succulent and flavorful.

361
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,439
But it's not greasy.

362
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,160
It's completely different
from the usual pork we have.

363
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,959
It must be the tribute ginseng pig
from the U-Tsang Military Commission.

364
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,839
You're right.

365
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,719
This breed lives in the mountainous terrain,

366
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,199
drinks from mountain spring water,

367
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,239
and only consume wild ginseng
and pine mushroom as their diet.

368
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,520
That's why the meat is delicate, savory,

369
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,359
and tender.

370
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,040
I was considering

371
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,560
the fact that these guests come from overseas.

372
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,160
They might have never tried delicacies
from mountains.

373
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,719
(That's why I made soup from ginseng pig's spine)

374
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
(and used its shank for Lion's Head.)

375
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,599
(Meat like this)

376
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,479

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,239
(no matter how it's cooked.)

378
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,280
Well said.

379
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,119
Only our Great Ming has

380
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,119
such a delicacy

381
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,359
as ginseng pig.

382
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,239

[Steamed Tapertail Anchovy with Gold Foil]

384
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,800
Prepared with ginger and spices.

385
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Undercooked smell floating in the air.

386
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,839
Pufferfish are poisonous.

387
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,119
Perch is tasteless.

388
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,439
Tapertail anchovy is indeed the best.

389
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,280
But it's not even the spring season yet.

390
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,880
You actually tried to pass it off
with a dried tapertail anchovy.

391
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,719
You even sprinkled gold foil on top.

392
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,359
It's already a mediocre color.

393
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,280
Does decorating it with this

394
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,280
make it a perfect dish?

395
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,439
Who are you trying to fool?

[Pepper Pork Tripe Soup]

400
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Why did you add pepper?

401
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,640
Pepper was shipped

402
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,800
(to my hometown)

403
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,839
(from Calicut through Sumatra.)

404
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,000

she's a new tribute woman.

407
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,359
We have more than enough pepper
in the storehouse.

408
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,680
Yet, you make assumptions

409
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,000
and treat such an inexpensive ingredient
as something valuable.

410
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,239
Wouldn't that be a lack of manners?

411
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,640
I have limited knowledge.

412
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,800
Please forgive me, Sirs.

413
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,239
What is it that lack of manners?

414
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
We didn't know Your Highness would be here.

415
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,479
Forgive us for not receiving you.

416
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,359
It's a small issue to treat guests inadequately.

417
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,280
Tarnishing the honor of our nation
is a bigger issue.

418
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,359
I've heard what you said just now.

419
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,680
All the land belongs

420
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,439
to the Emperor.

421
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,400
All the people are

422
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,079
the Emperor's subjects.

423
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,079
Since the Qin and Han Dynasties,

424
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,959
China has constantly
contacted foreign countries.

425
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,959
As for Great Ming, all the more so.

426
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,119
Grandfather implored countless times

427
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,119
not to bully the few

428
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,280
and not to bully the weak

429
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:46,199
wherever the traveling merchants went,
whether by sea or land.

430
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,319
Some places have no knowledge
of weather changes.

431
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,680
So we provide them with an almanac

432
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,959
and teach them to farm.

433
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,719
Some places use banana leaves as cutleries.

434
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,800
The people only consume cold food.

435
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
So we trade pottery and porcelain,

436
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,160
offer acupuncture and medicinal herbs.

437
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,959
Some places have no etiquette and customs.

438
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
The war is never-ending.

439
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,680
So we pacify the war.

440
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,520
Our fleet is not only bringing

441
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,760
beautiful silk or ceramics.

architecture, the art of sea navigation,

445
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,839
and many Chinese classics

446
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,800
in overseas countries.

447
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,439
Why are we doing this?

448
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,319
A life of destitution

449
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,199
leads to chaos.

450
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,599
Only when the world is peaceful

451
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
can people enjoy a peaceful life.

452
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,239
So

453

if she doesn't know, you must teach her.

454
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,560
Also, give the same treatment to all.

-Your Highness, please forgive us.

456
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,839
They're confined in the palace,
so they have limited knowledge of the world.

457
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,839
Your Highness' lesson is better than
a decade of my work.

458
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,199
All of you must remember today's lesson.

459
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,079
A person should have a broad mind and vision.

460
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,560

A type of red shrimp
from the sea of Kuaiji was mentioned

466
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,079
in the collection of herbs in the Tang Dynasty.

467
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
A bigger one is one chi long.

468
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,520
Its antennas look like hairpins.

469
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,880
It's exactly the same as
the colorful giant shrimp

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
with a huge abnormal body recorded

471
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,319
in Taiping County Annal.

472
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,359
Therefore, it's also called
"God of Shrimp" in Quanzhou Prefecture.

473
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,719
Today, I used the traditional method
of the local fishermen

474
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,359
to prepare Splendid Lobster Rice.

475
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920

Your Highness,

the "rice" among the fishermen,

479
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,800
often refers to fish and shrimp.

480
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,239
Lobster meat dipped in the sauce
has a unique flavor.

481
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,719
It seems you're back at the ship's bow.

there are some carefree
and joyful feelings I can't describe.

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,239
It's fresh, savory, and chewy.

485
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880

It's crisp and sweet.

496
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
It's far better than steamed taro.

But it's the Emperor's edict, after all.

Since Father is ill,

512
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,160
I had to do it.

When entertaining guests,

521
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:02,199
we should indeed make them feel at home.

00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,639
All right.

561
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,320
Miss Yao,

562
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,479
haven't you been looking

563
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,000
for this navigation logbook?

564
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,399
I brought it for you.

565
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,080
I don't need it anymore.

566
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,800
I already brought it here.

567
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,520
Just take it.

568
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,280
Please thank His Highness for his reward.

569
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,800
Sure.

570
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,919
(Tell her.)

571
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,239
(One day,)

572
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,840
(our fleet will bring back)

573
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,639
(not only jewelry and spices,)

574
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,239
(but also more products
for the benefit of the Chinese people.)

575
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,159
I'm dead.

576
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,719
I forgot to tell her the most important thing.

577
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,040
Forget it. Let's go.

578
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,560
"Rewards?"

579
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,879
Is that what she said?

580
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,360
I wouldn't dare to convey the wrong message.

581
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,439
That's what Miss Yao said.

582
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,439
Hurry up!

583
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,320
Come on.

584
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,040
Quickly now.

585
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,800
Quickly.

586
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,639
Eunuch Yuan,

587
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,040
here you go.

588
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,120
Send it yourself.

589
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,479
Go.

590
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,280
Serve it.

591
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,479
Yes, Your Highness.

592
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,919
What did you prepare today?

593
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,360
Your Highness,

594
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,760
according to custom practices,

595
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,639
the Imperial Food Service prepared food

596
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,120
based on the Court of Imperial Entertainments'
daily menu.

597
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,040
Yao Zijin.

598
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,120
I'm ready to receive punishment, Your Highness.

599
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
What wrong did you commit?

600
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,280
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

601
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,760
Get out.

602
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,360
I'll take my leave.

603
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,760
Persuade her to come back.

604
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,560
Don't come back until she comes back.

605
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:51,080
Your Highness,

606
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,520
how should I persuade her?

607
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,280
I can't stand her looking indifferent.

608
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,439
Your Highness,

609
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,080
Miss Yao didn't behave indifferently.

610
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,159
That's how a servant serves a master.

611
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:01,959
They answer carefully

612
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,840
without overstepping their boundary

613
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,080
when asked.

614
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,679
Where is the mistake in that?

615
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
Where's the mistake?

616
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,360
I never treated her like a servant!

617
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,000
Go quickly.

618
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,520
I said go!

619
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,919
Your Highness,

620
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,199
look at this.

621
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,479
(This month,)

622
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,560
(His Highness takes tonic.)

623
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,879
(Should not eat food that causes heat.)

624
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,679
(Should eat early.)

625
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,040
(Prepare duck with lotus seed and job's tears stew.)

626
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,600
(Remove shredded pork with egg-white
and silver carp with tofu.)

627
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,639
(Roasted goose, mix a little with shamrock pea.)

628
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:46,879
(Knife-cut noodles.)

629
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,439
Go after her.

630
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,199
This time,

631
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:25,840
go on my behalf.

632
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,760
Yes, Your Highness.

633
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,140
[Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold]

634
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,120
Crow-dipper,

635
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:53,000
three spoons.

636
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
Jinya powder.

637
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:23,879
Zijin,

638
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,439
what do you think about my carving?

639
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,080
Is it beautiful?

640
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,399
Too much detail.

641
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,639
The pattern is too dense.

642
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,760
But you've improved a lot.

643
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:39,600
Keep up the good work.

644
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,120
Matron Meng.

645
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:58,020
[Fine Meal, Divine Work]

646
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,239
Mr. Chen.

647
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,520
Matron Meng, you're being too courteous.

648
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:04,639
I don't deserve

649
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,399
to be addressed as such.

650
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:09,320
I remember vaguely when Hanying just entered
the palace for training,

651
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,000
you once served as a teacher.

652
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
It's right to address you as such.

653
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,879
May I know if you're here

654
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,959
by Great Imperial Grandson's order?

655
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,479
Today, Official Yang entered the palace

656
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,280
and tasted Miss Yao's Suzhou pastry.

657
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
He finds it tasteful.

658
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,360
So he wanted his cook to make the same thing.

659
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,959
I'm here to ask for the recipe.

660
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:27,560
This is only a small matter.

661
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,560
I can ask Zijin to write it and send it over.

662
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,399
No need to take the trouble
to come all the way here.

663
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:38,159
Thank you, Matron Meng.

664
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,120
I'll send someone to pick it up later.

665
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,399
Sure.

666
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,199
Mr. Chen, take care.

667
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,840
Please forgive me, Matron.

668
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,040
I was afraid Zijin might miss out on
a bright future.

669
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
How bright can a future be

670
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,639
to win favors with beauty?

671
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,879
It's good to be young and ignorant.

672
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,800
They're free from a lot of worries and sorrows.

673
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,080
The palace has its rules,

674
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,600
and female officials have dignities too.

675
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,679
As long as you're part
of the Imperial Food Service,

676
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,040
you'll always be under my protection.

677
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,639
There's no reason for anyone
to be taken away by force.

678
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,280
If you do such nonsense again,

679
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:21,479
I won't spare you.

680
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,120
Yes, Matron.

681
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,679
The taste isn't right.

682
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:43,000
Your Highness,

683
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,520
today's dish is

684
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,000
the same as yesterday's.

685
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,120
What's different?

686
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,760
Try it yourself.

687
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,159
I dare not.

688
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,320
Can't you tell?

689
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,080
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

690
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,199
It's not the dish.

691
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,919
His Highness is not in a good mood.

692
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:15,919
Your Highness,

693
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,320
the same food will taste different

694
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,919
if the person who eats it

695
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,120
is in a different mood.

696
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,800
I think it's more like
the cook didn't prepare it wholeheartedly.
