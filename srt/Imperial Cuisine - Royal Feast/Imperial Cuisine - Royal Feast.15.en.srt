00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,375
[Radish Omelet]

4
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,639
Is this pickled radish?

5
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Pickled radish relieves summer heat
and increases appetite.

7
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,760
(Wrapping them in eggs)

8
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,760
(and wild scallion makes them)

9
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,720
(more sweet and fragrant.)

10
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,100
[Rice Soup]

11
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,679
Scorched rice?

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,119
(With pine wood as firewood,)

14
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:24,440
(it absorbs the flavor from the rice and wood.)

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
(Along with scorched rice,)

16
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,600
(rice soup with pickles
tastes fragrant and sweet.)

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,600
Unfortunately, such ordinary firewood
and rice can't be shared

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,000
by the people in the capital.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,479
How come?

20
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,600
Forgive me for my impertinence.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,399
I permit you to speak.

22
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,080
If I may be bold,

23
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,600
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,440
Tianshou Mountain, and Western Hills,

25
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,000
where the Imperial Mausoleum is located,

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
are where it's prohibited for woodcutting.

27
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,399
If the people in the capital want to get firewood,

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
they often need to get it hundreds of miles away.

29
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,039
In ancient times, the mountains,
forests, and rivers

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
are shared with the people.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,479
It's not exclusive to the royal family.

32
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,639
Pass down my decree.

33
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,759
From the Juyong Pass
that connects to Tianshou Mountain

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
all the way to the east,

35
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,199
woodcutting is forbidden
in all mountains and forests

36
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,399
to avoid disturbing our ancestors.

37
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,119
Lift the restrictions
on other mountains and forests.

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,119
Rise.

40
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,119
No wonder Noble Consort Guo often praises you

42
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,320
and says you sympathize
with the people's hardship.

43
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,600
When you're in my presence,

44
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,520
do remind me of this.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,279
I dare not.

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
No need to be modest.

47
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,039
Do you have something else to tell me?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Your Majesty's compassion
for the people's hardship

49
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,520
is indeed a blessing of all the people.

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,520
Yet, some people deceive everyone

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
and go against Your Majesty's intention.

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,720
I dare not to bother you rashly.

53
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,919
But since Your Majesty has asked,

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,399
I must answer.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,479
Speak!

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Jing Quan, the minister of the Court
of Imperial Entertainments, wants to follow

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,640
the old practice and go to Nanjing
to gather gem-faced civets.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,519
Take them all away.

59
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,480
Yes.

60
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,519
Why are they checking the accounts suddenly?

61
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,480
Will the Imperial Food Service be implicated?

62
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,440
What's going on?

63
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,640
The minister of the Court
of Imperial Entertainments wants

64
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
to follow the old practice and go to Nanjing
to gather gem-faced civets.

65
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,559
It was to please the Emperor.

66
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,679
His Majesty just finished

67
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,920
a task that was of no urgency.

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,279
How can His Majesty cause trouble for the people

69
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,160
because of his appetite?

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,600
Not only did His Majesty strip Jing Quan
of his rank at that instant,

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
but also ordered a thorough investigation.

72
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,640
After the investigation,

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,119
it was found that Jing Quan stole items
from the storehouses

74
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,720
to fill his own pocket

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,440
from selling them.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,559
Someone from the Imperial Food Service
must have helped him.

77
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,040
She tried to transfer you to the Banquets Office.

78
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
But trouble comes knocking

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,679
at her door now.

80
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,320
Get back to work.

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Yes.

83
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,399
Wei.

84
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,239
Master.

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,600
Yuehua,

86
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,959
I've taught you

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,799
everything I know.

88
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,359
You must remember

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,519
to practice more from now on.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't fail the expectations I have of you.

91
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,679
Master!

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,399
Master, where are you going?

93
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Matron Meng,

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,079
the Palace Surveillance found
the Imperial Food Service's accounts...

95
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,640
I already know about this.

96
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,200
Do you know

97
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,480
that Directress Wang just took all the blame

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,959
at the Palace Surveillance?

99
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,079
I didn't expect there's someone so loyal

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,119
to someone like Hu?

101
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,760
Master has never known anything but cooking.

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
She doesn't manage the accounts at all.

103
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,119
She must have nothing to do
with what Jing Quan did.

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,799
She's innocent.

105
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,880
You should find

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,640
the person behind all these, then.

107
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,000
I know you were the one
who reported it to His Majesty.

108
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,880
It can only be helped
by the person who started it.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,359
Only you can save Directress Wang.

110
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,160
Hu helped Jing Quan forge
the accounts for embezzlement

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,040
to stabilize her position as the matron
of the Imperial Food Service.

112
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,239
Why should I help someone like that?

113
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,720
I beg you

114
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,040
to forgive her.

115
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:40,760
Let her go.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,040
Are you begging me?

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes.

118
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,959
I'm begging you.

119
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm begging you!

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,239
Yuehua,

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,279
I took the liberty to take the fall

122
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,839
for your mistakes

123
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,079
when I met the Crown Princess.

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
I did it

125
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,119
because it is a mother's nature

126
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
to protect her child.

127
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,320
However,

128
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,279
everything is up to you

129
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,200
from now on.

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
Master! Master!

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,440
Is it possible to give me a moment with her?

132
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,719
We don't have much time left.

133
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,760
So don't take too long.

134
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,159
Master,

135
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,039
why are you doing this for her?

136
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,799
I met her when I entered the palace at 17.

137
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:27,960
At the time,

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
I was frail

139
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,960
and often suffered from beatings and hunger.

140
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,440
She was the only one
who risked her life to protect me.

141
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,159
I know she's not a good person.

142
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,640
But I want to protect her

143
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
because

144
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,960
she's my only friend in this palace.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
They said you were stripped of your rank
and to be sent back to your hometown.

146
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,960
Does that mean I'll never see you again?

147
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm only returning to my home.

148
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,080
His Majesty was lenient with the punishment.

149
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:03,919
After this,

150
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,280
you must take care of yourself

151
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,960
when I'm no longer around.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
Understand?

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,159
It's time to leave now.

154
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,719
Don't cry.

155
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,260
[Foods Office]

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,239
Master took the fall of you.

157
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,559
Yet, you were too scared to show up.

158
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,960
You're truly heartless.

159
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,679
If I showed up,

160
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,520
it'd give someone something to hold against me.

161
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,359
Then her sacrifice

162
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,919
will be in vain.

163
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,039
Zijin,

164
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,080
look.

165
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,280
What do you think?

166
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,039
This one is ugly.

167
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,880
This...

168
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,880
It took me ages to arrange these.

169
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,919
Yin Ziping,

170
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,200
it's better you don't do it

171
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
if you can't do it perfectly.

172
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,559
Come on.

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,919
You're always like this.

174
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,919
You'd do it one by one if it doesn't look right.

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,559
Demand for perfection is an illness too.

176
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,679
You...

177
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,799
Do it again.

178
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,239
Food plating is like painting.

179
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,479
You need to know simplicity.

180
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
Having more doesn't mean it's better.

181
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,119
Again.

182
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,960
Ziping,

183
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,760
the one above.

184
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,640
If one doesn't work hard,

185
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,559
one will be at a disadvantage.

186
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,440
Stop dallying.

187
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,760
Continue with your practice.

188
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,080
Yes.

189
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,520
Matron Meng.

190
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,640
The leftovers can be sent to the Medicines Office
to make chrysanthemum powder.

191
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,359
Don't be wasteful.

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,840
Yes.

193
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,679
I'm not an expert in medicinal food.

194
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,479
You'll have to depend on yourself in the future.

195
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,880
But it's not a big problem.

196
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,440
The Imperial Food Service

197
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,280
recruits thirty palace maids every year.

198
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,400
Only a couple would be good at cooking.

199
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,119
I can only show you the way.

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
It'll depend on your capability

201
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
as for how far you can go.

202
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,320
I understand, Matron Meng.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Stop wasting time.

204
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,719
Matching colors in food presentation

205
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,080
is sophisticated.

206
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,200
A meal shouldn't only be tasteful.

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
It should also let people have the desire to eat.

208
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,080
The meal has to have character,

209
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,599
even if it has perfect colors, smells, and tastes.

210
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,960
We must know the value
of a poem lies in its meaning,

211
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,919
a painting in its expression of emotion,

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,520
and delicacy in its aesthetic appeal.

213
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
When someone knows

214
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,400
who cooked the dish they've tasted
without asking,

215
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,640
that would be the end of your apprenticeship.

216
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
If that's considered the end
of the apprenticeship,

217
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,239
what is the highest level, then?

218
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,400
It's too early for you to ask that.

219
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,400
Keep plating.

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
I, hereby bow to you, Master.

221
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
I'll let you sort out

222
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,599
the recipes of the past dynasties.

223
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,119
You must be skilled with ancient
and modern techniques

224
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,719
to fully grasp the cooking techniques.

225
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
How can you achieve anything

226
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,520
if you can't take this blow?

227
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,880
Matron Hu.

228
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:24,880
Before she left,

229
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,719
she was most worried about you.

230
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,400
I heard

231
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,679
you've started to restore
the Tang Dynasty's scholars' banquet menu.

232
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Are you going to stop where you're at

233
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,239
because no one is guiding you now?

234
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,320
It's good to be ambitious.

235
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,280
But your strength needs to be on par with it.

236
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,080
Otherwise, it'll only be your wishful thinking.

237
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,400
You have a long journey ahead of you.

238
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,400
Yes.

239
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,760
Your Majesty.

240
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:03,004
[Benevolence and Care]

241
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,680
Her Majesty has been suffering from dizziness,

242
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,520
a fast heartbeat,
and abdominal pain since morning.

243
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,359
What is causing all these?

244
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,239
How long has it been?

245
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,400
Her Majesty was busy
with the palace affairs before this.

246
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,800
Later, it was the funeral.

247
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,520
Her Majesty didn't want to trouble others.

248
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,560
So she has been holding it in.

249
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,760
She has had these symptoms
for more than three months.

250
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,400
She even bled last night.

251
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,439
One more thing...

252
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,319
Menses?

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,760
It's the slippery pulse.

254
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,160
Directress Pan,

255
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
what nonsense is this?

256
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,079
Did you feel the pulse properly?

257
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,040
I've checked her ulna pulse. It flows ceaselessly.

258
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,560
The pulse isn't obvious
because Her Majesty is frail

259
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,599
and accompanied
by a fast heartbeat and sweating.

260
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,640
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

261
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,359
It's joyful news, Your Majesty.

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,640
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

263
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,280
Our fore founder has said

264
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,760
that human feelings change endlessly,

265
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,239
and customary rites adapt to changes.

266
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,119
When a parent just passed away,

267
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,119
the descendants will cry piteously
from morning until dusk,

268
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,000
mourn for three years,

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,439
and be forbidden from engaging
in marital relations.

270
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,119
Our forefathers were heartless.

271
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,239
Now, Your Majesty has been pregnant
for more than three months.

272
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,760
So it's not considered
to have broken the mourning period.

273
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,920
If the diagnosis is true,

274
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:11,640
we only need Hegan decoction
to warm the meridian and stop bleeding.

275
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,599
Your Majesty will recover
in less than half a month.

276
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,800
It's clearly an illness.

277
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,160
How can you say it's pregnancy?

278
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,680
What kind of mediocre

279
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,880
is the Imperial Academy of Medicine employing?

280
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Your Majesty.

281
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,839
Directress Pan.

282
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,319
Her Majesty's pulse seems to be a puzzle.

283
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,280
How can you be certain

284
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,839
that it's the slippery pulse?

285
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,079
You only took office in less than half a year.

286
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,319
Who are you

287
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,319
to refute my diagnosis?

288
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,640
Directress Pan, I beg to differ.

289
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,520
Do disease and diagnosis

290
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,280
have anything to do with one's position

291
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,560
and qualification?

292
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,439
Administrative Assistant Dai also said
it's a pregnant woman's pulse.

293
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,040
What's there to argue about?

294
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,359
Since Official Hu thinks the same,

295
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
you have no other comments, right?

296
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,959
The Medicines Office is one
of the Imperial Food Service's offices.

297
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,479
I'm only a sixth-ranked female official.

298
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,560
I dare not to defy you openly.

299
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,400
But as a female physician,

300
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,040
my work is to treat patients.

301
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,839
Since I didn't feel any pregnancy pulse,

302
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,319
no one could change my mind

303
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
even if His Majesty was present.

304
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,040
You...

305
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,719
Matron Hu, please don't take it to heart.

306
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:52,920
Let it be.

307
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,680
Didn't Noble Consort Guo ask His Majesty

308
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,199
to send a female physician

309
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,920
to treat her grandmother, Madam Yan?

310
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,520
I think Directress Jiang is
the best person for the job.

311
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,319
Yes.

312
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,920
I'll count on the Imperial Food Service

313
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,520
to take care of Her Majesty's meal.

314
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,479
Matron Hu,

315
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,400
why is Directress Jiang so arrogant?

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,839
During the Western Han Dynasty,

317
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,479
a famous female physician, Yi Shuo,
practiced medicine to help the people.

318
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,119
After that,

319
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,400
recruiting female physicians became a custom
for the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

320
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,319
The female physicians of the Medicines Office

321
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,680
are either famous doctors
who are recommended by local authorities

322
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,319
or from a family of physicians.

323
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
Each of them has unique skills

324
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
far more than ordinary physicians.

325
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,199
However,

326
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,239
no matter how medically skilled a physician is,

327
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,839
they may not necessarily see
what's happening in the palace.

328
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:58,959
Is it salty?

329
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,520
Just right.

330
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,439
Yao Zijin.

331
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,479
Her Majesty is pregnant.

332
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
The Imperial Academy of Medicine prescribed
Hegan decoction

333
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
to warm Her Majesty.

334
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
She needs to nurse herself with medicinal food.

335
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,119
From this day forth,

336
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,079
you'll be assisting Su Yuehua

337
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,920
in preparing the meals for Kunning Palace.

338
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,239
Matron Meng,

339
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,199
why not let me assist Yuehua?

340
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,760
You've joined the Imperial Food Service
for a long time.

341
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,199
Have you memorized the first volume
of the "Principle of Correct Diet?"

342
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,199
Can you tell apart
between angelica root and notopterygium root?

343
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,959
What about perilla seeds and dodder seeds?

344
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
With your capability,

345
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,839
you're delusional to think
of preparing Her Majesty's meal.

346
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
If you think you have a long life,

347
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,560
you should just hang yourself

348
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,479
and not implicate everyone
at the Imperial Food Service.

349
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Don't look at me like that.

350
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,719
At the Imperial Food Service,

351
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,599
food preparations come first.

352
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:01,959
Yes.

353
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,560
She's not being herself today.

354
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,560
Matron Hu turned her back on you

355
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,959
and insisted on transferring you
to the Banquets Office.

356
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,280
But Matron Meng stopped that from happening.

357
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Now, she recommends Su Yuehua
to the Kunning Palace

358
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,199
to put pressure on you.

359
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,359
Now that Her Majesty is pregnant,

360
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,599
which is a great opportunity,

361
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,319
why would she let you share the credit?

362
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:33,520
Have you finished the tasks
Matron Meng assigned to you?

363
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,000
The landscape painting was so confusing.

364
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,160
I can't figure it out at all.

365
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,439
You have to teach me.

366
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,560
-Come on.
-All right.

367
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,959
This is what Administrative Assistant Dai
prescribes for Her Majesty.

368
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,079
The Imperial Academy of Medicine will send
a prescription for the medicinal food every day.

369
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,199
Just prepare the meals
according to the prescriptions.

370
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,160
You have to check it yourself.

371
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,760
There must be no ingredient
that clashes in the medicinal food.

372
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,400
Please rest assured.

373
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll do my best.

374
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,319
No,

375
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,680
let Yao Zijin do everything.

376
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,760
You don't have to do anything.

377
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,680
Your Majesty,

378
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,839
this is crucian carp ginger soup
and congee with lotus seeds.

379
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,959
It's a medicinal food prescribed
by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

380
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,640
It's to prevent miscarriage and calm the mind.

381
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,479
Quiet.

382
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,839
Greetings, Mother.

383
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,319
Kneel outside.

384
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:05,640
Mother,

385
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,319
I heard Imperial Physician Sheng
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine

386
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,760
cured the Late Emperor's paralysis.

387
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,280
His skills are exceptional.

388
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Why don't we summon him to take a look?

389
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,479
Why did no one summon him here

390
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,119
if we have such a physician?

391
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,839
Your Majesty,

392
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,719
Imperial Physician Sheng
is an expert in paralysis.

393
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,760
He only treated the Late Emperor in the past.

394
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,880
He has never treated anyone
from the imperial harem.

395
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,000
How about we ask

396
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,760
His Majesty first
before summoning Physician Sheng?

397
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,359
Go.

398
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
Are you sure it's bush cherry pits congee?

399
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,359
Yes.

400
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,000
Physician Sheng changed
glutinous rice congee with lotus seeds

401
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,359
into bush cherry pits congee.

402
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,359
Every medicinal food for pregnancy
was changed too.

403
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,560
What's wrong?

404
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:06,119
Bush cherry pits have laxative properties.

405
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,760
It's to remove blood stasis.

406
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
If Her Majesty is bearing a child,

407
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,680
why would they prescribe ingredients
that dispel blood stasis and moisten dryness?

408
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,119
Are you saying

409
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,305
bush cherry pits is
a taboo medicinal ingredient for pregnancy?

410
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:21,760
Also,

411
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,479
judging from Her Majesty's state of illness

412
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,479
and expression,

413
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,680
she didn't look pregnant.

414
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,000
That means Imperial Physician Sheng has found
the cause of her illness.

415
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,119
That's why he prescribed ingredients
to remove blood stasis.

416
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,839
It's not our place to change the prescription.

417
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't overthink.

418
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,560
Just do it accordingly.

419
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Yuehua.

420
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,325
[Bush Cherry Pits]

421
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,359
Matron Meng.

422
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,920
Yin Ziping,

423
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,000
are you willing to work for me from now on?

424
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,239
I'm willing to serve you.

425
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,479
It's only a trivial matter.

426
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,359
No need to be nervous.

427
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,000
Go to the Yongning Palace for me.

428
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,000
(The current person residing
in Yongning Palace is...)

429
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,359
(Noble Consort Guo.)

430
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,599
Yes.

431
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,479
His Majesty is determined
to move back to the original capital.

432
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,040
Official Yang is trying to dissuade him.

433
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,439
But I'm afraid it's to no avail.

434
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,400
Your Highness.

435
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,040
Your Highness,

436
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,920
is your hand all right?

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,479
Your Highness!

438
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,319
Shiqi,

439
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,079
how's the progress of returning
to the old capital?

440
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:21,839
Your Majesty,

441
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,280
this is against
the Late Emperor's original intention.

442
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,119
I fear it'll cause criticisms
among the ministers.

443
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,719
Nanjing is the country's capital
set by the founding emperor

444
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,719
of the Ming Dynasty.

445
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:36,160
My late father insisted on moving the capital.

446
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,959
The three main halls were caught by fire.

447
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,599
It was a warning from heaven and our ancestors.

448
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,640
So

449
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,640
moving back to Nanjing

450
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,079
is the ancestral law I want to restore.

451
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,760
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has arrived.

452
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:58,599
Father.

453
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,560
Wait there.

454
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,560
Shiqi.

455
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,959
Please help me persuade Weizhe.

457
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,119
The Ministry of Revenue

458
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,760
might be reluctant to spend money.

459
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
I can promise

460
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,160
to only repair the palaces.

461
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,400
I'll not waste the treasury's money.

462
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,640
Besides,

463
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,239
we'll save more

464
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,040
on transporting provisions
to the north after moving back.

465
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:25,839
Father.

466
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,319
I told you to wait.

467
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,760
Shiqi...

468
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,520
What was I saying just now?

469
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,439
Transporting provisions to the north.

470
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,160
Ah, yes.

471
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,959
It's two million dan of provisions.

472
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,119
The people are overwhelmed.

473
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,199
Moreover,

474
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,719
won't the capital be in danger

475
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,800
if the enemy invades the north?

476
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
So

477
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,760
moving back to Nanjing

478
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,239
is something I've decided
after careful consideration.

479
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,959
Your Majesty,

480
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,239
the issues of transporting provisions

481
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,880
have been solved after dredging the canal.

482
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,599
It has also prospered the prefectures
on both sides of the straits.

483
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
The Great Ming's porcelain, silk,

484
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,479
tea leaves, and timber

485
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,560
are flowing smoothly from the north to the south.

486
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,719
As for the enemies in the north,

487
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,439
the Emperor can hunt them down.

488
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,079
They're the ones who need to be on guard.

489
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,520
Father, you mustn't look at
the gains and losses separately.

490
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You must plan for the generations to come.

491
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,760
What is it do you want to say today?

492
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,959
I'm here to tell you

493
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,800
that I left the palace twice

494
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,839
to find the inkstone Grandfather wanted.

495
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
I wasn't trying to win any ministers over

496
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
to object to your plans of moving back to Nanjing.

497
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,079
Please stop sending the imperial bodyguards

498
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,959
to follow me.

499
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,000
Not only am I not used to you

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,479
putting a guard against me,

501
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,719
but I also don't like it either.

502
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,040
I send the imperial bodyguards to follow you

503
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,000
not to watch you,

504
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,439
but to protect you.

505
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,319
Zhu Zhanji,

506
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:03,839
how dare you speak to your father
in such a manner now.

507
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,920
Everyone finds truth hard to swallow.

508
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,800
If you don't like to listen,

509
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,520
what else can I do?

510
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,400
If I see the imperial bodyguards again,

511
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,719
I won't give consideration to your face.

512
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,520
Please think twice before you act.

513
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,040
I'll take my leave.

514
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,280
Zhu Zhanji!

515
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,400
How dare you behave with such insolence!

516
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
You even pulled a long face in front of me!

517
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,560
I'm going to...

518
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,319
I...

519
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:29,599
I...

520
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,439
Shiqi.

521
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

522
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,000
Convey what I said

523
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,520
to Weizhe

524
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,119
without missing a single word.

525
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,719
I will restore

526
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,160
Nanjing

527
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,439
as the capital city.

528
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,160
I shall obey your order, Your Majesty.

529
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,760
I'll take my leave.

530
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Come out.

531
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,760
Your Majesty,

532
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,119
I brought you ginseng soup

533
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,119
after seeing you work so hard.

534
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,599
It's not even something disgraceful.

535
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,760
Why did you make me hide?

536
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,560
The ministers can't stop nagging

537
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,959
that I doted on you too much.

538
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,040
They said I ignore etiquette
and I am lax with rules

539
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,239
to the point that their nagging
gives me headaches.

540
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,119
Sit.

541
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Your Majesty.

542
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,359
Your Majesty,

543
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,760
I heard everything just now.

544
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,319
Others say you are too lenient.

545
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,880
But I think

546
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,119
there's no man with a softer heart

547
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,800
and more generous than you

548
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,040
in this world.

549
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,119
Your Majesty,

550
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,800
you're going to be a good emperor.

551
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,959
I hope so too.

552
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm not like the Late Emperor

553
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,000
who wanted to build unworldly feats.

554
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I only want

555
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,880
less war,

556
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,119
less corrupted officials.

557
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,319
So that

558
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,199
my people can live peacefully.

559
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,119
Your Majesty.

560
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,560
Your Majesty!

561
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,239
Your Majesty,

562
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,400
the Imperial Academy of Medicine reported

563
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,560
that the Empress suddenly bled profusely
after taking the medicine

564
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,079
prescribed by Imperial Physician Sheng.

565
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,040
Officer You, let me go!

566
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,959
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

567
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm innocent!

568
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,880
Her Majesty is not pregnant!

569
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,319
If they continue with the treatment,

570
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,080
Her Majesty will lose her life

571
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,959
in a matter of days!

572
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,879
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

573
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,959
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

574
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:17,959
Your Majesty!

575
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,320
If they continue the treatment,

576
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,439
Her Majesty will lose her life

577
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
in a few days!

578
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,479
Matron Hu,

579
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,120
should we send Her Majesty the meal?

580
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,760
Prepare her meal based on
the previous prescription.

581
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,679
Yes.

582
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,800
[Kunning Palace]

583
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,679
Mother.

584
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,639
-Your Majesty.
-Mother.

585
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,199
Help me up.

586
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,199
Mother,

587
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,199
you mustn't move.

588
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,120
To Qianqing Palace.

589
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Careful.

590
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,639
Go and ask for the Crown Prince now.

591
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,520
Yes.

592
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,199
What is it?

593
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,040
How long has this situation lasted?

594
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,040
Seven days.

595
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,840
Her Majesty refused
to eat medicinal food for pregnancy.

596
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,679
She would only have plain congee every day.

597
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,719
There wasn't any sign of recovery.

598
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,959
Her Majesty is carrying the Emperor's son.

599
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,800
If someone heard what you said,

600
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,679
you'd get flogged like Imperial Physician Sheng.

601
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,600
She's clearly not pregnant.

602
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,080
But everyone at the palace said she is.

603
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,719
It's clearly a serious illness.

604
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,320
Not a single imperial physician dares
to prescribe a prescription.

605
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
What nonsense.

606
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,800
You better send the Crown Prince meal now.

607
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,800
It's not a long-term plan for Manager Fang and me

608
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,159
to take turns delivering meals for you.

609
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
Did anything happen between you two?

610
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,600
Nothing happened.

611
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,280
Then go.

612
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,320
Ziping.

613
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,320
Go now.

614
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:43,840
Hurry up.

615
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,520
Ziping.

616
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,439
Go.

617
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,239
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

618
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,959
I thought you'd never come

619
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,479
to this study all your life.

620
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,080
I dare not push

621
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:20,600
my duty to someone else.

622
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,479
Do you hate me this much?

623
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,320
Why didn't you just add poison to my food?

624
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
Silver needles will expose it.

625
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,520
There will be some way, right?

626
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,800
I dare not ask my whole family
to be executed along with me.

627
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,000
You're so honest.

628
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,239
Yao Zijin.

629
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,159
Your Highness,

630
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,360
my last name is "Sun".

631
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't know anyone of that last name.

632
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,679
I only know Yao Zijin.

633
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,479
Your Highness,

634
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,000
why don't you care about Her Majesty's illness?

635
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,719
Miss Yao,

636
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,120
Her Majesty is pregnant.

637
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,239
There's nothing His Highness can do to help.

638
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,479
Your words don't make sense.

639
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,320
I've overstepped my boundary.

640
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,639
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

641
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,719
Your Highness,

642
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,840
Her Majesty insists that she's not pregnant.

643
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,520
Don't you find that strange?

644
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,040
Administrative Assistant Dai has said

645
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,120
my mother's temperament
will change drastically,

646
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,879
and she'll feel restless to be pregnant

647
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:50,600
at her age.

648
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,399
I dropped by to visit her twice a day,

649
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,439
but I never get to see her.

650
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,399
Her Majesty has already given birth
to four children.

651
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,600
How would she not know the symptoms of pregnancy?

652
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,639
She claims to have abdominal pain all day.

653
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,719
Yet, the imperial physicians are helpless.

654
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What if Physician Sheng is right

655
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,399
about her being not pregnant?

656
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,360
Administrative Assistant Dai takes turns
working with four imperial physicians.

657
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,479
Do you think the rest also gave
the wrong diagnoses

658
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,719
when one gave the wrong one?

659
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,120
A directress checked the pulse,

660
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,080
and Administrative Assistant Dai diagnosed it.

661
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,879
No one would dare
to overturn his diagnosis openly.

662
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:27,120
Besides,

663
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,719
His Majesty is sure that Her Majesty is pregnant.

664
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,360
Who would dare to be a killjoy openly?

665
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,399
The consequences of the wrong diagnosis

666
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,080
are unimaginable.

667
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,800
Do you still dare to agree with Sheng Yin?

668
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,639
Your Highness,

669
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,360
Physician Sheng has received 30 beatings.

670
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Yet, he'd rather die than change what he said.

671
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,159
Does he really want to throw his life away?

672
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,120
No.

673
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,639
Because Imperial Physician Sheng thinks

674
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,600
the ethics of healing

675
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:54,959
and the lives of the sick people

676
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,439
are far more important than his life and honor.

677
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,360
Likewise,

678
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,520
I may be a female official
of the Imperial Food Service,

679
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,120
but I'm the one who prepares the medicinal food,

680
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,199
which will be fed to the sick people.

681
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,919
I have to take responsibility.

682
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,560
Serving a meal blindly

683
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,959
without knowing the cause of illness.

684
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
This is not a cook

685
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
but a murderer's accomplice.

686
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,760
Are you saying

687
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,479
my father made a mistake?

688
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,239
How dare you!

689
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,399
I'm only a lowly maidservant.

690
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,479
I dare not criticize.

691
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,120
But Your Highness asked me,

692
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:29,840
so I must answer.

693
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,919
Table Maid Yao.

694
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:31,560
Let her speak!

695
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,600
Your Highness,

696
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,439
in His Majesty's heart,

697
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,919
an offspring made out of nothing
is more important than his wife

698
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,320
who's been married to him
for more than twenty years.

699
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,120
If we're in her shoes,

700
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,719
how does Her Majesty feel now?

701
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,399
As her son,

702
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,840
shouldn't you be considerate of her?

703
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:02,320
Your Highness,

704
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,000
where are you going at this hour?

705
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,800
Eunuch Yuan!

706
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,840
Miss Huaping.

707
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,120
Is His Highness in the study?

708
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,120
Well,

709
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,040
you came at the wrong time.

710
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,439
His Highness just left the palace.

711
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,679
What should I do now?

712
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,239
What is it?

713
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:21,959
What happened?

714
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,320
Rest assured.

715
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,120
I've already made

716
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,199
an arrangement for Sheng Yin.

717
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:47,919
Mother.

718
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,840
Careful.

719
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

720
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,399
Why are you...

721
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,959
Inform His Majesty

722
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,120
that I seek an audience with him.

723
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:25,959
Yes.

724
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,280
[Ren'an Apothecary]
In this late night,

725
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
are we here to buy medicinal herbs
at the apothecary?

726
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,120
No.

727
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:43,159
To steal medicinal herbs.

728
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,360
To steal medicinal herbs
that the Imperial Dispensary doesn't have.

729
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,520
Chen Wu.

730
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,000
Yes.

731
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:56,840
Come out.

732
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,679
Why?

733
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,239
Do you want me to go and receive you?

734
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

735
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,399
Your Highness.

736
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,639
Open the door.

737
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,399
Your Highness.

738
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,159
Show me what you're capable of.

739
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,879
Yes.

740
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
There are only two employees in the apothecary.

741
