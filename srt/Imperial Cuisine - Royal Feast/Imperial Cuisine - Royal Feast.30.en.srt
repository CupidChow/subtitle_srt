[Episode 30]

3
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Her Highness Sun

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
didn't prepare moon cakes as gifts.

5
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,519
What now?

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Didn't she send moon cakes here?

7
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:00,839
Your Majesty.

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,239
I mean well,

9
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,519
but she doesn't appreciate it.

10
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,720
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,679
actually, this year...

12
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,360
Stop mumbling.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,919
Actually, this year, except for Empress Dowager,

14
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,320
none of the palaces sent moon cakes.

15
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,240
What?

16
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,679
It is a rule that all palaces offer moon cakes

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,559
to His Majesty.

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,919
His Majesty will commend and reward

19
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,080
his favorite moon cakes.

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,199
This is propriety.

21
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,279
What's happening now?

22
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,679
Rules are disobeyed.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,919
No one cares about propriety.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,279
Eunuch Manager Yuan,

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,199
Her Majesty did not send any.

26
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,800
So, the mistresses wouldn't dare to send.

27
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,199
No matter how defiant they are,

28
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,320
they won't bypass Her Majesty.

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you think this is the reason?

30
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,279
What about Her Highness Sun?

31
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,279
Didn't she send any?

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,479
Don't talk about that.

33
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,279
I made the trip for nothing.

34
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,279
Her Highness made moon cakes

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,240
and ate all of them herself.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,639
Fine. Fine.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,639
Listen.

38
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,880
You wait and see.

39
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,160
Open your eyes wide!

40
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,839
One more thing.

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,119
The Palace Garden Service

42
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,399
promised you a share this year.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,399
Please put in

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,639
some good words in front of His Majesty.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
No problem.

46
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Please leave.

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
Go if you want to.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
No one's stopping you.

49
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,199
Let's go.

50
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,679
Let's see

51
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,520
how are the preparations

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,399
for the Mid-Autumn Festival Feast.

53
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,119
Sometimes,

54
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,639
I admire you.

55
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,160
You could have a good life

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,320
had you not interfered

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,119
with Noble Consort Guo's sacrificial burial
with the Late Emperor

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,519
and enraged the Empress Dowager.

59
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,720
That's why you were not given a higher status.

60
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,359
Your sisters

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
saw the final fate of Consort Guo

62
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,359
and are afraid to get close to you openly,

63
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,200
but you're unfazed.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Come to think of it,

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,559
it's better if you were

66
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,399
a cook in the Imperial Food Service.

67
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,799
Look at you now.

68
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,160
So pathetic.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
After the Mid-Autumn Festival Feast,

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
I will invite His Majesty

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,160
to taste sweet-scented osmanthus wine.

72
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,920
This wine is exclusive.

73
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,040
It has a mellow taste.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,839
His Majesty will be pleased.

75
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,559
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,

76
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,440
you don't have to worry about me.

77
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,559
Your Highness, that is a good idea.

78
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:12,753
[Calmly Watch the Natural Law]

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Let me do it.

80
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,480
Alright.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
I'll play

82
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,519
a pipa song.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,640
His Majesty arrives.

84
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,640
Greetings, Mother.

85
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,920
Come and sit here.

86
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Proceed.

87
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,559
How are you, Mother?

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm fine.

89
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,359
Have you finished handling government affairs?

90
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
Colorful petals and golden rain capes
weaved into layers.

91
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,239
What does the fish put up with?

92
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,200
It leaps into the lotus pods

93
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,519
and swims across Huachi to become a dragon.

94
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,359
This dish is called Fish Ball in Lotus Pods.

[Fish Balls in Lotus Pods]

96
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,600
It absorbs

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,559
the natural aroma of honey and lotus leaves.

98
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,000
It tastes a bit sour

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
and is very appetizing.

100
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
Your Majesty, try it too.

101
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,640
Empress Dowager,

102
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,039
this soup has

103
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,599
three ingredients, namely lotus,

104
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,599
chrysanthemum, and water chestnut,

105
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,440
and specially made shredded
pickled vegetables.

106
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,880
How elegant!

107
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,119
By the way,

108
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,400
the Palace Garden Service said

109
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,640
that it has fruit and vegetable
supply shortage this year

110
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200

111
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,679
3,000 stalks of hollyhock

112
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,599
and 5,000 bunches of reeds and bulrush.

in the Imperial Food Service for many years

and now oversees

115
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
many palace affairs in the Forbidden City.

116
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,119
Tell me,

117
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,400
is there a vegetable and fruit shortage
in the imperial palace?

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Your Majesty,

119
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,599
the Empress Dowager knows what is luxury

120
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,760
and leads by example.

121
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
Everyone in the palace emulates her

122
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,799
and leads an unadorned life.

123
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,359
A grand feast is not held

124
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,520
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

125
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,080
With such frugality,

126
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,080
how can there be a supply shortage?

127
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:29,919
You're right.

128
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,559
The whole Forbidden City

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,679
does not use a lot of vegetables and fruits.

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm worried

131
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,440
that someone

132
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,919
is taking the opportunity to blackmail
and practice graft.

133
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,520
From this year onward,

134
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,880
the fruit and vegetable supply
in the Forbidden City

135
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,840
will be cut by two-thirds.

136
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,919
Your Majesty is wise.

137
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,960
What is this?

138
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,919
[Pan-fried Roujiamo]
Directress Yin,

139
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,200
how dare

140
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
you serve such crude food?

141
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,039
Remove it.

142
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,400
Sister,

143
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
what is that?

144
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,559
Your Majesty.

145
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,919
The stuffing is made of pork in wine sauce
and green moss.

146
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,559
It is crispy and delicious,

147
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,840
but

148
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
I can't see

149
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,679
what's so special about it?

150
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:08,919
Your Majesty,

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
in the early years,

152
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
you went on the northern campaign
with Yongle Emperor.

153
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,320
The military

154
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,679
ate fried cornmeal noodles as their rations.

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,679
Today,

156
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,080
I made pan-fried roujiamo from wheat flour

157
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
and strung them together with twines

158
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,280
for carrying during marches.

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
(I also added)

160
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
(salt and ginger juice for taste)

161
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,559
(and sprinkled nourishing sesame seeds
to invigorate the spleen and replenish qi.)

162
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
(The stuffing can be any kind of meat.)

163
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,640
(I tested them.)

164
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,039
(They can last for days.)

165
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,359
After my enthronement,

166
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,919
there is peace under heaven.

167
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't have to go on expeditions.

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,919
However, in past marches,

169
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
when there was a water shortage,

170
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,799
fried cornmeal noodles were hard to swallow.

171
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,320
I appreciate your concern

172
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,880
for military officers and soldiers.

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,840
I will give your recipe

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
to military cooks

175
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,520
so that soldiers

176
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,320
can eat them during training

177
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,559
and hunting.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,919
Yes.

179
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,119
Doesn't the Imperial Food Service

180
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,599
need a person in charge?

181
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,119
Yes.

182
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,599
The two of them are quite inexperienced.

183
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,359
They might not be able to convince everyone.

184
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,479
So...

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,440
Let her take the post temporarily.

186
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
After you mentor her,

187
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
put her in charge.

188
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,479
Yes.

189
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,679
I thank Empress Dowager for your benevolence.

190
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,559
Your Majesty, try this.

191
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,760
Yes, Mother.

192
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:21,799
Your Majesty.

193
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Did you put the note

194
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,520
in the moon cake?

195
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,039
To prepare the sweet-scented
osmanthus wine for you,

196
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,840
I worked under the scorching sun

197
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,919
until my face is burned.

198
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,080
Look.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,719
Touch it.

200
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,159
Touch it.

201
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,239
Right.

202
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,960
Will Your Majesty accept this?

203
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,239
Wrong. It's not this one.

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Let me look for it.

205
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,719
I'm going back to the feast.

206
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,520
You can take your time.

207
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,479
Your Majesty!

208
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,400
Your Majesty!

209
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,599
Your Highness,

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
it's cold by the water. Be careful.

211
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,559
Let me hold you.

212
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,000
(This wine)

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
(is exclusive. It tastes mellow.)

214
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,799
(His Majesty will be pleased.)

215
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,760
She played a trick on me.

216
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,440
She did it deliberately.

217
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,719
You tricked me.

218
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,000
-Your Highness.
-You tricked me.

219
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,280
Your Highness.

220
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,599
Someone, quickly!

221
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,200
Help!

222
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
Someone!

223
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,479
Don't cry.

224
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,159
You still cry.

225
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,359
Did you hear me?

226
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,599
You are not allowed to cry.

227
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,159
(You're not allowed to cry.)

228
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,640
You still cry.

229
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,719
If you cry again, I'll hit you again.

230
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,599
Your Highness,

231
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,080
why did you come out quietly?

232
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,359
I was looking for you everywhere.

233
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,119
What are you looking for?

234
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,560
That flute

235
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,239
sounded familiar.

236
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,959
Directress Yin is looking for you.

237
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,280
Let's go back.

238
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Too bad.

239
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,239
Let's go.

240
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Are you homesick?

241
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,650
[Lotus Leaf Fermented Fish]

242
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,280
Is this fermented fish wrapped in lotus leaf

243
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,040
and baked in the scorching sun?

244
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,199
Yes.

245
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,959
We used dried lotus leaves

246
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,479
that we preserved from the midsummer.

247
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,920
Originally, we had iced osmanthus wine,

248
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
but the lake was too cold

249
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,119
and that might be bad for
Your Majesty's health.

250
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,839
So I warmed the wine.

251
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,280
Is this your idea?

252
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,040
Your Majesty,

253
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,280
it's Zijin's...

254
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,680
Her Highness

255
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,359
dedicated this to the Empress Dowager.

256
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,719
Did you prepare the lotus leaf fermented fish?

257
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

258
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,079
Boating on the lake in midsummer,

259
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
we pluck lotus leaves to make fermented fish.

260
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
When the sun sets,

261
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,560
we return with joy.

262
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,280
Accompanied by osmanthus wine,
opening the leaf to get the fish.

263
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
That would befit the occasion.

264
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,680
This meal

265
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,239
should be a boat feast.

266
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,520
At this time,

267
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,920
the lotus leaves have withered.

268
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,800
I don't see any elegance in this.

269
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,520
I remember Your Majesty

270
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,959
loved lotus leaf cups.

271
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,000
You said that there was a hint
of lotus scent in the wine,

272
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,599
and it was fun and elegant.

273
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,160
What?

274
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,040
Are you so busy now

275
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,599
that you have no time to accompany us idlers

276
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,040
to enjoy flowers and wine?

277
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,160
Mother, I'll accompany you

278
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,880
when you are in an aesthetic mood,

279
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:39,760
but

280
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,560
it is better not to put on airs

281
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,359
of being cultured and urban.

282
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,920
Mother,

283
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,079
I have government affairs to handle.

284
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,160
I must leave.

285
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,319
What's wrong with His Majesty?

286
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,040
He doesn't like the guqin and singing,

287
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,280
but how did

288
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,760
the lotus leaf fermented fish offend him?

289
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,839
Under the moon and looking at flowers,
lotus leaves smell fragrant.

290
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,040
This is fun!

291
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,719
How is this putting on airs?

292
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,479
We practiced for so long,

293
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,280
but His Majesty

294
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,000
left without listening.

295
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,239
It's better that way.

296
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,079
We can feel free

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,359
to sing and dance.

298
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,560
If he doesn't like to listen, I like.

299
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Didn't I tell you to report
to the Qianqing Palace?

300
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Why doesn't His Majesty visit me?

301
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,319
Your Highness, His Majesty
is busy with government affairs.

302
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,479
He won't be able to come.

303
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's summon the female physician.

304
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,239
Do that

305
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,880
so that I can become a joke in the palace.

306
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,400
Your Highness.

307
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,640
Lady of Bright Deportment.

308
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,199
Her Highness Sun sent Shenxian Porridge.

309
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:17,760
She said His Majesty

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,239
often used it to treat colds.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,119
She wants to make me mad.

312
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,479
I don't want it.

313
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,079
Take it away.

314
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,239
Yes.

315
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,199
Stop.

316
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,439
Bring it over here.

317
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,325
[Shenxian Porridge]

318
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,520
It's too hot!

319
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,719
She wants to enrage me.

320
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,560
She always smiles

321
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
but actually is a backstabber.

322
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,040
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

323
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,599
Is your cold better?

324
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,079
She is here to see me in person,

325
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,959
but you let her wait outside.

326
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,040
I

327
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,599
have become a disrespectful person.

328
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,880
I forgot to tell you just now

329
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,079
that the earthen pot
should be placed on coal fire

330
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,760
and buried in charcoal ashes

331
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,160
to be simmered until the fifth watch before dawn.

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,160
Don't miss the schedule.

333
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,520
What is this?

334
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,760
You drank Shenxian Porridge just now.

335
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,079
[Shenxian Rice]
This is Shenxian Rice,

336
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,400
made especially for you to ward off
the cold and replenish your body.

337
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,239
Also,

338
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,079
the cold medicine prepared
by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

339
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Drink them together to drive the cold away.

340
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm here to apologize.

341
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Don't be angry, alright?

342
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,280
Feel better?

343
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,959
Are you really here to make amends?

344
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,719
If you are willing to apologize,

345
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,719
you deserve to be punished.

346
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
You said this before.

347
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,880
Don't try to deny that.

348
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,839
Alright.

349
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:07,719
On the mid-autumn night,

350
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,439
why is Your Majesty frowning?

351
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,239
People always try to appease me.

352
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,800
I don't know

353
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,079
how to coax others.

354
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,800
Yunzhou, what do you think?

355
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:19,959
Naturally, Your Majesty wants to coax

356
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,280
a woman.

357
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,400
Naturally.

358
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,839
His Majesty rules the land

359
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,959
and can have all the beauties under heaven.

360
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,959
Today, you are troubled because of a woman.

361
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,400
I don't understand this.

362
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,319
Someone told me before,

363
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,880
but I didn't believe him.

364
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,280
Your Majesty,

365
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,920
women are arrogant and easily jealous.

366
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,719
They will get carried away

367
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,680
if you are patient with them

368
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,599
and pamper them.

369
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,160
Perhaps you

370
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,160
pamper her too much.

371
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,199
She knows your weakness

372
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
and is conceited because she is
in your good grace.

373
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,640
Is that so?

374
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
Leave her alone

375
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,079
and ignore her.

376
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,640
After some time,

377
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,439
if you take a look at her,

378
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,319
she will be grateful.

379
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,959
You don't know her.

380
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,119
Your Majesty.

381
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,839
Women are the same.

382
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,839
For example, Noble Consort Guo

383
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
got all the love.

384
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,400
She became arrogant and domineering.

385
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,800
The Late Emperor ignored her

386
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,719
and she pleaded daily

387
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,199
and cried.

388
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,439
Did you say that Lady of Bright Adornment Wu
fell into the water?

389
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

390
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,560
Sir,

391
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,640
will this idea work?

392
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,280
Heaven knows.

393
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,560
Normally, she is very pampered.

394
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
Why didn't you summon Directress Jiang
to take a look?

395
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,479
Your Majesty, my mistress is sleeping.

396
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,119
How dare you stop His Majesty?

397
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,560
Your Majesty.

398
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,800
Your Majesty.

399
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,439
Your Majesty.

400
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
Medicinal food must be consumed on schedule.

401
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:24,920
My mistress

402
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
asked Her Highness Sun

403
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
to open the pot on the fifth watch.

404
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,079
That's why she is sleeping over.

405
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,560
I think

406
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,880
she wants to get me mad.

407
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:36,560
Alright.

408
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,119
That's great.

409
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,160
Wake up.

410
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,839
Wake up.

411
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,079
Get up and take your medicinal food.

412
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Why are you still here?

413
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,199
You asked me to wake you up

414
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,520
on the fifth watch to take the medicinal food.

415
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,719
Did you forget?

416
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,479
At least you kept your promise.

417
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,280
Sit tight.

418
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,719
His Majesty visited you last night,

419
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,680
but you were sleeping.

420
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
So, he left.

421
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Why didn't you wake me up?

422
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,160
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

423
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:08,920
I told you to sit tight.

424
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
-Alright, alright.
-Yao Zijin.

425
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,760
Stop moving.

426
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,319
Let me out.

427
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,680
Let me out.

428
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,760
Yao Zijin.

429
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,920
Stop kicking.

430
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,400
Are you hurt by the fall?

431
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,280
Her Majesty said yesterday

432
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,239
that the dish wasn't spicy enough.

433
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,000
Today, she said it was too bitter.

434
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,839
How did you cook the porridge?

435
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,280
Directress Su,

436
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,920
I followed

437
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,880
the medicinal food recipes

438
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,119
from the Palace Medicines Office.

439
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:39,880
Use less oil.

440
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I don't dare make any mistake.

441
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,640
Don't argue!

442
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,839
I...

443
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,160
Stick your hand out.

444
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,119
What are you doing?

445
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,920
She was inattentive

446
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
when preparing the meals for Kunning Palace.

447
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,359
Shouldn't I teach her a lesson?

448
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,959
Directress Su,

449
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,319
I followed the recipes

450
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,439
and weighed everything carefully.

451
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,959
I dared not make any mistake.

452
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,000
You still argue.

453
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,439
You're inattentive.

454
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,119
How can I explain to Her Majesty?

455
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:16,920
Don't hit her.

456
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,599
Directress Yin.

457
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,640
You are

458
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,959
temporarily in charge
of the Imperial Food Service.

459
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:26,719
I am teaching

460
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,520
this insignificant cook a lesson,

461
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,640
but you intervene.

462
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,040
She's about to deliver meals to the palaces.

463
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,920
If the mistresses

464
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,400
see the marks on her hand,

465
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,920
they'll think that Directress Su

466
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
ill-treated her.

467
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,640
How about this?

468
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,959
From today onwards,

469
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,280
I'll supervise

470
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,560
medicinal food preparations
for Kunning Palace.

471
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:42,920
If there are more mistakes,

472
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,079
I will be responsible.

473
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,599
You can relax now, right?

474
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Directress Yin.

475
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,640
Honestly, I did not do it.

476
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,000
Don't be afraid.

477
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:05,880
I will help you

478
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,439
weigh the medicine and taste it

479
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,719
until Her Majesty is satisfied.

480
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,359
Alright?

481
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,640
Let's go.

482
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,520
In the past,

483
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,880
Yin Ziping would be hopping mad.

484
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,359
She is calm and steady now.

485
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,760
You are so forgiving.

486
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
She took your position
as the temporary person in charge.

487
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,119
Aren't you angry?

488
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,959
Your Majesty, the Ministry of Works
of the Secondary Capital said

489
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,239
that the Palace Inner Quarters

490
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,119
needs 9,000 rolls of silk and Leno.

491
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,680
They would like to ask His Majesty

492
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,000
to order Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other prefectures
to increase weaving.

493
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,079
I carefully verified

494
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,959
and discovered that the Inner Quarters

495
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,199
need less than

496
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,400
half of the required amount.

497
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,280
The people are the foundation of the country.

498
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,119
When the people are content,
the nation is peaceful.

499
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,959
During the Late Emperor's reign,

500
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
non-urgent matters were postponed.

501
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,239
It wasn't that long ago.

502
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,520
They are doing it again.

503
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,520
In the name of the palace,

504
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
they looted many places

505
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,640
and pocketed 90 percent of things
for themselves.

506
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,319
They're just like the despicable vermin.

507
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,359
Empress.

508
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,040
Empress.

509
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,680
I feel sick.

510
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,760
Forgive me

511
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,280
for misbehaving.

512
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:30,560
You may leave first.

513
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,920
Yes.

514
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,439
I understand.

515
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,680
Gracious Consort, your weiqi playing
has improved a lot,

516
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,239
but your style...

517
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,079
Your Majesty, what do you think

518
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,599
of my weiqi style?

519
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,040
Normally,

520
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,400
you are always on the offensive.

521
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
You act rashly.

522
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,599
Today,

523
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,000
you are on the defensive

524
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and make surprising moves.

525
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,640
You've progressed a lot.

526
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,599
Your Majesty let me make three moves first.

527
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
Now you keep yielding to me.

528
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,479
That's why I'm not defeated yet.

529
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,359
Is Your Majesty

530
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,520
trying to save my face?

531
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:24,839
After I go back

532
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,160
and study intensively for a while,

533
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
I'll impress Your Majesty.

534
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,839
It seems that Gracious Consort

535
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,160
has a good master at the back.

536
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,319
Let's stop now.

537
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,479
Your Majesty.

538
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,719
Your Majesty.

539
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,199
Your Highness,

540
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,479
did His Majesty notice

541
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,520
that you invited Her Highness Sun

542
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
to turn around the lost situation in chess?

543
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,280
Your Majesty,

544
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,639
the Prince of Han sent people

545
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,840
to deliver a mid-autumn festival gift.

546
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,520
It was delayed for several days by a downpour.

547
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,760
It just arrived in the capital.

548
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,439
Yunzhou,

549
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,479
seems like my second uncle

550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,320
cares about me.

551
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,600
Looks like I have to write a letter

552
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,199
to thank him.

553
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:40,679
Your Majesty,

554
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,919
I'm worried

555
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,679
the envoy from the Prince of Han's Residence
came to spy

556
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,360
on the pretext of delivering a gift.

557
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,560
When my grandfather and father were alive,

558
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
the Prince of Han would come

559
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,639
and celebrate every festival.

560
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,879
Now,

561
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,520
he's just observing the old rules.

562
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,360
Moreover,

563
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,360
I treat my uncle

564
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
with sincerity.

565
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,080
Everyone can see that.

566
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,239
I believe

567
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
he won't let me down.

568
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,639
Yes.

569
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,479
You may leave.

570
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,399
Who taught you the song?

571
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,399
Get out.

572
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:01,919
Your Majesty,

573
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,639
I came back from Yongcheng to report to you.

574
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,280
Didn't I say not to mention this?

575
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,800
Wasn't His Majesty

576
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,280
fine just now?

577
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,520
Don't forget

578
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,000
what I said to you.

579
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,520
Who let you in?

580
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,959
Eunuch Yuan dared not do it.

581
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,399
I greeted Empress Dowager at her palace.

582
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,520
Her Majesty

583
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,879
was about to send some snacks to Your Majesty.

584
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,280
So I

585
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,719
volunteered to deliver them.

586
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,360
If Your Majesty does not welcome me,

587
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,239
I'll leave.

588
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,280
I know Your Majesty is tired.

589
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,840
I'll let you rest.

590
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,600
I'll stay here with you.

591
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,399
What did I do wrong?

592
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,280
This scent doesn't suit you.

593
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,080
I'll give you something nicer.

594
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,679
I know Your Majesty

595
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,959
will dote on me.

596
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,239
Go and get forty beatings.

597
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:13,399
Your Majesty.

598
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,399
I won't dare

599
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,040
act on my own anymore.

600
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,000
Your Majesty.

601
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,360
Your Majesty.

602
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,239
I won't dare anymore.

603
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,439
Your Majesty!

604
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:23,399
Your Majesty.

605
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:25,439
Yuan Qi was trying to cheer you up.

606
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:26,760
He deserves

607
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,520
the beating.

608
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,520
Leave them.

609
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:38,000
She hid Guo

610
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
and annoyed Empress Dowager.

611
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:41,560
If I don't punish her,

612
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
the Empress Dowager will punish her severely.

613
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,120
I ignore her

614
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,600
so that she'll reflect on her mistake.

615
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,600
I don't want to see her in front of me,

616
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,520
but she is ubiquitous.

617
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
Wherever I go, I'm reminded of her.

618
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,800
She is here and there

619
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,239
until she makes me feel dizzy.

620
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:00,199
Your Majesty, why don't you issue an edict

621
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,280
to severely reprimand her

622
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,479
and get it over and done with?

623
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,000
Reprimand?

624
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,080
Go.

625
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,399
Go immediately

626
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,560
and tell her that she is grounded for 100 days.

627
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:15,919
Yes.

628
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,439
Wait.

629
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:35,775
[Yongning Palace]

630
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,080
Eunuch Chen.

631
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,199
This way, Your Highness.

632
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,679
Your Highness,

633
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,760
take a look at the layout here.

634
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,320
If you find something unpleasant,

635
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,600
I will replace it immediately.

636
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,600
In this hall,

637
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:54,000
the screen, bed,

638
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,479

639
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,840
are arranged according to

640
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,080
your liking.

641
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,600
Thank you.

642
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,159
My existing dwelling is fine.

643
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,040
This is not where I should live.

644
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:06,840
Your Highness,

645
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
His Majesty has given the instruction.

646
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,000
You will live here.

647
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,199
Do not forget

648
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,080
that this is Yongning Palace.

649
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,679
Think about it.

650
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,320
Herein

651
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,800
lies His Majesty's deep intention.

652
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,280
Your Highness, you are wise.

653
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,919
The most favored concubines and consorts
of the Ming Dynasty

654
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,120
lived here before.

655
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,919
Don't you understand

656
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,439
His Majesty's intention?

657
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,080
Yes.

658
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:30,399
Yongle Emperor's Consort Zhuang

659
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,360
lived here.

660
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,520
So did Noble Consort Guo

661
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,600
of the Late Emperor.

662
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,879
They were all favored consorts.

663
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,520
Weren't they?

664
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
Do you understand now?

665
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,399
But where are they now?

666
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,199
Your Highness. Your Highness.

667
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,120
Your Highness.

668
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,959
His Majesty heard

669
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,719
about an old custom in Guangzhou Prefecture.

670
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,600
Hang mid-autumn lanterns high and on trees.

671
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,800
They hang lanterns

672
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,600
high up

673
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
so that they will have

674
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,879
eternal blessings.

675
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,679
Originally, on the mid-autumn night,

676
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,199
His Majesty wanted to invite you to take a look.

677
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,399
Unfortunately, he was too late.

678
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,159
This is your housewarming gift instead.

679
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,600
I am too ashamed

680
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,719
to accept His Majesty's deep favor.

681
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,560
Eunuch Chen,

682
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,600
it's getting late.

683
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,360
It is inconvenient for me to disturb His Majesty.

684
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,159
I will thank him myself the next morning.

685
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,120
Jin, let's go.

686
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:54,760

688
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,239
You...

689
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,439
There are some things

690
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,080
that I shouldn't say.

691
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,639
But if I hide it from you,

692
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,479
it's not fair for His Majesty.

693
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,280
Yes.

694
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,120
His Majesty deliberately ignored you,

695
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,919
but he did it for a reason.

696
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,600
Others may not understand,

697
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,520
but Your Highness has a pure heart and spirit

698
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,959
and should understand.

699
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,919
I appreciate His Majesty's kindness.

702
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,439
you know

703
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,239
I was not in the palace
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

704
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,560
Do you know what I was doing?

705
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,520
His Majesty ordered me

706
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,879
to rebuild your mother's tomb

707
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,439
before her death anniversary

708
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,639
so that her soul could find peace
and prayer was offered.

709
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,399
I was also ordered to find a way

710
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:39,520
to locate her kin,

711
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
send them back to their hometowns,

712
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,600
and help them settle down.

713
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:58,639
Get a new candle for me.

714
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:16,439
You're back.

715
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:18,679
Yes.

716
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,040
I relayed Your Majesty's good intention.

717
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,239
Who won't be visibly moved

718
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,520
by such deep affection?

719
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,479
Her Highness saw it

720
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:39,520
and cried on the spot.

721
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,760
Should I

722
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,479
punish you for deceiving the Emperor?

723
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:46,840
Why must you

724
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,040
emulate Yuan Qi?

730
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,239

Leave.

732
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,600
Yes.

[Xingyun Cottage]

Where is Eunuch Manager Yuan?

735
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:36,719
Why am I given

736
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,159
such a difficult assignment?

737
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,280
He endured 40 beatings

738
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,719
and screamed for a long time.

739
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,040
He is still bedridden.
