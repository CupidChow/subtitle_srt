[Episode 12]

3
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,760
You're late.

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,440
Matron Meng!

5
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,440
Manager Fang,

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,919
please check.

7
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:03,879
Matron Meng,

8
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,879
you...

9
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,040
Fool!

10
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,000
Why did you address her as the matron?

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
I'll help you check.

12
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,360
Today's vegetables

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
don't look fresh.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,279
The vegetables aren't fresh.

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,039
Have you forgotten, Madam Meng?

16
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,360
You used to say that fresh vegetables

17
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,919
should be cooked

18
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,039
within two hours after they were picked.

19
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,759
Sometimes, they arrived

20
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
with dew drops on them.

21
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,479
Look at these.

22
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,440
Sorry.

23
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,880
Please

24
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,520
send another cart.

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160
Manager Wen, but...

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,199
Stop slicing.

27
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,759
Let's go.

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,479
Manager Wen bullied Madam Meng again.

29
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Don't go.

30
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,759
Let me take this.

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,279
Given her temperament,

32
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,240
Matron Meng doesn't need sympathy.

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,279
Work hard.

34
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,720
Let me do it.

35
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,559
Please observe

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
social hierarchy.

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,119
Let's go.

38
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Yuehua.

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,279
Next time you see Matron Meng,

40
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
don't be so rude.

41
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,119
Directress Hu is temporarily in charge

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,959
and will be the matron sooner or later.

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Why be concerned about irrelevant people?

[Xingyun Cottage]

45
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,839
Miss Yao, you are here.

46
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,799
Please wait.

47
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes.

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
I'll wait.

49
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,239
Official Yang.

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,799
His Highness is in a meeting.

51
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,760
Can the Ministry of Revenue do anything?

52
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't know

53
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,640
where you got the news, Your Highness.

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
From the imperial bodyguard.

55
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,760
The imperial bodyguard provides escort.

56
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,320
They shouldn't be concerned
about local disasters.

57
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,320
I must listen to both sides.

58
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,679
Had the people not told them,

59
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,040
how long would your ministry conceal this?

60
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,320
Did the Hejian Prefecture
deliberately conceal this?

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,200
This...

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,839
If you don't wake up,

63
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,399
I'll kiss you.

64
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:19,920
Your Highness.

65
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,119
I breached the etiquette.

66
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Please forgive me.

67
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
You have always been discourteous.

68
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
You fell asleep while delivering a meal.

69
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,799
Then you overstepped your bounds.

70
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,519
I had to carry you.

71
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,519
In short, I won't forgive you.

72
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,920
Men!

73
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Give her 20 beatings.

74
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Your Highness.

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Your Highness.

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,399
Are you scared?

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,760
Look clearly.

78
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,399
This is the way a master treats his servants.

79
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,920
Chin up.

80
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,920
I dare not.

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,799
Lift your head.

82
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,760
I order you to lift your chin up now.

83
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,440
Well?

84
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,599
Why did you fall asleep?

85
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,919
I...

86
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Be frank.

87
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,599
Before the New Year's Eve banquet,

88
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,919
I didn't sleep for four days.

89
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
Everyone at the Imperial Food Service
didn't sleep either.

90
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,799
That must be tough on you.

91
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll transfer you here.

92
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,039
No.

93
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
Permit me,

94
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Your Highness,

95
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,320
to remain there.

96
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,559
Alright,

97
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,080
but you need to promise me this.

98
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,400
From now on,

99
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,599
you don't address yourself as a servant.

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,280
Tell me.

101
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Why do you like being a cook?

102
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Your Highness,

103
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,039
my mother had high expectations of me
when I was a child.

104
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,359
(She asked my tutor to be strict.)

105
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
(I go beaten for forgetting)

106
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,760
(songs for the guqin.)

107
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,400
At that time,

108
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,320
the kitchen

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,880
was my sanctuary.

110
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
It was small

111
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
and full of porcelain.

112
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,119
She couldn't swing the rattan.

113
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
At the Imperial Food Service,

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
I spent my most relaxing

115
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,679
and happiest moments.

116
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,000
There,

117
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,039
people acknowledged me for the first time.

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,039
I found the meaning of my existence.

119
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,599
Your Highness,

120
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,359
please let me spend more time there.

121
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,400
I thought

122
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,880
your happiest time was in this study.

123
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,119
Looks like I overthink.

124
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,200
Your Highness,

125
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,119
they're different.

126
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,640
When Your Highness handled government affairs

127
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
and commanded troops in campaigns,

128
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,119
did you feel satisfied

129
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,239
and carefree?

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Alright.

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Play a song for me.

132
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,599
Yes.

133
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,719
Wait here.

134
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,960
Aren't musicians not allowed in the study?

135
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,559
Who is playing the guqin?

136
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
This song was written by High Highness.

137
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,400
It was half-finished.

138
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,559
His Highness

139
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,960
said that he lost his inspiration.

140
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,520
I didn't expect him to continue it.

141
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Huaping,

142
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,200
find out who is in the study.

143
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,239
I wish to see her.

144
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,320
Alright.

145
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,359
Find out who is so bold

146
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
and don't forgive her.

147
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,039
Matron Hu.

148
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Matron Hu.

149
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,119
Zijin.

150
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,400
Did you compile the list of
herbal food from all dynasties?

151
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Yes.

152
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
It'll be done by tomorrow.

153
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,520
What is this?

154
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,159
The Great Imperial Grandson's Consort

155
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,719
tasted Zijin's food at the banquet

156
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,479
and told Zijin to deliver a snack.

157
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:12,675
[Taiji Hawthorn and Milk Cream]

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,880
A girl who makes such delicious food

159
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,159
must be smart.

160
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,599
Can you play weiqi?

161
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,719
Table Maid Yao,

162
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,640
I invited you here

163
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
today...

164
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,880
Your Highness,

165
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,559
your turn.

166
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
I lost again.

167
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,919
Come and play weiqi with me when you are free.

168
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

169
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,200
Please excuse me.

170
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,599
Huaping,

171
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,280
what do you think of

172
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
Miss Yao?

173
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,479
I don't know.

174
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,440
She is friendly and kind.

175
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,200
I am a woman,

176
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,440
but I also want to get close to her.

177
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,479
Much less the Great Imperial Grandson.

178
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,039
Your Highness,

179
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,559
do you want her to wait on His Highness?

180
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,280
If someone can make His Highness happy,

181
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,799
it'll be an atonement for me.

182
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Recite that poem again.

183
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,400
Big Brother,

184
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,239
didn't you say

185
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,640
I don't have to weigh every word I read

186
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,479
but just understand the meaning?

187
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,800
I don't have to sit for examinations.

188
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,760
Smoke rises in the desert

189
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
and the sun sets on the river.

190
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
Even a three-year-old can recite that.

191
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,040
Look at you.

192
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,319
You got so many words wrong.

193
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,680
[Cooking smoke rises in the desert.]
It's not cooking smoke.

194
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,760

it's the Lantern Festival.

208
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,560
The ministers are waiting to tour
Wansui Mountain with you.

209
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,439
Why did you come here alone?

210
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,319
The Emperor is not in the Qianqing Palace.

211
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Everyone searches high and low for him
in the Forbidden City.

212
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,319
How do you know I am here?

213
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,760
You rode the warhorse on campaigns
for more than 10 years.

214
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,319
I heard it is sick today.

215
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,439
I thought you would come and take a look.

216
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,439
It's not sick.

217
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,319

Remember the Dragon Boat
Festival Feast that year?

220
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,160
You hit the ball, shot the willow,

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,640
and triumphed over others.

222
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
The ministers and foreign envoys were amazed.

223

Give it to me.

388
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,119
Come on, over here!

389
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
She is gentle and kind.

390
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,079
Mother, why are you doing this?

391
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,599
In this world,

392
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,760
who could be better than the girl I hand-picked?

393
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,719
You all have seen her.

394
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,239
Even His Majesty agreed to the marriage.

395
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,760
Everyone knows

396
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,959
she is the real
Great Imperial Grandson's consort.

397
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,599
But His Majesty believed an alchemist

398
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,439
and reneged on his promise.

399
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,680
He gave this girl the title.

400
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,560
They were married for so long

401
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,479
but still haven't gotten a son.

402
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,479
Is it auspicious?

403
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,160
She brings bad luck

404
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,599
and is not as good...

405
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,199
Mother.

406
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,160
Let's go.

407
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,959
Pass it to me from the back.

408
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:24,920
Again! Again!

409
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,319
Go.

410
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:27,439
Your Highness,

411
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
His Majesty invited you to the watchtower
to view the lanterns.

412
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,319
You disappeared in a blink of an eye.

413
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
If His Majesty finds out, he'll punish you.

414
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:35,719
Your Highness,

415
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,439
it's the Lantern Festival.

416
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,599
The maids are viewing the lanterns.

417
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
Miss Yao will not come.

418
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,520
Look.

419
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,479
What did I say?

420
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,719
She isn't here.

421
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,560
Your Highness.

422
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,880
Your Highness.

423
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,359
Do not follow me.

424
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,760
Great! Great!

425
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,319
Look!

426
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,359
Awesome!

427
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,479
Great! Great!

428
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,760
Once more!

429
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,439
Great!

430
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Your Highness.

431
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,199
It likes you.

432
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,280
I have many pets,

433
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,079
but it is the dearest to me.

434
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,959
I groom and feed it,

435
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,359
but it treats me indifferently.

436
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,920
Increasingly so every day.

437
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,079
Your Highness has many pets.

438
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,599
The cat doesn't matter, I suppose.

439
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,719
You're not Yantai.

440
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,760
How would you know?

441
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,120
I think

442
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,520
it is ungrateful.

443
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,439
I know.

444
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,959
In what sense?

445
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,719
Do you know

446
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,239
that Yantai is a cat

447
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,239
and my nickname is Li, or Cat.

448
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
The common people
give their children nicknames

449
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
so that they'll grow up safely.

450
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,760
Your name is quite interesting.

451
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,439
Your Highness,

452
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,000
I have to go back.

453
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,639
I'm leaving the capital.

454
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
After Beijing became the Ming Dynasty's capital,

455
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,879
Huitong River was reopened

456
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,080
to transfer grain from the south to the north.

457
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,159
However, the earthen dam

458
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,159
is annually destroyed by flood.

459
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,040
The repair work is too costly.

460
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,320
My grandfather sent me to inspect and supervise

461
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,919
river channel repair work.

462
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,239
I don't know when I'll be back.

463
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,239
Come with me.

464
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,439
Your Highness,

465
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,479
I'll stay here

466
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,000
and wait for your return.

468
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,320
(how many secrets do you hide in your heart?)

469
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,399
Go and play.

470
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,080
Go.

471
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
It's gone, Your highness.

472
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,719
Who is there?

473
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:30,719
Ziping.

474
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,879
What happened?

475
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,879
Why are you here?

476
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,879
Ziping.

477
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,320
Ziping.

478
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
I let her win,

479
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,520
but she was relentless.

480
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,919
When I finally won,

481
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,120
she secretly asked people to block me

482
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,360
and give me 30 slaps.

483
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,399
I listened to you.

484
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
I didn't make trouble

485
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,159
or fight back.

486
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,159
These nobles

487
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,840
don't treat us as humans at all.

488
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,520
I can't accept this.

489
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,719
I can't.

490
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:25,760
Hold this.

491
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,800
Smash it.

492
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,479
It would be a waste.

495
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,760
that was a fine drawing.

496
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,679
Why tear it up?

497
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,879
It didn't look like her.

498
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:18,919
No?

499
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,159
No way.

beautifully.

505
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,719
It looked like her.

My official business comes first.

507
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,159
I'll leave my love in the Forbidden City.

508
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,040

00:42:58,399 --> 00:42:59,639
Xia Yuanji was right.

00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,879

He offended you because he was anxious.

537

Arughtai invaded Datong and Kaiping,

548
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,479
but the Minister of Revenue, Official Xia,

549
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,919
advised against marching north

550
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,000
because we don't have

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,080
