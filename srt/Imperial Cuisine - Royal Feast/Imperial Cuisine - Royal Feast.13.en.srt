[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,720
Father.

4
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:45,519
Leave!

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Father...

6
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,319
I said, leave!

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,599
Father.

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,039
What is so funny?

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Grandfather, you don't have to waste your time.

10
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
When you asked Official Xia
to accompany me to visit the people

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,919
to understand the hardship of the people,

12
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:27,639
Official Xia forced me to eat millet.

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,639
I've held this grudge for a long time now.

14
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,639
So I sent someone to make a secret investigation

15
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,919
to find evidence of his crime.

16
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
But the people I sent told me

17
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,479
that there were only clothes
and pottery in Official Xia's house.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,119
He has nothing else.

19
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Executing Xia Yuanji is only a trivial matter.

20
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,199
Then

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
what do you think it's a serious matter?

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Grandfather,

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,279
you've been ill twice.

24
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,759
I hope you can live for a long time.

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Let me take your place
for the northern expedition this time.

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
What do you say?

27
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,399
Many people

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
live long.

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
But there's nothing more

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
to it.

31
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,320
When Yan Hui was 30,

32
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,119
his name was remembered for generations.

33
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,360
I want to do great deeds
that will last for generations.

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,320
I don't need to live long.

35
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,919
However, you mustn't go.

36
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,479
Grandfather...

37
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
I can go to the north without worries

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,039
because you're in Beijing.

39
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,720
I can't bring the future
of the Great Ming to be at risk.

40
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,200
Arughtai invades

41
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,320
our border every year.

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,359
How the people have suffered.

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,399
When I think of this,

44
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
how it hurts me so.

45
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,079
They can scold me for being ambitious.

46
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,679
Let them.

47
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,079
Scold me for being warmongering.

48
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,160
Let them.

49
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:52,880
Even

50
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,959
if I leave a bad name,

51
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,959
I'll never allow the Great Ming to be trampled on.

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Let alone the displacement
of the Great Ming's people.

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
My child,

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,200
your father has read many books
written by men of virtues.

55
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,079
He's been confused by a bunch of bookworms.

56
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Since you think

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,079
that old thing from the Ministry
of Revenue is still useful,

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,839
I'll leave him to you, then.

59
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:35,760
Grandfather,

60
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
you've been on the throne for more than 20 years.

61
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,160
Many countries pay tribute to you.

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
How many

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,559
emperors from the past dynasties

64
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
had led a war expedition

65
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,320
themselves?

66
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,239
Do the imperial royal court ministers

67
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,600
even know of your aspiration and vision?

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,239
There are not many emperors
who'd brave the wind and rain.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,959
Yet, many ministers are short-sighted.

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
After everything has been said,

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
only flattering works.

72
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
What other good words do you have
that are pleasant to hear?

73
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,399
Zhanji,

74
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,440
have you completed the task I asked of you?

75
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,239
Go and do it now.

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,000
Go on now.

77
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:23,920
Zhanji,

78
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,959
after I return with triumph,

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,799
let's go hunting together.

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,559
Yes.

81
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,600
I'll take my leave.

82
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,519
(In April, 22nd year of Yongle's Reign,)

83
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,160
(Zhu Di led hundreds of thousands of troops)

84
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,760
(for a fifth military campaign
to the northern desert)

85
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,440
(and ordered the Crown Prince
to manage the state affairs.)

86
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,279
(In June,)

87
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,600
(the Great Ming Army reached Dolon Nor River.)

88
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,799
(Arughtai fled upon hearing the news.)

89
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,679
(The Ming army searched the valley
for 300 li but found nothing.)

90
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,000
(The military provisions were running out.)

91
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,839
(Zhu Di called back the troops.)

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,160
(In July,)

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,559
(the Emperor reached Khailas-ausu.)

94
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,239
(Zhu Zhanji returned to Beijing to raise
military provisions under a secret order.)

95
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,720
(Soon,)

96
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,119
(a piece of news enough to shake the world)

97
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,119
(followed.)

98
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,040
Table Maid Yao,

99
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,600
don't you have anything to say to me?

100
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,920
I fear.

101
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,760
But you don't look frightened.

102
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,320
In March, I left in a hurry

103
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,760
after meeting Grandfather.

104
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
I only stayed for three days
when I returned in May.

105
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,239
I didn't summon you on purpose.

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000
I wanted to see if you'll come to see me.

107
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,559
After not seeing each other for a long time,

108
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,880
don't you have anything to say to me?

109
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,000
Your Highness,

110
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,799
the Imperial Food Service prepared

111
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,320
[Braised Rabbit]
this braised rabbit, especially for you.

112
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,599
Matron Hu made this herself.

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,760
How could

114
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,919
you cook the rabbit I brought back

115
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,599
for you?

116
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,400
Your Highness, this...

117
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,520
I wrote to you.

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
But you only replied to me a month later.

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,719
I asked someone to send you a gift.

120
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,760
Yet, you braised it.

121
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,919
How touching to have such
a dedicated female official

122
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,239
like you.

123
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:13,799
What is so funny?

124
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
Your Highness,

125
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,320
it's a different rabbit.

126
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,159
The one you gave me escaped a long time ago.

127
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,919
How could I keep it until now?

128
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,200
I haven't been around for a long time.

129
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,039
Don't you miss me at all?

130
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:30,960
Your Highness,

131
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
I...

132
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,719
Your Highness.

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,440
Speak.

134
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
Your Highness.

135
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,119
Your Highness?

136
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,559
Stay at the Imperial Food Service.

137
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Don't go anywhere.

138
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,359
-Your Highness...
-Father!

139
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,760
You left too suddenly.

140
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,559
My heart is breaking!

141
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Your Highness, calm down.

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,880
You're harming your health
from mourning too much.

143
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
You must take care of your health.

144
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
Your Highness...

145
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Your Highness...

146
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,000
Father...

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Where's the Great Imperial Grandson?

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
Your Highness,

149
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Official Yang Rong and Haishou returned
to convey the report in secret.

150
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,239
The moment the Great Imperial Grandson
heard the news,

151
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,840
he left the capital to retrieve
the deceased emperor

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
after reporting to the Crown Prince.

153
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,000
If the imperial court hears of this,

154
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,359
everyone will surely be afraid.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Convey my decree.

156
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,080
Seal this information.

157
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,159
When the Great Imperial Grandson returns
to the capital with the coffin,

158
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,559
we'll announce the death.

159
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:14,640
Yes, Your Highness.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
Your Majesty...

161
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
(In August, 22nd year of Yongle's Reign,)

162
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,239
(The Crown Prince summons
the Imperial Grandson to receive the coffin)

163
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
(and mourn in the Kaiping encampment.)

164
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,880
Be careful.

165
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Get down first.

166
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Hurry.

167
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,679
Grandfather,

168
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,640
we agreed to go hunting in Nanhaizi

169
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,200
when you return from your expedition.

170
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,320
Now, the bow is here.

171
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,239
But where are you?

172
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,359
You always kept your word

173
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,719
and never went back on your words.

174
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,159
But why is this the only time

175
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
you lied to me?

176
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,479
Why?

177
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:52,540
[Xingyun Cottage]

178
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Your Majesty, the name list.

179
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:34,799
Your Majesty.

180
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,400
What?

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,679
Your Majesty,

182
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,840
after our fore founder's death,

183
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,280
all 40 concubines of the imperial harem

184
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
were buried along with him.

185
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
According to the ancestral law set
by our fore founder,

186
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,960
any concubines who have no children

187
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,919
shall be buried along.

188
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,280
How many of them?

189
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,919
One hundred and sixteen

190
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
shall be buried along.

191
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Your Majesty...

192
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,760
Wait.

193
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
According to the old practice,

195
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,440
the families of these concubines
shall be compensated.

196
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,640
Their fathers and brothers shall inherit
1,000 imperial guards.

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,919
Consort Zhuang has served Father for a long time.

198
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,119
We must send her off properly.

199
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,039
Go.

200
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,640
[Chunyou Gate]

202
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,440
You're not allowed to enter.

203
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Her Majesty has conveyed her edict

204
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
to give preferential treatment
to Consort Zhuang.

205
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,400
Moreover,

206
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,679
we must feed the concubines
before sending them off.

207
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,400
Why make it difficult for Consort Zhuang?

208
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,679
Consort Zhuang,

209
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,400
this is the sweet walnut dessert
you frequently mentioned.

210
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,599
Please try it.

211
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Does it still taste the same?

212
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,799
Not the same.

213
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,599
It doesn't taste the same as the one

214
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,960
my mother makes.

215
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,559
Help me.

216
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,039
Please help me.

217
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,599
Consort Zhuang,

218
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,440
please get up.

219
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,599
We'll always remember how much you care for us.

220
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,960
But we're just lowly maidservants
from the Imperial Food Service.

221
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
To be buried with the Emperor
is the ancestral law.

222
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,520
How can we go against that?

223
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,880
The burial is

224
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
after sunset today.

225
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
Help me leave the palace.

226
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,599
Help me leave.

227
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:52,919
Consort Zhuang,

228
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:53,760
are you...

229
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,719
Her Majesty refuses to see us.

230
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,840
I had no way to plead with her.

231
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,599
I'm not running away.

232
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,359
I only want to see my mother.

233
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,079
She has no sons

234
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,000
and no one to rely on.

235
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
I'm not asking for anything else.

236
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,479
I only need to see her once.

237
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,439
Even if

238
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,319
it's the last goodbye.

239
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,839
I'll return after I bid farewell to her.

240
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,560
Please help me.

241
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,839
Please!

242
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,560
I'll return after I bid farewell.

243
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,920
I...

244
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,160
I only want to see my mother one last time.

245
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,239
It's just a small request.

246
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,359
Can't you fulfill it?

247
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,160
You want to leave the palace?

248
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,439
Consort Zhuang,

249
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,040
there are only three of us here.

250
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,359
If you don't return before sunset,

251
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,239
all three of us will pay with our lives.

252
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
You have ways to send me out of the palace?

253
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,520
That's great.

254
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,319
I swear

255
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,239
I'll return.

256
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,160
I swear I'll return.

257
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,239
All right. Come back before sunset.

258
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
Yao Zijin!

259
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,599
You know that I'm going to die soon.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
So you're brushing me off with this thing!

261
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,719
Leave!

262
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,959
All of you, go!

263
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,199
Get out!

264
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,079
Get out!

265
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:50,839
Consort Zhuang!

266
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,520
Get out! All of you!

267
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
What's the matter, Your Highness?

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,479
Your Highness, calm down.

269
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,239
Your Highness, calm down.

270
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll prepare a new one and send it over.

271
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,479
(Today is the fourth day of the week.)

272
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,719
(They would usually set up
a market outside of Xuanwu Gate,)

273
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,760
(where you can go out with a token.)

274
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,959
(But the market has been suspended
because of the funeral.)

275
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,359
(Those who go in and out are those)

276
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,359
(who run errands for their respective bureaus.)

277
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,719
(As you walk ahead,)

278
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,160
(when you run into the patrol guards,)

279
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,599
(show them your token)

280
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:35,839
(and tell them)

281
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,800
(the number of ingredients sent
by the Palace Condiments Service is wrong.)

282
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,239
(So Matron Hu sends you to ask for an explanation.)

283
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,439
Next.

284
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Token.

285
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,599
What's your problem?

286
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,719
I'm lining up here.

287
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,520
I came first.

288
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
What's wrong with me standing in front?

289
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,959
Why are you being unreasonable?

290
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,599
Do you know where you are?

291
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Don't make a scene here.

292
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,079
Leave now!

293
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:03,959
Take them away!

294
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,560
Come with us.

295
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,000
Let's go.

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,839
No, it's her fault.

297
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,359
Go!

298
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,359
(After you get out from Xuanwu Gate,)

299
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,839
(the hardest obstacle to overcome
will be the Bei'an Gate.)

300
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,520
You have such a kind heart.

301
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
You prepared food seriously

302
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
for a person who's going to die.

303
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,160
That's all the more reason

304
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,239
not to argue with her.

305
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,359
When she's full,

306
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,719
only then can she go in peace.

307
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,479
Go in, then.

308
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,940
[Yongning Gate]

309
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,040
Why?

310
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,280
You're right.

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Why?

312
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,560
I helped her in the past to gain some benefit.

313
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,880
But she's going to be buried alive soon.

314
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,520
She's someone of no value anymore.

315
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,719
Why do

316
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,400
you take such a risk to help her?

317
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,959
Why are you looking at me?

318
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,239
Did I say anything wrong?

319
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,880
We did prepare this sweet walnut dessert

320
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
according to Consort Zhuang's method.

321
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,119
Why doesn't it taste the same?

322
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,199
She's going to die soon.

323
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,680
Why care about the taste?

324
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:34,920
Fine.

325
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,040
Even if she manages

326
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,199
to pass Xuanwu Gate,

327
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,479
how will she pass Bei'an Gate?

328
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,160
I heard there are hundreds of guards

329
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
at all 18 post guards.

330
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,079
It's hard for her to escape even if she has wings.

331
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Zijin,

332
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,599
if we bring her back now,

333
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,880
we can still make amends for our mistakes.

334
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,839
What do you think?

335
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,000
Zijin?

336
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:01,800
Zijin!

337
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Could it be the walnuts?

338
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,760
Yao Zijin!

339
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,000
Only you'd trust her!

340
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,880
If I had the chance

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,079
to escape like her,

342
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,040
I'd leave the palace as far as I could.

343
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Her Highness will come back.

344
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,280
She never goes back on her words.

345
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,400
In the face of death,

346
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,880
anyone would become selfish and weak.

347
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,040
No one is an exception.

348
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,280
You didn't have to send food just now.

349
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,199
Why did you come back?

350
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,839
Aren't you scared of death?

351
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,560
You'll be scared if you're alone.

352
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:37,839
Ziping,

353
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,719
she'll come back.

354
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,479
I knew it.

355
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,719
Nobody will come back and die.

356
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,239
Liar.

357
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Yao Zijin,

358
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,119
you're such a fool.

359
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,719
Go!

360
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:17,880
Come on.

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,079
Hurry.

362
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,359
There's Consort Zhuang
from Yongning Palace left.

363
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,439
Quickly now!

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Miss Yao.

365
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
Light up.

366
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,599
They'll be here soon.

367
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:44,959
Hurry!

368
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,839
We're almost there.

369
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,239
There's no time to waste. Hurry up.

370
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:47,640
Yes.

371
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,359
Leave.

372
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,640
Leave now.

373
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Ziping.

374
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,199
Don't worry about implicating those
from Yongning Palace.

375
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,119
I'll stay.

376
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Why are you saying that?

377
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,959
I was supposed to die.

378
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm paying you with my life this time.

379
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,280
We'll no longer owe each other.

380
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,239
Why?

381
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
When my whole family died,

382
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,160
I was the only one who survived.

383
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Do you think

384
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,239
it was my younger brother

385
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,160
who opened the cricket jar?

386
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,280
So you now know what kind of monster

387
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,839
you've been treating with kindness.

388
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,599
Leave now.

389
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,239
I'm not leaving.

390
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:44,880
Leave!

391
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,280
Ziping!

392
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Open the gate.

393
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,359
Yes.

394
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,880
Why is it locked?

395
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:55,959
Knock.

396
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,839
Yes.

397
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,079
-Open the gate!
-Open the gate!

398
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:00,880
Open the gate now!

399
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,719
Open the gate!

400
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,199
Open the gate!

401
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:03,959
Open it!

402
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,479
Yes.

403
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,319
I'll be serving His Majesty soon.

404
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,640
So I'll naturally have to dress up.

405
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,599
Who allowed you to behave insolently?

406
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,439
How rude of you.

407
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,839
Your Highness,

408
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,160
this way, please.

409
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,959
I thought Consort Zhuang would never return.

410
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,439
But

411
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,800
how did she pass Bei'an Gate?

412
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Zijin.

413
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Zijin?

414
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Zijin.

415
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,479
Zijin?

416
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,119
What's the matter?

417
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,760
I thought you love crisp cake.

418
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
It's such a tasty crisp cake.

419
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I can't help

420
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,800
but savor every bit of it when I eat it.

421
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,719
I don't know why

422
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
it doesn't taste as good now.

423
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,959
There are still some
of the ingredients left I used

424
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,920
for Consort Zhuang's sweet walnut dessert.

425
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,079
What's wrong?

426
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,359
Where do these come from?

427
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,040
The walnuts are from the Liao county
and Lingbao red dates.

428
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,479
These are high-quality tributes.

429
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,680
Over here.

430
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,199
The Medicines Office sent these ingredients
for medicinal food preparation.

431
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,920
It may be big.

432
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,719
But it's not as sweet and crisp as those walnuts.

433
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,959
It has an astringent taste too.

434
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,760
What is she doing?

435
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,079
It's too late to make sweet walnut dessert now.

436
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,640
Is it for Consort Zhuang?

437
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
The number of ingredients delivered is getting
more and more laxly.

438
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,920
The quantity of fragrant rice,
dried fruits, antlers,

439
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
and sea produce
from the East Sea is also not tally.

440
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,520
Directress Wang refused to accept them.

441
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,199
If I didn't try to persuade her,

442
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,319
she would have gone and questioned
the Court of Imperial Entertainments.

443
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,880
I see.

444
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,640
I fear Directress Wang might be too stubborn.

445
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,800
If she finds out...

446
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll take care of it.

447
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,719
Yes.

448
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,439
Find out

449
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
where Zijin went today.

450
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,319
I don't need your help.

451
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,199
Your Highness!

452
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:27,160
Your Highness!

453
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Zijin!

454
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,199
Watch your manners.

455
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,959
Zijin!

456
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,839
Your Highness,

457
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,319
I've made a bowl of sweet walnut dessert for you.

458
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800
Please try it.

459
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Directress Wang,

460
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,959
I just want to do one last thing for her.

461
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Zijin.

462
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,439
Ziping,

463
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,280
hurry.

464
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:47,680
Yes.

465
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,640
This is the flavor

466
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,800
of the sweet walnut dessert my mother made
when I was a child in Jiangnan.

467
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,160
Your Highness,

468
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,599
no matter how high-quality the ingredient is,

469
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,119
the best taste in the world

470
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,040
is the memory of one's hometown.

471
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,479
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,160
I lied to you.

473
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,800
When I left the Forbidden City,

474
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,319
I never planned to return.

475
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,319
But I've frightened the sedan chair bearers away.

476
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,920
I could only carry my mother on my back,

477
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,839
knocking on every door.

478
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,719
(But our clan members who clung on us in the past)

479
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,400
(dared not to defy the imperial decree
and take us in.)

480
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,560
(But I couldn't walk)

481
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,160
(any longer.)

482
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,680
Even if I have a pair of wings,

483
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,479
I can never leave this place.

484
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,800
Your Highness, it's time to go.

485
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,840
My last moment in the world

486
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,399
is warm.

487
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,560
Your Highness.

488
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,120
His Majesty has arrived!

489
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,800
His Majesty is here!

490
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,560
Are you here to see her off, Your Majesty?

491
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,479
I'm willing to die today.

492
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,360
Please remember your promise to me, Your Majesty.

493
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,679
Take good care of my mother

494
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,159
and don't let her be homeless

495
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,399
without anyone to rely on.

496
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,879
Your Majesty,

497
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
you must not defy the ancestral law.

498
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
Zijin.

499
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,159
Mother,

500
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,479
I'm leaving now.

501
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,800
Your Highness!

502
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,679
Your Highness!

503
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,639
Your Highness!

504
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,679
Your Highness, are you all right?

505
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,679
Leave me.

506
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:17,679
So

507
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
do you understand it now?

508
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,360
Insolence!

509
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
Concubines without children
will be buried with the Emperor.

510
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,959
Ministers with meritorious deeds are exempted
from death by law.

511
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
Besides,

512
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,600
His Majesty is healthy.

513
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,759
I just don't have

514
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,479
the heart to see that.

515
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,320
When our fore founder died,

516
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,840
some concubines who had children
were also buried with the Emperor.

517
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,040
Why don't you

518
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:50,399
think about the person who'll decide your fate?

519
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,120
You...

520
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,199
Your Highness,

521
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,879
you're trembling.

522
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,239
Let me send you back to your palace.

523
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,800
Ziping.

524
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,520
Ziping!

525
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,239
Yin Ziping!

526
00:39:59,479 --> 00:39:59,919
Ziping.

527
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Zijin.

528
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,280
Quickly!

529
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,800
Come back here!

530
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,280
Where are you going?

531
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,800
You know how to pass Bei'an Gate, right?

532
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,040
The whole country is mourning day and night.

533
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,080
We still have a chance.

534
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,040
Come on. Let's go.

535
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,080
Come back.

536
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,959
Tell me

537
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:16,120
why do you want to leave.

538
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,800
Martyrdom.

539
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,520
Those are for the concubines only.

540
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
We're maidservants of the Imperial Food Service.

541
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,560
Then promise me

542
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,360
that you'll ignore the Great Imperial Grandson.

543
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,120
Don't be a concubine.

544
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,479
We'll just work as female officials.

545
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,399
All right?

546
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,080
Ziping.

547
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,120
No matter how valuable the life

548
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
of luxury and gourmet is

549
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,919
means nothing in the face of death.

550
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
You saw what happened today.

551
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,000
I fear you'll end up like Consort Zhuang.

552
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:46,520
Rest assured.

553
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,000
I won't.

554
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
If you become a concubine

555
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
without any children,

556
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,639
you'll have to be buried with the Emperor.

557
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,120
As female officials,

558
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
we fear losing our lives

559
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
if we make mistakes.

560
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,479
If we leave the palace today,

561
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,679
we have no direction.

562
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,959
The whole city is under curfew.

563
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
How will we leave the capital?

564
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:12,800
How can we make a living

565
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,120
as girls?

566
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,360
Even if we start a business,

567
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,000
how do we sustain it?

568
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
Zijin,

569
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,719
what are we supposed to do now?

570
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,239
All the land belongs to the Emperor.

571
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,719
Do you think Consort Zhuang wanted to stay?

572
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,280
She wanted to leave.

573
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,120
But where can she go?

574
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,080
Even if she managed to escape,

575
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,719
her entire family members would be executed.

576
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,600
Escape?

577
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,120
We can never escape.

578
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,000
Since we can't run,

579
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:50,840
we'll just stay.

580
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,120
Ziping,

581
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,879
making people sacrificial objects is not right.

582
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,800
The way of the world is not right.

583
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,600
If it's not right, it must be corrected.

584
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,159
But that's ancestral law.

585
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,600
Even the Crown Prince can't openly...

586
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm not afraid.

587
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,679
Ziping,

588
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,239
don't be scared.

589
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,600
Always remember

590
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,239
when there's a will, there's a way.

591
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:15,560
Think about it.

592
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,040
Whether it's a female official,

593
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
a concubine,

594
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,280
or even the common folks,

595
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,439
who has no difficulties?

596
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,320
There will always be a way.

597
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,479
No matter where I go

598
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,560
or how far I go,

599
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,719
as long as I have a companion

600
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,800
and am not alone,

601
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,000
I can walk far

602
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,560
with this belief.

603
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,120
The end

604
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,399
may be the way out.

605
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
(Directress Hu,)

606
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,159
(this is the medicinal cuisine I've written.)

607
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,840
(Can you spare some time to look at it?)

608
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,080
(She gave Consort Zhuang a jade pendant.)

609
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,560
(That's how Consort Zhuang managed
to pass Bei'an Gate.)

610
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
What kind of jade pendant?
