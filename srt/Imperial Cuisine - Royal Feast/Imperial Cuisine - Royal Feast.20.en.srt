00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,080
How dare you defy

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,800
His Highness!

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,599
Let His Highness go!

6
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:57,919
Let His Highness go now!

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Let go of me!

8
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll ask Father to execute you
if you don't let go of me!

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,800
I said, let me go!

10
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,160
Zijin, it's all right.

11
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,680
Let His Highness go now.

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
Your Highness. Your Highness.

13
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,199
Please look

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,240
at the sampan congee you just knocked over.

15
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,960
To preserve the flavor of the congee,

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,639
the cook used a specially made earthen jar

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,320
instead of the usual cookware
to cook it over a slow fire for two hours.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,720
The cook had to continue stirring

19
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,559
until her hands became stiff.

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,360
It's not just this bowl of congee.

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
Every food here comes

22
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,440
from a farmer's hard work

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,800
and a cook's countless efforts to prepare.

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,720
How can you waste them like this?

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
All these are your duty.

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,679
Other than preparing meals,

27
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,639
what else do cooks like you can do?

28
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,639
Farmers can't farm

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
if they don't eat.

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,839
Without any army provisions,

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,080
they'll lose a battle.

32
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,399
If the country's granary is empty,

33
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,839
what do we use to relieve disaster
and save the people?

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Without food, a country will be in turmoil.

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
Also,

36
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,759
Hongwu Emperor has warned

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,119
his descendants countless times

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
that food is the world's most precious thing.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,679
If so, why do you look down

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,240
on the cooks who prepare meals

41
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,080
and openly go against

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
the ancestral teachings of the Hongwu Emperor?

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,679
Hongwu Emperor once said

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
that everyone should perform
their respective duties

45
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,600
to maintain the stability of the world.

46
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,320
May I be bold to ask Your Highness?

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
We have done our duties

48
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,440
as a cook.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,679
As the descendant of the royal family,

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,839
have you fulfilled your duty?

51
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,320
When His Majesty was your age,

52
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,119
he has memorized Confucian classics,

53
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,679
which have been praised by the ministers.

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,119
When the Late Emperor led
a war expedition in the north,

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,800
the former Crown Prince could defend

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Beijing independently at 13 years old.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
What about Your Highness?

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,279
How dare you!

59
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,399
No one has spoken to me like this!

60
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,440
Zijin!

61
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,960
His Majesty has issued a request for admonition.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,160
People all over the country can submit
their admonishment.

63
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
This is the reason

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,639
I've overstepped my boundary.

65
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,399
Your Highness, please abide
by the ancestral's teaching.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Treat the cooks kindly and cherish food.

67
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,839
Don't tarnish the dignity of the royal household.

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
Big Brother, this bad woman bullied me!

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,959
Big Brother, she insulted me.

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,880
Kill her for me.

71
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,160
All of you can leave now.

72
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,640
That was so close.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,119
What if the Prince of Wei lost it

74
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,359
and insisted on decapitating you?

75
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,320
Fortunately, the Crown Prince was present.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,359
Do you think someone with a personality

77
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,239
like Prince of Wei will forget this matter?

78
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
Did you get hurt just now?

79
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,679
Shan,

80
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,480
everyone has been giving in to you

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
because you're frail.

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm disappointed

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,839
about your actions today.

84
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,079
You're the descendant of the Zhu family
and a prince of the Great Ming.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,679
How could you behave presumptuously?

86
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,679
Big Brother, you're not on my side either?

87
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,279
If you throw a fit at the servants again,

88
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,079
I want you to stay in your room
and reflect on yourself for a day as punishment.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,559
Sit.

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Shan,

91
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,079
power should be exercised with caution.

92
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,320
With that power, you should respect life.

93
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,880
One doesn't gain respect

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
from their birthrights.

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,799
What makes your place in the world

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,559
is your every word and action.

97
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,920
When that female official questioned you,

98
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,239
you were already speechless.

99
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,279
Why was that?

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
It was because she was on the right reason.

101
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,320
If all you do is lose your temper
and execute others,

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,480
no one will ever truly admire you.

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
Do you understand?

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,679
Hurry. Follow her.

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,119
Your Highness, you've been following me.

106
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,799
What's your purpose for doing so?

107
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Take her!

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
Stop it!

109
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,519
Leave.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,760
Your Highness. Matron Meng.

111
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,480
Mother.

112
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,920
Shan.

113
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,839
Shan!

114
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,799
Mother.

115
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,160
You've done well.

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,839
Shan.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,880
Matron,

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
a minister chooses a wise ruler to serve.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,119
The same goes for female officials.

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,160
Forgive me for my bluntness.

121
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,279
Noble Consort Guo is not worth for you to serve.

122
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
We can't ask too much of others.

123
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,559
If Her Highness isn't scheming,

124
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,720
how would she gain His Majesty's love

125
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,839
and today's position and power?

126
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,600
You saw what happened

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,839
to the weak Consort Zhuang of the Late Emperor.

128
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,279
Doesn't that put you on guard?

129
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,519
Matron Meng.

130
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,519
Zijin,

131
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,200
I hope you'll be a matron one day.

132
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,359
Just watch how I do it.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
You'll grow step by step

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,320
until you can manage the Imperial Food Service.

135
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,880
Matron Hu has lost Her Majesty's favor.

136
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,000
She's no longer your match.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,920
May I know

138
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,320
what it is that you still want?

139
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
What exactly do you want?

140
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,039
Hongwu Emperor recruited female officials

141
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,280
to assist the Empress to educate the concubines,

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
to be in charge of all matters in the palace,

143
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,919
and lay out the norms of the Great Ming

144
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,799
as an example for all women in the country.

145
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,799
But since the Late Emperor ascended the throne,

146
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
the eunuchs are valued more,

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,919
while the female officials are losing power,

148
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,479
and the Six Services exist in name only.

149
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,359
My loyalty to you

150
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,239
is to restore the old system

151
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
and become the best matron
of the Great Ming one day.

152
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,400
You're...

153
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,400
I hope you'll grab the good opportunity

154
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
that I've taken pains to create for you.

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,880
So

156
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,400
can I trust you?

157
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,039
To stay at the Imperial Food Service,

158
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,719
I have no other choice.

159
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,919
The Emperor worked hard
with the state affairs every day.

160
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
The only time he can relax is during mealtime.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
The Imperial Food Service

162
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,200
often plays an unexpected role.

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,919
I'm sure you remember
how Matron Meng took down Jing Quan

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,679
of the Court of Imperial Entertainments?

165
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,919
When I become the matron,

166
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,200
I'll repay you.

167
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,159
I'll remember what you said.

168
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,440
Go now.

169
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,039
Sir.

170
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,799
I told you to stop delivering these to me.

171
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,479
I have no more space in my room.

172
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,320
There's only this one invincible

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
soft armor in this world.

174
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,159
Even His Lordship was reluctant to wear it.

175
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,239
Yet, he's giving it to you.

176
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,239
His Lordship wishes to meet you.

177
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
(From the imperial bodyguards' interrogation,)

178
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,679
Administrative Assistant Dai confessed

179
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,599
that Noble Consort Guo hid
the Prince of Wei's condition.

180
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,520
This is a grave matter

181
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,119
that involves the Prince of Wei's health.

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,039
So I had no choice but to report this to you.

183
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,840
Noble Consort Guo
is the Prince of Wei's birth mother.

184
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,599
Was she concerned about making chaos,
or was it for other reasons?

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,200
I hope Father can make a clear decision.

186
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,239
Tea.

187
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:19,719
Tea!

188
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,080
I want tea!

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,479
Your Majesty.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,719
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

191
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

192
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,960
Father.

193
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,320
Good.

194
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,119
Come here.

195
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,359
Yifan,

196
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,679
have you used up

197
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,719
the things I've sent you?

198
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I don't lack anything.

199
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,400
You can stop sending things into the palace.

200
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,679
Do you find me troublesome

201
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
after meeting your birth father?

202
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,760
Why do you say that?

203
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,039
I don't blame you.

204
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,719
After all, he's your birth father.

205
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,080
I was dying in a place far from home.

206
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
You were the one who found me.

207
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,320
I was proud and unyielding at that time.

208
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,440
I rather die than go back,

209
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,719
and you took me in.

210
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
All these years,

211
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,159
you taught me in person the literary talent,

212
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,679
martial arts, and stratagem I have.

213
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,159
You're the only one

214
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,640
who deserves to be my father.

215
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,799
Shoot.

216
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,479
At first, I secretly took you in

217
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,640
because I wanted to have more bargain chips
to force Second Brother to do my bidding.

218
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,000
Later, I devote my attention to you

219
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,840
because you're truly a talent worth teaching.

220
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,679
After all, one of my two sons

221
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,159
is frail and sickly,

222
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,400
the other one is slow-witted and disobedient.

223
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,559
That can't be taught at all.

224
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,359
If they have half of your talent...

225
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,719
Do you still remember

226
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
you took me out hunting when I was 13?

227
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,039
A pack of wolves attacked our camp at night.

228
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,719
You could have abandoned me and fled.

229
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,640
Yet, you risked your life

230
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,320
to rescue me from the wolves.

231
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,119
You were even seriously injured.

232
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,239
I'll never forget

233
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
your kindness.

234
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,559
I don't know

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,960
how much longer I can take care of you.

236
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,080
Since ancient times, treachery is loyalty,

237
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
while deceit is faith.

238
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
That big brother of mine

239
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,359
is precisely that great evil.

240
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,200
Since he ascended the throne,

241
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,200
he appeared to be taking care of me in every way.

242
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,599
But he has been making me return to my fief.

243
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,799
When I return to Zhangde,

244
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,919
it won't take two years...

245
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,440
I guess I won't be able to die from natural causes.

246
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm afraid

247
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,200
we'll never see each other again.

248
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
How would I not know

249
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
of your trouble all these years?

250
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,079
Please rest assured.

251
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,599
I'll fulfill your wish for you one day.

252
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,439
You're a good son.

253
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,520
I have faith in you.

254
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,675
[Milk Skin]

255
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Take these and air them dry under a cool shade.

256
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Yes.

257
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,520
(What's she doing?)

258
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:32,839
Miss Su,

259
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,319
I've already placed the milk skin

260
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,959
under a cool shade as you've asked.

261
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,439
Do you have any other instructions?

262
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,439
Get come clams,

263
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,760
bamboo shoots, chicken belly, and sea cucumber.

264
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,239
I want to prepare His Majesty's meal.

265
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,400
Yes.

266
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,239
That's no longer necessary.

267
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,119
The palaces in Nanjing are being repaired.

268
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,520
The officials and the builders' food
need to be taken care of.

269
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
wants to send 200 cooks there.

270
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
Pack up

271
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,920
and depart tomorrow.

272
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Matron Meng,

273
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,160
what did I do wrong
that you have to transfer me away?

274
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,280
The services of female officials
in the Inner Court are subjected to demand.

275
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,760
Anyone will be transferred where they're needed.

276
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,280
Is it only "cooking" if it's for the royal household?

277
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,719
Is it wrong for you to cook for ordinary builders?

278
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,199
Matron Meng...

279
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,479
All of you, listen up.

280
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,000
A farmer who receives a barren land

281
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,959
will work harder to farm it.

282
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,680
Physicians treat patients equally,

283
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,680
regardless of poverty, wealth, or rank.

284
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,239
It's the same with other occupations.

285
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,000
As a cook,

286
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,640
you must give your all
no matter who you're cooking for.

287
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,640
If you want to be picky with the people you serve,

288
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,439
you don't deserve to be in the kitchen.

289
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,520
Yes.

290
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,479
Matron Meng,

291
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,839
-I...
-Eunuch Liu.

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,280
Eunuch Liu, what brings you here?

293
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
Does His Majesty have any orders?

294
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,239
Miss Su,

295
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,160
why haven't you sent
the milk skin His Majesty asked for?

296
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,199
Eunuch Liu, I'm preparing it now.

297
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,280
But...

298
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,760
Eunuch Liu, she's going to work in Nanjing soon.

299
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,760
My, my. What should I do now?

300
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,119
His Majesty has a decree.

301
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:26,800
Su Yuehua inherited
the exquisite skills of famous masters.

302
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,160
She shall be promoted
to the position of directress.

303
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,880
She shall be in charge of the meals
at Qianqing Palace.

304
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you for His Majesty's grace.

305
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,359
It's the first time to make an exception

306
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,959
to promote someone in the palace.

307
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,199
That's right. This never happened before.

308
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,479
Father.

309
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,439
I've sent someone to pick Shan up
from your palace.

310
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Why did you stop them?

311
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm talking to you.

312
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,599
Father, I've said this before.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,319
Shan is my younger brother.

314
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,400
I want to protect him.

315
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you think I'll harm him?

316
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,199
Father,

317
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,280
the way to establish oneself

318
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,800
doesn't precede the moral standards of society.

319
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm the Crown Prince of the Great Ming

320
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,239
and a prince of this country.

321
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,239
Other than being the subject
of the Great Ming and your son,

322
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,800
one should have brotherly love

323
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,560
and know the order of their place.

324
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,319
I can't allow

325
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,239
a narrow-minded and scheming woman

326
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,319
to nurture and guide my younger brother.

327
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
This will only ruin him.

328
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,119
Your Majesty, it's time for your meal.

329
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,439
Come and join me.

330
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,079
Thank you, Father.

331
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:38,775
[Seasoned Flour Mush]

332
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,119
Your Majesty enjoys tea.

333
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,319
This dessert was made like brewing tea.

334
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,119
It's called "Seasoned Flour Mush."

335
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,359
What you said just now is quite reasonable.

336
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,800
If you have time,

337
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,280
come and keep me company.

338
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,079
Yes.

339
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,079
Enjoy your chicken.

340
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,040
All right.

341
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,319
Your Highness, you haven't been
so happy for a long time.

342
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,640
Did anything good happen?

343
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,959
I thought there weren't any memorials lately.

344
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,319
What happened here?

345
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Your Highness.

346
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,520
(Today, exploitation
by receiving officials happened)

347
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,119
(on transporters
who were on state-requisitioned services)

348
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,359
(for transporting grains, silvers,
and cloth to the capital city.)

349
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,839
(The so-called grain acceptance method)

350
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,479
(is based on the number of bribes.)

351
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,199
(The transporters couldn't afford
to pay the bribes anymore)

352
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,079
(and unable to return home.)

353
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,479
(They beg the Ministry of Works to allocate
an open space to accommodate the transporters.)

354
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
(However, it can't solve the long-term practices.)

355
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:43,000
(It's advisable to send
investigating censors there)

356
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,079
(and have the Wardens' Offices of the Five Wards
to patrol at all times.)

357
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,439
(Anyone who dares to extort the transporters)

358
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,439
(will be condemned.)

359
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,359
(It's said during Hongwu Emperor's reign,
every monk was issued Monastic Certificates.)

360
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,479
(The Central Buddhist Registry and the Central
Taoist Registry were ordered to compile the registers)

361
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,239
(and they were issued to all temples.)

362
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
(When run into Buddhist or Taoist monks,
these can be used for identification.)

363
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,719
(If the officers refused
to be worthy and virtuous)

364
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,199
(and repetitively ignored
the investigating censors,)

365
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,000
(they'd be demoted after being investigated
by the Surveillance Commission)

366
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,920
(without further elaboration.)

367
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,119
Directress Su,

368
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,079
are you preparing a night snack for His Majesty?

369
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,959
I truly want to help.

370
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,800
Matron Meng was around during the day.

371
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,280
I was in a bind...

372
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:52,760
Not this.

373
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,079
Bring me the jar of water I prepared.

374
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,640
We must use fresh river water for this meat dish.

375
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
If we let it simmer all night,

376
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,479
the pork will be tender

377
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,479
and extremely flavorful.

378
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,439
His Majesty wishes
to have pickled trotters tomorrow.

379
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,439
Please get the ingredients for me
from the cellar.

380
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:27,839
Yes.

381
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,959
I'm a directress now.

382
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,680
You better don't fall too far behind me.

383
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,640
His Majesty loves greasy food.

384
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,560
But it's not healthy for him.

385
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,599
You should pay more attention
when preparing the meals.

386
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,839
Yao Zijin,

387
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,719
it hasn't been long I was promoted
as the directress.

388
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,119
You should at least congratulate me.

389
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,239
Why are you so narrow-minded?

390
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,000
I want to remind you

391
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,400
that His Majesty's meal should be light
for his health.

392
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,079
It's not healthy to have night snacks.

393
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,520
You do everything that pleases him.

394
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,640
The geese feet,

395
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,280
pickled trotters, and milk skin you prepared

396
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,040
are harmful to His Majesty's health.

397
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,239
Yuehua,

398
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,280
this world is harsh on women.

399
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,439
Once you take a shortcut,

400
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,680
the world will ignore your efforts and strength.

401
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,800
Every step you take in the future will not

402
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,839
get rid of the pain caused by slanders and gossip.

403
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,119
You're an excellent cook.

404
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,000
As long as you stay grounded...

405
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
I can't go to Nanjing.

406
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,599
I have an unfulfilled wish.

407
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,239
No matter what, I can't go to Nanjing.

408
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
I remembered something.

409
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,800
You prepared the vegetarian meal that day, right?

410
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,359
Child,

411
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,359
don't resort to improper means in the future.

412
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,880
Focus on cooking.

413
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
(Not long after Directress Wang returned
to her hometown,)

414
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,920
(she was found dead from hanging.)

415
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,119
(These are her possessions.)

416
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:52,920
(Yuehua,)

417
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,760
(these are what I learned
from cooking my whole life,)

418
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
(and also the only thing I can leave you.)

419
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
(I hope you will realize)

420
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,280
(your long-cherished wish)

421
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,400
(and become the best cook in the world one day.)

422
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,079
Master,

423
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,920
the Meng and the Hu

424
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,239
don't deserve to be the matrons.

425
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,800
If you're in heaven,

426
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,359
please watch over me.

427
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,599
So I'll fulfill my wish.

428
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,119
Yaoqing,

429
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,599
don't blame me.

430
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,400
Come here.

432
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,040
Father.

433
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,439
Son, you're here just in time.

434
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,000
Join me and enjoy this gourmet food.

435
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
Yes. Father,

436
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,560
I have a drawing

437
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,520
I want you to enjoy with me.

438
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
It's a pity that you were too busy.

439
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,520
Food comes before anything else.
Come and sit down.

440
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:34,800
Yes.

441
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,719
Extremely tender.

442
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,400
What a treat.

443
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,092
[Braised Pork with Soy Sauce and Wine]

444
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,359
Father, pork is greasy.

445
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,439
You should eat less of it.

446
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,119
It's all right.

447
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,439
His Highness is right.

448
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,680
Treating deficiency with tonics
and cold with warm food.

449
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,280
Having lamb in winter warm the spleen and heart.

450
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,800
It can also treat lung deficiency and fatigue.

451
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,760
Please try the mutton soup.

452
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:17,050
[Mutton Soup]

453
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:18,680
All right.

454
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,599
Let's try this together.

455
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:27,680
Have some.

456
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,560
Yes.

457
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,239
Eat.

458
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
In the past, the smell of mutton was too strong.

459
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,800
That's why the cook uses salt
and other strong flavors to cover it.

460
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,439
But this mutton

461
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,719
doesn't have any gamey smell.

462
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:47,920
How did you do it?

463
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,520
I specially added almonds
and boiled them together.

464
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,000
No wonder.

465
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
Your Majesty has been consuming
a lot of meat and fish lately.

466
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,959
Why don't Your Majesty drink
some dandelion tea to remove phlegm?

467
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,350
[Dandelion Tea]

468
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,439
Your Majesty!

469
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
You scared me!

470
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,439
Your Majesty.

471
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,560
Your Majesty, you're...

472
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,319
Father.

473
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,079
What's wrong?

474
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,319
You're bleeding.

475
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,079
Who's bleeding?

476
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,920
Your nose. It's your nose.

477
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
-Me?
-Your nose, Your Majesty.

478
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,400
Me?

479
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,079
Guards!

480
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Take these away!

481
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,319
Father!

482
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:29,839
Hurry!

483
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,359
Remove these now!

484
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,599
Quickly!

485
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,719
Hurry!

486
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,119
Take them away!

487
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,199
Your Majesty is suffering
from overflowing heat in your lungs.

488
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,280
That's why your energy
and blood are counter-flowing.

489
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,320
Stay still.

490
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't move.

491
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,719
Why did Father have sudden symptoms?

492
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,560
Your Highness,

493
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,399
His Majesty's tongue has a yellow greasy coating
and inflamed nasal cavity.

494
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,120
His Majesty also has a dry mouth.

495
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
These are the symptoms
of overheating of the lungs.

496
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,639
His Majesty should consume heat-clearing
and blood-cooling food.

497
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,239
Father, did you hear that?

498
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,679
Greasy meat is harmful to your health.

499
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,080
It's best not to eat them anymore.

500
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,439
Report!

501
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,840
Matron Meng requests to seek an audience.

502
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,159
Let her in.

503
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,320
Yes.

504
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,239
I heard Your Majesty is not well.

505
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,239
I'm concerned and fearful.

506
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,439
I've prepared food that clears heat
and moistens the lungs.

507
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,040
After the imperial physician inspects it,

508
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,439
Your Majesty can have it.

509
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:20,350
[Guilinggao]
(*also known as tortoise jelly)

510
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,520
Is it tasty?

511
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,760
It's sweet.

512
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,639
But not as sweet as you.

513
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,239
Can Father have medicinal food now?

514
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,080
Yes.

515
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,560
Guilinggao can moisten the lungs
and clear internal heat.

516
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,000
It's suitable for His Majesty to consume.

517
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,600
I previously wanted to prepare
this medicinal food.

518
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,320
But it takes more than 20 hours
to boil the turtle shell.

519
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,760
I was afraid I might delay
Your Majesty's treatment.

520
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,760
Matron Meng is truly a thoughtful person.

521
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,879
How timely for the Imperial Food Service
to come up with this now.

522
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,520
Add two more spoons of honey.

523
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,879
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,000
Every summer,

525
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,679
everyone in the palace consumes this
to clear internal heat.

526
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,199
The Prince of Wei has been complaining
of sore throat and internal heat.

527
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,760
That's why we prepared this.

528
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,439
We didn't expect to be using it now.

529
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,159
Father,

530
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,840
do you still remember your promise to me?

531
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,000
Summon Noble Consort Guo.

532
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,919
Zhanji!

534
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,800
Zhanji!

535
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,159
You can leave now.

536
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,360
Your Majesty.

537
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,479
Your Majesty!

538
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,919
Your Majesty.

539
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,840
Somebody!

540
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,199
What are you doing?

541
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,239
Your Highness, what is this?

542
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,159
Your Highness!

543
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Your Highness, what are you doing?

544
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:53,760
Do it!

545
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Your Highness, please don't!

546
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't ruin my hand!

547
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,360
Please, Your Highness!

548
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,840
As a cook,

549
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,719
you have a silly notion

550
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,520
of serving the Emperor,

551
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,959
instead of focusing on cooking.

552
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,199
You can't keep

553
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,239
these hands of yours anymore.

554
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,159
No.

555
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,439
As long as you spare me,

556
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,560
I won't think of anything anymore!

557
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,959
I won't do

558
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,159
or want anything anymore!

559
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,719
I beg you, Your Highness!

560
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,360
As long as you spare my hands,

561
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,280
I don't want anything anymore!

562
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:26,800
No, Your Highness!

563
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,560
May I be bold enough

564
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,879
to ask Your Highness to forgive her?

565
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,639
Manager Yao,

566
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,280
don't overstep your boundary over a small credit.

567
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,639
This is none of your concern.

568
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,760
Your Highness, you made me a promise.

569
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
If I help Your Highness meet His Majesty,

570
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,280
you'll fulfill a wish for me.

571
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,760
I wish Your Highness could forgive her.

572
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,280
Are you going to waste your wish like this?

573
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,919
Your Highness,

574
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,399
Directress Su has
the most skillful hands in the world.

575
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,439
Didn't Your Highness admire

576
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,479
the replica of Wangchuan Villa she carved?

577
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,120
Other than her,

578
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,159
no one in this world

579
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,719
can restore such a fine painting.

580
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,760
Move aside now!

581
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,439
Please keep your word, Your Highness.

582
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,840
Grant me my wish and forgive her.

583
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,320
Let's go.

584
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,439
Why do you still refuse to see your mistake?

585
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,479
Mistake?

586
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,040
I considered you as my good friend.

587
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:32,719
Yet, you only cared

588
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,679
about Yin Ziping who's good for nothing.

589
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:36,840
What's so great about her?

590
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,000
I followed Master.

591
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,199
I wanted to improve my skills.

592
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,320
Yet, she was like you.

593
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,199
She didn't hesitate to sacrifice herself

594
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
for someone who doesn't deserve it.

595
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,760
Whatever I ask and wish

596
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,800
is all for nothing in the end.

597
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,360
Why?

598
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,879
For what reason?

599
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,639
Yuehua...

600
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,520
No matter what,

601
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,800
I won't be grateful to you.

602
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,280
I never begged you to save me.

603
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,439
I'm not saving you,

604
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,840
but those hands that restored Wangchuan Villa.

605
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,560
Yuehua,

606
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:27,959
we should see

607
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,120
the real meaning of skills in food preparation.

608
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,840
I've forgotten to tell you.

609
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,080
I've tried cooking all

610
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,439
of the Tang Dynasty's scholars' banquet menu.

611
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:42,600
What about you?

612
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,520
How many medical texts
have you already memorized?
