[Episode 28]

3
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,839
From today on,

4
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,639
I'll be in charge of the royal meal.

5
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,720
Matron Meng.

6
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,519
Just do as I say.

7
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,440
Matron Meng wants to serve
His Majesty's meal in person?

8
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,479
You're always by His Majesty's side.

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,119
Did anyone make slanderous remarks?

10
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,679
Why would they stop me from serving
the Emperor out of a sudden?

11
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,160
Sir.

12
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,639
Someone secretly went to the Bei'an Gate

13
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,479
with the Empress' imperial badge just now.

14
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
The imperial bodyguards
are more alert than ever.

15
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,759
Did something happen in the palace?

16
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,399
I'm aware of the Imperial Food Service's matter now.

17
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,479
You can leave now.

18
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,839
Go.

19
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,440
Deliver a message to the Prince of Han
in Le'an Prefecture

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,679
that His Majesty is seriously ill
and urgently summons the Crown Prince back.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,639
He'll know what to do.

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes.

23
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,639
Sir,

24
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,960
His Lordship has returned to his fief in Zhangde.

25
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Do we need to...

26
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,600
Sir.

[Extensive Records of the Taiping Era]

Found it.

29
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,119
Crown Prince's Concubine.

30
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,679
Your Highness, the Crown Prince
has instructed us

31
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,839
to make you stay if you come.

32
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,320
Bring this along too.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,679
No need.

34
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll entrust Yantai, the cricket, plants,

35
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,239
and the rest in this study to Zijin.

36
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,079
Your Highness, everything here is delicate.

37
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,839
It'll be difficult to take care of them.

38
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,679
Yantai is my favorite pet.

39
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
It'll be the same as seeing me
when she sees Yantai.

40
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Take it

41
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,880
as our comfort for being apart.

42
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,160
Yantai.

43
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,839
Come here.

44
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,040
You're more adorable than your master.

45
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Get it.

46
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,359
I understand.

47
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,559
You can leave now.

48
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
His Highness sure is concerned
about his reputation.

49
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,440
He hid them so well.

50
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,200
Is he afraid everyone would laugh at him?

51
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,320
There seem to be some differences.

52
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
What's the matter?

53
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,399
Over here.

54
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,799
The Crown Prince is away.
No one is allowed to enter.

55
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,079
What's happening outside?

[Lily Pastry]

57
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,640
A Yongning Palace's palace maid stole
an embroidered screen given by His Majesty.

58
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,440
Noble Consort Guo was livid.

59
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
She's also missing now.

60
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,239
The Palace Surveillance is searching
for her all over the palace.

61
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,440
They dare not search the Crown Prince's study.

62
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
We've already sent them off.

63
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,640
Your Highness,

64
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,440
I went to get some snacks from the tea room.

65
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,600
But I remembered there were ten lily pastries.

66
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,200
When I turned around, there were only nine left.

67
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,279
Even the tea is half empty.

68
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,160
I don't know which palace maid ate it.

69
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,079
She should be punished.

70
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,920
For you to tell Her Highness this small matter,

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
you should be the one to be punished.

72
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,559
Forgive me, Your Highness.

73
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,880
I was upset for a moment.

74
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,720
I dare say no more.

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,919
How dare a palace maid like you hide in here.

76
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,159
Come out and ask for forgiveness at once!

77
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,239
Your Highness,

78
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,479
why don't we get the Palace Surveillance here?

79
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,960
There's no need to fear a palace maid.

80
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:54,919
I'll go and get her.

81
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,039
Your Majesty,

82
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,840
many have asked about His Majesty's illness.

83
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,039
I...

84
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
I can only do my best to cover it up.

85
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,320
We may hide it for now.

86
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,760
But it's not a long-term plan after all.

87
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,919
Before the Crown Prince returns to the capital,

88
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
we must never let this piece of news get out.

89
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,840
But it's early summer now.

90
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
With the temperature rising,

91
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,000
I fear...

92
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,640
Your Majesty,

93
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,559
everything is ready.

94
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,559

His Majesty is dead?

98
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Your Majesty,

99
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,479
your plan can delay

100
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
the smell of the corpse from leaking out.

101
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
But people will be suspicious

102
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
after a while.

103
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,640
Once the news of His Majesty's death gets out,

104
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,760

Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,000
Your Majesty,

109
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,280
you must help me.

No matter what,

112
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,760
you must wait until he returns safely.

113
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Is it true?

114
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
His Majesty was fine before.

115
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,479
How did this happen so suddenly?

116
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,520
Tell me

117
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,760
what happened at Yongning Palace that day.

Please help me.

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,400
Then tell me the truth.

123
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,320
I'll tell you.

124

Capture her!

134
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,799
Your Majesty!

135
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,159
His Majesty's lip didn't touch the wine.

136
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,640
How is that being poisoned?

137
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,359
He clearly had a heart attack!

138
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,080
The Empress is using this reason to kill me!

139
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,320
You shouldn't have run if you didn't do it.

140

She's the Empress.

141
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,719
I had no room to refute

142

every word she said.

143
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
Why are you hiding here?

144
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,280
I took advantage of the chaos to escape.

145
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,919
I wanted to find a hiding place.

146
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,760
I only dared to come when it was dark.

147
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,119
There are not many people here.

148
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,880
I want to see the Crown Prince.

149
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,880
He's the future emperor.

150
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,479
Only he can save me.

151
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,320
Only he can save me.

152
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,159
I know you may not believe what I said.

153
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,039
But I swear.

154
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,159
I didn't.

155
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,320
I didn't kill His Majesty.

156
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,440
The Empress didn't announce His Majesty's death.

157
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,520
She must be worried
His Majesty's death would cause

158
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,960
the feudal lords to cause unrest.

159
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
Noble Consort Guo, you're hiding here

160
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,880
because the Empress doesn't want
to make a public search.

161
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Lest it'll alert the others.

162
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,280
Help me. Please help me.

163
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,440
Noble Consort Guo,

164
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,599
I fear your palace maid is already...

165
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
The secret envoy to Nanjing must be on his way.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
We can only hope
for the Crown Prince's early return.

167
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Otherwise, the country will be in chaos.

168
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,799
Let alone your life and death.

169
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,840
You must save me!

170
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,080
Noble Consort Guo.

171
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,559
Listen to me.

172
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
I'll send some clothes here.

173
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,080
Don't leave this study room if it's nothing.

174
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,880
All right.

175
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,440
Hurry.

176
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,840
It was as you'd expected.

177
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,719
Fu Jiang wanted to report this
to the Kunning Palace.

178
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Lock her up for now.

179
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,520
We'll punish her later.

180
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,080
Your Highness, are you helping Noble Consort Guo?

181
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
But Her Majesty...

182
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,719
His Majesty died suddenly.

183
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,440
Noble Consort Guo is a witness.

184
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,200
The Crown Prince is his son.

185
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
So he should know the truth.

186
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,919
But

187
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,400
if he hears about this,

188
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,039
how sad he must feel?

189
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,479
You're still worried about His Highness, right?

190
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,280
His Majesty was a rare and wise emperor.

191
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,080
For him to die suddenly,

192
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,000
we don't know what kind of storm it'll cause.

193
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,560
In the year of the Battle of Baihegou,

194
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,479
the Late Emperor launched "the nest of bees"
to inflict heavy losses on the enemy.

195
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,959
Now we have "hundred tiger rush"

196
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,560
that can launch 100 fire arrows.

197
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,719
Its power is massive.

198
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,640
But I haven't heard

199
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,560
that firearms can be used in naval warfare.

200
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,239
As long as we place the powder kegs
at the bow and the stern of the ship,

201
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
they will be able to travel by water.

202
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,959
After that, we'll ignite the explosives
in the middle of the ship.

203
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,719
Then we'll be able to burn down the enemy's ship.

204
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,959
But it's a little troublesome to implement it.

205
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,160
Hire some craftsmen tomorrow.

206
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,719
Yes, Your Highness.

207
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,079
Your Highness, an urgent message from Beijing.

208
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,280
Return to the capital immediately.

209
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,359
Assassins! Protect His Highness!

210
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,719
Your Highness!

211
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

212
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,160
The Crown Princess is here.

213
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,119
Clean it up!

214
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,959
What brings you here, Your Highness?

215
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,680
This study was filled with the smell
of books and ink in the past.

216
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
After you've arrived,

217
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,359
it becomes more lively.

218
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,319
Jin, serve the Crown Princess some tea.

219
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,160
No need.

220
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,280
Father is unwell.

221
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,640
I only found out you're always hiding out here

222
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,439
when I wanted to invite you to Qianqing Palace
and pay respect to him with me.

223
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,400
Are you not happy
because your servants at the palace

224
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,880
didn't serve you well?

225
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,839
Before His Highness left,

226
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,959
he was worried about the plants and his pet.

227
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,839
That's why I'm always here to take care of them.

228
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,760
Please don't overthink.

229
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,079
I'm sure you find something strange
is happening in the palace.

230
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
Or are you hiding things from me?

231
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,800
Other than a lazy cat,

232
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
the crickets,

233
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,040
and the books in this study,

234
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,920
what can I hide from you?

235
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Is that so?

236
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,760
Nothing can be hidden from you as expected.

237
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,400
His Majesty is critically ill.

238
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,199
This is a serious matter.

239
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,640
You mustn't speculate about it.

240
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,119
Whether I'm telling the truth,

241
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,359
you'll find out when you go to Qianqing Palace.

242
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,119
Don't you dare?

243
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,800
You can ask Imperial Physician Sheng
at the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

244
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,319
I see you off, Your Highness.

245
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,000
Your Highness.

246
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,680
If you didn't tremble,

247
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,839
no one would pay attention
to what a palace maid looks like.

248
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,040
Jin.

249
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,520
Careful.

250
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,800
You can't stay here anymore.

251
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,719
Go back to Qingning Palace with me.

252
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,800
It's all right.

253
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
Everything is all right.

254
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,439
Hurry.

255
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:09,920
All right.

256
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
Guard this door.

257
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
Yes.

258
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:48,900
[Emperor's Medical Records]

259
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
His Majesty is seriously ill
and prefers peace and quiet.

260
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,400
I should enter alone.

261
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,560
Just wait out here.

262
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,719
-Yes.
-Yes.

263
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,000
Your Majesty.

264
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,920
Prince of Han! Your Highness! Prince of Han!

265
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,439
Go on.

266
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,839
Your Majesty,

267
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
Shandong, Huai, Xuzhou,
and other places are seriously short of food.

268
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,719
Now happens to be the time
for summer tax collection.

269
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
The people are having a hard time now.

270
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,920
Draft an imperial edict to reduce

271
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,000
the summer and autumn tax collection by half.

272
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,719
Your Majesty,

273
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,000
can you give me several days

274
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,839
for the officials of the Ministry of Revenue
and Ministry of Works

275
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,959
to come up with a solution.

276
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,079
When they've come up with the solution,

277
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,359
half of the people would be dead from starvation.

278
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,079
Why?

279
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,160
You don't agree, Official Yang?

280
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,160
Should we wait for the Crown Prince's return

281
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,359
before we draft the imperial edict?

282
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,199
Prepare the paper and brush.

283
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,319
Official Yang will draft
the imperial edict here.

284
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,439
Leave after you're done.

285
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,760
Your Majesty,

286
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,839
Prince of Han and Prince of Zhao

287
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,920
entered the palace
with several important court officials.

288
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,040
Your Majesty, I thought the Prince of Han
was at his fief.

289
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,599
How did he get the news so quickly?

290
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,160
They've come all the way.

291
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,920
If we don't receive them,

292
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,160
it'll be rude.

293
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,959
You must not.

294
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,079
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

295
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,239
I heard something big had happened at the palace.

296
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,959
So I rushed back day and night without rest.

297
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,520
How's my brother's condition?

298
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,079
The imperial physician is taking care
of His Majesty.

299
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
As the feudal lords,

300
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,839
how can you leave your fiefs

301
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,040
without being summoned?

302
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,359
Our founding emperor left
the ancestral instructions for his descendants.

303
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,520
Any feudal lords who reside at the border

304
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,199
shall return to the imperial court
as scheduled if there's no emergency.

305
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,599
If there's an emergency, they don't have

306
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,199
to abide by the schedule.

307
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,479
Something huge enough
to shake the nation had happened.

308
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,839
How could I just ignore it?

309
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,319
Now the rumor is spreading like wildfire.

310
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,719
Have you heard of it, Sister-in-law?

311
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,079
What kind of rumor?

312
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,479
Sister-in-law,

313
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,079
the rumor says His Majesty is critically ill,

314
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,959
and the Crown Prince is far away in Nanjing.

315
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,560
The Eastern Palace is unable
to manage state affairs.

316
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,359
We rushed back

317
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,520
for fear that this rumor might cause havoc

318
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,280
and unrest in the country.

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,719
He's right, Your Majesty.

320
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,599
Is His Majesty feeling better now?

321
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Should we summon the Crown Prince
to return to the capital?

322
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,680
We haven't seen His Majesty

323
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,040
after so many days of waiting.

324
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:43,199
-That's right.
-How's His Majesty doing now?

325
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,839
His Majesty had just taken his prescription.

326
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:45,839
He's already asleep.

327
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,839
Both of you must be quite tired

328
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
from your journey.

329
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,520
Why don't you get some rest

330
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,760
and visit again later?

331
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,479
Sister-in-law,

332
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,599
look at my boots.

333
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,359
I'm nervous with great concern

334
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,439
at the thought of my brother's illness.

335
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,239
I wish I could stab wings between my ribs.

336
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,319
Do you have the heart to close the door on me?

337
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,800
That's right, Sister-in-law.

338
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,479
If you're afraid that too many people going in

339
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,520
might disturb His Majesty,

340
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,640
can't you let the two of us enter

341
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,400
to see him from a distance

342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
and come out after that?

343
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,239
Go back.

344
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,680
Sister-in-law.

345
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,640
These are the important officials
whom my brother relies on.

346
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
You kept making excuses

347
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,439
to stop us from meeting His Majesty.

348
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,439
Don't tell me you're hiding something.

349
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,880
I want to see my brother now.

350
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,599
If he is all right,

351
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,839
I'm willing to be punished.

352
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,599
His Majesty needs to recuperate in peace.

353
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,719
Anyone who dares to make a scene here

354
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,800
shall be punished for breaking into the palace.

355
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,560
It's unreasonable to stop younger siblings

356
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,199
from seeing their own big brother.

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
For you to do this,

358
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,560
aren't you afraid the world

359
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,839
might criticize you
for your dictatorial actions

360
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,160
and sowing discords between us brothers?

361
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Zhu Gaoxu,

362
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,640
you were unruly and never changed your ways.

363
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,199
The founding emperor detested you.

364
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,880
If I didn't plead for you,

365
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,280
your backbone would have been broken by the whip.

366
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,359
Third Brother.

367
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,479
Yes, Sister-in-law.

368
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,959
You had an eye disease before.

369
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
If I didn't search everywhere
for famous physicians for you,

370
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,199
I fear you wouldn't be alive now.

371
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,479
They say the eldest sister-in-law
is like a mother.

372
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,319
Who gives you the right to hue and cry before me?

373
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,040
The Crown Prince is on his way back.

374
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,319
He'll arrive in three to five days.

375
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,719
If His Majesty is still not well,

376
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,439
the Crown Prince shall manage the state affairs.

377
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Everyone can rest assured now.

378
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,479
If you continue causing a scene here

379
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
and disturb His Majesty,

380
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,640
who's going to be responsible?

381
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,839
Matron Meng,

382
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,119
come here.

383
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,719
Tell us what happened.

384
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,280
How's His Majesty?

385
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,040
His Majesty has had half a bowl
of medicinal congee that calms the mind.

386
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,760
He's indeed resting.

387
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,239
You're lying!

388
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,680
Prince of Han, please conduct yourself.

389
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,079
Imperial Physician Sheng!

390
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,560
Yes, Your Lordship.

391
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
His Majesty has been ill for a long time.

392
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,560
Where are his medical records?

393
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,800
It's with me.

394
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,199
[Emperor's Medical Records]
I love studying medical texts

395
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,040
and am worried about His Majesty's health.

396
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,560
So I borrowed these medical records
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

397
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,040
Everyone looks like they're ready
to engage in a fight.

398
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,760
It's from the 4th month,
three o'clock in the morning until today.

399
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,199
The medical record is complete.

400
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,880
If Your Lordships are interested,

401
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,359
you can bring it back to study it.

402
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,040
Send them off.

403
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,239
Your Majesty,

404
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,520
the Crown Prince was ambushed by assassins

405
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,560
on his way back to the capital.

406
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,280
What?

407
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,359
What happened?

408
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,079
Something happened to the Crown Prince?

409
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,359
How could that happen?

410
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,280
Your Majesty,

411
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
it's better not to look at it

412
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
for your health.

413
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:36,760
Is...

414
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,800
Is this really the Crown Prince?

415
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,199
Mother!

416
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,000
Why would I let myself die in the hands of others?

417
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,400
This is the body of the assassin.

418
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,599
Rest assured.

419
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,239
You have me.

420
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,439
You're a good son.

421
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,239
I knew you'd return safely.

422
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
The moment His Highness arrived,

423
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,680
he instructed that I bring this body here.

424
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,880
It was to shock the mastermind
behind the assassination.

425
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,719
I hope Your Majesty can forgive me.

426
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,599
What on earth had happened?

427
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Did you run into assassins on your back?

428
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,319
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

429
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,040
Have you found out

430
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,959
who was behind this?

431
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,479
I didn't use the main road

432
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
and changed my routes many times.

433
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,839
But the assassins still kept chasing after me.

434
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
So I had to set a trap.

435
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,479
Your Highness.

436
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Second Uncle, why are you looking at me like that?

437
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm happy.

438
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I'm so happy that I'm speechless.

439
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,760
Your Highness is brave, a great tactician,
and has excellent martial arts.

440
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,920
It's indeed the nation's blessing.

441
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,000
Great.

442
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,359
Well played!

443
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,239
The Crown Prince is requested
to have an audience with His Majesty.

444
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,080
Your Majesty.

445
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,320
-Your Majesty!
-His Majesty has passed away!

446
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,159
Big Brother!

447
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,320
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty.

448
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,520
Father,

449
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,000
I've returned late.

450
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,520
His Majesty's imperial edict!

451
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,760
Official Yang, please announce
the imperial edict.

452
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,840
According to the will of heaven,

453
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,239
here's the Emperor's imperial edict.

454
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,280
"I, who is lacking, succeeded
my forefathers' empire.

455
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,080
It's been about a year
since I ascended the throne.

456
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,560
I was eager to achieve
what my late father had accomplished.

457
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,879
I devoted myself with a sincere
and sorrowful heart.

458
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
As the people's hardship has yet to be resolved,

459
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,640
I worked and worried day and night
for a long time.

460
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,159
It eventually led to critical illness
and death was inevitable.

461
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,120
Life and death are the natural order of life.

462
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,919
Twas the same with the predecessors.
So, no need to feel sad.

463
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,639
The people of the country need a monarch.

464
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,120
My eldest son, the Crown Prince, is kind,

465
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,560
filial, and wise.

466
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,760
The great weapon of the Late Emperor

467
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,000
said the people. What great hope he is.

468
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:22,919
He's best suited to be the next emperor,

469
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,159
to believe in heaven's decree,

470
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,199
and to comfort the hearts of the millions."

471
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,399
"I've only been the Emperor for a short while.

472
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,439
Yet, I haven't showered my grace on the people.

473
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,280
I can't bear for them to work too hard.

474
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,000
The mausoleum system must be frugal.

475
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,560
The funeral system shall change
from months to days.

476
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,800
All shall remove
their mourning clothes after 27 days."

477
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,300
[Qianqing Palace]

478
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:10,600
Pass my decree.

479
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
During the mourning,

480
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,800
princes abroad shall not leave
their own territories.

481
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,879
Strengthen the defense of every garrison.

482
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:19,679
I don't ever want to see the spectacle

483
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,679
the Prince of Han had caused.

484
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,159
Your Majesty,

486
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,399
Consort Jing's grandfather, Zhang Yu,
took part in the founding of this country.

487
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,399
He quelled the war and wiped out
treacherous officials under orders.

488
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,719
He rendered meritorious service.

489
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,520
Her father, Duke of Ying, Zhang Fu,
is an important official of the country.

490
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,080
So she's the daughter of a meritorious official.

491
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,360
Please exclude her from the sacrificial burial.

492
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes.

493
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,239
Mother, Noble Consort Guo, is also
the daughter of a meritorious official.

494
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,679
She gave birth to three sons to Father.

495
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:12,800
It's not right to list her
in the funeral sacrifice.

496
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,199
Noble Consort Guo

497
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,800
should be buried along with your father.

498
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,399
Why?

499
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,600
Mother.

500
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
Please tell me

501
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,479
why she must be part of the funeral sacrifice?

502
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,560
You're overthinking again.

503
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,800
Your Majesty!

504
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,520
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

505
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,879
Your Majesty!

506
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
Somebody! Help!

507
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:00,919
Your Majesty!

508
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,159
Father loved Noble Consort Guo very much.

509
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,399
Her glory and honor depend on it.

510
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,399
This doesn't make sense.

511
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,679
How do you know
that poisoned wine was for your father?

512
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,679
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Guo,
is jealous of Mother.

513
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,159
She personally served

514
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,520
that poisoned wine to Mother.

515
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,239
Go.

516
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,479
Your Highness,
when the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

517
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,719
it'll be time to appoint titles
to the Eastern Palace's concubines.

518
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,840
Didn't you say it's not spacious enough?

519
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,239
When we move to a new palace,

520
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,719
you should feel happy with it.

521
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,439
Why do you still look sad?

522
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,840
Where do you think

523
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
the previous owners of these palaces go?

524
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,439
They've left with the Late Emperor.

525
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
When they leave,

526
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,199
their family will be compensated and rewarded.

527
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,080
It's an honor that others are envious of.

528
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:29,040
Then...

529
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,439
Why are you in a rush?

530
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:44,959
I have something urgent.

531
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:45,840
I won't let you leave if you don't tell me.

532
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,040
Do you know who that is?

533
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:48,600
That's...

534
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
I can't believe that Crown Prince's Concubine.

535
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,000
How dare she shelters a concubine
who's on the sacrificial list.

536
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,159
I'm going to tell the Empress about this.

537
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,719
You're the timidest one among us.

538
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,600
What's wrong with you today?

539
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,520
How dare you behave wantonly today?

540
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,840
The Crown Prince's Concubine
is a bad influence on you.

541
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,080
Get out of my way.

542
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,159
Wu,

543
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,639
please.

544
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,600
Don't tell anyone about this.

545
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,239
The Crown Princess has been busy
with memorial ceremonies.

546
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,159
She has no time to bother about other matters.

547
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,320
But she's hiding out in Xinuan Pavilion.

548
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,520
We've come and go the palace.

549
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,199
Anyone would have seen her.

550
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,320
It's just that we're all concubines
of the imperial harem.

551
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,439
We had no grudge against each other.

552
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,959
So who would tell anyone about this?

553
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,479
The Crown Prince's Concubine has said

554
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
she'll plead for mercy.

555
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
She'll think of a plan.

556
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,800
Or if we work together,

557
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,600
who knows we might save Noble Consort Guo's life?

558
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,120
You're overestimating yourself. Let me go!

559
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,080
Wu!

560
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:45,840
Let her go!

561
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,439
How would you know
if her fate today will not be ours tomorrow?

562
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,040
Forget it! I don't care anymore!

563
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:57,959
I don't care!

564
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:04,679
It's you.

565
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,199
Please help me.

566
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,719
Please help me persuade Big Brother.

567
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,479
Stop my mother from being a sacrificial burial.

568
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm sorry for mistreating you in the past.

569
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,399
Please help me!

570
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,919
Help me!

571
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:16,800
Prince of Wei has kneeled all day.

572
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,639
Help me!

573
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:18,879
But the sacrificial burial is part
of the ancestral instruction.

574
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,719
The ancestral instructions can't be violated.

575
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,439
Besides, it's the Her Majesty's decree.

576
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,840
Help me!

577
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:27,600
Officer You,

578
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,040
I need a favor from you.

579
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:34,600
Now, this is once in a blue moon.

580
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,639
You're actually begging me.

581
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm not begging

582
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:39,399
but requesting.

583
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:42,719
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne,

584
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:44,199
and you need to build your prestige.

585
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,679
You can save two lives

586
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,239
and have two people indebted to you

587
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,560
by doing one favor.

588
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,040
Please help me! Help me!

589
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,080
This is a great opportunity.

590
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:58,120
You're indeed concerned about me.

591
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,239
Tell me about it.

592
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,040
Please help me!

593
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,600
Help me!

594
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,120
What is she telling him?

595
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,399
Please help me! Help me!

596
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,000
Please help me!

597
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,120
Please help me!
