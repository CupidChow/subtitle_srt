[Episode 16]

3
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,639
Search carefully for the blood clams
from Liaodong.

4
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,760
They're for treating qi and blood imbalance

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,279
in women.

6
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,480
They arrived in Beijing
around August or September.

7
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,360
Yes.

8
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:01,839
Your Highness,

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,199
did Imperial Physician Sheng tell you

10
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,919
about the medicinal material?

11
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,919
They can't identify it.

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Why would I bring you along?

13
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,399
Go and help them.

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,240
Yes.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,119
If they arrived in September,

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,759
they would be sun-dried.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Sun-dried.

18
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:36,960
This...

19
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,639
This is locked.

20
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,240
This must be it.

21
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,320
Carry him there.

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,080
Yes.

23
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

24
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,399
Imperial bodyguards are people
with special hidden talents.

25
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,160
You may leave after one hour.

26
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,039
Your Highness! Your Highness!

27
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,800
Forgive me.

28
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,520
Forgive me.

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
I followed you to protect you.

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,080
Take him away.

31
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,160
Your Highness.

32
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,559

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Well,

36
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,279
should we help him or not?

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
Don't just stand there.

38
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,080
Come and help me.

39
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,199
Wait for an hour.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,160
Good for you.

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,399
Empress.

42
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
Dews are dense late at night.

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,359
You are in poor health.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,559
What must you insist on seeing me?

46
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,160
Your Majesty, please allow

47
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
Imperial Physician Sheng

48
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,160
to continue treating my illness.

49
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,679
He gave you a prescription earlier.

50
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,359
It nearly took away a life.

51
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,559
Fortunately, the dragon heir is safe.

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
I was merciful

53
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,720
and pardoned him.

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,839
How could you believe him?

55
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,760
I trust Imperial Physician Sheng.

56
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,359
He did not deceive you, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,320
I would know

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
whether I'm pregnant or sick.

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,359
Your Majesty, please allow

60
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,359
Imperial Physician Sheng
to continue to treat me.

61
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,040
Your Majesty,

62
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,880
Administrative Assistant Dai
is an expert in gynecology.

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
How can he misdiagnose the pregnancy pulse?

64
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
If you believe that quack doctor

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
and hurt the dragon heir,

66
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,040
who can take responsibility for the crime?

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
There is no dragon heir, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,679
This matter is important

69
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,079
and we should be serious.

70
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,119
Your Majesty,

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,239
go back and rest

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
and summon imperial physicians
to take your good pulse?

73
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Good pulse?

74
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,519
Within three days,

75
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,799
I'll breathe my last here.

76
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
How can I have a good pulse?

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Empress!

78
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
My wife.

79
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,559
Stand up.

80
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Pregnancy is a great thing.

81
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,320
How can you talk nonsense?

82
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,640
Father,

83
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,440
Her Majesty was upset

84
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,079
and spoke inauspiciously.

85
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,239
Please forgive her.

86
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,440
Help her back to the palace.

87
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,880
Your Majesty!

88
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,600
I married into the imperial family at 15.

89
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,399
I've served you for more than 20 years

90
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,359
and given birth to three sons and a daughter.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm asking for nothing

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,720
except for this, Your Majesty.

93
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
On account

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,839
of my dedication to serving you my whole life,

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
please allow me to have my way.

96
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,079
Just once.

97
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
Let me see Imperial Physician Sheng.

98
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
I want to stay alive.

99
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,839
I beg you, Your Majesty.

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,920
Didn't I order the Imperial Academy of Medicine

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,839
to diagnose you to save your life?

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,119
All women in the world need to give birth.

103
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,279
I've never seen anyone as crazy as you.

104
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,320
Empress,

105
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,160
you've given birth before.

106
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,519
How can you tolerate
a misdiagnosis by a quack doctor

107
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,359
that will kill

108
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,200
our precious baby?

109
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,440
I will take all responsibilities

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,760
for the consequences.

111
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,679
Your Majesty, please agree.

112
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,799
Your Majesty oversees the six palaces

113
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,920
and is the country's motherly model.

114
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,440
How can you say something so bizarre?

115
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,720
Giving birth to royal heirs

116
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,799
is the imperial harem's primary responsibility.

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,239
If it were me,

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,839
I'd risk my life to save the child.

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,600
How could Your Majesty

120
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,840
not tolerate the pain and...

121
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,119
Your Majesty,

122
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,239
the moonlit night is cold.

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,559
You mustn't allow Her Majesty

124
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,679
to lose her composure.

125
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,640
What if the dragon heir

126
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,239
is harmed?

127
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,760
Help her back to the Kunning Palace

128
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,200
and relay my edict

129
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,080
to summon all imperial physicians
for a consultation.

130
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:05,880
Your Majesty.

131
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,200
Your Majesty.

132
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,359
Have mercy, Your Majesty,

133
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,520
I am in pain.

134
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,080
Please save me.

135
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,159
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,559
Your Majesty.

137
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,039
Leave.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,919
Your Majesty.

139
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,799
At this hour...

140
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,799
Go now.

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,239
Yes.

142
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,719
Here,

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,200
come on.

144
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,760
I lost my composure today.

145
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

146
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
I'll take my leave.

147
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,440
The Late Emperor

148
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,719
always praised her for being obedient and wise.

149
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,080
I regard her as a good wife.

150
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,280
Why is she

151
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
a completely different person today?

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
She was...

153
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,400
so reckless

154
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
and

155
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,760
irresponsible.

156
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,960
Your Majesty.

157
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Your Majesty.

158
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,440
Lady of Talents Wu.

159
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,200
Her Majesty isn't receiving guests.

160
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Please go back.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
I won't go in and disturb her.

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,159
I'll wait here.

163
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
When she feels better,

164
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'll go in and extend my regards.

165
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,239
Follow me.

166
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,440
You can leave us.

167
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,039
Your Highness.

168
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,359
What's in that sack?

169
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,359
It moves.

170
00:12:59,359 --> 00:12:59,880
Go back.

171
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,119
Now?

172
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,159
I'm not an imperial physician.

173
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,039
I'll be in the way.

174
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
Earlier, you stayed

175
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,599
against Female Official Mei's advice.

176
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,119
I can't leave until His Highness

177
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,840
sees

178
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,719
me waiting here.

179
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,719
Can I let the Crown Princess
take all the praises?

180
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,599
Now is the critical moment.

181
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,599
You can't leave.

182
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,080
In this palace,

183
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,799
having too much or too little love is bad.

184
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,440
This is just enough.

185
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's go.

186
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:30,479
Mother.

187
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,159
Your Highness.

188
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,359
Mother.

189
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,440
Zhanyong, Zhanshan, and Jiaxing

190
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,679
missed you and cried.

191
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,159
They're worried about you.

192
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,359
I have sent them back first.

193
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,719
When you feel better,

194
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,239
I'll let them greet you.

195
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,000
Alright.

196
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,159
Mother.

197
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,280
This time, I brought Sheng Yin here

198
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
to take your pulse.

199
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,960
Your Highness,

200
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,719
His Majesty decreed

201
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,280
that Sheng Yin could not enter the palace again.

202
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:02,719
Your Highness,

203
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,440
this is wrong.

204
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,159
Are rules more important

205
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,280
than my mother's life?

206
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,440
Sheng Yin.

207
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,400
Yes.

208
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:13,559
I...

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,559
How is it?

210
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,280
Your Highness,

211
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,320
thankfully you are decisive.

212
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,719
Three more days

213
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,280
and even a reincarnated Hua Tuo can't cure her.
(*a physician known for his surgical operations)

214
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,479
Imperial Physician Sheng,

215
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,880
is Her Majesty's condition that serious?

216
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,960
Her pulse is deep, choppy, wiry, tight,

217
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
and has no force.

218
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,880
It isn't a slippery pulse or pregnancy.

219
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,080
It is caused by blocked meridians

220
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,000
and poor blood and qi circulation.

221
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,440
She should take the qi-activating
peach kernel decoction

222
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,919
and the Didang decoction to boost
blood circulation and remove blood stasis.

223
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,080
However,

224
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,760
they prescribed medicine
to prevent miscarriages, relax the mind,

225
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,080
warm the meridians, and stop bleeding.

226
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:08,440
Naturally, that made the illness worse.

227
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,919
Her period stopped four months ago

228
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,239
and she has abdominal pain.

229
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,840
If she is not pregnant, what can it be?

230
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,200
The slippery pulse is irregular

231
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,200
because she is weak.

232
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,520
Hence, her pregnant pulse is not obvious.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,640
Your Highness,

234
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,239
the peach decoction contains
peach kernels and Chinese rhubarb.

235
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,400
The Didang decoction
has leeches and horseflies.

236
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,479
Both are stasis-dispelling medicines.

237
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,000
Pregnant women cannot take them.

238
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,359
Sheng Yin,

239
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
to become famous,

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
you'll harm the dragon fetus.

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,239
It's punishable by death.

242
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,640
Your Highness,

243
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,239
don't listen to what the quack doctor says.

244
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,719
His prescription

245
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,679
will harm the dragon fetus

246
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,880
and even the phoenix body.

247
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Your Highness,

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,359
I took her pulse

249
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,400
and it was a slippery pulse.

250
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,239
Your Highness, please reconsider.

251
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,320
The voices of many confuse right with wrong.

252
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,039
Defamation destroys a man.

253
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,599
There are too many idiots in the world.

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,919
Your Highness,

255
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,679
I will say no more.

256
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,760
Please decide.

257
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,599
Your Highness,

258
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,000
imperial physicians
can prescribe medications

259
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,280
but cannot decide for the patient.

260
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,400
Mother,

261
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
when I was small, you told me

262
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,599
that one must be decisive in life.

263
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Indecisiveness ruins everything.

264
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,479
So I conduct myself

265
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,280
like you, Mother.

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Even if I take the wrong path,

267
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,400
I will blaze trails and break paths

268
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,640
and fight my way out.

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Lives are at stake here.

270
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,719
It's up to you to decide.

271
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,640
If you think Sheng Yin is right,

272
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
I will support you.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,640
Your Highness,

274
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,359
what if His Majesty gets mad?

275
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,719
I'll stand guard outside.

276
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,000
No one will disturb you.

277
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,039
Do not worry.

278
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,200
I'll stay with you.

279
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,079
Sheng Yin,

280
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
give me the medicine.

281
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,119
Yes.

282
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,079
Your Majesty,

283
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,319
please take charge.

284
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,599
What happened?

285
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,439
Your Majesty,

286
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,079
you must stop the Crown Prince.

287
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,000
He insisted on letting Sheng Yin
treat Her Majesty.

288
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,000
I fear...

289
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,319
I fear that the dragon heir will be aborted.

290
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,000
How arrogant!

291
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Your Majesty.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,079
-Move aside.
-Her Majesty just took her medicine.

293
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,040
Your Majesty.

294
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,959
Zhu Zhanji,

295
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,680
where is that quack doctor?

296
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,839
Your Majesty, I'm here.

297
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,599
Imperial Physician Sheng, you...

298
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,199
Your Highness,

299
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,079
I wrote a pledge in front of His Highness.

300
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,839
If I can't heal Her Majesty,

301
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,280
I am willing to die.

302
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Sheng Yin, you...

303
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,959
You... you are making a big mistake.

304
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,880
Administrative Assistant Dai,

305
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,599
I dare you to make a public pledge like me?

306
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,400
You...

307
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,439
If Her Majesty is not cured within 10 days,

308
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,319
you will be beheaded.

309
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,040
Your Majesty.

310
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,199
Do you both

311
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,239
dare?

312
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,479
Your Majesty,

313
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,560
an imperial physician diagnoses
with his medical skills,

314
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
not ignorance.

315
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,920
We shouldn't physically threaten him.

316
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
If he is frightened,

317
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
how can he treat the patient calmly?

318
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
Sheng Yin,

319
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
don't be arrogant.

320
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,719
If you hurt the dragon heir,

321
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,280
you can't compensate with your head.

322
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,359
Zhu Zhanji,

323
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,400
is this a trick

324
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,439
you taught them?

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Father,

326
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,319
please respect my mother's decision.

327
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,119
Don't I respect your mother?

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
If I don't respect her,

329
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,760
will I convene the imperial physicians
for a consultation?

330
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,800
Why would I visit late at night?

331
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,040
Zhu Zhanji,

332
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,880
do you know

333
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,439
that your mistake

334
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
may kill your mother

335
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,920
and the unborn baby?

336
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,280
Why are you laughing?

337
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,319
What's so funny?

338
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,800
Father,

339
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,680
while in the Eastern Palace,

340
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,560
you stood your ground
and offended my grandfather.

341
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
You bravely offered advice.

342
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,319
As your wife,

343
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,719
my mother always stayed by your side

344
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,319
with undiminished love.

345
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,640
Did she ever ask you about
the consequences of what you did?

346
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,920
Did she ever show the slightest fear and cower?

347
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,920
Never.

348
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,439
Whatever you

349
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
desired to do, she never questioned you

350
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,040
and resolutely supported you.

351
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,479
As for you,

352
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,040
why wouldn't you trust her once?

353
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,119
If you can't heal her,

354
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,719
I don't want your head.

355
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,040
I want to kill your entire clan.

356
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:48,719
Your Majesty,

357
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,680
Her Majesty took the medicine

358
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,000
and expelled a lot of blood clots.

359
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,479
She is feeling much better.

360
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,119
Ziping.

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,520
Let me do it.

362
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,319
You've worked all night long.

363
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,359
I feel peaceful

364
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,199
when I'm cooking.

365
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,760
Last night,

366
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,359
Her Majesty took medicine to induce bleeding

367
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,079
and discharged clots.

368
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,000
She might be deficient in qi and blood.

369
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,680
She should eat medicinal food
to strengthen qi and blood today.

370
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I should prepare in advance.

371
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,599
You did all the work,

372
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,280
but the credit goes to someone else.

373
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,160
Why is that so?

374
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,839
You'll become more skillful as you practice.

375
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
When no one can replace you,

376
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
you will be unique.

377
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,400
The saying that suffering is a blessing

378
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,479
is not deceptive.

379
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,599
Fine.

380
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,280
If you please Her Majesty,

381
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,040
you please His Highness also.

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Ziping,

383
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,719
I've been hiding something

384
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,439
from my past.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,160
I want to tell you about it today,

386
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Yao Zijin!

387
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,100
[Kunning Palace]

388
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
Your meal, Your Majesty.

389
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,479
[Longan, Goji, and Pigeon Egg Soup]
This is longan, goji, and pigeon egg soup

390
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,520
that nourishes qi, blood, and yin
and moistens the lungs.

391
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,920
You should drink it first.

392
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,975
[Emerald Buddha's Hands and Chicken]

393
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,880
Is it garnished with Buddha's Hands flowers?

394
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,680
Your Majesty,

395
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,119
this dish is called Buddha's Hands Chicken.

396
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,880
It leaves a unique taste in my mouth,

397
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,680
like fermented tofu.

398
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,680
No.

399
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
The taste lingers on my tongue

400
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,319
like wine.

401
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Your Majesty,

402
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,040
this dish contains

403
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
(fermented tofu sauce and glutinous rice wine.)

404
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,640
(Glutinous rice wine warms the qi.)

405
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,119
(I specially selected it for you.)

406
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,680
Thank you.

407
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:11,880
Your Majesty,

408
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,479
please slow down.

409
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,000
Your Majesty,

410
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,280
you've just recovered.

411
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,680
Do not overeat.

412
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,479
It's crispy on the outside and juicy inside.

413
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,319
It tastes very good.

414
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,839
What a pity.

415
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,048
[Soup With Pepper]

416
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
It has been many years

417
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,000
since I last smelled this.

418
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
Empress Zhang is from Yongcheng.

419
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,560
She loves to have soup with pepper
and fried dumplings for breakfast.

420
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,319
You know all local delicacies.

421
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,239
How can you not know this?

422
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,640
It's just some street food.

423
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,359
How can such crude food be offered?

424
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,359
More than 20 herbal ingredients
are used in the soup

425
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,479
and they change with the seasons.

426
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,880
You were stumped

427
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
when Her Majesty asked about the ingredients.

428
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,239
She would know

429
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,239
that someone else made the meal.

430
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,479
You wasted the chance I gave you.

431
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,400
Your Majesty,

432
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,599
you have just recovered.

433
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
Why not wait...

434
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,040
Do you know how I get this spinning wheel?

435
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,479
I've heard

436
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,800
that this was given by Empress Xiaochengren.

437
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,640
That's right.

438
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,479
When Mother gave it to me, she said

439
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,959
that a man who doesn't farm

440
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,079
will starve.

441
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,479
A woman who doesn't weave

442
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
will suffer from cold.

443
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Men farm and women weave.

444
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,760
The wife follows her husband.

445
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,000
This is a truth that rules the world.

446
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,640
Yes.

447
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:49,880
Your Majesty!

448
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,119
Your Majesty!

449
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,079
What a waste if it is broken!

450
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,359
-Your Majesty!
-Send it to the Imperial Food Service

451
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,719
and burn it as firewood.

452
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,199
Yes.

453
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,520
Father.

454
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,800
Why are you here?

455
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,880
I heard that you are not feeling well.

456
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
I specially came here to ask for forgiveness.

457
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:27,800
Father,

458
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,880
take your medicine first.

459
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,000
I am late.

460
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

461
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:51,040
Guangzong County of Shunde Prefecture
has a lot of rain this year.

462
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,479
The locality submitted the report late,

463
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,800
and disaster relief was delayed.

464
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,040
I decreed earlier

465
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
that in natural disasters,

466
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,280
warehouses must be opened
for disaster relief first.

467
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,599
However,

468
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,239
some officials would become greedy.

469
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,520
You must...

470
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Father,

471
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,000
send a regional investigating censor

472
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,760
if you worry about local officials

473
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,680
embezzling during disaster relief.

474
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,680
If the censor conducts an inspection
with great fanfare,

475
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,760
he would hear and see

476
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,479
what other people want him to see.

477
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,199
You're young.

478
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,959
What do you know?

479
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,280
Father,

480
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,599
the imperial bodyguards
are making arrests outside Beijing.

481
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,640
There are frequent arrests
without authorization.

482
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,040
One can imagine

483
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,920
how arrogant they normally are.

484
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,920
If you order them to check secretly,

485
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,359
there will be more wrongdoings.

486
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
During my grandfather's time,

487
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,280
they were more restrained.

488
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,359
Now...

489
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,040
I...

490
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,319
I...

491
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,280
let the imperial bodyguards act
without restriction.

492
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,359
Father.

493
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,280
Get out.

494
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,640
I was harsh with my words.

495
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,319
Please take care of your health.

496
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,319
Had you and your mother
not joined forces to anger me,

497
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,000
I would be in good health.

498
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,160
Why are you still here?

499
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,640
I'll take my leave.

500
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
Unfilial son!

501
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,719
I read the memorial you submitted.

502
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,439
It was rather to the point.

503
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,319
However, the officials of ministries
will handle the matters.

504
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,280
Don't worry about them.

505
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,239
A butcher who killed

506
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,839
countless loyalists

507
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,400
is giving advice to His Majesty
like a learned scholar.

508
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:22,040
Water transporters and land-tax escorts
in the capital are tired

509
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,000
but have no place to stay.

510
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
This is sheer nonsense.

511
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,400
Don't discuss loudly.

512
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,599
He only has to jot down

513
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,959
what your guests and friends said

514
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,040
at the banquet yesterday,

515
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,400
and tomorrow, Official Liu, your head might roll.

516
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:39,160
I won't let this disgusting stuff dirty my eyes.

517
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,550
[He regularly demands 480 taels
for approval of passage.]

518
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,359
This is...

519
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,719
His Majesty

520
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
has a relapse.

521
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,400
Administrative Assistant Dai gave
a prescription to regulate his body.

522
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,199
He must stop his vegetarian diet.

523
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:31,719
Help me

524
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:32,319
move this inside.

525
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,439
Let's move them inside.

526
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,599
Come here.

527
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,800
Here.

528
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:41,800
Be careful.

529
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,599
Give it to me.

530
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,359
The noble consort of Yongning Palace wants it.

531
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,119
You can't take it.

532
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,479
Can't you see?

533
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,920
Dare you take Her Majesty's things?

534
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,760
Let go.

535
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,839
Give it to me.

536
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,839
Give it to me.

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Don't take my thing.

538
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,479
Why are you so noisy?

539
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,839
Miss Yukuai.

540
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,680
The black goji is for Kunning Palace.

541
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
She said that the noble consort wants it.

542
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
And she wants all of it.

543
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,479
We ordered it three days ago,

544
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,040
but it wasn't given to us.

545
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,520
First come, first served.

546
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,040
Let go.

547
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,359
If you take all,

548
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,719
what am I going to say?

549
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,359
Stop.

550
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:27,920
Yukuai,

551
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,520
you can scold a palace maid
for doing something wrong,

552
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,839
but don't hit them.

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,839
Moreover,

554
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,359
the noble consort wants the black goji

555
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,160
for His Majesty's heart disease.

556
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
No one is above His Majesty.

557
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:39,839
Give me the goji.

558
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,239
I...

559
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,239
Give them to me.

560
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:44,839
Give me.

561
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,359
The noble consort ordered this.

562
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,800
It's mine.

563
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,160
Fine!

564
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,160
The berries grow in high mountains

565
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,040
and are rare.

566
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,880
How dare you knock over
such a precious medicinal material?

567
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,800
You lost your grip first.

568
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,239
-Don't frame me.
-You knocked it over.

569
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,000
You...

570
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,760
Manager Wen, look!

571
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,520
Xiang Qin is in trouble.

572
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,119
I...

573
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,160
You're so ungrateful!

574
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,399
How dare you spoil everything.

575
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,879
Everyone makes mistakes. Talk amicably.

576
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,199
It's so loud and noisy.

577
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,560
What if outsiders hear us?

578
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,320
Clean it up.

579
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,760
I have no one to support me.

580
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,439
I dare not be arrogant.

581
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,199
I can't compete with Miss Fang,

582
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,399
who is in a big hurry to get married to a eunuch.

583
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,520
You are about to climb higher in higher status.

584
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,560
You!

585
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,760
You've gone too far!

586
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,560
Look at you.

587
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,679
I got your sore point?

588
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,120
I'll wrestle you to the ground.

589
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
Xuelu, take it.

590
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,600
Let go.

591
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,560
Don't take that.

592
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,399
You can't take that.

593
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,520
You really can't take that.

594
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't waste it.

595
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,239
You can't take that.

596
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,320
Stop fighting!

597
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,040
Manager Fang.

598
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,840
Manager Fang.

599
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,719
Manager Fang.

600
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,239
Don't take that.

601
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,760
You!

602
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,080
Come over here.

603
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,520
Stay there.

604
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,280
Stop.

605
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,439
I hit you.

606
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,719
Ziping.

607
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,719
Yin Ziping.

608
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,439
Don't take that!

609
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,199
Stop fighting!

610
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Stop fighting!

611
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,800
Don't take it!

612
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,760
Stop fighting!

613
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,439
Ziping!

614
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,520
Ziping!

615
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,360
Stop!

616
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,080
The matron is here!

617
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,040
All of you, stop!

618
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,840
Kneel.

619
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,919
Kneel for two hours

620
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,159
and reflect on your mistakes.

621
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,879
I...

622
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:52,479
Kneel properly.

623
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,439
Pretentious.

624
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,199
What about you?

625
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,360
Why did you fight?

626
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,479
His Majesty gave the valuable advice

627
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,239
to reinstate Meng.

628
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,159
I can't go against his wish.

629
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,959
She seeks gains

630
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,040
in exchange for love.

631
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,399
The head of the Imperial Food Service

632
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,760
must convince everyone.

633
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:31,800
Otherwise,

634
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,439
even if I give an edict,

635
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,560
you still cannot convince everyone.

636
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:36,800
Your Majesty,

637
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,479
I have confidence.

638
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,679
In terms of seniority,

639
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,600
Meng is far above you.

640
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I will let you compete on an equal footing.

641
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Your Majesty.

642
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,040
Leave.

643
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,360
Your Majesty,

644
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,919
His Majesty just conferred

645
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Guo Xuan, Noble Consort Guo's elder brother,
the title of the Marquis of Wuding.

646
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,840
An exemption was made to confer her grandmother, Yan,
as the Mistress of the Duke of Ying.

647
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,840
Her mother, Xu, was given the title of Lady.

648
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,919
Also,

649
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,159
Huang Yan, the Late Emperor's close attendant,
had illicit affairs with foreign ministers

650
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,639
and was executed.

651
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,760
His property and money go to
the Marquis of Wuding.

652
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,439
One should plan first and act later.

653
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
An impetuous person

654
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,320
cannot achieve great success.

655
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,360
Yes.

656
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,399
(To Grandmother,
from your granddaughter Guo Duansu.)

657
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,639
(After I bade goodbye to you,)

658
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
(summers and autumns have passed.)

659
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,439
(I heard that you are unwell)

660
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,679
(and sent a eunuch
to bring along an imperial physician)

661
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
(to ask about your condition.)

662
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,925
[To the Mistress of the Duke of Ying]

663
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:06,879
Yujing,

664
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,399
make sure you give this letter

665
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,000
to my grandmother personally

666
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,520
and send my message to her.

667
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,639
The company one keeps

668
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,840
has a bearing on his success.

669
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,159
Be respectful and modest,

670
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,639
and you'll safeguard
our forefathers' achievements.

671
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,679
Grandmother, take care of the brothers,
sons, and nephews in the clan,

672
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,560
and the Guo family will be assured

673
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
of long-term peace and prosperity.

674
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,040
Your Highness,

675
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,399
now your brother is the marquis,

676
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,879
it is clear that His Majesty favors
the Guo family.

677
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,560
Even Her Majesty's parental home
cannot compare with you.

678
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,879
You should be happy.

679
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,760
Why are you so worried?

680
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,280
When I'm happy,

681
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,919
someone will be unhappy.

682
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,879
I must have a sense of crisis,

683
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,280
or

684
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,719
there'll be trouble.

685
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,199
Yes.

686
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,040
Wait.

687
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,120
These are

688
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,000
His Majesty's gift of 1,000-year-old wild ginseng
and 1,000-year-old glossy ganoderma.

689
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,159
This medicine
is from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

690
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,879
My grandmother is old,

691
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,719
frail, and sickly. She catches a cold easily.

692
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,399
This is specially prepared
by the imperial physicians.

693
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,520
Take them.

694
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,840
Watch the maids who are serving my grandmother.

695
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,399
If they neglect her,

696
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
dismiss them immediately.

697
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

698
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,520
Stay safe.

699
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,760
Let's go.

700
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:25,800
Your Highness, you're back.

701
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,639
Why are you here?

702
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,879
Didn't you love the Duyou Guqin?

703
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,679
What a pity

704
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,600
that the string is broken.

705
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,280
I found

706
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,000
a string that matches the original guqin

707
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,639
and replaced the broken string.

708
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,040
Listen.

709
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
The sound is as clear and smooth as before.

710
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,399
Can I play a song for you

711
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,600
to relieve your boredom?

712
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,560
Don't bother.

713
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Someone will tidy that up.

714
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,360
Your Highness, can you tell me

715
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,080
what is troubling you?

716
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:23,800
I am stupid

717
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,959
and may not be able to resolve your worries

718
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,159
but if you speak your mind,

719
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,760
I will lend you my ears.

720
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,879
-Your Highness.
-Leave the guqin here.

721
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,520
Thank you for your concern.

722
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:36,600
If there is nothing else,

723
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,040
I'll visit you another day.

724
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,479
Your Highness.

725
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,719
Anything else?

726
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,320
This study is simple.

727
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,679
It is unsuitable for a long stay.

728
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,120
Mother fears that the attendants
will neglect you

729
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,080
and sent me here to discuss with you

730
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,360
about moving back.

731
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,320
People come and go to the palace every day.

732
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,000
It is very noisy.

733
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,520
This place is elegant

734
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:05,719
in comparison.

735
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,080
I'll live here.

736
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,439
Your Highness, I should stay

737
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:10,280
with you then.

738
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,159
If you refuse to move,

739
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,360
from tomorrow onwards,

740
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,000
I'll accompany you more often.

741
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,280
When you are busy,

742
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,679
I'll grind ink and pour tea.

743
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,120
When you are free,

744
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,679
we'll chat so that you're not bored.

745
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,760
Is that fine with you?

746
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,120
I already said

747
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,879
don't serve me day and night.

748
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,479
When Mother was the consort
of the Eastern Palace,

749
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,199
she attended to His Majesty's

750
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,679
daily needs.

751
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,120
This is the duty of a wife.

752
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,320
In the past, Your Highness' tolerance

753
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,639
had made me lazy.

754
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,399
I am seriously changing now.

755
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,040
I said no.

756
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,120
Yuan Qi,

757
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,239
send the Crown Princess back.

758
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,280
Yes.

759
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Your Highness,

760
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,520
please.

761
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:52,719
I will come again tomorrow.

762
00:42:58,959 --> 00:42:59,719
Don't see me off.

763
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Take care of His Highness.

764
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:12,320
Your Highness,

765
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:13,919
did you see that?

766
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,919
Why do I feel

767
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,840
that the Crown Princess

768
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,280
is different from the past?

769
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,639
What time is it?

770
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:26,919
Why hasn't my meal arrived?

771
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,120
It was delivered

772
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
earlier.

773
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,120
Miss Yao put the food box

774
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,040
outside.

775
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,800
The Crown Princess was here just now.

776
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,040
She can't just deliver.

777
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:41,600
Tell her

778
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,800
that I don't like today's meal.

779
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:44,840
Tell her to make another set.

780
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,199
Again?

781
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,879
Yes.
