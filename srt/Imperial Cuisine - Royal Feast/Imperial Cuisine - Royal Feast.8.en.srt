[Episode 8]

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,480
[Xingyun Cottage]

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Your Highness, your prediction was correct.

5
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,839
Prince of Han's personal attendant
disappeared from the prison

6
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,440
before we got to interrogate him.

7
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,160
There's more to this than meets the eye.

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
The key to solving this lies in You Yifan.

9
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,639
Let's head to Qianqing Palace.

10
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,160
Your Highness!

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,639
Your Highness!

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,120
This is sent by Qianqing Palace.

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,759
Your Highness, what does His Majesty mean by this?

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Your Highness?

15
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,000
You still don't understand?

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
Do not hear, do not see, and do not ask.

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
That is His Majesty's intention.

18
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,440
He's telling me to focus on my duties.

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,479
Close the door. I'll resume my study.

20
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,440
Yuehua.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,559
Zijin.

22
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,039
Why did you go out when it was raining?

23
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,759
Consort Zhuang's reward was too precious for me.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
I don't think I deserve them.

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,399
That's why I made some snacks
and sent them to her.

26
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,559
Who knew it would pour outside?

27
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,520
What's the matter?

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,119
Look at you.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,399
You're drenched.

30
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,239
So hot.

31
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,040
Zijin.

32
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,799
Zijin?

33
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,040
Mother.

34
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,880
Poor Zijin.

35
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,720
My mother is already gone.

36
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,440
I wonder where your mother is.

37
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,160
Go and inquire about it.

38
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,959
Forget it. You may leave.

39
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,839
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,799
Dong Anyu ruled over Jinyang.

41
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,079
He sought political advice from Old Man Jian.

42
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,920
Old Man Jian said,

43
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,839
"One must be loyal, trustworthy, and daring."

44
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,600
Dong Anyu said,

45
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,440
"Loyalty is important indeed."

46
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,720
Official Liu is famous for being long-winded.

47
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,279
Usually, when he repeats
his lessons over and over again,

48
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
His Highness is able to withstand it.

49
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,959
What's wrong with His Highness today?

50
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Looks like there's something on his mind.

51
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,160
You're asking the obvious.

52
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,679
I wanted to visit the Imperial Food Service,

53
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,359
but His Highness didn't allow me to.

54
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,920
She's just a maidservant
who delivers His Highness's meals to him.

55
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,720
Her presence has no importance.

56
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Maybe,

57
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
she was scalded by the hot cauldrons.

58
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,920
Maybe she cut herself with a knife.

59
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,399
Or, maybe she fell into the well

60
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,000
when she was trying to get some water.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,679
You're so evil.

62
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,760
I've already memorized this section.

63
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,799
When I finish reading a book,
I can remember its core concepts.

64
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,200
There's no need to repeat it.

65
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,399
Let's stop here for today.

66
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,399
You may leave.

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,760
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,559
It was just a joke.

69
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,679
I'm in a great mood today.

70
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,239
I'm going to head out of the city and go hunting.

71
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,239
Chen Wu,

72
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
His Highness was still
being nonchalant about it

73
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,600
even though you said she fell into the well.

74
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,640
Seems like you miscalculated your step.

75
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,519
Hurry up.

76
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,220
[Animals in the scene are created with CGI]

77
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,640
Your Highness, I caught it.

78
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,959
Your Highness, His Majesty
sent someone to deliver this to you this morning.

79
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,760
According to the Ministry of Rites,

80
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Yin, the wife of Luo Zhu'er, a soldier in Nanjing,

81
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
had given birth to three sons.

82
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,679
Please follow the usual routine
and reward him with grains and cash.

83
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,559
According to the Directorate of Astronomy,
the stars were astronomical in size.

84
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,520
They were cerulean.

85
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Hu Qi, the procurator of Guizhou, has reported

86
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,400
that an auspicious beast was seen at the peaks.

87
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,799
It has black stripes. It has
a lion's head and a tiger's body.

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Your Highness, I haven't finished them yet.

89
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,200
Pass me the rest.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
All of this is useless gossip.

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Send this to Grandfather.

92
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,280
Your Highness, I don't think you should do this.

93
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,239
A good harvest, favorable weather,

94
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,000
and a prosperous nation
are the true signs of auspiciousness.

95
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,239
Capturing the mystical beast
has nothing to do with auspiciousness

96
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,400
and the people.

97
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,039
Tell Hu Qi this.

98
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,960
If he reports false news like this again,

99
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,119
he can quit his position.

100
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, Your Highness.

101
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,359
Yuan Qi.

102
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,440
Your Highness.

103
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,719
Head to the Imperial Food Service personally.

104
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,520
It's been seven days,
and the food quality is getting worse.

105
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,919
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,159
This is the new medicine prepared by
the Medicines Office.

107
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,320
Brew this.

108
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,000
This is...

109
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,119
Here.

110
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,559
Ginseng nourishes the yang energy
of the internal organs.

111
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,159
Manager Fang said
she begged the directress for a long time

112
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,239
before she gave her some ginseng slices.

113
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,159
But from what I see,

114
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,239
this isn't ordinary ginseng.

115
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,119
Eunuch Yuan,

116
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
I followed your instruction.

117
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,679
What if someone gossips about this?

118
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,400
Don't worry.

119
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,640
I know the severity of this matter.

120
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,039
I will never tell anyone else.

121
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
But...

122
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,320
What's the matter?

123
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,320
About this...

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
What's the matter?

125
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,440
We cannot pass things around
without permission in the palace.

126
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,479
Can you please hand this to Eunuch Chen for me?

127
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,359
To Chen Wu?

128
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,520
To Chen Wu?

129
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,799
In his dreams!

130
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,080
In your dreams!

131
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,840
You have such bad taste!

132
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,719
How am I inferior to Chen Wu?

133
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,479
Yantao,

134
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,440
I told you to deliver the meal to Directress Hu.

135
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,719
How could you shirk your responsibility?

136
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Matron Meng ordered me

137
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,960
to hurry

138
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,719
and head to the cellar
to get some preserved meat and sausages.

139
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,080
I was too busy.

140
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
That's why I told He Shu to send the meal to her.

141
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,559
Secondary Consort Guo kept sending
her maidservant to us.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Sometimes, she requests
goat's cheese and milk skin.

143
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,679
Sometimes, she requests shortcakes.

144
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,080
I was too busy to do anything else.

145
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,039
Xuelu,

146
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
didn't I tell you to send the meal to her?

147
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,919
Look at this.

148
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,080
Look at all the sesame oil, sweet sauce,

149
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,159
fermented beans, and so on.
They had just arrived here.

150
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I was checking our inventory.

151
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,559
How dare you still eat?

152
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,520
Zijin,

153
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,479
Directress Hu sprained her foot
by accident yesterday.

154
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,880
Can you send her meals to her?

155
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,239
Yes, Manager.

156
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,919
I'll head there right away.

157
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,640
Directress Hu.

158
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm here to send your meals to you.

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
Usually, they all fuss around me.

160
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,400
They did everything they could to please me.

161
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,159
Now that I've offended Matron Meng,

162
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,320
all of them are afraid
to come into contact with me.

163
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,000
They pushed their duties to each other.

164
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,640
In the end, you were the sacrifice.

165
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,960
Please enjoy your meal.

166
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,799
You have a great personality and patience.

167
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,080
Wait.

168
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,799
Directress, do you need anything else?

169
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Are you willing to be under me?

170
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,039
Yuehua,

171
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,080
these are the recipes of famous dishes
I've gathered over the past decade.

172
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,880
Many of them are incomplete.

173
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,599
I always tried to restore them
to their original appearance.

174
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,200
But one man is only capable of doing this much.

175
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,400
From now on, please assist me

176
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,479
and complete this recipe book which contains
the dishes of our previous dynasties.

177
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,679
Directress Wang,

178
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,039
this is the culmination of your blood and sweat.

179
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,200
How can I read it?

180
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,559
Since Matron Meng has left me in charge of you,

181
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,119
I will do my best to teach you.

182
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,840
I won't hide anything from you.

183
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,640
Are you willing

184
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,440
to learn from me?

185
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you, Master.

186
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,159
Are you not willing to be under me

187
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,440
because of my pathetic state?

188
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,000
That is not the case.

189
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,239
If so, is it because you are unwilling
to involve yourself with the factions?

190
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm just trying to guide you

191
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,119
since I have taken a liking to you.

192
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
We can just be friends.

193
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,839
If you're willing,

194
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
you should call me Sister from now on.

195
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,479
But

196
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,800
why me?

197
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,239
Yin Ziping is narrow-minded.

198
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,319
Su Yuehua is conceited.

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,520
But you,

200
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,280
you can treat everyone impartially.

201
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,319
Almost no one in the Imperial Food Service

202
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,560
had badmouthed you before.

203
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
This is

204
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
quite an achievement.

205
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,079
But Directress Wang hates me.

206
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
You see,

207
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,400
she seeks the pinnacle of the Art of Food.

208
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,479
She wants someone who's truly sincere
in pursuing her passion for cooking.

209
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,760
She was too naive for thinking that
you weren't sincere enough

210
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,560
during her first meeting with you.

211
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,400
You can't survive solely

212
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,800
on your cooking skills alone
in the imperial harem.

213
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,280
If you make yourself likable,

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,359
you'll be able to survive longer.

215
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,000
If so,

216
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,959
Directress, please enlighten me.

217
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,199
In this world, there are all kinds of industries

218
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,439
and jobs.

219
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,359
Do you know what's the secret to success?

220
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,160
Being different?

221
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,040
[Be different]

222
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Being different.

223
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,640
Ziping.

224
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:18,959
Trust me.

225
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,000
Go now.

226
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,319
Matron,

227
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,079
she's been kneeling for four hours.

228
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,079
Matron Meng,

229
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,479
I just hope that you can grant me
permission to enter the kitchen.

230
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,319
I will surely do my best!

231
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,239
Why should I give you this chance?

232
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,359
Even though I've committed a serious offense,

233
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,959
Matron, you didn't chase me away.

234
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,839
According to my bold prediction,

235
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,199
I think you do cherish my talent.

236
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,359
You're one of the few people
to recognize my talent.

237
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
It is beneficial to provide to others as well!

238
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
A lowly person like me has no other way out!

239
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,959
Matron, if you give me another chance,

240
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,839
I will surely serve you with all I have!

241
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
People of the world know
it is beneficial to take from others,

242
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
yet they do not know it is beneficial
to provide to others as well.

243
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
That doesn't seem like something you know.

244
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,920
Fine.

245
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,079
Yin Ziping,

246
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,479
I will give you one last chance.

247
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,640
I hope you can put your talent to good use

248
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,400
and prove to me that I wasn't wrong about you.

249
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Thank you, Matron!

250
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Thank you, Matron!

251
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,479
Your Highness,

252
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,800
His Highness's men said

253
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,439
His Highness will be busy tonight

254
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,800
and that His Highness won't have dinner here.

255
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,040
Your Highness,

256
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
in the past, no matter how busy His Highness was,

257
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,199
as long as you invited him,

258
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
His Highness would keep you company.

259
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
But ever since that incident,

260
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,719
it's been months since His Highness
has stepped into the Dongnuan Pavilion.

261
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,719
Could it be that His Highness has known the truth?

262
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,280
No.

263
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,599
That can't be.

264
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,640
My sister has dealt with it.

265
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,959
The Medicines Office has no idea about it at all.

266
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
I'm sure His Highness is just too busy.

267
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,599
His Highness is just too busy.

268
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,640
He will come to visit us

269
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
once he's done with the official affairs.

270
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Do not spout nonsense.

271
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,359
Your Highness,

272
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,719
His Highness is tolerant and considerate to you.

273
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,359
It is hard to find a person
who treats you this nicely.

274
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,800
You shouldn't...

275
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Your Highness,

276
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,599
the dishes are getting cold.

277
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
(Are you the one who's willing to
stay beside me forever?)

278
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,280
(I...)

279
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,359
Your Highness.

280
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,239
I'll see you off, Your Highness.

281
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,160
Such audacity!

[Shuowen Jiezi Volume One]

283
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,640
Who gave you permission to stay here?

284
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,719
Who gave you permission to read my books?

285
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,199
Remove the book from your face.

286
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,400
Your Highness,

287
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,719
I was foolish.

288
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,359
Please pardon me.

289
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,239
Eunuch Yuan told me to leave by 7 PM.

290
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,319
I didn't expect Your Highness to return early.

291
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,599
Your Highness, I was foolish.

292
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,680
Please punish me.

293
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:51,920
If so,

294
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,640
how should I punish you?

295
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,160
Since you can read,

296
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,280
you can stay here

297
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
and arrange my books for me.

298
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,199
Your Highness.

299
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,280
Your Highness,

300
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm a maidservant from the Imperial Food Service.

301
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,839
This is a breach of etiquette.

302
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,359
The filling tastes different.

303
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,560
You didn't make them yourself?

304
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
Your Highness,

305
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,839
Qianqing Palace requested wontons for dinner.

306
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,760
The Imperial Food Service has
prepared two sets of wontons.

307
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,680
Both sets were made by Manager Fang.

308
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,400
So Your Highness,

309
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,079
what's wrong with the wontons?

310
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,000
In the past, the filling was made with pork haunch,

311
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,239
mutton leg,

312
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,719
and water chestnuts.

313
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
By doing so, the filling will become springy.

314
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
Why didn't you remind her?

315
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Your Highness, how did you know that?

316
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,800
Do you know how terrible the daily meals are?

317
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,079
I've been enduring them for years

318
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,920
without telling anyone.

319
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,719
It's because gentlemen shouldn't
seek satisfaction through good food.

320
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,719
You knew about that, yet you didn't remind her.

321
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:07,920
Why?

322
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,119
Your Highness,

323
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:13,680
it's because the meat today
is exceptionally fresh.

324
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,800
You're lying.

325
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
It's because you're a new cook.

326
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,439
You don't dare to challenge
a manager's authority in the kitchen.

327
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,400
But as a cook,

328
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,119
you should prioritize
the satisfaction of the people

329
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,880
who consume your meals.

330
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,400
How could you just brush it off like this?

If you dare to treat it lightly,

335

you will be punished severely.

Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,520
is your strength.

371
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,839
Su Yuehua was born from a line of famous cooks.

372
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,760
She's good at handling all kinds of ingredients.

373
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,239
And she's an expert at all kinds of dishes.

374
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,199
Her strength is her extensive knowledge.

375
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,439
That is why

376
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,760
Directress Wang ordered her
to restore the lost recipes book

377
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
and invent new recipes from the book.

378
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,400
Only Yuehua is capable of that.

379
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,560
So you were actually observing everything?

380
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,040
But those who are involved
cannot see the bigger picture.

381
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,079
Directress Hu wants me to be different.

382
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,160
But what's the one thing
that's different about me?

383
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:38,760
You're right.

384
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,359
Back then, you used herbs to stew the meat.

385
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,920
Even His Majesty was praising you.

386
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,199
It's all Directress Wang's fault.

387
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,079
She gave you an earful for no reason

388
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,599
and landed you in this plight.

389
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,640
And now, she wants you to be different?

390
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,079
I used herbs to stew the meat?

391
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
I understand now.

Yuehua.

394
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,920
Master.

395
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,719
What are you making?

396
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm making Golden and Silver Tofu Soup.

397
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,839
According to the past records,

398
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,439
the fried tofu must be golden in color

399
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,000
while the fresh tofu must be
so fresh that it's silver in color.

400
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,719
That's how the dish got its name.

401
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,119
This time,

402
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,239
I wish to make it with egg white and egg yolk.

403
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,359
Have you learned anything new
from the records lately?

404
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,000
In the past, I thought Snow Crab Bucket drew its
inspiration from Stir-Fry Egg White with Crab.

405
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,560
But Song Dynasty was the first
to use giant mud crabs in their cooking.

406
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,920
And Honey Giant Mud Crab
was invented in the Yuan Dynasty.

407
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,719
Maybe that's the true origin
of the Snow Crab Bucket.

408
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,800
Chinese cuisine has a long history.

409
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,319

Did you use aged gelatin to make it?

454
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,399
Fresh gelatin is heaty for the body.

455
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,199
We can only serve our master aged gelatin

456
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320

that can ward off the cold.

467
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,080
Using fermented glutinous rice wine can stimulate
the spleen and improve blood circulation.

468
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
It's very good for pregnant women.

469

But if you wish to cure her cold hands and feet,

470
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,199
it's better if you use Gaoliang wine.

Her body is weak and she's
experiencing spleen deficiency.

473

Moistening tonification is a better option.

Even aged gelatin won't be able
to cure her of her condition.

00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,719
They even colluded with
the Directorate for Palace Delicacies

547
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
and made a false report regarding
the monthly wages of the eunuchs.

548
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,320
They pitted one against ten...

549
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,280
That's enough.

550
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Jing Quan, Chief Minister of the Court of Imperial
Entertainments is colluding with Eunuch Wan

551
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,760
of the Directorate for Palace Delicacies
to embezzle the Imperial Treasury's money.

552
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,520
Eunuch Wan is the foster son

553
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,879
of Huang Yan, the Seal-holding Eunuch Director
of the Directorate of Ceremonial.

554
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
Even if you can topple both of them,

555
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,719
will you be able

556
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,520
to topple His Majesty's favorite eunuch?

557
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,120
And

558
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,159
the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs

559
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,560
is full of his disciples.

560
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,199
Will you be able to deal with all the eunuchs?

561
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,399
Let go!

562
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,840
Matron Meng.

563
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,399
So are these the ingredients you have chosen?

564
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,239
Matron Meng,

565
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,120
Pine mushroom is the king of all mushrooms.

566
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
It can only be harvested
after a few years of growth.

567
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,479
It has a fragrant taste.

568
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,959
I'm sure such an ingredient

569
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,439
is considered precious.

570
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,199
The land of China

571
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,080
has all kinds of top-quality ingredients.

572
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,760
Camel humps, bear claws,

573
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
pine mushrooms, bird's nest, abalones,
sea cucumbers, shark's fin, and so on,

574
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,760
they're not even worth mentioning.

575
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,120
As a cook in the Imperial Food Service,

576
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,879
you need to discover precious ingredients
that are different

577
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,399
to showcase your talent.

578
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,239
We do not need your services

579
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,120
if these common ingredients
are the ones we need to cook.

580
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,199
What exactly does she mean?

581
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,800
I don't understand her.

582
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,800
Zijin,

583
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,080
this...

584
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,360
It looks hideous.

585
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:35,800
It has bumps all over it.

586
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
What is this?

587
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Spinning yarn is a tough process.

588
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:52,239
Mother, you don't need to do this personally.

589
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,479
I'm used to it.

590
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,719
I don't think it's tough.

591
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,639
Pass it to me.

592
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,199
Mother, it seems like you're sick.

593
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,560
I should've stayed by your side
and served you as you took your medicine.

594
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,360
But I had no idea at all.

595
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:28,639
I was negligent.

596
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,679
Mother, please forgive me.

597
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,679
Jinshu.

598
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,080
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,959
Send someone to invite
the Great Imperial Grandson.

600
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:09,719
No.

601
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:10,760
Go and invite His Highness himself.

602
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Your Highness, have you finally made up your mind?

603
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The Crown Princess wants you
to nourish your body with herbal medicine

604
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,639
because Her Highness expects you
to give birth to a royal offspring.

605
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,280
Later, when His Highness is here,

606
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:20,919
you must stop being cold to His Highness.

607
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,479
Go now.
