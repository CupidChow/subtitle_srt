[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:49,919
The reason wise emperors were cautious
about marriage is that they attach importance

4
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,959
to the continuation of the family line.

5
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,919
Because the prosperity and decline of a family

6
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,000
and the rise and fall of a country

7
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,360
are closely related.

8
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,639
Alas, inside the Inner Court,

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,680
the teaching on self-cultivation

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
must...

11
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,320
must be...

12
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,679
Must be prudent.

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't move.

14
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,119
This is too small.

15
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,559
Speak in pleasant tones with words of reason.

16
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,800
Speak in pleasant tones with words of reason.

17
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,119
Slanderous talks and argumentative words

18
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,600
are like rapid fires
that can burn down the fields.

19
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,839
You come out every night to catch it.

20
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:54,919
Think about it.

21
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,320
The palace sends special envoys every year
to collect it everywhere.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Only one out of a thousand is given
to the Great Imperial Grandson.

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,039
Since he didn't blame you,

24
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,759
don't bother it.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Green crickets are the best.

26
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,759
This is purplish.

27
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,199
And it's small.

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
You can't fool them.

29
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,639
You really take it.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,559
Let's go back.

31
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,759
Let's go.

32
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,910
[Zhi Hu]
[Judge in the Northern Prison]

33
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,520
Sir.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Zhang He confessed new things.

35
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,559
Although it has nothing to do
with the Crown Prince,

36
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,080
it caused an issue.

37
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,800
He worked in the Ministry of Rites
before he was in the Ministry of Revenue.

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,919
At that time, the female officials were appointed
according to the Emperor's order.

39
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,360
When the imperial eunuch selected the candidate,

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,039
he took bribes and allowed someone
to impersonate others.

41
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,160
By now,

42
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,600
she should be in the palace.

43
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,679
Look into it.

44
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,399
Yes, sir.

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
It's so small.

46
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,559
And it's a purple cricket.

47
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,239
It's too ridiculous to replace

48
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
the original insect king with it.

49
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,079
Test it.

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,399
Okay.

51
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,320
[Xingyun Cottage]

52
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,440
You're going to lose.

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Wait a moment, Your Highness.

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,880
You can't win even if I give you three more days.

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,399
Congratulations, Your Highness!

56
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,239
Your Highness.

57
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,839
What's the matter?

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,880
This little thing

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,959
won six rounds in a row.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,239
It won by just one bite.

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,399
Don't look at how plain it is.

62
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,640
It defeated His Highness's
General of Agile Cavalry

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,880
with only one bite.

64
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,839
Someone who can recognize talent is rare.

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,079
Even if the real insect king is right here,

66
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,480
who can recognize it?

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,959
This game has reached a dead end.

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,600
I admit defeat.

69
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,370
[Guang'an Gate]

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,679
Hurry up.

71
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,040
Walk faster.

72
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,119
Everyone, keep up.

73
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,519
What happened?

74
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,720
Miss Yin.

75
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,679
The imperial bodyguards found out someone
had entered the palace under a false name.

76
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,959
Didn't they go to arrest the person yesterday?

77
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,440
Why do they still investigate it?

78
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,799
Such a thing

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,839
would happen more than once.

80
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,799
Many people who were chosen to enter the palace

81
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,320
didn't want their daughters

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,480
to be maidservants.

83
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,079
They spent much for someone to replace.

84
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,320
Not only does it involve the imperial eunuchs
and the Ministry of Rites,

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,640
but the Palace Surveillance

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
is also investigating it
with the imperial bodyguards.

87
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,839
Is there such a thing?

88
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes.

89
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,519
Miss Yin.

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,119
Miss Yin.

91
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:26,959
Let's go.

92
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,040
Don't you think she's acting weird?

93
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,279
Why do you say so?

94
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,440
She's so beautiful

95
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,279
and good at female virtues and cooking.

96
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,760
Another day,

97
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,839
I saw her register books for Manager Fang.

98
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Her handwriting is good.

99
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,239
She seems good at everything.

100
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,760
The imperial family selects concubines
from commoners.

101
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,559
Many people nurture their daughters carefully.

102
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,000
Only those with virtues, speech,
appearance, and skills

103
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,600
can be candidates.

104
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,959
She's gentle and well-spoken.

105
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,839
She must be from a decent family.

106
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,000
Let alone cooking and needlework.

107
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,200
Even if she's good in the four arts

108
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,200
and music,

109
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,519
it's normal.

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,399
But she knows

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,239
how to distinguish crickets.

112
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,920
Don't you think it's strange?

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,239
It's none of your business.

114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
I'll wait and see

115
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,679
tomorrow's exam.

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
Matron Meng.

117
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,640
The Crown Princess has ordered

118
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,760
that the weather is too dry as it's autumn.

119
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,559
The Great Imperial Grandson caught a cold
and often has a sore throat.

120
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,119
Prepare some light food.

121
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:12,959
Yes.

122
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,720
(Miss Yin.)

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,480
(The imperial bodyguards found out someone
had entered the palace under a false name.)

124
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Manager Fang.

125
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,200
Can I prepare the meal

126
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
for the Great Imperial Grandson today?

127
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,960
Eunuch Yuan.

128
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,119
What brings you here?

129
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,679
His Highness invited Official Yang
to enjoy the chrysanthemum today

130
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,760
and wants to have a hot pot at noon.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,719
Prepare it well.

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
But the Crown Princess ordered us

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
to prepare lighter food
for the Great Imperial Grandson recently.

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,880
Cut it.

135
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,000
I just delivered what His Highness said.

136
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
Every single word.

137
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Bear it if something happens.

138
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,039
And

139
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,880
let her deliver the meal from now on.

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
Eunuch Yuan.

141
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,440
Zijin.

142
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,039
What should we do?

143
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,960
Your Highness, half of a stick
of incense has burned.

144
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,080
Your Highness.

145
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,000
Half of a stick of incense has burned.

146
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:51,840
Hold on a little longer.

147
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,880
-This incense.
-Your Highness.

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
Your Highness.

149
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,599
Your Highness.

150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,200
Your Highness.

151
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,159
Your Highness.

152
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,479
I

153
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,320
can't

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,280
move anymore.

155
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,559
Your Highness.

156
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,799
Oh, Your Highness.

157
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,559
Well.

158
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,559
What should we do?

159
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,919
I can't get up now

160
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,039
even if you place a knife

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,799
on my neck.

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,919
Hurry up.

163
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,080
I used to wonder

164
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,280
why Your Highness lives in the thatched cottage
instead of the palace.

165
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,559
Now only I understand as I look

166
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,080
at the beautiful scenery.

167
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
Master Yang, you once said

168
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,200
cultivating an upright spirit

169
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,359
can make one achieve great things.

170
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
And nothing is more important

171
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,599
than one's father.

172
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,559
Without a healthy mind and body,

173
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,359
how can I devote myself
to my father and the country?

174
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,559
Here comes Father.

175
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:36,559
Father.

176
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,039
I...

177
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,440
I want to have a meal with you.

178
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,359
Your Highness.

179
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
The Crown Princess is waiting
to accompany you to the meal.

180
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,679
Should we go back?

181
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,559
The people are the foundation of peace
in the country.

182
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,880
We must send someone
to supervise the implementation

183
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,760
of the relief grain previously
allocated to Yingzhou.

184
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,359
Before it, Guangzhou was flooded
with hurricane tides.

185
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,559
Houses and granaries were destroyed.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And...

187
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,159
Yingtian, Yangzhou, and Jinan.

188
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,760
The rain ruined the crops.

189
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:46,559
Have those sent by the Ministry of Revenue
to comfort people come back?

190
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,960
They arrived at the capital yesterday

191
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,520
and have presented themselves
before His Majesty.

192
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,320
All right, then.

193
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,119
Father just came back from the north.

194
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm already not in charge,

195
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,640
but there are severe floods

196
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,640
in the north-south Zhili province,
Shandong, and Henan.

197
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,919
The people are suffering.

198
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,159
Immediately send a notice

199
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,000
to the prefectures, states, and counties

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,559
to stop taxation.

201
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,080
His Majesty has ordered Your Highness

202
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
to master horsemanship and archery
within three months.

203
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,719
If Her Highness knows you're here for lunch,

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,760
I can't afford to take the blame.

205
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,719
Father knows it clearly.

206
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,080
You don't have to remind him.

207
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,679
Busybody.

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
It's okay to do it once in a while.

209
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,359
Mother won't blame you.

210
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,760
But

211
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,440
if Grandfather knows...

212
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,359
Fortunately, the news from the cottage

213
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,559
can't reach Qianqing Palace.

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,719
Why do you stare at me like that, Father?

215
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,239
It's not lamb hot pot.

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Your Highness.

217
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,640
Chrysanthemum can reduce heat
and enhance eye vision.

218
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,520
Suppress hyperactive liver
for calming endogenous wind.

219
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,320
It brings a different taste

220
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,640
to this warm pot.

221
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Your Highness.

222
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,679
The one who delivered the meal has left.

223
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,119
Now I feel alive.

224
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,000
Add some more.

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,520
It's said that the famous poet, Tao Yuanming,
regarded chrysanthemums as friends

226
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,840
cooked with chrysanthemum.

227
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,640
Taste it slowly.

228
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,719
The chrysanthemum pot has a delicate fragrance

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,919
and is unique.

230
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,359
The so-called elegance

231
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,880
is nothing more than that.

232
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:55,719
Your Highness.

233
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,880
Last night, Prince of Han spoke to His Majesty.

234
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,760
He said that not all the affected areas
were with crops ruined.

235
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Order of priority should be taken

236
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,479
so as not to provide help freely.

237
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,760
Nonsense.

238
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,359
For local disasters,

239
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,640
whether true or false,

240
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,359
disaster relief should be provided first
before investigating it.

241
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,880
It's the ancestral motto of the Ming Dynasty.

242
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,359
Saving the poor is like rescuing people
from the fire and drowning.

243
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,200
The affected people

244
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,000
suffer more than the country.

245
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,440
The Emperor is the lord of the world
and the father of the people.

246
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,159
He can't be more compassionate

247
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,840
and lenient towards the people.

248
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,479
How should we quibble with the people?

249
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,320
Provide help freely.

250
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,320
How could he say so?

251
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,880
It's so foolish.

252
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm going to see Father.

253
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,080
Your Highness, please don't.

254
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,039
Father.

255
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,719
If you go now,

256
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,479
how will you answer

257
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,719
if Grandfather asks

258
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,200
what and who you had lunch with?

259
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,599
Right.

260
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,359
Your Highness.

261
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,719
Prince of Han often utters slander.

262
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,920
If you go rashly,

263
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
it may provoke His Majesty.

264
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not good for the people.

265
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,599
Are you exaggerating?

266
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,719
I didn't mean to frighten Your Highness.

267
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,560
If you go,

268
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,040
it'll bring serious consequences.

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,560
Is it that serious as he said?

270
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,439
It's really as serious as he said.

271
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,599
But I can't ignore the people who are suffering.

272
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,239
How about this?

273
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,640
His Majesty doesn't like to see me

274
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
nor listen to me.

275
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,719
Then why don't we find

276
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,800
someone who can please His Majesty to advise?

277
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,359
How is it?

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,560
Your Highness.

279
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,599
The maidservant of the Imperial Food Service
who delivers meals every day

280
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,479
is from Southern Zhili, Suzhou Prefecture.

281
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,479
I don't want to know about it now.

282
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,050
[Virtuous women can control their temperament...]

283
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,719
What's the first sentence
of Chapter Becoming Good?

284
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,839
Why didn't I recall it?

285
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,479
You even memorized Chapter Becoming Good.

286
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,959
I only remember until Chapter Being Discreet.

287
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,199
It seems that I can't be a female scholar this time.

288
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,680
Zijin.

289
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,839
Thank you.

290
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,079
I'll pass this time.

291
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,839
I can't recite it even after many times.

292
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,359
It's so hard to remember.

293
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,920
I can't even recite it.

294
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,760
(This annoying man is here again.)

295
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,760
Chief Zhang.

296
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,599
The maidservants
of the Imperial Food Service this year

297
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,520
are all here.

298
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,479
Thank you.

299
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,239
Besides checking the list,

300
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,319
Officer You has a few things to ask.

301
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,319
It won't bring trouble, right?

302
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,319
The imperial bodyguards can even
arrest and interrogate

303
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,119
the meritorious officials and royal relatives.

304
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,560
Let alone the Imperial Food Service.

305
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,880
If you want to ask or interrogate,

306
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,959
please help yourself.

307
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,319
However,

308
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,119
they need to prepare dinner

309
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,079
for the concubines.

310
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,479
It's not easy

311
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,560
for us to explain if it's delayed.

312
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,079
Sure.

313
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,239
Pardon me.

314
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,400
What's your name? Where's your origin?

315
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm Zhao Jiamin.

316
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,520
17 years old.

317
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,599
I'm originally from Yiyang County,
Guangxin Prefecture, Jiangxi Province.

318
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,000
The three generations of my family
run restaurants.

319
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm Wang Shuhua.

320
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,680
16 years old.

321
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm originally from Xiushui County,
Zhejiang Province.

322
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,920
My grandmother was the maidservant
of the Imperial Food Service.

323
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,119
I learned cooking from her since I was young.

324
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,439
I'm best at making cakes and pastries.

325
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,400
I don't know about anything.

326
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,680
I entered the palace according to the rules.

327
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,239
Sir.

328
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,640
Whether it's true or not,

329
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,040
someone will check

330
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,560
your registered residence.

331
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,280
Next one.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm Su Yuehua.

333
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,640
18 years old.

334
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm from Renhe County, Hangzhou Prefecture,
Zhejiang Province.

335
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,800
Miss Su seems to be not only good
at Hangzhou cuisine.

336
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,199
Sir.

337
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,680
When Su Dongpo was the governor of Hangzhou,

338
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,439
there was once torrential rain for days.

339
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,839
West Lake flooded.

340
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,280
He led the people to build dams and bridges

341
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,880
and survived through the flood.

342
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,439
My ancestors gave braised pork belly

343
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,400
and bean soup to thank him
on behalf of the Hangzhou people.

344
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,560
The ground rice grain is as bright as jade.

345
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,319
Boiled beans in casseroles
are as soft as flaky pastry.

346
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
It refers to this bowl of bean soup.

347
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,319
Later, our Su family went all over the country.

348
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,880
There were famous chefs
from generation to generation.

349
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,280
I stayed with my father all year round.

350
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,479
I cooked dishes in many notables' residences.

351
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,079
If you think I'm an impostor,

352
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,319
you can ask someone to interrogate me.

353
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,439
Your turn.

354
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,680
Yin Ziping.

355
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,479
17 years old.

356
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm from Southern Zhili, Suzhou Prefecture.

357
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,160
My grandfather used to serve
in the Court of Imperial Entertainments.

358
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,439
After he passed away, our family was in decline.

359
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,040
How about you?

360
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,760
Officer You.

361
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,199
Zijin is the same age and origin as me.

362
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,400
She can make

363
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,760
all the delicacies in the world.

364
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
It's no worse than her Su family.

365
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
What can you find out like this?

366
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,959
Please check quickly.

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,319
We're going to prepare dinner later.

368
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:08,880
Officer You.

369
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,920
It's almost in line
with the name list and portraits.

370
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,760
We still have to go to
the Palace Workshop Service today.

371
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,800
Let's go.

372
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
How strange.

373
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,199
What do you suspect, sir?

374
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,839
The Court of Imperial Entertainments cook
specializes in cooking one dish all year round.

375
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,959
-You can look down on others if you're excellent at it.
-Zijin.

376
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,400
Let's go.

377
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,280
In recent years, the Imperial Food Service

378
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,959
has been known for being good at
various major cuisines

379
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,040
to suppress the Court
of Imperial Entertainments.

380
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,920
But the famous dishes they're good at

381
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,959
are still their ancestral dishes.

382
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,680
The list of Miss Yao clearly states

383
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,640
that her grandfather

384
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,160
was the retired Proctor of the Disciplinary Office
of the Directorate of Education.

385
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,839
Her father was an incompetent proofreader.

386
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
She learned cooking from her mother since young.

387
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,119
She only stayed at home

388
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,319
and she's not a cook.

389
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,839
How can she cook all the delicacies

390
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,160
like the profound Su family?

391
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,439
Well...

392
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,199
Can you have braised pork belly

393
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,599
at the Sichuan restaurant in the capital?

394
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,839
Hurry to Suzhou Prefecture immediately.

395
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,319
Investigate and report

396
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,359
who recommended, taught,

397
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,239
and sent her to the palace.

398
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:28,400
Yes.

399
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,880
Your Highness.

400
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,599
His Highness heard that you're sick

401
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,680
and came to visit you specially.

402
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Who allowed you to tell him?

403
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,079
Your Highness, pardon me. I was...

404
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,439
Get up, please.

405
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,479
You're still sick.

406
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,800
Sit down.

407
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,040
Just sit down.

408
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Go and bring the tea.

409
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,359
Yes.

410
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:34,800
Summon the Imperial Physician.

411
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,400
Let the Imperial Physician treat it.

412
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,280
Yes.

413
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,199
No, Your Highness.

414
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,359
There are strict orders
in the ancestral family rules.

415
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,760
If the consort is sick,

416
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,800
the Imperial Physician can't be summoned easily.

417
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,959
Besides, I just don't eat well.

418
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,479
Later, I'll let Jinshu get medicine
from the Medicines Office.

419
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,160
Or ask the Directress of the Palace
Medicines Office to come over...

420
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,719
Go ask the directress come.

421
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,400
Yes.

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,880
Your Highness, don't you remember?

423
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,520
My grandfather is a famous physician in Jining.

424
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,040
I was weak when I was young.

425
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,160
He treated me all along.

426
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,000
I also learned some from him.

427
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Strictly speaking,

428
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,239
those directresses of the Medicines Office
aren't as good as me.

429
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,439
Just trust me.

430
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,880
Okay.

431
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,800
It's up to you.

432
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
But if the condition worsens,

433
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,719
don't force yourself.

434
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,040
Consult the Imperial Physician immediately.

435
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,640
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

436
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,359
It was picked too early.

437
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,800
It's sour.

438
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,199
Your Highness.

439
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,719
I've eaten it.

440
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,719
If Your Highness wants to have it,

441
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,599
just take the case with you.

442
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,880
Yu'an.

443
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,040
When you first entered the palace,

444
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,119
I named you Yu'an.

445
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,880
Do you know what's the meaning?

446
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,800
Grandfather went to the battlefield.

447
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,479
Grandmother stayed at Beiping.

448
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,119
The enemy approached the walls.

449
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,359
Grandmother mounted the defensive wall
to oversee the battle.

450
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,160
She guarded the city for Grandfather.

451
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,040
Grandfather

452
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,640
tried his best in that war.

453
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,280
The army suffered heavy casualties.

454
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,800
Later, he said

455
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,040
that when he almost collapsed,

456
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,280
he thought of Grandmother's words.

457
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,560
You must return no matter what.

458
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,400
Later, Grandfather became the Emperor.

459
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
He owned beauties all over the world.

460
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,119
But when he was furious,

461
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,119
no consorts dared to persuade him.

462
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,479
Grandmother was the only one
who dared to persuade him.

463
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,160
The so-called married couple

464
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
is to live together for a lifetime,

465
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,599
regardless of life or death,

466
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,400
honor or disgrace.

467
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,239
Yu'an.

468
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,599
I'll give you peace for the rest of your life.

469
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,400
I don't know why you're not opening your heart.

470
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,160
But I want to ask

471
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,760
if you're the one who's willing
to accompany me all my life?

472
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,640
Your Highness.

473
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,640
I...

474
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Take care of yourself.

475
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:09,199
I'll get going.

476
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,520
Your Highness.

477
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,599
I bid Your Highness farewell.

478
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,280
Your Highness.

479
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,839
You've been coughing all day.

480
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,400
This is cough medicine

481
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,079
specially prepared for you
by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

482
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,160
The Imperial Physician told me

483
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,400
it's better

484
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,839
to take this medicine while it's hot.

485
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,400
And this health porridge.

486
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,479
Glutinous rice invigorates the spleen
and replenishes qi.

487
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,400
Scallion white dispels wind and disperses cold.

488
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,760
And vinegar can remove toxins.

489
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,040
The Imperial Physician said
it's most suitable for you to consume.

490
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,160
Your Highness.

491
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,400
Do you want to suppress
the taste of scallion white?

492
00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:01,230
[Xingyun Cottage]

493
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,079
It's sunny again.

494
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,079
Let's go.

495
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,359
Let's see if Grandfather is back.

496
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:06,959
Yes, Your Highness.

497
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,439
Your Majesty.

498
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,520
The Great Imperial Grandson is here.

499
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,760
Grandfather.

500
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,760
What are you laughing at?

501
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,079
I'm busy.

502
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,640
I haven't had lunch.

503
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,119
Yet, you and your father

504
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,119
had a chrysanthemum hot pot
and enjoyed the flowers.

505
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,640
How relaxing.

506
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,280
This...

507
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,959
As the Emperor of the country,

508
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,719
I'm wealthy.

509
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,040
I can change ten outfits every day.

510
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,439
But whenever I think

511
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,199
of Empress Xiaocigao being thrifty all her life,

512
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:21,880
I

513
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,800
don't want worldly possessions anymore.

514
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,280
Old clothes

515
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,560
are comfortable to wear.

516
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,680
I'll wear it

517
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,880
for the ministers to see later.

518
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,839
I want to let them know

519
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,439
how thrifty the Emperor of the country is.

520
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,359
A minister

521
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,000
should learn to appreciate what they have more.

522
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,439
I've been looking for these clothes
for a long time.

523
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,400
How is it?

524
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:57,839
Grandfather.

525
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,599
It looks good, right?

526
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,319
Let me tear here.

527
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,000
Then you ask someone to sew patches.

528
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,400
Wouldn't it look more worn?

529
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,079
Nonsense.

530
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,599
You always spoil my plan.

531
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,640
Every single word you say later

532
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,400
will be recorded on a daily note

533
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,800
and passed on to future generations.

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Let the people know

535
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,199
that my grandfather

536
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,359
is a diligent and modest emperor.

537
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,920
I don't care about having

538
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,479
such fame and glory.

539
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,680
It's to educate all officials.

540
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,319
It's not fame and glory.

541
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,160
But it's not enough for them to see.

542
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,000
You should make them remember it.

543
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,479
You used to say

544
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,920
that the people are the foundation
of the country.

545
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Therefore, the Emperor
is also common to the people.

546
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,680
Always be pure-hearted.

547
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,839
Think about hunger before you eat.

548
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,959
Think about the cold before you wear clothes.

549
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
For instance?

550
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,000
For instance, there were floods
in the north-south Zhili province,

551
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,359
Shandong and Henan.

552
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,719
The Imperial Court should provide a lot of funds.

553
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,239
Don't be stingy and make a fuss about it.

554
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,119
It can show that my grandfather

555
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,119
loves and protects the people.

556
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,520
I know

557
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,680
you speak on behalf of your father.

558
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,239
What's wrong?

559
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,560
What's wrong with you?

560
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm okay.

561
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Come on.

562
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,760
Huang Yan.

563
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,719
Summon the Imperial Physician.

564
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,560
Summon the Imperial Physician.

565
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,079
Summon the Imperial Physician.

566
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,640
How do you feel?

567
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,160
If you disagree,

568
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll kneel until you do.

569
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,359
I'll be here all the time.

570
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,119
I

571
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,920
took back his right to govern the country.

572
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,880
I helped him

573
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,719
deal with his mistakes.

574
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,280
But it's such a big matter.

575
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,839
How could he make fun of the people?

576
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,079
Get up.

577
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,640
Then... I'll take my leave.

578
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:08,719
Grandfather.

579
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:09,600
Please have it.

580
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,679
Why are you laughing?

581
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,919
Thank you, Your Majesty.

582
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,770
[Qianqing Palace]

583
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,600
Your Highness.

584
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,879
Ask Physician Sheng to come.

585
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,439
Keep this secret.

586
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,239
Yes.

587
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
It's poisoning indeed.

588
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,120
Please take this medicine, Your Highness.

589
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Your Highness.

590
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,671
I'm not sure

591
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,560
[Sheng Yin, Imperial Physician]
what poison it is now.

592
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:11,959
But

593
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,719
the poisoner

594
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,120
is afraid that others will find out.

595
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,560
The dosage is very low.

596
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
Fortunately, Your Highness is blessed.

597
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,439
Toxicity occurs early.

598
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,320
If it's not found out,

599
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,679
there'll be no cure

600
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,679
if the dosage accumulates over time.

601
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,320
Your Highness has taken the medicine.

602
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,360
You'll be fine.

603
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,239
May I ask about something?

604
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,959
What's Your Highness's daily meal?

605
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,239
Chrysanthemum pot

606
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,560
and health porridge.

607
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,000
Your Highness.

608
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,679
I'm going to the Imperial Food Service

609
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
to arrest the poisoner.

610
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,040
Stop there.

611
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,479
Your Highness.

612
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,399
It must be the maidservant
of the Imperial Food Service.

613
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,399
I'll get her back

614
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,760
to let the imperial bodyguards interrogate.

615
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,840
She'll confess.

616
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,919
Shut up.

617
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:55,639
Physician Sheng.

618
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,800
If Grandfather asks about it,

619
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,879
just say I had a skin injury
when I fell off the horse that day.

620
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,919
I came to you to get the medicine.

621
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,399
Don't worry, Your Highness.

622
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:04,639
I understand.

623
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,199
Your Highness.

624
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,080
The maidservant has bad intentions.

625
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,919
You can't let her be.

626
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,399
Ask Chen Wu to come over.

627
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:14,719
Yes.

628
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,639
Greedy kid.

629
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:23,560
Are the imperial bodyguards
still investigating?

630
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,199
The whole palace has been checked.

631
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,719
There's an impostor who has entered the palace.

632
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
His Majesty was furious

633
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,120
and ordered to get to the bottom of it.

634
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,000
It won't be tolerated.

635
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,399
Does it taste good?

636
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,639
It tastes so good.

637
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,560
Sir.

638
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,080
That family was a beggar.

639
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,280
The women in their family

640
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,040
applied makeup every day.

641
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,719
They didn't seem decent.

642
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,000
Her husband

643
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,040
got the news from nowhere.

644
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,199
It's said that Official Tianshi

645
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,840
wanted to come to Suzhou to collect crickets.

646
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:56,879
He had an idea

647
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,080
and collected a cricket at a high price

648
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,919
in the countryside.

649
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
He wanted to please the officials
and get rid of his lowly identity.

650
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,159
Well.

651
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,439
He really found it.

652
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,280
Their cricket is brave and good at fighting.

653
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,879
It defeated other crickets.

654
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,959
Don't talk nonsense.

655
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,919
I'm telling the truth.

656
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,879
Go on.

657
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,919
Their youngest son is very naughty.

658
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:20,600
He accidentally let the cricket go.

659
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,639
The news has been spread.

660
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,639
How would the officials

661
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,199
forgive them?

662
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,560
I went to check things out the next morning.

663
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,679
That was a tragedy.

664
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,479
The woman hung herself
and the man drowned himself in a well.

665
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,879
Even their youngest son
followed in their footsteps.

666
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,679
Did they have a daughter?

667
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:36,679
Yes.

668
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,040
The girl seemed seven or eight years old.

669
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,280
I didn't know

670
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,919
how she got away.

671
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:42,879
When the bodies were collected,

672
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,760
she kneeled and cried over her parents' death.

673
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
No one could drag her up.

674
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,239
Then she was taken away by someone.

675
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,320
Go on.

676
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,639
Who did she go with?

677
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,520
Who else?

678
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,800
Where else could the beggar go?

679
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:59,080
Many of them were taken away by the fishermen.

680
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,239
Then become a prostitute on the ship
when they grow up.

681
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,239
However,

682
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,120
that girl was lucky.

683
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,360
A family in Yangzhou brought her with them.

684
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,439
They bought her with a dozen guan.

685
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,159
Then she was taken away.

686
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,280
She could be sold

687
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
at a high price later.

688
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,439
All selected eunuchs, officials,

689
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,879
and relatives of all the maidservants

690
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,360
all insisted there was no imposter.

691
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,360
How did you confirm that?

692
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,600
The imperial bodyguards
are investigating everywhere.

693
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:31,040
It's said that someone in Suzhou Prefecture
entered the palace under a false name.

694
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,199
I looked closely at the eyebrows
and eyes of her portrait.

695
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,320
She looks like her.

696
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,679
Sir.

697
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,719
Is there really a reward?

698
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,879
Two people entered the palace
from Suzhou Prefecture.

699
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,800
You said both portraits look like her.

700
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,320
Which one is it exactly?

701
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,439
The 17-year-old or 18-girl-old girls

702
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,679
all look pretty.

703
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,239
If I see her in person,

704
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,679
I'll surely recognize her.

705
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,000
Sir.

706
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,479
I took out the exam papers of Yao Zijin.

707
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,520
I also interrogated the maidservant
who was responsible for education.

708
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,639
She's good at four arts

709
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,439
and musical instruments.

710
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,199
She has been carefully trained
since she was young.

711
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,000
That's right.

712
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:03,520
Sir.

713
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,159
There may be oversights
to recognize the person from the portrait.

714
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,280
But another witness came along.

715
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,280
Bring the person here.

716
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,159
Yes.

717
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,600
Are you still having a headache?

718
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,919
Hurry up.

719
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,719
Rest for a while.

720
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,679
Turn around.

721
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:29,919
I'll rub it for you.

722
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,600
Do you feel better?

723
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,840
All right.

724
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,679
I'll get you some water.

725
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,959
Well, you.

726
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,959
You're not feeling well.

727
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,760
But you still pushed yourself.

728
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,239
Does the position of manager

729
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,399
mean that much to you?

730
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,439
Yes.

731
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,199
It means a lot.

732
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:16,399
Ziping.

733
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
I treated you so well.

734
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,239
But you wanted to kill me

735
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:34,919
for the position of manager?

736
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,840
Why did you treat me so well?

737
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,560
Just blame yourself.

738
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
You shouldn't be so kind

739
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,399
and foolish!

740
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:54,679
There should be

741
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,000
a bottom line for kindness.

742
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,040
And it shouldn't bring disaster.

743
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,000
You

744
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,399
should never

745
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,719
treat a person who's sincere to you

746
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,439
like a fool.

747
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,560
You.

748
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,560
You...

749
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:24,600
Please.

750
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,280
Please don't.

751
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,360
Please don't.

752
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,120
No.

753
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,239
Don't do so.

754
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:15,320
Someone wants to meet you.

755
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:38,479
Look carefully.

756
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:39,560
Is it her?

757
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:49,639
She looks similar.

758
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,879
I haven't seen her for ages.

759
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:54,800
She looks pretty alike.

760
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,760
You can recognize her

761
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,560
even you haven't seen her for long.

762
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:02,360
It seems that the temptation
of the reward is great.

763
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,600
Officer You, what do you think?

764
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,120
Sir, she's here.

765
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,879
Bring her here.

766
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Ms. Yan, look carefully.

767
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,679
Is she the girl who ran away

768
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,199
from your house?

769
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,360
Sir.

770
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,639
Her eyebrows and eyes do suggest so.

771
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:46,879
Look more carefully.

772
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,439
Sir.

773
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,320
The girl came to my house at the age of eight.

774
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,479
I taught her to play instruments and sing.

775
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,280
But she was born slow-witted

776
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,439
and odd.

777
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:06,919
She didn't manage to learn it.

778
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,360
I paid to buy someone again.

779
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:11,360
I only taught her to do some chores.

780
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,439
Due to my oversight, she ran away.

781
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,000
I couldn't find her anywhere.

782
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,639
It's not hard to know whether it's her.

783
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm sorry.

784
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,959
Pardon me.
