[Episode 21]

3
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,919
Your Highness.

4
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,679
Would this make me less angry?

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,679
Nosy.

6
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Highness, this Guilinggao
might smell fishy.

7
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,479
Do you want to have something else?

8
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm angry now.

9
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,479
Don't you know my body is full of internal heat?

10
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,000
Take it away.

11
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
Yes, Your Highness.

12
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
Add some honey and osmanthus.

13
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,839
Go now.

14
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,080
I'll get going now.

15
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,119
What's wrong? Are you not well?

16
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
It's just some tonic for women's health.

17
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,839
Take it away.

18
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,440
That's odd.

19
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,679
Why are you and Miaoxian taking
medicinal decoction at the same time?

20
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
You didn't even summon any female physicians.

21
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,639
Why?

22
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Did you prescribe it yourself?

23
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,959
I've never seen these palace maids before.

24
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,720
Huaping is too young.

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,399
Mother fears she can't manage her duties.

26
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,359
So she especially chose and sent

27
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,880
four clever palace maids to me.

[Kunning Palace]

29
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Your Majesty,

30
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,079
the Eastern Palace sent
them all back early this morning.

31
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,119
Was this the Crown Princess' wishes?

32
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Mother, it was mine.

33
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,399
You can leave now.

34
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,720
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
It's all right if you don't like them.

36
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,440
I'll send another four to your palace tomorrow.

37
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,640
Mother.

38
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm not blaming you.

39
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,519
If you were common folk,

40
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
I'd never meddle in your affairs.

41
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
But are you?

42
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,040
You're the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace.

43
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,279
The prince of this country.

44
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,359
Who'll bear

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,839
the responsibility of this nation
if you have no children?

46
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Mother, I'm still young.

47
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,799
I'll have children sooner or later.

48
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
There's no need for you to be anxious.

49
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,799
I can't bear

50
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,040
to make things difficult for my daughters-in-law.

51
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,079
But everyone is waiting, watching,

52
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,679
and expecting the future line of the Great Ming.

53
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,119
How about this?

54
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
If you don't like

55
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,079
the concubines at the Eastern Palace,

56
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,760
you can select new ones

57
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,279
until you're satisfied.

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,839
Mother, there's nothing wrong with them.

59
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
I feel contented.

60
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,720
I know there's nothing wrong with them.

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,040
But you like none of them.

62
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Mother, if you send them again,

63
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll send them back to you.

64
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,399
So don't worry about this.

65
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll take my leave.

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,799
Zhanji,

67
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,279
you can't run from this responsibility!

68
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,119
Come back here!

69
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,160
Your Majesty.

70
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,279
Why can't

71
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,559
he understand?

72
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
They'll be condemned as sinners

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
if I don't make it hard on them now.

74
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,399
As long as they have children,

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,040
they won't be criticized by others

76
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,239
and have a way to survive.

77
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
His Highness doesn't understand

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
Your Majesty's kind intention.

79
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
What should we do now?

80
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,239
Since he doesn't like the ones I chose,

81
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
I'll pick someone he likes, then.

82
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,000
What are you making?

83
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,679
Matron Meng.

84
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,920
The Prince of Wei coughs
in the middle of the night.

85
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,760
I've read from the Materia Medica
for Dietotherapy.

86
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,399
Make 50 holes in a cold pear

87
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,679
and fill the holes with pepper.

88
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,600
Simmer it with the residual heat of the charcoal.

89
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,959
It can be eaten after removing
the pepper when it has cooled down.

90
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,239
This can alleviate cough.

91
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,959
So I want to give it a try.

92
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,679
Do you still remember what I said

93
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,440
about food preparation?

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
Food preparation is

95
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,959
to give full consideration to the diners' needs,

96
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,440
keep the original flavor
and essence of the ingredients,

97
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,079
and make delicious delicacies from them.

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Since you chose to specialize
in medicinal cuisine,

99
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,839
other than considering
the physical constitutions of the diners,

100
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
the choice of ingredients is important.

101
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,519
So tell me,

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
how did you pick this medicinal pear?

103
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
In "Pharmacopoeia",

104
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
only snow pear from Xuancheng

105
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
and Chinese white pear
from Jingzhou and the north are suitable

106
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
to be used as medicinal ingredients.

107
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,960
But after a few experiments,

108
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,359
I noticed this year's fragrant pears
which were sent as tribute,

109
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,520
also have effective results.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,039
So I used it for medicinal food this time.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
It's good to know how to distinguish
the Pharmacopoeia records.

112
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,840
However,

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
the one eating it is a child.

114
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,599
The flavor of pepper is too strong.

115
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,919
He won't like it.

116
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Why don't you switch it to butter and honey?

117
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Also,

118
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,119
the pear peel can clear internal heat
and quench thirst.

119
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,239
It's a medicinal ingredient in itself.

120
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Won't the property of medicine be reduced
if you remove the peel?

121
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,039
Previously, you said you were not familiar
with medicinal cuisine.

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
I thought it was true.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
As a cook,

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,239
we must always know the characteristics

125
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
of the ingredients in the world.

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
I understand.

127
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,599
Thank you for your guidance, Matron Meng.

128
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Zijin! Zijin.

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,159
Matron Meng.

131
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,719
the Imperial Food Service
to send a midnight snack.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Only cooked taros are left.

133
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,799
Betel nut taro is not
the only best taro our country has.

134
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Fuding's taro has the most delicate texture

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,159
and it's the best ingredient to make taro paste.

136
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Slicing Fenghua taro and steaming

137
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
with meat is better.

138
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
Isn't it just right

139
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,039
to use these baby taros
to make osmanthus taro seedling

140
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,840
and taro with scallion oil?

141
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, for this one...

142
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Zijin, come

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,919
and help me out.

144
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,719
Yes.

145
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,380
[Kunning Palace]

146
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,200
Matron Meng, please stay.

147
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,239
Go on.

148
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes.

149
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
Your Majesty doesn't usually
have midnight snacks.

150
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,320
Matron Meng sliced the cooked taros.
She added nutmeg

151
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,599
and almonds into the mixture
and lightly fried them.

152
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,359
Along with parsley and Bijian soup,

153
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,320
it can strengthen the spleen and stomach,
calm the mind, and aid in sleeping.

154
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
Please enjoy your meal, Your Majesty.

155
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,119
Do you still remember our bet?

156
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,880
Silly child, why go all the trouble?

157
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,039
No one can go against the royal family.

158
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,359
If you refuse to budge,

159
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,479
no one in the world can save you.

160
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,599
Your Highness.

161
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,559
Please calm down, Your Highness.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
I'll talk her out of it.

163
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
She'll change her mind.

164
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,159
When a human is born, it's like living in a cage.

165
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,039
You can only go against the natural order

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
when you die.

167
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,960
You don't say a word for half a year.

168
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
You face the window all day.

169
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,119
Do you think

170
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,559
you can detach yourself from this world?

171
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,719
They are many who can replace you.

172
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,520
But I just don't tolerate defiance.

173
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
Let alone rejecting me.

174
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,119
Your Highness,

175
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,239
I watched Li grow up.

176
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,799
She's a good girl with good manners

177
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,479
and she abides by the rules.

178
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,679
Please show me some grace

179
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
and give her another chance.

180
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,479
Silly child,

181
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,799
you only have two choices

182
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,039
if you refuse to enter the palace.

183
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,280
You can only become a nun or die.

184
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
You're still so young.

185
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,359
Don't tell me you want to shave your head

186
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:50,719
and spend your whole life at the temple?

187
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,679
Aren't you afraid of inviting trouble

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
for getting me into the palace?

189
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,000
It's all planned.

190
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,760
I suggest you stop being delusional.

191
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Just accept and be
the Great Imperial Grandson's concubine.

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
But I'm not willing to.

193
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,359
Do you dare to bet?

194
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,039
Once you know the prosperity
of this supreme place

195
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,400
and meet my son,

196
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
your unwillingness will disappear.

197
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:37,919
When that time comes,

198
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,799
I'll wait for you to beg me.

199
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,359
This is my grace to you.

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
You've entered the palace for a while now.

201
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,919
So do you know
what the supreme place in the world is?

202
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,679
Your Majesty,

203
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,080
the royal household,

204
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,760
wealth, glory, supreme power

205
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,119
are the highest power in the world.

206
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Have you met the Crown Prince?

207
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,359
The Crown Prince is wise, farsighted,

208
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
intelligent, and decisive.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
He also has a benevolent heart for the people.

210
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,719
Tomorrow, I'll relay my edict

211
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,719
to confer you the Crown Prince's concubine.

212
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Thank you for Your Majesty's kindness.

213
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,119
Please revoke your order.

214
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,039
What?

215
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
I lack fortune.

216
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
I dare not accept it.

217
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,479
You don't admire imperial power after seeing it.

218
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,599
You don't envy glory after seeing it.

219
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,599
How carefree you are.

220
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,000
But there's a fate

221
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
between you and him.

222
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
Can you bear to cut it off?

223
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,479
When

224
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
I first entered the palace,

225
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,200
I came with a grudge.

226
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,960
But after spending time with the Crown Prince,

227
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,679
my heart has melted because of him.

228
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,520
Your Majesty,

229
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,799
I truly adore the Crown Prince.

230
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,239
But I have to choose between love and freedom.

231
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm not willing to be a concubine.

232
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,359
Please fulfill my wishes.

233
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,840
Do you know what you're talking about?

234
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,080
Your Majesty has promised to let me go.

235
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,960
How dare you speak to me like this.

236
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm the head of the imperial harem.

237
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,320
As long as I don't let you go,

238
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,039
you'll have to be submissive
in this imperial harem,

239
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,359
be the Crown Prince's concubine,

240
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,359
and continue the royal family's line.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm childish, ignorant, stubborn,

242
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,160
and unreasonable.

243
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,319
I don't deserve to serve the Crown Prince.

244
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
You have the nerve to speak this way.

245
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,040
No matter how tough your bones are,

246
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
it's not tougher than a sharp ax.

247
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
No matter how strong your will is,

248
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,800
you can't shake the supreme imperial power.

249
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
You speak to me like this

250
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,920
because you're taking advantage
of my tolerance and compassion.

251
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
After you've exhausted all my patience,

252
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
your older brother and every one
of the Sun family will cease to exist

253
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,520
in an instant.

254
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,839
The people say

255
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
the Empress is gentle and generous.

256
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
But they were wrong about you.

257
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Your will is far more determined than any man.

258
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,079
Your decisiveness is also far more comparable.

259
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
But

260
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,880
what I want is

261
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,959
to die without regret.

262
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,479
I'll take my leave now.

263
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,959
Your Majesty, this maid is rude.

264
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,439
You shouldn't tolerate her anymore.

265
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,760
As expected, it's sweet, crispy, and delicious.

266
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
She could have stood by

267
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,079
when I was in trouble.

268
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,280
However, she ran about for me
regardless of past grievances.

269
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
Mother is right.

270
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,359
She's a good child.

271
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,319
Your Majesty...

272
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
I just want to see

273
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,719
if there's anyone in the world
who dares to disobey the imperial power.

274
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,439
Or even

275
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,359
resist the arrangement of fate.

276
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,920
Wait here.

277
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
Why do you want to see me

278
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,199
at this late hour?

279
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,319
What is this?

280
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
An amulet for offspring.

281
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
I don't need something superstitious like this.

282
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,640
If this is why you want to see me,

283
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll head back, then.

284
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,040
Your Highness, keep it.

285
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,119
I said I don't need it.

286
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Big Sister.

287
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,839
It doesn't matter if you have no child.

288
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,640
I sincerely pray to heaven

289
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,040
for peace and joy in your life.

290
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
This is enough for me.

291
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,439
Big Sister,

292
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,599
why are you talking strangely?

293
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,560
Big Sister.

294
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,560
Big Sister.

295
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,500
[Qing'an Gate]

296
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,199
Ziping.

297
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,760
Stop daydreaming.

298
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,479
Why do you look distracted?

299
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,680
It's nothing.

300
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,119
I'm all right.

301
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,800
But I wonder how it'll take

302
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,599
to master cutting tofu.

303
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,800
What?

304
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,239
She saw Manager Fang prepare hydrangea tofu,

305
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,359
and later she heard there were 158 tofu dishes

306
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,000
at the Tofu Banquet.

307
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,599
She's obsessed with tofu now.

308
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,439
She kept looking at tofu every day,

309
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
and I don't even know what she's doing now.

310
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:54,599
Come with me.

311
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,125
[Chrysanthemum Tofu]

312
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Highness,

313
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
His Majesty may have exempted
Jiaozhi's gold and pearls,

314
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,839
and the purchases of Shaanxi and Sichuan tea.

315
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
However, many places still collect by force,

316
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,760
harass the people, and waste money.

317
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,959
For instance, the tribute of lacquer and azurite.

318
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,760
They never care if it's locally produced.

319
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,839
Everything is being levied.

320
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
The people were forced to sell their property

321
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,640
to buy lacquer and azurite at a high price

322
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,079
to complete the quota for the government.

323
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,479
Unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity

324
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,079
to drive up prices tenfold.

325
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,359
The people lost their homes and properties.

326
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,719
[Investigating Censor, Mei Shaoyuan]
Why did you stop me from submitting the memorial?

327
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,800
You're not scolding the unscrupulous merchants.

328
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,319
You're scolding

329
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,400
the eunuchs Father sent out for purchase.

330
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,680
Do you know

331
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,239
the ones Father sent are

332
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,640
those he think highly of?

333
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,400
Some of them have been
his trusted confidant for many years.

334
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,239
Do you think Father will believe you or them?

335
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
I can't let someone like you

336
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
get hurt from slander.

337
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
As the investigating censor,

338
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,599
I have to supervise the departments
and report anything unlawful.

339
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
I can't just watch the eunuchs cause trouble

340
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
for the Great Ming.

341
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,800
Your Highness, you must watch out
for the rats by your side.

342
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,439
Don't let them mislead you.

343
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,880
Your Highness.

344
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,719
I'll reward this tea to you.

345
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

346
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,719
Good tea.

347
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,839
It's good. Thank you, Your Highness.

348
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Gentle water nourishes all things.

349
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,800
Flood destroys crops and harms the people.

350
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
Hence, people build water wheels

351
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,479
to prosper the countryside and build dams
to prevent water disasters.

352
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,079
The water is so.

353
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,319
So are people.

354
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,599
The eunuchs were at war
with Grandfather for many years.

355
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,400
There are indeed a lot of talents around.

356
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,319
He's indeed

357
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
an upright and valiant young talent.

358
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,439
What?

359
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,439
Let's go.

360
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,400
Follow me.

361
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,959
Come back.

362
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,359
Why are you here?

363
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm here to see the one you like.

364
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,560
Zheng Sanbao fought bravely and skillfully
for several voyages in the West.

365
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,280
Yishiha has sent many envoys to Nurgan

366
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,119
to appease the local ethnic groups.

367
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course,

368
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,959
there's also someone like Huang Yan
who gave out intel

369
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,479
of the Inner Court to hatch a sinister plot.

370
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,599
Eunuchs are like water.

371
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,199
They're no different than the officials.

372
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
There is no distinction between good and evil.

373
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
It depends on how you use it, that's all.

374
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
I beg to differ, Your Highness.

375
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,599
A knight errant can uphold justice

376
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,199
if he has the sword in his hand.

377
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
If it falls into the hands of bandits,

378
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,400
it'll become a sharp weapon to kill.

379
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,959
The reign of the Ming Dynasty concerns
all the people.

380
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Now, the Emperor is kind,
and the Crown Prince is virtuous.

381
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,319
You can firmly grasp this sharp sword.

382
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
But who can be certain

383
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,199
that the Great Ming will have
a great emperor every generation?

384
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,319
How bold of you!

385
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,079
Leave.

386
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
I said, leave.

387
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,640
Yes, Your Highness.

388
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,359
You're impeaching

389
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,640
[Xingyun Cottage]
the imperial bodyguards

390
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,599
and the eunuchs.

391
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
I've told you so many times.

392
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,359
If you have something to say,

393
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,520
just tell me in private.

394
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,599
You scold others so openly.

395
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Some people will plot against you.

396
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,199
Since you know he's a snake,

397
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,079
why do you keep him by your side?

398
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,920
Yuan Qi

399
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
has been serving me since I was young.

400
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,479
I fell down from the horse one time.

401
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,479
He rushed towards me to protect me.

402
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,520
He was bedridden for a year.

403
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
Shaoyuan,

404
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,800
even he's from a lowly birth,

405
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,800
he's still human.

406
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
I'll get the meals ready.

407
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,199
It smells so nice.

408
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,119
Zijin,

409
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,839
why does stinky tofu smell

410
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,920
so bad,

411
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,520
but it tastes so delicious?

412
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,920
Smells good, right?

413
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,920
Zijin.

414
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,040
The first one is mine!

415
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
It's mine. You can't take it.

416
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,119
It's all mine. Mine.

417
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,760
It's all mine.

418
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me have a bite.

419
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,319
Careful. It's hot.

420
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,239
Zijin.

421
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,280
You ran away so fast.

422
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,280
You ignored me when I asked you questions.

423
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
What do you want now?

424
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,599
I...

425
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Try it.

426
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,000
Matron Meng is here.

427
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,040
This year's Lantern Festival,

428
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,839
they will set up a lantern display
of Aoshan Mountain in the palace

429
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
to pray for peace in the world.

430
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,280
His Majesty is also going to hold
a banquet for all the officials.

431
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,119
All of you need to keep your heads up

432
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,319
to manage it.

433
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,319
-Yes.
-Yes.

434
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,479
Matron Meng.

435
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
If I remember correctly,

436
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,520
the contest winner

437
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,119
between us has not been decided yet.

438
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Matron Hu,

439
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,160
don't you want to give up

440
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,599
at this point?

441
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,800
No matter what, I'm still the matron.

442
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,719
In terms of rank,

443
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,199
it's not your place

444
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,680
to behave presumptuously in front of me.

445
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,719
Is this still necessary?

446
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,959
Matron Meng,

447
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,640
you've already taken control
of the Imperial Food Service.

448
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,400
But it's still a competition.

449
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
Without determining the victor,

450
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,839
how can one convince everyone?

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
Are you willing

452
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
to accept the challenge for a third-round?

453
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,400
What's the wager?

454
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,640
We can compete

455
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,839
during the banquet for the officials.

456
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,760
If I win by chance,

457
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,599
you're to admit that your skills are inferior

458
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
to mine in front of everyone.

459
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,680
If I lose,

460
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,079
I'll leave the palace

461
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,520
and never step inside the Forbidden City.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
What do you think?

463
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
As you wish.

464
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,680
If she was not

465
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
the Crown Princess' sister,

466
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,959
she wouldn't have been alive until now.

467
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,920
Now, she brings disgrace upon herself.

468
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,119
Matron Meng will definitely take this chance

469
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,239
to chase her out of the palace.

470
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,079
Am I right, Zijin?

471
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,439
Let's not talk about this anymore.

472
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,640
Can you do me two favors?

473
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,040
Two favors?

474
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,359
It's sweet douhua?
(*a Chinese snack made with very tender tofu)

475
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,920
Douhua shouldn't be sweet.

476
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,599
Your Highness,

477
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,199
the Imperial Food Service prepared it.

478
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,199
Why would it be sweet?

479
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,239
Why did they make

480
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,119
sweet douhua?

481
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,319
What did they add in here?

482
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Your Highness,

483
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,319
they might have

484
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
added sugar or sweet syrup

485
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,520
in it.

486
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,959
Osmanthus is likely too.

487
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm not sure of the specifics.

488
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
Why would anyone

489
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
add sugar in douhua?

490
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Your Highness might not know this.

491
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,880
My maternal grandmother

492
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,839
is from Jingzhou.

493
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,479
She has made this sweet douhua

494
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,520
since I was young.

495
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,199
It's especially sweet and fragrant.

496
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,560
But

497
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,959
there's only one bowl.

498
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,079
Why are the flavors of saltiness

499
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
and sweetness separated?

500
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,479
I saw how they made it.

501
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,199
(They used)

502
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,280
(a copper sheet in the bowl
to separate the two flavors.)

503
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,040
(The copper sheet was brushed with...)

504
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,160
(As for the specifics,)

505
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,839
I'll let you know

506
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,880
after I ask them the methods.

507
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,680
What nonsense.

508
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,079
Douhua can only be salty.

509
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,860
[Xingyun Cottage]

510
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,280
I've already helped with the first favor.

511
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,599
Just do me one more favor.

512
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,920
You never talked about him before.

513
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,839
Did you meet

514
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,959
outside the palace?

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Since you like him,

516
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
why do you ask for my help?

517
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,280
I just became a table maid.

518
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,479
My pay is limited.

519
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,959
I don't even have any jewelry

520
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,439
or silk handkerchief at all.

521
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,599
As for poems and sayings,

522
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,359
I don't know all those either.

523
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,680
How am I supposed to express my feelings?

524
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,920
So I could only prepare

525
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,079
one or two delicious meals

526
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,160
with all my heart.

527
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,400
Just help me this once.

528
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
My kind Zijin.

529
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
Please help me, Zijin.

530
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
Please, kind Zijin.

531
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,840
I'll be forever thankful to you.

532
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Go now. Quickly.

533
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,199
Ziping.

534
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,000
Go.

535
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,239
Tell the Imperial Food Service

536
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,560
to never make sweet douhua.

537
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,399
Yes.

538
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Your Highness,

539
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,800
I think Official Mei

540
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,040
wants to borrow this book.

541
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,800
He forgot to take it with him.

542
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll send it to him now.

543
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,040
Give it to me.

544
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,159
The whole room is full of a weird sweet smell.

545
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,879
I'm going to take a stroll.

546
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,560
I can't believe

547
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
someone loves sweet douhua.

548
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,120
Official Mei.

549
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,639
Manager Yao.

550
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,439
This meal is prepared
by the Imperial Food Service for you.

551
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you.

552
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,239
Your Highness, why are you glaring at me?

553
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,439
Where's the food box?

554
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,959
What food box?

555
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,719
That's not for His Highness.

556
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,280
Your Highness!

557
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,959
Not this one!

558
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,159
Give it to me.

559
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,040
Didn't Your Highness say

560
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,439
no one is allowed to mention her?

561
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,080
I naturally wouldn't dare to defy your wishes.

562
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,679
Get 20 strokes of punishment.

563
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,760
Your Highness, please.

564
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,719
Food and drinks are provided

565
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,919
for ministers who enter the palace.

566
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,320
Normally,

567
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,719
it was the Court of Imperial Entertainments' job.

568
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,199
But they're not serious in their work.

569
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,840
The food

570
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,080
they made was hard to consume.

571
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,199
His Majesty has reprimanded
the Court of Imperial Entertainments

572
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,719
and used that reason

573
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,639
to push the task for the annual banquet

574
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,600
to the Imperial Food Service.

575
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:20,959
Really?

576
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,679
Of course.

577
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,919
I didn't say anything unnecessary.

578
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
The food box

579
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,719
was delivered through me.

580
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,320
Why did she look so happy, then?

581
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,320
Did he accept it?

582
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,439
That's great!

583
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
I've finally had my revenge!

584
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,840
Make way! Make way!

585
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,959
What?

586
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,959
I used bamboo worms, bee pupa, and grasshoppers

587
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
(as the meat fillings)

588
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,000
(for the sticky rice dumplings.)

589
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,320
Don't look at me like that.

590
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,199
Fried bee pupae are crispy and tender.

591
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,479
It's a top-grade delicacy.

592
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,120
Yin Ziping!

593
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,439
You're obviously picking on

594
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,479
Official Mei on purpose.

595
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,959
Perfume satchel for sale!

596
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
Slow down!

597
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,560
You're hurting me!

598
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,479
Why steal?

599
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,239
Let me go!

600
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,280
You learn bad things of all things at this age.

601
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Follow me to the government office!

602
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,719
I didn't steal! I didn't steal any money!

603
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,879
Let me go!

604
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Let me go!

605
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:08,919
What's going on?

606
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
She tried to steal.

607
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,120
Take her away!

608
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,959
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

609
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,399
(I've said all the good things I could)

610
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,639
(and begged him for an hour.)

611
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,280
(He still sent me to the bailiffs.)

612
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
He wanted you to change your bad ways

613
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
and live as a decent person.

614
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,800
He still didn't let me go after that.

615
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
He kept waiting outside the prison

616
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,679
and forced me to be an apprentice at a restaurant.

617
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,840
You need a guarantor to work
as an apprentice at a restaurant.

618
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,239
He personally vouched for you

619
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,639
and forced you to earn a living
to support yourself.

620
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,679
He's such a nice man.

621
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't let him trick you.

622
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,120
On the surface,

623
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,479
he looks like a gentle scholar.

624
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
But he's evil and heartless.

625
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
He even took my pay.

626
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
There must be a misunderstanding in this.

627
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,879
There's none at all.

628
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,320
I'm already kind enough

629
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,439
not to add arsenic to his food.

630
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,120
Yin Ziping!

631
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,399
Zijin.

632
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:55,760
Zijin,

633
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,360
the wines from the Imperial Winery are here.

634
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,239
Go and verify the list.

635
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,800
All right.

636
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,159
Ziping,

637
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,159
go and help her out.

638
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,320
Jinhua Wine, Changchun Wine,

639
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,159
and Taixibai Wine one jar each.

640
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,600
Changqing.

641
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,280
Yes?

642
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,600
Tell them to move these inside.

643
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,399
Yes.

644
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
Move these quickly.

645
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,879
-Yes.
-Yes.

646
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,159
Be careful.

647
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,840
Hantanchun Wine and Five-flavored decoction.

648
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,320
Move all these inside.

649
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,120
Be careful.

650
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,360
Lotus Wine, Osmanthus Wine,

651
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,959
chrysanthemum pulp,
and orchid decoction two jars each.

652
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:35,639
Careful.

653
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:37,520
Let me see.

654
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,760
This is the wrong character of "xi".

655
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:50,800
This is how you write it.

656
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:52,800
Write it again.

657
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,159
It's almost the same.

658
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,479
No, it's not.

659
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,439
See?

660
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,679
Watch out!

661
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,560
An accident happened at the wine storehouse.

662
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
Yao Zijin is seriously injured and unconscious.

663
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,080
Were you behind this?

664
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,719
Why would I do that?

665
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
You're helping me rise in position

666
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,479
to take over the Imperial Food Service.

667
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
I may not know

668
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
what's your true purpose.

669
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,280
But you can do anything

670
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,719
to get rid of obstacles.

671
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,040
The eunuch was caught

672
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,159
and is still locked in the Palace Surveillance.

673
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,360
What did he say?

674
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,959
He insisted that it was an accident.

675
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,879
Should you be happy

676
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,959
that your opponent is injured?

677
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,919
I...

678
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,959
Manager Ji,

679
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,000
when is Zijin waking up?

680
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
You're also injured.

681
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,719
I'm fine.

682
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,439
Is she all right?

683
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
She was lucky to have you block it for her

684
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
when the accident happened.

685
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,399
If it hits her head,

686
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm afraid

687
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
she might never wake up.

688
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,320
What about her hand?

689
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,320
Will there be an aftereffect on her hand?

690
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,320
Matron Meng,

691
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Manager Yao needs

692
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,120
a careful recuperation.

693
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I can only identify

694
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,879
what's wrong with her condition

695
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,840
after she wakes up.

696
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:43,959
From today on,

697
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,879
everyone will move out from here

698
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,600
so she can recuperate at ease.

699
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,199
Apply the herbal ointment for her first.

700
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,399
Yes.

701
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,760
Warm wine may be beneficial.

702
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,439
But only certain wines.

703
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,479
Different wine

704
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,439
uses different level of heat.

705
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
We can preserve its original flavor
by doing this.

706
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,159
I only know cold wine is harmful to the stomach

707
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,159
and harmful to the lungs if it's too hot.

708
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
So only warm wine can be consumed.

709
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
Yet, I didn't know there was much to learn

710
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,360
about warming wine.

711
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,239
Why don't you teach me?

712
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:38,879
Is that okay?

713
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,439
Zijin,

714
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,800
you're finally awake.

715
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,040
Ziping.

716
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,120
My hand.

717
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,879
Zijin, calm down.

718
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,199
Manager Ji said

719
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,199
you'll recover

720
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,159
if you take proper rest.

721
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,600
You must be careful with your hand.

722
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,320
It hurts.

723
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,399
Your Highness.

724
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,600
His Highness had some drink.

725
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:50,879
He said he had a little headache.

726
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,919
He's already resting.

727
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,080
What's the matter?

728
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
Since His Highness is already resting,

729
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,840
I'll report

730
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,959
the state affairs later.

731
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:58,800
I'll take my leave first.
