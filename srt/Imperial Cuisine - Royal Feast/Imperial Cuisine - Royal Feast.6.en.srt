[Episode 6]

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,760
The Prince of Han saved your life.

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,559
I supported you.

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,959
You repaid his kindness

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,239
but not my rectitude.

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,800
I will follow your orders, Your Highness.

8
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,080
After Consort Zhaoxian died,

9
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
the palace had not held flower viewing banquets.

10
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,240
I understand.

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,320
Your Highness,

12
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,839
she is eloquent and bold.

13
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,960
She actually helped
the Prince of Han stay in the capital.

14
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,479
Will you forgive her?

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,279
It depends on whether her words
match her actions.

16
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:34,720
Tonight,

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,399
His Highness will rest
in Lady Guo's chamber again.

18
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,000
Please rest soon.

19
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,360
Eunuch Yuan, here is your snack
from the Imperial Food Service.

Your Highness.

23
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,679
Sitting in the south corner of the room,
I look at the cool bamboo shadows.

24
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,880
Leisurely, I tune the ancient zither.

25
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,640
While playing the song "Yilancao",

26
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,720

don't disturb me.

[I Learn Shurangama From the Teachings]

31

What's this?

32
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,640
Be careful.

33
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,040
This is Su Dongpo's reed
and persimmon leaf paper writing.

34
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,239
Instead of paper and brush,

35
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,200
he used persimmon leaves and reeds.

36
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,079
He is poorer than me.

37
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Ziping,

38
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,519
to get to know him,

39
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,519
I read all the books

40
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,959
in his study.

41
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,000
Did you discover anything?

42
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:34,719
I know he prefers Ouyang Xiu's poems

43
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,760
and admires the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi.

44
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,760
He rides, shoots, and commands.

45
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
In his spare time, he plays the zither.

46
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,479
When he is sad, he paints in the Qiongyuan Court.

47
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,919
He seems to have a high status,

48
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,159
but his drawings of flowers, birds,

49
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:52,400
insects, and fish are detailed, vivid, and lovely.

50
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,119
He is so approachable.

51
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
The more I know him,

52
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,159
the more I think he is the best man in the universe,

53
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,960
but...

54
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,159
He is so nice.

55
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,200
Don't say but.

56
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,119
Do you know

57
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,799
that when he was sleeping on the couch tonight,

58
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,880
I covered him so that he won't catch a cold.

59
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
He grabbed my hand

60
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,599
and said...

61
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,080

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,919
“Chen Wu, don't disturb me.”

63

Why

66
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,960
did you sleep on the bamboo couch?

Absolutely not.

71
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,280
I won't dare.

72
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,440
A bit.

73
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,119
Since you did,

74
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,320
then tell me

75
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,039
why did she keep staring at me?

76
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,599
Weren't you asleep?

77
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,280
You know why.

78
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Tell me.

79

I'm an innocent guy.

80
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,559
I wouldn't know what's on a girl's mind.

81
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,880
Maybe it is your good look.

82
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
If you have paid attention

83
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,760

Today, the Crown Princess is holding a banquet
in Qiongyuan Court.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,799
She will set the test question.

102
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,719
You must do your best.

103
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,719
Live up to the reputation
of the Imperial Food Service.

104
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,479
Yes.

105
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,520
My son

106
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
is willful.

107
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
He insists on living in a thatched cottage,

108
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,719
instead of his luxurious chamber.

109
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Thank you for your understanding and tolerance,

110
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
and concern about his well-being at all times.

111
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,359
As his mother, I don't have to worry.

112
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,679
I'm not worthy of your praises, Mother.

113
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
As your daughter-in-law, I was negligent.

114
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,520
I will take better care
of the Great Imperial Grandson.

115
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,719
Why are you laughing, Consort Zhuang?

116
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,080
The Consort of Great Imperial Grandson is young.

117
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,039
[Consort Zhuang, Imperial Consort]
She didn't catch the hint.

118
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,640
This is not about taking care of his daily needs.

119
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,200
It is about getting pregnant.

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
No wonder His Majesty favors Consort Zhuang.

121
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,000
You are perceptive.

122
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,479
My daughter-in-law

123
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,719
is smart, kind, respectful, and considerate.

124
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,760
She is perfect.

125
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
If she can

126
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,159
give birth to a great grandson for His Majesty,

127
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
that will be the icing on the cake.

128
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,479
Not only her,

129
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,599
me too.

130
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,760
We won't disappoint you.

131
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,119
Good.

132
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,200
Did you all hear that?

133
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:57,400
The Consort of Great Imperial Grandson
and Lady of Talents Wu both said so.

134
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,679
You mustn't slack off.

135
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

136
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,239
They are all like blockheads

137
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,960
and won't please His Highness.

138
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,599
He won't even visit them.

139
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,000
Moreover,

140
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,719
His Highness loves the study

141
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,039
and always stays there.

142
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
He said I disturbed him.

143
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
If you want him back,

144
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,000
tear down that study first.

145
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,960
I heard Lady of Talents Wu
loves the art of incense.

146
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,479
Fragrance permeates the air wherever you go.

147
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,760
It is refreshing.

148
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,080
[Beauty Yu, Imperial Concubine]
Your scent might have suffocated His Highness.

149
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
Beauty Yu has always been outspoken.

150
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,719
Please don't mind her.

151
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,479
His Majesty dislikes your talkativeness.

152
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,679
[Lady of Bright Deportment Li, Imperial Concubine]
The Crown Princess invited Consort Zhuang.

153
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:46,039
Consort Zhuang took pity on me for being lonely

154
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,359
and brought me along.

155
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,679
You are an elder.

156
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,159
Don't bicker with the Great Imperial Grandson's
Lady of Talents.

157
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,960
I could smell your fragrant scent

158
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,479
as soon as I entered the pavilion.

159
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,239
No wonder people call you the fragrant doll.

160
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,760
His Highness said that I am too fragrant.

161
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,039
Whenever I meet him,

162
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,679
I would take several showers.

163
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,919
He still dislikes me.

164
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,479
His nose could smell

165
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,400
the incense I used 10 days ago.

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's too strong.

167
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,039
Today, I invite you all to a banquet

168
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,840
for the contest of the Imperial
Food Service manager's position.

169
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,559
Let us feast.

Matron Meng.

171
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,200
Your Highness, what's the topic?

172
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,719
When Emperor Taizu was alive,

173
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,320
he ate tofu for breakfast and dinner every day

174
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,599
to remember the hardships of the past.

175
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,719
The main ingredient for today's cooking is tofu.

176
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,559
Yes.

177
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,960
Please forgive me

178
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,679
[Secondary Consort Guo, Crown Prince Consort]
for being late.

179
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,559
Sister,

180
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,239
you didn't invite me
to this flower viewing banquet.

181
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,599
You said you were unwell.

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
I didn't want to intrude.

183
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
Now that you're here, let's all sit down.

184
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Matron Meng,

185
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,599
about this contest...

186
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,280
Sister, after you took over the harem affairs,

187
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,440
you've been eating simple meals every day.

188
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,760
Why did you throw a banquet

189
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,440
but make it so simple?

190
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,559
Matron Meng,

191
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,159
yesterday, the Crown Prince said

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,359
that Haimen in Zhejiang

193
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,080
presented a batch of fresh sea fish.

194
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,000
Today, I will pull the strings.

195
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,559
Let's use fish as the main dish.

196
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,599
Let all cooks show their talents

197
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,119
and compete. What do you think?

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,799
Go ahead.

199
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,799
Yes.

200
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,679
Send the rocket drawing

201
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,520
to the cannon maker soon.

202
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,200
I'll test it when it's ready.

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,520
Yes.

204
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
This is a weird year.

205
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,400
It snowed early.

206
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:23,840
Can't stop it.

207
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:26,585
Your Highness.

208
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,760
Your Highness.

209
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,320
You're just in time

210
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,200
for the Crown Princess' banquet.

211
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,039
You're here.

212
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,919
Let's join them.

213
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:39,760
Stay still.

214
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,559

216
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,239
The rare butterfly

217
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,760
has dark blue wings

218
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,479
and black belly.

219
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,280
Have you seen it before?

220
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes.

221
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,799
It's poisonous.

222
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,960
The fragrance from the Lady

223
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,080
must have attracted it.

224
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,599
Don't move.

225
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,559
The powder of its wings can harm your skin

226
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,919
if you touch it.

227
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,400
Your Highness,

228
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,760
what should I do?

229
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,280
Miaoxian, stay calm.

230
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,520
Wait for me.

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,640
I'll get the Imperial Physician.

232
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,599
All right.

233
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,199
Hurry up, Your Highness!

234
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I'm scared.

235
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:12,880
Wait for me.

236
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,239
I'll stay still.

237
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,119
Your Highness, you fooled her again.

238
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,239
Stupid.

239
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,160
She'll

240
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,319
just occupy our time.

241
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,239
Let's go.

242
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,800
Lady of Talents Wu,

243
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,959
why are you here alone?

244
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:32,959
The Crown Princess is looking for you.

245
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,839
The Great Imperial Grandson is gone, right?

246
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,280
His Highness wanted to have fun.

247
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,040
We played hide-and-seek.

248
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,319
Let's go back.

249
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,560
The topic for today's contest

250
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,199
is fish.

251
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,560
You may start.

252
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,760
I'll have this.

253
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,119
Tofu?

254
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
Around 9 PM,

255
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,400
a little eunuch

256
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,079
carried a clay pot into the kitchen.

257
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,800
I asked Chang Qing to enquire and found out

258
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,599
that tofu was the topic
chosen by the Crown Princess.

259
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,319
Yin Ziping, you...

260
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,599
Don't tell others.

264
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:01,920
This is...

265
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,560
Your Highness,

266
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
this is Qilin Fish.

267
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,000
The fish scales are made from ham and chicken.

268
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,680
Qilin is auspicious.

269
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:10,959
I'd like to boldly

270
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,359
wish Your Highness good luck

271
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,400
and longevity.

272
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,839
The meat is tender and tastes unique.

273
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,439
The ham

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,199
is more delicate than fish meat.

275
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,439
Strangely,

276
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,959
I have dull taste buds.

277
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,319
Although I've eaten many delicacies,

278
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,479
I've never felt the delicious taste of the world.

279
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:38,079
Consort Zhuang has a unique view of food.

280
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,640
How can normal food impress you?

281
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:58,280
The tenderest bamboo shoot I've eaten this year.

282
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,239
(I deliberately sliced
a basket of winter bamboo shoots)

283
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,719
(and picked the most tender tips for cooking.)

284
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Remove it.

Drink dew from lily magnolia in the morning.

Eat autumn chrysanthemum in the evening.

289
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:02,439
This meal is elegant.

290
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
Eat flowers and drink dew.

291
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,239
She is also pretty.

292
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,640
Matron Meng,

293
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,199
the Imperial Food Service has recruited
many talents this year.

294
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,239
Now, thank Secondary Consort Guo for the praise.

295
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,199
There is mutton in the fish belly.

296
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,839
Your Highness,

297
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,079
I heard

298
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,280
that since ancient times, fish and mutton

299
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,719
mean freshness when combined.

300
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,680
The mutton does not smell strongly.

301
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,959
Very fresh.

302
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,479
Well done.

303
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:50,800

[Fresh Fish Dumpling]

306
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,079
The fish is not the filling

307
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,760
but the dumpling skin.

308
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,239
Yes.

309
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,920
(Eat fish without seeing it.)

310
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
(The method is unique.)

311
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,959
Try it, everyone.

312
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,479
(This fish dumpling uses clear chicken soup.)

313
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,359
(No wonder it tastes delicious and rich.)

314
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,160
The sauce

315
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,839
is the commander of all flavors

316
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,160
and leads all flavors.

317
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,359
I've tried thousands of sauces,

318
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,599
but this bean paste is unforgettable.

319
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,319
Try it, everyone.

320
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,280
Surprisingly, this tofu stewed in soup

321
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,640
tastes more delicious than the fish.

322
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,800
It is tender and melts in your mouth.

323
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,319
Consort of Great Imperial Grandson,

324
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,280
for ordinary people,

325
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:53,520
fish heads and tails are very precious.

326
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
In my mind, the art of cooking

327
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,239
is to turn simple items into something magical

328
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,280
to benefit the people.

329
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,959
Therefore,

330
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,239
(added tofu to the remaining fish soup,)

331
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,800
(so the mixture of tofu and meat
enhances the flavor.)

332
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
It can also give the poor people another meal.

333
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
Well said.

334
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,359
In today's contest,

335
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,719
only this dish is my favorite.

336
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,280
The simple ingredients

338
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
It deserves first place.

339
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:28,520
Does Secondary Consort Guo
have a better opinion?

340
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,839
I might be an insignificant person,

341
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,520
but I've served His Majesty for years.

342
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,839
In terms of status,

343
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,239
I am the elder of the Crown Prince.

344
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:43,079
Are you dismissing what I said?

Beauty Yu!

346
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,119
His Majesty has not summoned
the Beauty for many years.

347
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,520
How dare you claim to be
the Crown Prince's illegitimate mother?

348
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
You've gone too far!

In cooking,

352
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
ingredients are the most important.

353
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,680
The fire control comes next,

354
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,800
and lastly the salt.

355
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,920
There were few dishes with too much oil and salt,

356
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,599
and only this one takes into account
our taste buds.

357
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,959
It is fresh and elegant,

358
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,560
and it is outstanding.

359
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,280
Crown Princess, since we're choosing a manager,

360
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,400
it tests the cooks' ingenuity

361
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,439
and cooking skills.

362
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,119
If you don't taste the food,

363
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,760
how can you decide?

364
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,839
It's like an imperial examination

365
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,839
that tests knowledge and character.

366
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,680
It is not about

367
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,319
flattery.

368
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,479
Secondary Consort Guo,

369
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,079
this dish has a deep meaning.

370
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Of course.

371
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,119
We taste foods with our tongues.

372
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:56,439
The tongue is sometimes
more honest than the heart.

373
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:00,760
Alright.

374
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,599
I have a headache listening to you all.

375
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,599
Consort Zhuang and Crown Princess,

376
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,839
excuse me.

377
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,599
You won.

378
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,760
Wait.

379
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,079
Today's banquet

380
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,199
is for Shandong and Henan,

381
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,560
two jurisdictional provinces.

382
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,319
We are raising funds
for the disaster victims in the provinces.

383
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,959
It's an official business.

384
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,599
This is how it should be.

385
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,479
Gold and jade

386
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,239
don't matter to me.

387
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,560
After you all return,

388
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,839
please spread this news

389
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,680
to the concubines and consorts
and titled women of the Imperial Court.

390
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I hope they will be generous

391
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,319
and are compassionate to the people.

392
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,359
This is a good deed.

393
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,719
We should do that

394
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,119
without being told.

395
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,239
After I go back,

396
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,119
I will discuss this with other consorts.

397
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't worry.

398
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,959
On behalf of the victims,

399
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,599
I thank Consort Zhuang for your kindness.

400
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,920
The art of eating

401
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,839
is to refrain from eating

402
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,239
and accordingly.

403
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,040
The people of the country are suffering now.

404
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,439
We should put the people's livelihood first.

405
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,239
Unlike what Lady Guo said,

406
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,880
the most important isn't the skills.

407
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,640
Fresh flowers in dishes,

408
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,760
the tips of winter bamboo shoots,

409
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,959
auspicious qilin,

410
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,800
and fresh fish for dumplings.

411
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,400
If this matter spreads outside,

412
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,359
officials and wealthy households in the capital
will imitate us

413
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,760
and pursue luxury and sophistication.

414
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,359
This is not good.

415
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,439
What's more, today's tofu fish

416
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,319
is the most unforgettable delicacy
I've ever tasted.

417
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

418
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,800
Lady Guo praised you,

419
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,079
but the Crown Princess didn't touch your dish.

420
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,479
What a shame.

421
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,599
However, if I'm promoted to manager,

422
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,400
I will take good care of you.

423
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,359
Let's go.

424
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,280
We will

425
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,199
make an exception and promote
Su Yuehua to manager effective today.

426
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,719
Yes.

427
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,520
Matron Meng informed the Crown Princess

428
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,040
that the Imperial Food Service
needs one more Table Maid.

429
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,680
Yao Zijin,

430
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:33,719
you will fill the vacancy.

431
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,680
Ziping.

432
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,359
Ziping.

433
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,439
Consort Zhuang didn't like

434
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,040
the dishes in yesterday's banquet.

435
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,520
She could only eat

436
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,199
the fragrant flower fish shreds.

437
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,719
Her Highness said

438
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,119
that the dish shall be on the menu from now on.

439
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,079
These are her gifts.

440
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,199
Work hard in the future.

441
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:05,959
Yes.

442
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,479
I thank Her Highness.

443
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,520
Directress Wang,

444
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,160
the winner was obviously Yin Ziping.

445
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,520
Why was she treated like this?

446
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,479
Didn't you lose on purpose?

447
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,640
Me?

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,479
You didn't use tofu

449
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
to please the Crown Princess.

450
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,239
Weren't you letting Ziping win?

451
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
Ziping found out about it.

452
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
I shouldn't take the credit.

453
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,280
It's unfair.

454
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
If she cannot win,

455
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,520
you shouldn't let her compete.

456
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
You went back on your word

457
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,359
and hurt her.

458
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,160
How dare you?

459
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,640
Forgive me, Directress.

460
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,959
Ziping wants to turn over a new leaf

461
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,719
but didn't have a chance.

462
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,880
I won't be the manager,

463
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,000
so she could have the chance to start over.

464
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,959
You spoke so lightly of it.

465
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,920
Clearly,

466
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,880
your heart is indeed not here.

467
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
[Xingyun Cottage]

468
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,439
Your Highness,

469
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,160
the Imperial Food Service
held a contest at today's banquet.

470
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,400
Alas,

471
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
you almost saw her.

472
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,119
Did I say I want to?

473
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,640
That's right.

474
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,319
There was

475
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,319
no point going.

476
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,199
She lost.

477
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,560
Lost?

478
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,119
It doesn't

479
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,239
concern me anyway.

480
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,319
Why did she lose?

481
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,000
Poor skills.

482
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,719
Not necessary.

483
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:00,479
Well,

484
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,319
I inquired about it myself.

485
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,680
How could it be wrong?

486
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,640
What banquet was it?

487
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:06,839
A flower viewing banquet.

488
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,600
For the main course,

489
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,000
only Miss Yao's fish shreds suit the topic.

490
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,439
Others failed to get the big picture.

491
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,639
How could they win?

492
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,600
Your Highness,

493
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,320
what he said

494
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,120
made sense.

495
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
You talk too much.

496
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,120
Ziping.

497
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,919
Come out.

498
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,000
No.

499
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:29,959
Come out now.

500
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,800
No.

501
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,479
Come on.

502
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,000
You lied to me.

503
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,919
No matter what I do,

504
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,919
they

505
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,199
will always regard me as a lowly beggar.

506
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,280
Stay there.

507
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,000
Forget it.

508
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,080
-Go in.
-You...

509
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,320
Go in.

510
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,439
Alright. I'll go out.

511
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,000
Go in.

512
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,840
You're out.

513
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,120
You're out.

514
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,360
Your Highness, His Majesty
passed by Qiongyuan Court tonight

515
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,840
and somehow bumped into Beauty Yu.

516
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,959
Then what?

517
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,679
The eunuch reported

518
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,879
that His Majesty would stay in Beauty Yu's palace.

519
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,600
I think

520
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,719
Lady Guo is arrogant and pushy.

521
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,679
If we offend Beauty Yu,

522
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,199
His Highness will be in trouble.

523
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,639
I know. Leave me.

524
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:47,679
Yes.

525
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,479

00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,000
Go.

you're always busy with government affairs.

This is the first time you've looked at me.

556
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,040
She will be tried by the imperial guards
and the Directorate of Ceremonial.

557

-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

from Directress Wang.

00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,840
Yin Ziping.

568
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,760
The Directorate of Imperial Parks
is understaffed.

569
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,239
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
will transfer 12 people there.

570
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,159
Matron Meng.

571
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,159
Matron Meng.

572
00:38:59,159 --> 00:38:59,560
Hanying,

573
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,000
what's wrong?

574
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,399
Did my father get this?

575
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,679
Your Highness,

576
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,679
His Majesty only ordered one copy
to be sent to you.

577
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,959
Send mine to my father first.

578
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
Don't say that I got it.

579
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:28,159
Say that Grandfather wants him to read it.

580
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,000
He'll be happy.

581
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,479
Yes.

582
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,919
Great Imperial Grandson!

583
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,320
Save me!

584
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,399
-Save me.
-Get back.

585
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,280
-Great Imperial Grandson!
-Get back.

586
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,439
Save me,

587
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,000
Great Imperial Grandson!

588
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:46,840
Go!

589
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,639
Please!

590
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,199
Step back!

591
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,600
Great Imperial Grandson! Save me!

592
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,520
What happened?

593
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,760
I'll look into it.

594
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,800
-Go.
-Please!

595
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,520
Please!

596
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,719
Great Imperial Grandson! Save us!

597
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,520
His Majesty is supremely fortunate.

598
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,080
The night watch eunuchs stayed alert

599
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:00,840
and put out the fire in time.

600
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,000
Crown Princess, something happened!

601
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,080
The fire was put out in time.

602
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,360
Lady Yu's jailing will implicate

603
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,479
concubines, consorts, and palace people.

604
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,479
They'll be accused of taking part.

605
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,159
The imperial guard stormed Yongning Palace

606
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,280
and detained Lady of Bright Deportment Li.

607
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,399
Even Consort Zhuang is under house arrest.

608
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,800
Crown Princess,

609
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,919
were the lady and others involved?

610
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,199
His Majesty loves Consort Zhuang.

611
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,040
How could she be under house arrest?

612
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,159
That beauty

613
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
openly attempted to kill the Emperor.

614
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,320
Who'd believe

615
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,280
she isn't a conspirator?

616
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,120
Who knows

617
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,239
how many innocent people will be implicated?

618
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:42,919
From now on,

619
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,080
close the palace gates.

620
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Don't let

621
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,800
any visitors in.

622
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes.

623
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Are you worried that the Eastern Palace
will be implicated?

624
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,439
Consort Zhuang...

625
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,320
Beauty Yu is from Yongning Palace.

626
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,600
His Majesty was furious.

627
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,239
That's why she was implicated.

628
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,320
The Crown Princess ordered us to be careful.

629
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,959
Can't you do something?

630
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,239
Matron Meng.

631
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:47,719
Now, the Palace Surveillance guards the palace.

632
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,159
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

633
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,280
You must

634
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,639
try repeatedly to get in.

635
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,360
If the jailing continues,

636
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,919
Consort Zhuang will die

637
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,600
of hunger before she can appeal.

638
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,479
Which one of you dares to go?

639
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,360
Useless people.

640
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:10,679
I'll go.

641
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,959
Matron Meng, let me try.

642
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,439
I knew you would come.

643
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,280
You told me to mind my own business.

644
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,840
Why are you here, then?

645
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,479
I'm not a kind person.

646
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,600
I am

647
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,360
just ambitious.

648
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,600
How do we get in?

649
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,959
You can't get in with a food box.

650
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,320
Use this.

651
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,600
Go this way.

652
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,239
Grandfather.

653
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,000
You're here.

654
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,879
I heard that you went out today

655
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,479
and punished an officer who occupied a farm.

656
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,479
Well done.

657
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:24,760
Grandfather, I wish to speak.

658
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,120
Are you trying to tell me

659
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,280
about the Directorate of Ceremonial's
searching for traitors in the palace?

660
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Yes.

661
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,360
I give them a duty.

662
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,560
You are very disapproving.

663
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,080
I think

664
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,159
the directorate and imperial guards
are overbearing.

665
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,879
They often overstep their power.

666
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,719
I repeatedly instructed all officials
to have integrity and love the people

667
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,239
rather than being arrogant.

668
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,280
The people are suffering.

669
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,000
I ordered the men to supervise the officials,

670
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:05,840
like farmers removing the weeds from a field.

671
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,120
Those who are corrupt, in dereliction of duty,

672
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,760
victimize villagers, or oppress the people

673
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,360
will have his name erased
from the officials' records.
