[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,000
Sir,

4
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,720
Noble Consort Sun is here.

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Eunuch Manager Yuan

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
doesn't look too good.

7
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,279
You have to be careful.

8
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,199
(Locusts may be small.)

9
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,839
(But they've caused a lot of damage.)

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
(They multiply easily.)

11
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,760
(Yet, it's hard to exterminate them.)

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,919
(When the grains finally grow,)

13
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,839
(every field is lush green.)

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,960
(Every year during harvest time,)

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,119
(the locusts swarmed out of a sudden.)

16
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,360
(They ravaged the seedlings, plant nodes,)

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,320
(as well as the leaves and the spikes.)

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,479
(It hurts the cultivation of fields,)

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,639
(which is the life of the ordinary people.)

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,800
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:29,919
I asked you here

22
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,039
to ask you about something.

23
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,520
Do ask, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,279
Locusts plague

25
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,320
Hejian, Shunde,

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,759
Shandong, and Shanxi.

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,679
Is that correct?

28
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,119
Your Majesty,

29
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,199
locust plagues have occurred frequently

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,000
from the 4th to 7th month since the Hongwu Reign.

31
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,800
The situation is most severe
in the summer and autumn.

32
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,199
It's not the time of the year yet.

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,479
Hejian and Shunde may have a locust plague.

34
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,039
But due to the prefectures and counties'
local authorities' timely supervision

35
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,000
on the locals in catching
the locusts and growing millet.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,320
Now, it's already under control.

37
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,199
Last year, the local authorities of Shandong

38
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,479
had been urging the farmers

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,039
to grow mulberry trees, taro,

40
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,479
sesame, black beans, and more.

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,639
The locust plague may be serious.

42
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,320
But the people can still make
a living to feed the family.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,839
Only the prefecture of Shanxi fails

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,199
in exterminating the locusts.

45
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,759
The officials only did enough to get by,

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
which led to the crops being ravaged by locusts.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,679
The people have little food to eat.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Yunzhou,

49
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,759
I heard you flattered the Late Emperor

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
by criticizing the officials,
making them feel insecure,

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,440
which led to heated discussion.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,600
Is that what happened?

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,479
I hope Your Majesty can forgive me

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
for speaking bluntly.

55
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
A bronze mirror

56
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,479
reflects the human heart.

57
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,000
What's the difference

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
between good and evil?

59
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,360
There are locust plagues in several places.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,119
How much of the relief funds allocated

61
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,679
by the imperial court are used for disaster?

62
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,360
How many are unaccounted for?

63
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,399
I've prepared the list of officials

64
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,199
who handled the relief fund.

65
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,320
Please peruse, Your Majesty.

[The Fifth Month of the First Year of Xuande Reign]
[Internal Investigation One]

67
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,320
(I've been here all morning.)

68
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,399
(Why wait until the end of the year?)

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,320
(Heaven has mercy for the people.)

70
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,240
(Man didn't cause it.)

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,039
(Think of the people's hardship and don't idle.)

72
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,039
(People who suffer are watching.)

73
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,000
(In ancient times, there were poems
on removing borers.)

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,360
(There were also officials catching locusts.)

75
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,440
Exterminate the pests and aid the victims.

76
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,600
The reviews of predecessors are prepared.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,440
Save the people from fire and water,

78
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,480
and don't neglect your duties.

79
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,480
I find these greedy officials

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,519
are much scarier than the locusts.

81
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,679
Order

82
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,880
the imperial bodyguard to capture all of them.

83
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,679
Execute those who deserve it.

84
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,559
Pass this poem

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
to all officials.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,679
Let them take this as a warning.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,519
Your Highness,

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
I did offend you in the past.

90
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,559
But things have changed now.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,239
There's no need to be mindful

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,880
that you had to defame me

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,640
in front of His Majesty.

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,279
Officer You,

95
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,040
did I defame you,

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,640
or

97
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,279
did you guise yourself too well

98
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,559
in front of His Majesty?

99
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,720
The current important official, Official Yang,

100
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,920
always behaved cautiously and respectfully

101
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,760
during Yongle Emperor's reign.

102
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,640
He dared not speak more than he should.

103
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,920
But now, he's speaking without any restraint

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,079
of the current malpractices

105
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,959
in front of His Majesty.

106
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,279
The Minister of Rites, Lyu Zhen,
is extremely good at flattering.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
Now, he's also restraining himself from doing bad

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,959
and starts working seriously.

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
As the saying goes, the one on top

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
has a deep impact on those at the bottom.

111
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,480
I'm only doing what I was ordered to do.

112
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,119
What's wrong with that?

113
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,480
Officer You, please watch your words.

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,799
If someone else heard that,

115
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,320
they'd think

116
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,279
you were criticizing

117
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,119
Yongle Emperor

118
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,480
about what you've just said.

119
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,279
What did you hear?

120
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,519
We heard

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,679
you said

122
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,519
Yongle Emperor was resolute

123
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,559
and decisive

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,040
while the current Emperor is open-minded

125
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,399
and readily follow good advice.

126
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,239
The imperial bodyguards
are the eyes and ears of His Majesty.

127
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,079
His Majesty would naturally trust me.

128
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,359
As for you,

129
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,320
you should return to Yongning Palace

130
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,760
and take good care of Yantai.

131
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,440
I hope you'll remember what you said today.

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,480
You need to remember.

133
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,040
His Majesty needs

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,359
ears and eyes that understand
the people's sufferings.

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's go.

136
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,799
Noble Consort Sun

137
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
deliberately puts you in a difficult position.

138
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,279
Fu Jiang.

139
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,880
Dried persimmon can be replaced
with persimmon powder.

140
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,760
It's more effective in reducing phlegm
and treating cough.

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,519
I've already written

142
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
the lists

143
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
of restricted foods and drinks during meals.

144
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,600
Please

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,119
let Imperial Physician Sheng peruse it
before preparing them.

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,519
Thank you, Your Highness.

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,320
The four prefectures of Jinan, Yanzhou,

148
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Dongchang, and Qingzhou

149
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,799
hadn't rained

150
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
since last year's 7th month.

151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,320
The seedlings in the paddy field

152
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,519
had all wilted.

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,559
The people can't even feed themselves.

154
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,559
Yet, the Ministry of Works

155
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,640
sends people to purchase ornaments?

156
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,959
What kind of ornaments

157
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,320
need to be bought this urgently?

158
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,640
Shaoyuan,

159
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,519
do you know about this?

160
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,239
Your Majesty,

161
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,440
the Ministry of Works sent people

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,799
to buy the ornaments are used

163
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,119
to build the mausoleum for our ancestors.

164
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,119
Mausoleum?

165
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
It's just a bunch of excuses.

166
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,960
Isn't the people of Shandong

167
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
the people of our ancestors too?

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,719
Our ancestors would be heartbroken

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,919
to see their people suffering.

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,960
Pass my order.

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,640
Halt all purchasing.

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,719
If they dare to cause trouble
for the people again,

173
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,599
I'll execute them!

174
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,359
Is this also happening

176
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,960
in other places?

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,320
Why didn't you report this to me?

178
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:17,960
Never mind.

180
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,039
Summon the Minister of Works into the palace now.

181
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,599
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

183
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Directress Yin,

184
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:42,599
serve the dishes.

185
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,440
Yes, Your Highness.

186
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,239
Your Majesty, have some meal.

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,479
Do you smell anything,

188
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,719
Your Majesty?

189
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,919
I guess mint is better.

190
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,159
It's refreshing

191
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,039
and calming to the mind.

192
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,520
Directress Yin,

193
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,479
prepare mint tea

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,559
with some honey

195
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,719
for His Majesty tomorrow.

196
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,440
His Majesty won't get angry easily

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,239
after drinking it.

198
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,520
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
This smell

200
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,000
does have a calming effect.

201
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,239
It's too bad

202
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,520
it was a gift from my betrothed.

203
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,520
Otherwise, I would have given it to you.

204
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,840
When did you betroth?

205
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,119
She's the eldest daughter of my teacher,

206
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,239
Official Wang of Hanlin Academy.

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,599
It was decided last year.

208
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,640
We've already picked an auspicious day
on the sixth month this year.

209
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,760
This dish looks familiar.

210
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:42,880
This one

211
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,200
is yellow croaker with imitation crab roe.

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,875
[Imitation Crab]

213
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,000
I can't eat crab since young.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
But I like it so much.

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,919
That's why I kept asking Noble Consort Sun

216
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,840
about this.

217
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,359
When I reached home,

218
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,200
the cook at home

219
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
couldn't imitate the taste of crab at all.

220
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,000
I thought

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,119
I wouldn't be able to eat it anymore.

222
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,559
Sir,

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
the secret in this dish

224
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,559
doesn't use chicken egg yolk

225
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
but duck salted egg yolk

226
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,559
that was soaked in brine and preserved

227
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,359
with salted charcoal.

228
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,239
So it was duck's salted egg.

229
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,000
Did I tell you

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,919
to join me for lunch?

231
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,239
Get back to work.

232
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
You're not going to have a single bite.

233
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,559
Directress Su takes great care

234
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,119
in preparing

235
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,479
the Empress's meals every day.

236
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,479
But Kunning Palace would always send it back.

237
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,080
Has the Empress not recovered

238
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,119
from her cold yet?

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,200
After the Imperial Academy
of Medicine treatments,

240
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,080
the Empress's cold

241
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,159
had recovered greatly.

242
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,640
It's just that her illness

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,359
had completely affected Her Majesty's appetite.

244
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
She no longer eats

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,880
her favorite dishes.

246
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
He Shu.

247
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,640
Directress Yin,

248
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,599
Her Majesty has ordered

249
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,520
that I'll be the one

250
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,679
preparing meals for Kunning Palace.

251
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,479
Everyone is only worried

252
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,520
about Her Majesty's health.

253
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,640
If you need my help,

254
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,799
just ask me.

255
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,559
Directress Yin,

256
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,239
are you going to meddle in this matter?

257
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
I didn't mean to interfere.

258
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,080
-It's just...
-No need.

259
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,799
I'll change all the meal lists.

260
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,880
Why are you standing there?

261
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,359
This matter is of great concern.

262
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,559
The Imperial Food Service

263
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,119
must report this to Empress Dowager.

264
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,119
Kunning Palace has ordered

265
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,799
not to disclose the Empress's appetite

266
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,080
to anyone.

267
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,320
But this year's Qianqiu Festival,

268
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,200
the Empress had exempted
the wives of the officials

269
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,320
from bringing gifts

270
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
because she wasn't well.

271
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
She's becoming thinner day by day.

272
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,799
The Empress Dowager
and the Emperor are very concerned,

273
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,679
and they've been asking about this.

274
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,400
Moreover,

275
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,880
Empress Dowager will depart

276
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,200
to pay her respects at the Yongle Emperor's
and Hongxi Emperor's mausoleum.

277
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,799
Since they'll be traveling together.

278
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,400
How long can we hide this matter?

279
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,520
It's my fault.

280
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,000
The Empress doesn't have any appetite

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,359
because the food isn't tasty enough.

282
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,960
I'll keep changing the menu

283
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,000
until Her Majesty is willing to eat.

284
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,325
[Steamed Shad]

285
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:51,880
Your Majesty,

286
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,679
this shad is delivered from Nanjing.

287
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,760
As soon as they arrived,

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,919
His Majesty ordered me

289
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,880
to deliver it to you.

290
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,799
Where's the Emperor?

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
His Majesty has invited Official Yang

292
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,400
to versify at Wenhua Hall.

293
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,679
As soon as the banquet is finished,

294
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,559
he'll be right over.

295
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,440
Are you done checking it?

296
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,559
Your Majesty.

297
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,440
Take a seat and tell me.

298
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,119
Matron Meng left

299
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,400
a total of 160 account books.

300
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,799
I've already tallied half of them.

301
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
I can finish verifying them tomorrow afternoon.

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,679
You're faster and smarter than her.

303
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,919
What did you find?

304
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,280
Your Majesty,

305
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,640
one of the Hongwu Emperor's

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,080
ancestral instructions mentioned

307
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,280
that any purchases made by the imperial court

308
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,440
need to be ten wen higher than the market price.

309
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,200
But if we used this to verify the account books,

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
the purchasing amount

311
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,000
is one hundred times

312
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,559
higher than the market price.

313
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,400
It coincides with what Meng had said.

314
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:01,799
Your Majesty,

315
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
the eunuchs who make the purchases mostly

316
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,200
came from the recommendation
of the Directorate of Ceremonial.

317
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,479
But the Hongwu Emperor

318
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,840
was farsighted.

319
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,640
Every purchase made by the imperial court

320
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,799
must be inspected within seven days.

321
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,960
If the amount is not right,

322
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,799
sinners should be executed and not be pardoned.

323
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,520
When that happens,

324
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
those who recommended these people

325
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,679
will have to be punished as well.

326
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,719
There will always be some resistance

327
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,679
when it comes to restructuring the system.

328
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,599
Aren't you scared?

329
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,320
Your Majesty, you're humoring me.

330
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,799
No one dares to go against Hongwu Emperor's

331
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,799
ancestral instructions.

332
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,280
Your Majesty,

333
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll take my leave

334
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,599
if there are no other orders.

335
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,280
You may leave.

336
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm here to pay respect to Your Majesty.

337
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,239
Have a seat.

338
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,080
Sit.

339
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,559
I've heard

340
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,479
what Noble Consort Sun said.

341
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,280
I know

342
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
Mother is anxious about getting rid
of corrupted practices in the palace.

343
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,080
But we mustn't have too many expectations of them.

344
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,440
Surely, we can't execute

345
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,559
all of the eunuchs.

346
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,119
Matron Meng was too anxious before this,

347
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,400
which had led to many complaints.

348
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,280
After all, we can execute people.

349
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,559
But not their desires.

350
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,479
Based on my humble opinion,

351
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,799
how about we find a solution slowly?

352
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,039
Your Majesty is right.

353
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,000
But

354
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,320
we've only heard of scholars

355
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
who wanted to get official positions in the past.

356
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
Yet, some people

357
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,440
now abandon education

358
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,119
to choose castration

359
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,440
to be a palace eunuch.

360
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,160
I wonder what do you think

361
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
when you hear about this.

362
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,839
Is that true?

363
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,839
This person's petition

364
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,520
has been sent to His Majesty.

365
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,880
Why would someone try to profit from this

366
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
if there's nothing to gain?

367
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,880
I've entered the palace for many years.

368
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,520
Yet I had no idea

369
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,000
matters outside the palace are so corrupted now.

370
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,199
It's really hateful.

371
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,959
They should be executed.

372
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,160
I said all those

373
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,800
to knock Yuan Qi to his senses.

374
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,800
Yuan Qi is His Majesty's

375
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
most trusted subordinate.

376
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,079
It would be best if he knew
how to restrain himself

377
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,280
and manage the eunuchs

378
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,599
of the Directorate of Ceremonial.

379
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,680
If he doesn't change his ways

380
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,880
and becomes even worse,

381
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,680
he has no one else to blame anymore.

382
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,479
I'm doing this

383
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,280
not only for Yuan Qi.

384
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,800
It's to avoid His Majesty

385
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,239
from being sad in the future.

386
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,199
You look pale

387
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,280
and thinner.

388
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,959
I suppose you don't have

389
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,160
to join the homage at the mausoleum.

390
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,079
Paying respect at the Yongle Emperor's and
Hongxi Emperor's mausoleum is a serious matter.

391
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,839
How can I not go?

392
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,239
Mother, you can rest assured.

393
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,920
The imperial physician has said

394
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,560
that I've fully recovered from my cold.

395
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,959
It's all right for me to travel.

396
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,640
Have some fish.

397
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,040
Thank you, Mother.

398
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,719
Why don't you have some too?

399
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:46,880
Mother,

401
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
I heard Yongcheng

402
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
is building a divine tower

403
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,520
for His Majesty's and your well-being,

404
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,119
and the fortune

405
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,280
of the Great Ming.

406
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,599
It's a good deed.

407
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Are you trying to benefit from them

408
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,359
by speaking for them?

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There you are.

410
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,319
Mother, do you know

411
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,760
Yongcheng made a requisition

412
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,160
for 2,000 laborers

413
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,400
to build this divine tower?

414
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,040
Your Majesty,

415
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,599
building the divine tower is
for the blessings of the empire.

416
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,280
It's also for the blessings

417
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
of Empress Dowager, Your Majesty, and the people.

418
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Yongcheng lacks a workforce.

419
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,400
That's why they choose to make a requisition

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,479
during the offseason.

421
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,319
I think

422
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,520
letting the people live in peace is a blessing.

423
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,599
I don't need

424
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,400
blessings that come

425
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,280
from the people's labor.

426
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,640
Tell the person

427
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,520
who put you up to this.

428
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:40,880
Don't trouble the people.

429
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,560
I was thoughtless.

430
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
Please don't be too infuriated.

431
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,719
Enough.

432
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,839
It's only a small matter.

433
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,719
Have a seat.

434
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,920
Let's enjoy our meal.

435
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,040
Come on,

436
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:01,520
eat.

437
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,640
Have some fish.

438
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,119
Your Majesty,

439
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,800
there are many fish bones.

440
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,119
Your Majesty,

441
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,920
can you help His Majesty with it?

442
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:20,800
No need.

443
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,000
I can do it myself.

444
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,560
Your Majesty.

445
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,280
It was the Ministry of Works' fault

446
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,199
to have the idea to celebrate

447
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,160
Empress Dowager's birthday.

448
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
You were only being filial.

449
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,959
How could His Majesty blame you for that?

450
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's go.

451
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,040
I'll come another day.

452
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,319
What's the matter?

453
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,800
Your Highness.

454
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,760
Sit here.

455
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,040
I remember you told me

456
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,560
to treat everyone with kindness.

457
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,880
But everything you're doing now

458
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,400
will offend many people.

459
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,400
The palace eunuchs may have

460
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,319
low positions.

461
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,959
But since the Yongle Reign,

462
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,920
they've been all over the imperial palace.

463
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,400
They're similar to the climbing plants
in the field.

464
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
They'll keep on growing after you weed them out.

465
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,280
It'll be endless.

466
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:20,760
Let alone you.

467
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,479
Even the feudal lords and important officials

468
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,800
dare not offend them.

469
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,719
It's impossible to prevent

470
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
from being stabbed in the back by these rats.

471
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,239
Are we going to ignore the farmers

472
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,719
if we can't get rid of the weeds then?

473
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,680
Why should I be afraid

474
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,239
of doing what Matron Meng can do?

475
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
Why did you want to see me?

476
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,319
I heard the Empress

477
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,959
ate fish at Qingning Palace.

478
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,560
Did you see her eat it?

479
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,479
In the past, you wanted to be the matron

480
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,680
because you wanted to be above others.

481
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,479
In that case,

482
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,719
you can just take care of His Majesty

483
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,319
and Empress Dowager's meals.

484
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,439
Why are you asking

485
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,479
about Kunning Palace suddenly?

486
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,040
Because

487
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm the directress who's in charge
of the Imperial Food Service.

488
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,239
Empress Dowager

489
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,760
did give her a piece of shad at Qingning Palace.

490
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,040
But the Empress found it hard to swallow.

491
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,280
I suspect

492
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,400
the cold

493
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,479
had completely

494
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,959
damaged her appetite and taste.

495
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,199
Su Yuehua tried all the famous dishes

496
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,239
she is good at.

497
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Even if she changed the meal list,

498
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
it'd be useless.

499
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,319
Since the Empress

500
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,000
is tired of the palace food,

501
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,719
why not try making common dishes?

502
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,439
Ziping,

503
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,000
you've finally grown up.

504
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,079
You've learned how to be responsible

505
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,239
and concerned about others.

506
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,040
I was born a talented person in cooking.

507
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,439
It's only a matter of time
before I become the matron.

508
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,040
Good.

509
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,160
We'll see

510
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,079
if you can manage

511
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,760
to solve the Empress's meal.

512
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,560
Matron Yin.

513
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,479
That's music to my ears.

514
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,560
Can you call me that again?

515
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,920
Yin Ziping.

516
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:29,359
Long live Your Majesty!

517
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,959
Where's the Emperor?

518
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,439
Long live Your Majesty!

519
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,359
Empress Dowager is asking

520
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,719
for His Majesty's whereabouts.

521
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,599
Your Majesty,

522
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,239
His Majesty said he wants to lead the way for you.

523
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Long live Your Majesty!

524
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,439
Long live Your Majesty!

525
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,945
[Chongwen Gate]

526
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,719
Your Majesty,

527
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,119
we'll stop here to rest

528
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:45,800
before continuing with the journey.

529
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,479
Come here.

530
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,520
Your Majesty,

531
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,359
come and try this too.

532
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,920
This is the true flavor of the people.

533
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,680
Sure.

534
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,479
Come and try.

535
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:07,959
Here.

536
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,160
Try

537
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,839
the plain food of our village.

538
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,640
Have a seat.

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
Madam,

540
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,199
how's the harvest this year?

541
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,239
All thanks to Your Majesty's blessings,

542
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,040
we had a good harvest.

543
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,439
Everything is great.

544
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,040
I'm glad to hear that.

545
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:03,800
Your Highness,

546
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,719
the flatbread may be rough.

547
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,959
But

548
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:10,119
it's made from the farmer's precious grains.

549
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,199
Empress Dowager granted you the flatbread,

550
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,280
so you could experience

551
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,319
the people's hardship.

552
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,439
Your Majesty,

553
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,599
the flatbread tastes good.

554
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
The shell is fluffy.

555
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,280
I can smell pine nuts

556
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
and walnuts.

557
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,959
There's also

558
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,239
some kind of sweet taste.

559
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,760
Eunuch Yuan,

560
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,959
was rock sugar or honey added

561
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,880
in the batter?

562
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,280
Your Majesty,

563
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
these flatbreads are indeed too rough

564
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,959
to be swallowed.

565
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,119
So how would we dare to serve these
to Empress Dowager?

566
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,439
Besides,

567
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
there are too many people

568
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
with unknown backgrounds.

569
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,199
If anything happens,

570
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,199
my head would be on the line.

571
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,239
So the Court of Imperial Entertainments

572
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
came here in advance yesterday.

573
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,319
The kitchen servants from the palace

574
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,680
indeed made these flatbreads.

575
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:08,880
Your Majesty,

576
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,920
your flatbread is better.

577
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,959
It has more sesame seeds.

578
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,959
Can we switch?

579
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,640
Eunuch Yuan,

580
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,560
don't blame the cooks of the palace.

581
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,839
They wouldn't dare

582
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,079
to make common folks' flatbread.

583
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,040
They were just coping with it.

584
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,400
His Majesty rarely has the chance

585
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,119
to try country dishes.

586
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,439
How could

587
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,599
he know?

588
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,800
Mother, it's time to depart.

589
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,680
Let's go.

590
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:00,719
Your Majesty,

591
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,800
Prince of Wei is missing.

592
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,719
How did that happen?

593
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,800
The servant reported

594
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,040
that the Prince of Wei

595
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,439
went missing after relieving himself

596
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,079
as an excuse

597
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,040
while everyone was resting.

598
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,520
I've already led the men

599
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,280
and searched the farmhouse.

600
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
I've also ordered the palace guard
and imperial bodyguards

601
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,719
to expand the search area.

602
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,439
Your Majesty, it's time to go.

603
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,479
I'm feeling hot now.

604
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,040
I'm going to get changed.

605
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,520
Attend Empress Dowager and return
to the temporary imperial abode first.

606
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,920
Order the officials to go ahead before the rest.

607
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,760
I'll wait there for an audience with them.

608
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:36,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

610
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,239
Sir.

611
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:53,959
Your Majesty,

612
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,959
Prince of Wei is up ahead.

613
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,359
But...

614
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,239
But what?

615
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
Noble Consort Sun insisted on joining.

616
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,680
Why are you here?

617
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,119
I'll go

618
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,599
wherever you go.

619
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,839
Outrageous. Guards!

620
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,000
Send her back.

621
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,359
You know I have a loose tongue.

622
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,959
What if I said something I shouldn't

623
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,959
when I meet Empress Dowager?

624
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,040
What would you do, then?

625
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:35,050
[Animal on screen is CG]

626
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,719
I know horsemanship and archery at 13.

627
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,079
I went hunting with my father at 14.

628
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,479
It's nothing difficult to catch a game or two.

629
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:50,880
But

630
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,079
my skills had declined after staying
in the palace for a long time.

631
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,359
That's why I missed it.

632
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,959
But it's all right.

633
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,760
Your Majesty can take me
to your next hunting trip.

634
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,319
I'll naturally improve if I practice more.

635
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,079
Chen Wu,

636
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,280
stay and take care of things.

637
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Explain to Empress Dowager on my behalf.

638
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

639
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
Your Majesty.

640
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,680
Huaping,

641
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,280
did you see Chen Wu just now?

642
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,040
Eunuch Chen?

643
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,719
Speaking of him,

644
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,719
where did he go?

645
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,560
Something bad had happened.

646
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Who told you to come here?

647
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
Do you know how dangerous this is?

648
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,760
Tell me.

649
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,600
Why did you

650
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,320
come here all by yourself?

651
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,719
Speak.

652
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,639
I forced the little eunuch

653
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,840
to wear my clothes

654
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,399
and ride in the carriage,

655
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,399
while I wore his clothes

656
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,439
and came out here.

657
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Your Highness,

658
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,000
how did you manage to sneak out

659
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
with so many people watching?

660
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,639
You even came here all by yourself.

661
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,879
That doesn't make sense.

662
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,280
It's up to you if you believe me or not.

663
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,479
My mother is no longer here anyway.

664
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:44,679
Father is the same too.

665
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,479
No one in this world

666
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,800
cares about me anymore.

667
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,840
Nonsense.

668
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,560
You're my brother.

669
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,320
No matter what happens,

670
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,639
I'll always protect you.

671
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,600
Big Brother,

672
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,040
everyone ignores me.

673
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:57,719
I thought

674
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,639
you didn't want me.

675
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,679
Why would I come looking for you

676
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,080
if I didn't care about you?

677
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,439
I'm worried

678
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,439
that you refuse to listen to them

679
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,320
and come back.

680
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,600
Big Brother,

681
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,199
you must promise

682
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,959
that you won't hit me

683
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,159
and scold me when we go back.

684
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,000
All right.

685
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,719
But first, you must tell me

686
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,919
who told you to do this.

687
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,959
Otherwise,

688
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,239
you'll have to copy
the ancestral instructions 500 times.

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,520
It was her.

690
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,879
Your Majesty,

691
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,320
look.

692
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,639
Who are those people?

693
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,639
Yunzhou, go and ask them.

694
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,080
Do we need to make a move now?

695
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,399
There are many people.

696
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,520
Things will go wrong easily.

697
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,679
We'll wait a little longer.

698
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,560
Noble Consort Sun, what's wrong with my brother?

699
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,080
Your Majesty.

700
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,280
Tell the truth.

701
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,719
I've asked them.

702
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,399
Some are

703
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,560
from Laishui County of Baoding Prefecture,

704
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,439
while some are

705
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,560
from Xinhe County of Zhending Prefecture.

706
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,439
Last year's drought caused a poor harvest.

707
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,760
There was a locust plague this year

708
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:49,800
with no crop to harvest.

709
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,919
Many people are fleeing to the capital.

710
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,199
Wherever I go,

711
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
the people live and work in peace

712
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,199
and content.

713
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Everyone wishes me a long life wherever I go.

714
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,719
Little did I know

715
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,439
that the refugees

716
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:15,800
were driven out here.

717
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,280
Great.

718
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,280
They're keeping the truth from me.

719
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,560
How did you know?

720
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,320
Me?

721
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,199
Didn't you use Prince of Wei

722
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,239
to bring me here,

723
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,399
so I could see

724
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,280
how I was deceived and deceiving myself?

725
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,560
Your Majesty,

726
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,439
it was either drought or locust plague

727
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,080
that affect Wei County of Guangping Prefecture

728
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,560
and Bazhou of Shuntian Prefecture this year.

729
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,800
There are refugees all over the capital.

730
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
The people in the palace know about this.

731
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,439
They're all hiding it from Your Majesty.

732
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,840
You could've told me

733
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,959
if you wanted me to know the truth.

734
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,399
Yet, you want me to see it for myself.

735
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,399
It's heart-wrenching.

736
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,679
Does it make you feel good to see me like this?

737
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,959
If you don't see it yourself,

738
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,879
I won't know

739
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,199
where they will drive those refugees away.

740
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,479
There will be no proof when that time comes.

741
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,159
I'm afraid

742
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,959
it'll be treated as a matter of course

743
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,280
as that flatbread.

744
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,719
When you were young,

745
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,639
you followed Yongle Emperor

746
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,919
to make secret visits to the people.

747
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,320
You know people's hardships very well.

748
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:30,760
You didn't mind

749
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,679
because

750
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,959
those eunuchs were playing some tricks.

751
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,800
To you,

752
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
it's not even worth mentioning.

753
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,560
Food, drinks,

754
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,840
purchasing, and filial piety.

755
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,320
None of these are trivial matters.

756
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,159
Even a dike as long

757
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,439
as thousands of li

758
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,879
can be slowly eaten away by ants.

759
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,199
It's my fault.

760
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,439
Forgive me for my negligence, Your Majesty.

761
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,439
You didn't neglect your duties.

762
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
There was nothing you could do anyway.

763
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:03,199
One slight move may affect the whole situation.

764
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,959
If you said it,

765
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,679
you'd be criticizing me publicly.

766
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,679
Big Brother, I'm hungry.

767
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,919
I want to eat something.

768
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,840
Your Majesty,

769
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,879
I've prepared some meals

770
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,280
at the farmhouse just now.

771
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,679
Why don't we eat

772
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,080
before we return
to the temporary imperial abode?

773
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,239
You said you were helping me

774
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,719
to test how much my brother loves me.

775
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,679
You were lying to me.

776
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,760
You're such

777
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,239
a scheming woman.

778
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,040
You deserve to lose his favor.

779
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:53,439
Your Highness,

780
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,120
you can take my horse.

781
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,679
This fine steed has a fierce temperament.

782
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:02,840
It's been a while since I've ridden a horse.

783
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,719
I'm afraid I can't handle it.

784
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,080
You won't fall

785
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,479
with me around.

786
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,840
Thank you.

787
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,320
Sir,

788
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,879
how do I get back?

789
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:18,600
Walk.

790
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:35,439
You better not think

791
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,439
that this will disperse my anger.

792
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,919
I won't fall for this trick.

793
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,120
Big Brother, look.

794
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,199
I went searching for the Prince of Wei.

795
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,040
I've reported to Mother

796
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,280
that you were not happy

797
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,159
with what happened earlier.

798
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,600
So you've decided

799
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,199
to visit

800
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,560
the nearby villages personally.

801
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,439
Only then did Mother feel relieved

802
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,679
and depart for the temporary imperial abode
to wait for our return.

803
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,000
You must not have eaten.

804
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,199
I've brought Directress Su with me.

805
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Go and prepare the meals now.

806
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

807
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,800
I was worried about the lack of help.

808
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
Your Majesty,

809
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
you're very thoughtful.

810
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:34,800
Since it's rare

811
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,439
for us to be outside the palace,

812
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,479
why don't we try something new?

813
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,159
Is that all right?

814
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,360
Ziping.

815
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,600
Yunzhou,

816
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,199
have a seat.

817
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,040
Thank you for grace, Your Majesty.

818
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,080
Your Highness, you mustn't.

819
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,159
Let me do it.

820
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
His Majesty

821
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,000
has said

822
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,479
no need to restrain ourselves
while we were outside.

823
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,840
Let me do it.

824
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,560
I want to check the kitchen.

825
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,800
Directress Yin,

826
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,919
what is

827
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,320
Directress Su making?

828
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,600
If you mince it,

829
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,120
you'll have to remove the residue slowly later.

830
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,439
Doing so can retain

831
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,959
the original flavor of the chicken.

832
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,199
Get back to work.

833
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:43,320
This is chicken congee.

834
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,024
[Chicken Congee]

835
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:48,399
Here.

836
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,159
You can have mine.

837
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:12,679
It's tasty.

838
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's just too hot.
