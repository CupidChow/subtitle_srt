[Episode 38]

3
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,775
[Qianqing Palace]

4
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,160
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,919
would you like to go back and rest first?

6
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,720
No, I want to hear and find out

7
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
how I offended her.

8
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,559
She was so vicious.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Your Majesty.

10
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,519
According to the diagnosis
by imperial physicians,

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,480
the spice

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,119
was made from the pollen of thorn apples,

13
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,279
which could cause breathing difficulty

14
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,559
and paralysis.

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
We discovered an antidote

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
in a secret compartment of a box

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,440
in the residence
of the Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

18
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,240
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,039
when did you start to suspect me?

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,399
Summon the ministers.

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes.

22
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:34,919
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,119
don't listen to slanders by vile characters!

24
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,679
Your Majesty dethroned Her Majesty
for no reason.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,440
This is a warning from heaven!

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,399
Your Majesty!

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,759
Greetings, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,759
Bring him here.

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
Your Majesty made a smart and wise judgment.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,720
You didn't misjudge.

31
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,279
This person is the special envoy
of the Prince of Han.

32
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,279
As expected,

33
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,600
he slipped into my residence last night

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
and tried his best to persuade me to rebel.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,199
I see.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
The ruse hatched by Your Majesty

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
and the Duke of Ying

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,759
fooled me also.

39
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:22,720
Take him away.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,240
Yes.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Chen Wu.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,520
After the special envoy
of the Prince of Han arrived in Beijing,

44
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,320
the Eastern Depot followed the clues
he left behind

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,479
and caught eight spies sent by the Prince of Han

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,199
into the capital to wait
for an opportunity to act.

47
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,919
Through interrogations with torture,

48
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,520
we arrested all the spies
left by the Prince of Han

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,479
in the palace.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
The people of the Prince of Han

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,919
contacted

52
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,759
16 military officers.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
More than half were his former subordinates,

54
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,360
including high-ranking officers
of the Five Training Divisions

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,399
and the Three Thousand Division.

56
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,279
They were preparing

57
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,600
to support from the rear on the day

58
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,839
the Prince of Han rises in rebellion

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and seize the capital in one fell swoop.

60
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,160
The Prince of Han

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
spied on the imperial court many times

62
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,720
in the name of offering tributes.

63
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,479
For the love of my flesh and blood,

64
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,440
I did not pursue the matter.

65
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,160
Instead, I treated him with sincerity

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,919
and hoped he would find his way back,

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,279
but

68
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,920
he produced weapons in Le'an

69
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,200
and conspired day and night
to do something unlawful.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm bitterly disappointed.

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,600
Heaven bears witness to how Your Majesty

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,679
treats the Prince of Han,

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
but he has a wolf's ambition

74
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,119
and has let you down.

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,480
Your Majesty

76
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,920
shouldn't feel sad
for a rebellious officer and villain.

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,920
Your Majesty.

78
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,320
There is conclusive evidence
of the Prince of Han's conspiracy.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Even if Your Majesty tolerates him,

80
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,279
the Great Ming's ancestors

81
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,440
and millions of your subjects under heaven

82
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:44,279
won't tolerate

83
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,760
such a rebellious fanatic.

84
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,119
You've grasped everything,

85
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,399
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,640
What about deposing Her Majesty?

87
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,519
Her Majesty is pitiful.

88
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,000
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

89
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,320
Why did you help the Prince of Han?

90
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,799
At this point,

91
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,799
don't you want to tell the truth?

92
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,519
Take her away.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,239
Your Majesty,

94
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
although the Prince of Han is brave,

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
he lacks strategies.

96
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,519
Let me lead 20,000 elite soldiers

97
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,440
to suppress the traitor.

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,279
No.

99
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,200
I have another idea.

100
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,359
Wait.

101
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,839
Halt, Your Highness.

102
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,760
I wish to talk to Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,279
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu no longer exists.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,799
There is only a prisoner.

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,200
She nearly killed me.

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,839
Before she goes to jail,

107
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,200
I want to ask her why.

108
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,880
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,

109
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,760
did you act under duress?

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Just now, in the hall,

111
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,760
why didn't you argue for yourself?

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
After what I did to you,

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,320
do you still want to save me?

114
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,959
That person in front of you,

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,679
the Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,
who loved to laugh, loved fragrance,

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,559
and looked strong outside

117
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,279
but was childish,

118
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
basically didn't exist in the world.

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
I won't be impressed

120
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,399
by what you do for me

121
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,640
because I'm a spy.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
From the day I entered the palace,

123
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,799
I had an important mission.

124
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,200
At this point,

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,839
is there any need to cover up?

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,880
I was born

127
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
a domestic servant
in the Prince of Han's residence.

128
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,239
I was sent to Dantu
when I was small and grew up there.

129
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,440
Later, I was sent to the palace,

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,279
but my biological parents

131
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,959
and siblings

132
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,799
were all in the residence of the Prince of Han.

133
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,839
If I disobeyed orders,

134
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,959
what would they do?

135
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,640
In the imperial harem,

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,799
if I became much favored,

137
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
the Prince of Han would become more demanding.

138
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,720
If I were dejected,

139
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,839
I would become a useless chess piece

140
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,519
and won't live long.

141
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,160
I acted out the part of

142
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
charming but silly Wu Miaoxian

143
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,320
and I believed it myself too.

144
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,679
I enjoyed it too.

145
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,239
However, later...

146
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,960
(the Prince of Han repeatedly urged me to act.)

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
I knew I wouldn't succeed

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
but tried my luck anyway.

149
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,880
If Her Majesty dies,

150
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,440
the loyal ministers will become disaffected,
and the supporters and opponents

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
in the imperial court will soon be in turmoil.

152
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,359
This is unfortunate.

153
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,400
At that time,

154
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
why didn't you kill me?

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,239
Yes.

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
It'd be better to kill you.

157
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,640
Zhu Zhanji would be upset and disturbed,

158
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,440
but...

159
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,760
all my life,

160
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,039
no one had ever worried about me being cold

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,039
and covered me with a blanket.

162
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,359
I repaid you

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,559
with this life.

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,960
Miaoxian.

165
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
It's time to go.

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,400
Miaoxian!

167
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,000
If possible,

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,919
my family members...

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,200
They...

170
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,719
Your Highness,

171
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,719
let's go back.

172
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,159
Careful.

173
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,640
Come.

174
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:44,799
[Fine Meal, Divine Work]

175
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,479
Directress Yin.

176
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,640
The stove, cabinets,

177
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
and roof in the kitchen

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,359
are repaired.

179
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,479
Directress Yin,

180
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,479
the Court of Imperial Entertainments
sent new cooking ingredients.

181
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,479
They've been stored.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,679
Great!

183
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,799
The Imperial Food Service is finally

184
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,760
going back to normal.

185
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,200
Wipe here too.

186
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,080
Here.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,599
Alright.

188
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:18,960
Take her away.

189
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:19,799
Yes.

190
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
Who are they arresting?

191
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,239
What's happening?

192
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,200
I do not know.

193
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,719
Directress Su.

194
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,479
Why is Directress Su arrested?

195
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,119
Yes.

196
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,919
What did Directress Su do?

197
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,880
She doesn't look like who would do anything wrong.

198
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,359
Directress Yin, you won't give up

199
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,840
the chance of hitting me when I'm down.

200
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,479
I've been waiting for you.

201
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,679
From the time you accepted

202
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,280
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu's proposal,

203
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,080
you were doomed for today's ending.

204
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
When you tried to sow discord,

205
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I became suspicious of you.

206
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,080
I reported this to His Majesty.

207
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,960
He ordered me to keep quiet

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
and let you act.

209
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,479
That medicine?

210
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,359
Do you think

211
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,679
Zijin's vegetarian meal

212
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,200
was made by you?

213
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,479
Yin Ziping,

214
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,159
I underestimated you.

215
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,359
You are not an ignorant person anymore.

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
When you entered the palace

217
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,239
and was determined to be the best cook in the land,

218
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,440
your brave words

219
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,640
impressed Directress Wang.

220
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,119
She passed her lifetime's
painstaking work to you

221
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,599
and had high hopes for you.

222
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,320
She hoped you would fulfill
her long-cherished wish,

223
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,880
but what did you do?

224
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,440
You stabbed people in the back and won't repent.

225
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Haven't you disappointed her?

226
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,359
Had Zijin

227
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,919
not rescued you again and again,

228
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,960
who would be

229
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,599
in jail now?

230
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,119
You're a social pariah and thief,

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
but you were luckier than me.

232
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,280
Are you qualified to judge

233
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,119
my actions?

234
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,479
Alright.

235
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,320
I am not qualified.

236
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
How will you repay Directress Wang

237
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,719
who helped and encouraged you?

238
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,799
If Matron Meng

239
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,880
sees the way you are now,

240
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,599
would she regret

241
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
the sacrifice she made to save you?

242
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,640
Don't mention her!

243
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,359
Without Matron Meng,

244
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,400
will you still have your hand?

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,159
I can't be a matron after all.

246
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
For the rest of my life,

247
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,479
I don't want to cook anymore.

248
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,320
Since you want me to repay,

249
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll repay it.

250
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,679
Go away.

251
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,640
We don't owe each other anymore.

252
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,640
Go away! Go away!

253
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,039
Look at me.

254
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,200
Your Majesty.

255
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,919
Where is the trust Your Majesty talked about?

256
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,919
How dare you burn sacrificial vessels

257
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,840
in front of Empress Dowager

258
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,119
and ordered Jin to remind me

259
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,000
about Wu Miaoxian's abnormal activities?

260
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,599
I thought you already guessed it.

261
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,400
Had I accepted the position of the Empress,

262
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Empress Dowager will get mad at me

263
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,359
and

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,039
Your Majesty won't dismantle

265
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,400
the stage before the actor appears.

266
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,280
Were you sure that Empress Dowager and I

267
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,080
will play this act

268
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
and won't do anything to you?

269
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,359
I haven't punished you yet.

270
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,039
What did I do wrong?

271
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,880
Knowing that Wu Miaoxian was dangerous,

272
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,520
you still followed her to Kunning Palace.

273
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,039
Did you want to die?

274
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,880
Your Majesty not only lied to me

275
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,880
but also made Ziping hide things from me.

276
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,839
Would a wise ruler

277
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,599
do what you did?

278
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,400
Her Majesty is honest

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,839
and is not good at covering up.

280
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,400
You

281
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
are too softhearted.

282
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,359
Your Majesty.

283
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't argue.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,280
Don't blame

285
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,599
Directress Yin for this.

286
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,239
I

287
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,880
ordered her to keep it a secret.

288
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,719
What if something went wrong

289
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,239
and I died of poison?

290
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,119
Nonsense.

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
I won't let you curse yourself.

292
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,680
I will keep you safe.

293
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,319
Your Majesty used me.

294
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
You really...

295
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,319
Now you know

296
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,920
how I felt when you

297
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,319
used me.

298
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,599
I'm influenced by what I constantly
saw and heard since small.

299
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,239
I looked down

300
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,599
on the petty tricks

301
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,239
people played in the imperial court

302
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,079
or the imperial harem.

303
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,640
If I want to scheme,

304
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,319
you won't even have bones left,

305
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,599
but I

306
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,119
don't want to

307
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,119
play tricks on you.

308
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,119
Zijin,

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,160
I don't lack the service of women

310
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,000
and don't need

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,439
the smiles of hypocrites
who pretend to be sincere.

312
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,239
I want

313
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,199
you to treat me sincerely

314
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,319
without a trace of concealment and deception.

315
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,680
Do you understand?

316
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,959
Your Majesty,

317
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,599
by doing that,

318
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,040
Her Majesty...

319
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,160
More importantly,

320
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,479
she has given me

321
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,800
the answer I want.

322
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,640
What did Her Majesty say?

323
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,560
Your Majesty,

324
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
there is one more person.

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,760
I know.

326
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,040
Are you trying to plead for Wu?

327
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,719
We'll talk about it when I get back.

328
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,680
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

329
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,439
The Prince of Han rebelled.

330
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,359
I will lead the soldiers
on a military expedition.

331
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,280
(On the first day of the eighth month
of the first year of the Reign of Xuande,)

332
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,439
(the Prince of Han, Zhu Gaoxu, rebelled.)

333
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,880
(Emperor Zhu Zhanji)

334
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
(ordered Prince of Zheng, Zhu Zhanjun,)

335
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,160
(and Prince of Xiang, Zhu Zhanshan,
to stay and guard Beijing,)

336
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,199
(and personally led an army to conquer Le'an.)

337
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,520
Come in and talk.

338
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,319
Noble Consort Sun.

339
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:56,000
[Zhu Zhanshan, Prince of Xiang]
[The third son of Empress Dowager Zhang]

340
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,439
[Zhu Zhanjun, Prince of Zheng]
Before the Emperor left,

341
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,800
he entrusted the capital to you two brothers.

342
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,000
You shoulder the burden
of administering the country.

343
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
How dare you slacken?

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,040
The earthquake in the seventh month

345
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,160
destroyed civilian houses and fields
in the capital and its vicinity.

346
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
Additionally, there is
a severe drought in Shandong

347
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,239
and the Prince of Han is staging
an armed rebellion.

348
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
More and more refugees

349
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,239
have flocked into the capital.

350
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,439
Instead of comforting the refugees,

351
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,640
how dare you ordered the city gates to be closed?

352
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,800
Fools!

353
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,199
I deserve to die.

354
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,760
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

355
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,599
Summon Marquis of Guangping, Yuan Rong,

356
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,280
Marquis of Wu'an, Zheng Heng,

357
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,760
and Ministers Huang Huai and Huang Fu
to the palace.

358
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:35,719
Yes.

359
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,719
Greetings, Your Majesty.

360
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,800
Rise.

361
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

362
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,839
Place officers and soldiers at the city gates

363
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,239
to collect info on the native places
of the people

364
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,199
who flocked into the capital.

365
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,199
Anyone who is 15 or older

366
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,520
and under 50 years old

367
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,119
will be conscripted into the army.

368
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
They will be provided food and clothing.

369
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,479
Send them to fix

370
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,560
damaged city walls and civilian houses.

371
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,680
It's wartime now.

372
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,359
The capital has insufficient grain storage.

373
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Declare my decree.

374
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,199
Open the reserve warehouses
for disaster relief.

375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,319
Rich people who pay taxes in kind
with 300 dan of grain

376
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,119
for disaster relief

377
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,319
will be officially honored as righteous people.

378
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,119
Those who pay 500 dan in kind

379
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,800
will be exempted for three years
from conscript labor also.

380
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,439
During the time of disaster relief,

381
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,160
officials of all ranks in the capital

382
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,680
who are caught exploiting the people

383
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,959
and for dereliction of duty,

384
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,199
regardless of their ranks

385
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,280
and regardless of the severity of the offenses,

386
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,560
will have their property confiscated

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,040
for disaster relief.

388
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,359
You've got your assignments. Hurry and do it!

389
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,199
We obey Empress Dowager's decree.

390
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,239
Zhanshan.

391
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:56,599
Yes.

392
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,959
Reinforce the guards
on the inner and outer city walls.

393
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,359
Be wary of people with suspicious behaviors.

394
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,959
I received your decree.

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
You should go too.

396
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
Thank you, Mother.

397
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,640
Give him only water for three days.

398
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,239
Let him have a taste

399
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,280
of what it is like to be in a famine.

400
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,479
What?

401
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,520
Are three days too short?

402
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,760
I won't dare complain.

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Leave.

404
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,040
Why are you looking at me like this?

405
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,400
If the Prince of Zheng was my own son,

406
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,880
I would punish him more severely.

407
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,160
All right.

408
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,359
I asked you to stay

409
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,760
because I want you to see

410
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,160
what is the current situation.

411
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,319
Try to be frugal in the palace.

412
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,479
In the future, we'll

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,319
have harder days in the capital.

414
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:26,760
Yes.

415
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:31,959
Your Majesty.

416
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Your Majesty.

417
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,160
I think

418
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,560
Le'an is an isolated city.

419
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,119
The Prince of Han rises in rebellion.

420
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,599
He must first capture Jinan.

421
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,719
I don't think so.

422
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,239
If I were the Prince of Han,

423
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,319
I'd militarily conquer Nanjing first

424
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,959
to control the Nanjing garrison

425
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,959
and the money and grain
in areas south of the Yangtze River.

426
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,599
The capital is bound to be in danger.

427
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:07,160
No.

428
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,040
Although Jinan is close,
it is easy to defend and difficult to attack.

429
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,760
If the Prince of Han was not certain of victory,

430
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,319
he wouldn't take the risk.

431
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,959
I have ordered Nanjing
to reinforce its garrison

432
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,040
and ordered Chen Xuan to guard Huaian.

433
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,959
So, he won't go south.

434
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,079
He'll only lie in wait for us in Le'an.

435
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,319
Because I've just ascended the throne,

436
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,199
he expects the public to be uneasy

437
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,920
and I won't dare to leave Beijing at will.

438
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,280
The military warriors

439
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,319
are mostly

440
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,479
his old subordinates and comrades-in-arms.

441
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,680
This time, when I go on the expedition,

442
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,959
the motley crowd that follows him

443
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,400
will surely be terrified.

444
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:40,760
Relay my decree.

445
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,640
The entire military will advance faster

446
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,479
and go straight to Le'an.

447
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,359
Yes.

448
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,239
Your Majesty.

449
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,040
In the war with Le'an,

450
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:19,680
what if the Prince of Han

451
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,000
abandons the city and goes south?

452
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
He has many old units there in Nanjing.

453
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,040
You should be on guard, Your Majesty.

454
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,199
Don't worry.

455
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,040
Let me think.

456
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,280
My beloved official,

457
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,599
you lose.

458
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,959
Your Majesty.

459
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,479
The fire has singed your eyebrows,

460
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,000
and you're in the mood to continue the weiqi game.

461
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,560
Yuan Qi.

462
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,839
Your Majesty.

463
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,719
Pour a bowl of chrysanthemum tea
for Official Mei

464
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,599
to cool down his heat.

465
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,119
Yes.

466
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,680
Get another pot of chrysanthemum tea.

467
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,640
Yes.

468
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,000
Eunuch Yuan.

469
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:08,640
You won't forget

470
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,319
the deal you made with the Prince of Han,
would you?

471
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,880
While you're talking and laughing, Your Majesty,
life and death decisions are made.

472
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,760
I lost.

473
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm utterly convinced.

474
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,239
Your Majesty,

475
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,599
were you testing me just now?

476
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,479
Yes.

477
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,199
I wish everyone around me

478
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,479
can stand the real test of fire.

479
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,079
Is Your Majesty worried

480
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,319
about the situation in the capital?

481
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,680
When I am not in the capital,

482
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,000
the Empress Dowager will find out

483
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,280
who she can truly trust and use

484
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,479
and be closed to.

485
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,920
I don't understand.

486
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,640
Concentrate on playing weiqi.

487
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:05,719
Another round.

488
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,839
Come on.

489
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,640
Stop.

490
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,560
[Chongwen Gate]

491
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,119
Go.

492
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,880
Next.

493
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,599
Line up.

494
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,400
Good. Go.

495
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,239
Hurry up.

496
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:23,760
Sir.

497
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,239
Come.

498
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,280
His Majesty is on the expedition.

499
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,760
The important ministers of the imperial court
go along to escort him.

500
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,079
Now, the garrison in the capital is empty.

501
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,560
It's a great opportunity to act.

502
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,520
But your injury...

503
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,839
If it is not for the recurrence of the old injury,

504
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
will I be staying in the capital?

505
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,719
Keep up.

506
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,520
Relax.

507
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:38,680
I won't die.

508
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,599
Those at the back, line up properly.

509
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,239
Send a letter to my foster father.

510
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,760
Tell him I am waiting for his arrival
in the capital.

511
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:46,719
Yes.

512
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,959
I opened the reserve warehouses,

513
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,959
but we still do not have enough grain.

514
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,119
I have to open the official warehouses too.

515
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,839
After Mother's decree was promulgated,

516
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,359
righteous people
from prosperous prefectures and counties

517
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,280
actively donated grain,

518
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,079
but we had little success.

519
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,959
It will take time for the grain
to be transported into the capital.

520
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,079
The Marquis of Guangping and the Marquis of Wu'an

521
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,479
are collecting grain around the capital.

522
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,479
When food is scarce,

523
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
those who have grain

524
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,119
will be afraid to take out their grain.

525
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,359
What about your second brother?

526
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,119
Second Brother went hungry for three days

527
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,239
and fell sick.

528
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:19,719
What happened?

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,319
His mother, Consort Dowager Li,

530
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,839
heard that there are many refugees
in the capital

531
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,760
and immediately took out her hairpins, rings,

532
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,439
and private savings.

533
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,280
How can he be weaker

534
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,000
than a woman in the palace?

535
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,680
Let's go check it out.

536
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,119
Your Majesty.

537
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,119
The gruel for disaster relief is so thin
that you can see through it.

538
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,760
It's given twice a day in the morning and evening.

539
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,319
Limited to three persons per household.

540
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,680
Those under five years old are not eligible.

541
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,640
People can't fill their stomachs.

542
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,359
They pick roots and wild vegetables
outside the city

543
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,119
and accidentally eat poisonous weeds.

544
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,079
They can't go on like this.

545
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,319
Can we get the physicians in the city

546
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,479
to teach the people
how to recognize wild vegetables?

547
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:18,680
Quick.

548
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,880
Send the children to the wards.

549
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes.

550
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,239
Come on.

551
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,479
Your Majesty.

552
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Your Majesty, are you alright?

553
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,719
When are you going to tell?

554
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,640
Her Majesty was busy
with government affairs for days.

555
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,000
She has a relapse of her old illness.

556
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,280
I persuaded her in every possible way,

557
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,719
but she won't rest.

558
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,560
Shut up.

559
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,239
I am unfilial.

560
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,359
I can't accomplish the duty
entrusted by my brother

561
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,439
and make Mother worry.

562
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:50,880
Your big brother

563
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,680
wants you to gain experience,

564
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,199
so he gave you the duty

565
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,280
of administering the country.

566
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,359
Why are you so useless?

567
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,079
Your Majesty,

568
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,959
take care of yourself.

569
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,439
Let's go back to the palace first.

570
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,280
Your Majesty,

571
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,160
return to the palace to recuperate peacefully.

572
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,239
Let the Prince of Xiang

573
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,719
handle the official business
according to his discretion.

574
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,160
Only report urgent matters

575
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,319
to Qingning Palace.

576
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,439
Externally,

577
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
we'll just say

578
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,319
Empress Dowager is going to pray
at the Imperial Ancestor Temple

579
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,239
for blessings and disaster aversion
for all the people.

580
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,359
I agree with Noble Consort Sun.

581
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,079
Mother.

582
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,239
Empress,

583
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
if I go back to the palace to recuperate

584
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,640
and hand everything here

585
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000
to you,

586
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,239
can you handle it?

587
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,119
I

588
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,880
will do my best to help the Prince of Xiang.

589
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,239
I'm afraid

590
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,040
I might let you down, Your Majesty.

591
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,319
We'll discuss it later.

592
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,640
Let's go ahead and take a look.

593
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,199
Go ahead with your work.

594
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,560
Let us go in.

595
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,199
Stop! Block them!

596
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,800
Let us go in.

597
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,760
Quick!

598
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,400
Block them quickly.

599
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,680
Don't let even one go.

600
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,680
Block them.

601
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,839
Those who take the lead to stir up trouble

602
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,439
will be arrested for interrogation.

603
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,479
Immediately send 200 more soldiers

604
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,479
to guard the city gates.

605
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:28,680
Yes.

606
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,119
Don't snatch.

607
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,560
Line up.

608
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,160
Stop fighting over it.

609
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,280
Are you alright, Your Majesty?

610
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,959
Bring Empress Dowager back to the palace.

611
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,800
Don't push.

612
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,000
Everyone will have a share.

613
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,439
Here. You can have it.

614
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,400
Line up over there.

615
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,319
Don't fight over it.

616
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,079
Get it here! Get it here!

617
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,280
Get in line, everyone.

618
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,599
Stop fighting.

619
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,839
Give me one.

620
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,680
Calm down.

621
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,079
Stop.

622
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,479
Stop.

623
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:03,719
Quick.

624
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,680
I checked Her Majesty's medical records.

625
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,680
Her gastric problem is related to her anxiety.

626
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,439
Additionally, she has bloody phlegm
in the morning.

627
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,439
She is often mentally tired.

628
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,800
Her left rib is painful on inhalation.

629
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,560
Can we change the original

630
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,359
decoction for nourishing qi and the stomach?

631
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,800
A decoction for nourishing qi
and saliva excretion would be more appropriate.

632
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,920
Your Majesty is correct.

633
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,560
That is also my intention.

634
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,839
Use longan meat as an added ingredient
for the medicine.

635
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,839
Yes.

636
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,920
According to the current situation,

637
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,199
Empress Dowager should rest quietly

638
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,920
and leave the government affairs

639
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,880
to the Prince of Xiang to handle
with plenary powers.

640
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,639
If you handle government affairs,

641
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,719
you can't take care of everything.

642
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,879
Leave the dispatch of staff

643
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,600
and refugee affairs to me.

644
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,719
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Sun is here.

645
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,760
Your Majesty.

646
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,679
These are troubled times.

647
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,879
We should

648
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,639
abandon our old hatreds and work together.

649
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,199
I understand. Go ahead and speak.

650
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,080
Yes.

651
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,320
Jin.

652
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:22,320
I've made an inventory of the gold,
silver, hairpins, and rings

653
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,520
donated by the imperial harem.

654
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,959
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

655
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,159
The capital has a food shortage,

656
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,679
but the luxurious clothes and sumptuous meals
in the palaces are absurd.

657
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,840
I recalculated

658
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,719
the expenditures of each palace.

659
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,040
The current status of Qingning Palace
can be maintained,

660
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,919
but other palaces can be more thrifty.

661
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,159
You may handle them
according to your discretion.

662
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,320
How are the wards now?

663
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,760
There are more

664
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
sick people in the city.

665
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,320
The Imperial Academy of Medicine
can't do anything.

666
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,760
The Prince of Xiang also has a headache.

667
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,120
The Imperial Academy of Medicine
has 13 departments.

668
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
It holds a major exam every three to five years

669
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:07,239
to select children
from families of medical practitioners.

670
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
My maternal grandfather used to say

671
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,959
that to become world-famous physicians,

672
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,679
it is necessary to travel all over the county

673
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
to accumulate medical skills
from thousands of cases.

674
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,879
You can't be a physician
without 10 years of hard work.

675
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,719
In terms of true skills and genuine knowledge,

676
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,520
Sheng Yin is the best
in the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

677
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,560
However, he went along with His Majesty.

678
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,159
In the Medicines Office,

679
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,360
there are useful people,

680
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,679
but Empress Dowager is sick again.

681
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,399
You and Gracious Consort He

682
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,840
will assist in handling the general affairs.

683
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,959
Let me go to the wards.

684
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,000
No.

685
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,439
Your Majesty's body is precious.

686
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,879
How can you take the risks?

687
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,959
Let the imperial physicians

688
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,520
return to the palace every day

689
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,800
to report to you.

690
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,199
I'm not that delicate.

691
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,399
Moreover,

692
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,639
there's no way I can give a prescription

693
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,639
without seeing the patients.

694
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:53,399
Your Majesty.

695
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:55,719
I must go.

696
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,199
My maternal grandfather

697
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
left me many ointment recipes

698
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,840
for treating intractable diseases.

699
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,719
I can definitely help.

700
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,719
Your Majesty, please don't.

701
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,159
Where is the book of recipes

702
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,679
that he left me?

703
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:09,840
Your Majesty!

704
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,199
Thank you.

705
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,199
Take care of the wounds.

706
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,879
When the war started,

707
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,639
the people who were affected fled.

708
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:25,959
There are more refugees

709
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:26,879
in the capital now.

710
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:28,360
Hasn't the Prince of Xiang

711
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,560
transferred grain from other localities?

712
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,320
Why aren't the grain transporting carts here?

713
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,639
After the Prince of Han rises in rebellion,

714
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,600
water transport vessels dare not go north.

715
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,320
Shanxi and other places are far away.

716
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,719
It won't be delivered for a while.

717
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,639
For the time being,
we can't place our hopes on them.

718
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,199
Except for what is necessary,
take all the flocks and herds

719
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
at the Directorate of Imperial Parks

720
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,840
and fruits and vegetables

721
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,159
and exchange them for grain,

722
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,199
and bring the grain here.

723
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,159
But...

724
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,280
Go ahead and do that.

725
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:54,719
I'll take responsibility.

726
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:55,679
Yes.

727
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,560
Empress Dowager issued an edict

728
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:01,600
allowing young and strong refugees
to work for food.

729
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,040
However, we do not have enough placements
for repairing

730
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,879
the city walls of official residences alone.

731
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,439
Go to the capital

732
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,280
and visit the rich businesses, temples,

733
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,360
and official warehouses.

734
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,679
Inform them

735
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,520
that those who provide
food and lodging to the victims

736
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,959
will be allowed to recruit workers
for reconstruction.

737
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,159
Yes.

738
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,159
During the times of the ancestors,

739
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,280
part of the Imperial Forbidden Garden
was opened

740
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:21,360
to allow people to hunt animals
and pick wild plants.

741
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,879
Now,

742
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,560
handle this according to old customs.

743
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:25,639
Yes.

744
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,120
Let's go to the streets ahead.

745
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,840
Rice prices are up again!

746
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,919
What are you shouting about?

747
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,320
[Three guan per dan rice]
This is the price for today's rice.

748
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,879
How can you jack up the price randomly?

749
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:43,679
Up to you to buy or not.

750
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,879
How can a consort watch these?

751
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,399
I can't take it anymore.

752
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,679
The common people can endure anything,

753
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,479
except for hunger.

754
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,000
When they become desperate,

755
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,239
they'll go to barracks, government offices,

756
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,479
and even the Imperial City.

757
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,600
No one will recognize

758
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,120
whether you are an imperial consort
or an ordinary womenfolk.

759
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,840
Is it that serious?

760
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,000
What should we do?

761
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
Dispatch someone quickly

762
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,000
to go to directly affiliated prefectures
and counties that are rich and populous.

763
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,919
Spread the news,

764
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,399
saying that

765
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,679
the price of grain per dan
in the capital has risen to four guan.

766
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,239
Go.

767
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,679
Yes.

768
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,639
You have a black heart.

769
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,760
What are you doing?

770
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,600
Businessmen seek profits.

771
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,159
When they hear that the price of grain is high,

772
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,159
they will send grain to the capital
against all odds.

773
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,320
Wealthy businessmen with extra grains

774
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,479
will also actively sell grains.

775
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,120
However...

776
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,159
What?

777
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,399
By right, when the Prince of Xiang
issued an urgent decree,

778
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,399
grain transporting carts from all prefectures

779
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,679
would enter the capital urgently.

780
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:43,399
I hope nothing

781
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,399
has happened to them on the way.

782
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,239
Let's go.

783
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,159
We will

784
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,600
take a look at where the sick are housed.

785
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:53,679
Slow down. Slow down.

786
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,120
Here. Carry the water over.

787
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,679
How can Her Majesty

788
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,159
come to such a place?

789
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,760
Physician,

790
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,399
my child

791
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,639
was bitten by an unknown poisonous insect.

792
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,040
-I'll take a look.
-Please examine her quickly.

793
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,800
Huaping, get water.

794
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,399
Yes.

795
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,560
Your Majesty.

796
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,560
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Sun is here.

797
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,120
Thank you, physician.

798
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,199
Empress Dowager refused to eat?

799
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,560
Yes.

800
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,600
Is the meal you delivered

801
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,560
not to her taste?

802
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,360
Your Highness,

803
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,679
the imperial physician said
that Empress Dowager should eat porridge.

804
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,520
For days

805
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,800
we changed from duck porridge
to barley porridge.

806
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,919
Today...

807
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,560
we served porridge
with bird's nest and chicken soup,

808
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,120
but it still didn't suit her appetite.

809

810
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,719

Your Majesty.

00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:46,879
Your Majesty.

813
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,120
From now on,

814
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,879
I will send the food

815
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:50,840
from

816
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,439
the porridge kitchens to Qingning Palace.

817
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,360
Your Majesty, please rest and don't worry.

Your Majesty

is worried about

822
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,080
the refugees.

823
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,439
I did not notice that.

824
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,919
Your Majesty,

825
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,239
if you are worried about grain,

826
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,520
I know what to do.

827
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,679
Manager Fang,

828
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,479
what do you want us to see?

829
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,439
Give it to me.

830
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:22,919
Yes.

831
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,399
What are they doing?

832
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,760
What are they doing?

833
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,560
Be careful.

834
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,080
Here.

835
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:14,399
This is...

836
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,600
(At first, we felt it was a pity to waste.)

837
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:23,399
(Matron Meng led palace maids to store them,)

838
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,080
(but they collected more and more.)

839
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,120
(People who took part)

840
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,679
(were hand-picked by Matron Meng.)

842
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,360
(Then, I taught the others.)

843
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,199
(We pounded washed and steamed radish)

844
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,439
(with glutinous rice into a puree)

845
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,879
(and cast them into bricks.)

846
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,800
(After they were dried naturally in the air,)

847
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,639
(they became solid bricks.)

848
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,320
(We piled them up piece by piece.)
