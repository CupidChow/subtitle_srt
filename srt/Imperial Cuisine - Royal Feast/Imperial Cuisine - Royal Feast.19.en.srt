00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Crown Princess, let me do it.

4
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,440
You're too slow.

5
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,360
I can do it better.

6
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,520
Your Highness, Miss Yao...

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,320
Didn't I say not to mention her again?

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,360
Get out.

9
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,559
Yes.

10
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,759
Your Highness.

11
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,279
I'm fine.

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
Are you worried about Prince of Wei's illness?

13
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,119
The entire Imperial Academy of Medicine
is there.

14
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,960
Nothing will happen.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
Don't worry too much.

16
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Zijin,

17
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,759
to save Matron Meng and Yin Ziping,

18
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,720
you accepted flogging as a punishment.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,199
Is it worth it?

20
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,880
I do whatever is needed

21
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,880
to save those who deserve to be saved.

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,119
I'm willing to accept

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
the consequences.

24
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,800
It's not about whether it is worth it.

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,600
The Palace Surveillance's
heavy sticks are awful.

26
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,559
I told them just now

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
that Her Majesty doesn't want to see you anymore.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Can you take this?

29
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,720
It's not too late for you to repent.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,559
I will ask Her Majesty to banish you
from the palace

31
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,399
and save your life.

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,479
Didn't you send the eunuch to commit the murder?

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,119
By a strange turn of events, I survived.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
Under the circumstances,

35
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,679
you can say what is on your mind already.

36
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,520
I don't want to watch you die,

37
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,919
but

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,919
this is fate.

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
What is the count?

40
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,040
Only six.

41
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,959
You can't take it already.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Four more

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,040
and you will depart this world.

44
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,440
Bow your head, beg for mercy,

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and say you're wrong,

46
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,480
and you will survive

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
this punishment.

48
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Sir,

49
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,320
what is my offense?

50
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,399
You're sensible

51
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,480
and can see through the evil of human nature,

52
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,799
but you still sacrifice yourself to save others.

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,119
Isn't that wrong?

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
If you don't turn around,

55
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,200
even if I save you once,

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
you will make similar mistakes again.

57
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,799
I don't save people who have a death wish.

58
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:41,920
Continue.

59
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,160
You don't know what's good for yourself.

60
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,600
Sir,

61
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,279
she looks soft,

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,519
but she is arrogant.

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,079
Sir,

64
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,119
she won't listen. Let her die.

65
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,119
Why bother?

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Suicidal.

67
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,640
I repeatedly warned you.

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,399
Why didn't you listen to my advice?

69
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,559
Sir.

70
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,640
Stop.

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,760
Miss, just say it,

72
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,200
and His Highness will naturally save you.

73
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,079
Thank you for your kindness.

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
There are two more.

75
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,160
I can take them.

76
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
You don't have to ask for mercy.

77
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,920
Just raise your head and look at His Highness.

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Succumb to him.

79
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,399
Your Highness, this...

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Continue.

81
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,519
Continue.

82
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,079
[Ji Lan, Manager of Medicines]
Your Highness, I've given Table Maid Yao medicine.

83
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Manager of Medicines Ji,

84
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,479
prepare the daily decoction

85
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,799
yourself

86
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
and send it to the Imperial Food Service.

87
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes.

88
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
(I don't want to be your concubine,)

89
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,039
(and I don't want to live for you forever,)

90
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,840
(much less a puppet on the string.)

91
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,400
Your Highness,

92
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,280
why did you help her but won't reveal yourself?

93
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,479
Your Highness would be losing face.

94
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
This is about the Prince of Wei.

95
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
I'll get to the bottom of this.

96
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,679
Her life and death do not concern me.

97
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,679
That's true, Your Highness.

98
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Did you find the person?

99
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,039
I've sent someone to get him.

100
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,039
(Father,)

101
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,159
(don't let your son down)

102
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,119
(again.)

103
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,640
You're awake.

104
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Let me help you up.

105
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,320
Help her out.

106
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,679
Yes.

107
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,000
Come on.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
I'll hold you.

109
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,640
Thank you.

110
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

111
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,919
Do you remember what I said to you?

112
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,039
I remember it forever.

113
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Why did you appeal for others

114
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,320
and endure so much pain?

115
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Your Majesty,

116
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,159
they are not other people,

117
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,239
but the matron who taught me how to cook

118
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,880
and my best friend.

119
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,359
How can you appeal

120
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,119
without any evidence?

121
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,599
Your Majesty,

122
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,719
I was not in the kitchen
when the food was prepared,

123
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,679
but I know

124
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,760
that from choosing the dishes to preparing them,

125
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,799
the Imperial Food Service has strict rules.

126
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,559
This mistake would not be made.

127
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,719
Her Majesty wants evidence.

128
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,440
I have no evidence.

129
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,159
Your Majesty,

130
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,000
I have an important thing
to report to you personally.

131
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,280
Regardless of how the Prince of Wei fell sick,

132
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,840
Your Majesty will be implicated.

133
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,039
Why is that?

134
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,880
During the meal preparation,

135
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,119
Your Majesty sent someone to the kitchen.

136
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,599
Who are you referring to?

137
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,440
Your Majesty, you know.

138
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,440
You don't have to ask me.

139
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,919
How dare you?

140
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,440
Your Majesty,

141
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
the past event is still vivid.

142
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,080
You are the ruler.

143
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,919
Of course, she won't blame you.

144
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,799
She directed all her hatred

145
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,440
on me.

146
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,039
She could've

147
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,000
targeted me.

148
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,359
Shan...

149
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
Shan is just a child.

150
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,599
How could she be so cruel?

151
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,200
Who did Nobel Consort Guo

152
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,080
accuse of targeting the Prince of Wei?

153
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
Your Majesty, I deserve to die.

154
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
I couldn't stop Her Majesty.

155
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,000
If you have doubts,

156
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,200
you can confront me.

157
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,880
Your Majesty,

158
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,359
how is the Prince of Wei?

159
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,159
What did imperial physicians say?

160
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,239
When will he wake up?

161
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,359
Don't touch him.

162
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,559
Your Majesty,

163
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,520
some time ago,

164
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,799
I listened to others

165
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,200
and nearly caused a disaster.

166
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,080
Later, I repeatedly begged you for forgiveness.

167
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,880
Even if you are resentful,

168
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,119
you should consider His Majesty also.

169
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,039
Your Majesty,

170
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,840
the noble consort has no evidence
and is making assumptions,

171
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,559
but you believe her totally.

172
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Your Majesty.

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,039
Summon Imperial Physician Sheng.

174
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,679
The quack doctor Sheng Yin
repeatedly broke prohibitions.

175
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
I've fired him.

176
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,080
Don't mention him again.

177
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:15,679
Your Majesty,

178
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,719
would you rather trust a bunch of quack doctors

179
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,039
and fire the man who saved your wife?

180
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,599
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess are here.

181
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,960
Father.

182
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Sheng Yin is not far from Beijing.

183
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,599
I've ordered him to return to Beijing urgently

184
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,760
to diagnose and treat Shan.

185
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,000
Zhu Zhanji.

186
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,840
You are so unruly!

187
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,599
Your Majesty, please allow your daughter-in-law
to take the Prince's pulse.

188
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,119
Go.

189
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,760
You...

190
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,280
What are you doing?

191
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,679
Don't touch my son.

192
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Your Majesty.

193
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,679
Zhu Zhanji,

194
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,640
are you going to kill your brother?

195
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,599
Your Highness,

196
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,679
the Imperial Academy of Medicine has concluded

197
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,200
that the Prince of Wei is unconscious

198
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
because he was poisoned.

199
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,919
Why must you anger His majesty again?

200
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,119
Father,

201
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,679
Shan is not you.

202
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm not my second uncle either.

203
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,039
You...

204
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,159
Shan is my own brother.

205
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
I won't let anyone hurt him.

206
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,760
What do you mean?

207
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm Shan's birth mother.

208
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,200
Will I harm him?

209
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,280
Your Majesty,

210
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,080
the Prince of Wei wasn't poisoned.

211
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,000
He developed subcutaneous ulcers on his back
because of exopathogenic wind and damp fire.

212
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,080
What nonsense is that?

213
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,080
Just now, Administrative Assistant Dai said

214
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,599
that the Prince of Wei ate

215
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,799
uncleaned algae.

216
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,679
Are you sure?

217
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Men!

218
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,880
Arrest Administrative Assistant Dai
and interrogate him.

219
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes.

220
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,919
Zhu Zhanji.

221
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
How dare you give orders when I'm here?

222
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,599
Father.

223
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,959
The ulcers can be fatal.

224
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Even if Administrative Assistant Dai
can't see well,

225
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,479
he can still diagnose,

226
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,400
unless someone deliberately
hid Shan's condition.

227
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,239
You...

228
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,959
Your Majesty, he...

229
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,719
Father,

230
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,560
Administrative Assistant Dai deceived
his superiors and subordinates.

231
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,040
You're wise

232
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,599
and would know what's at stake,

233
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
but you listened to one party only.

234
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Your Majesty!

235
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,599
You mustn't believe this slander.

236
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,560
The ulcers can kill the child,

237
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,280
but you're still arguing!

238
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,599
Guo, are you worthy of being a mother?

239
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,439
I...

240
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,119
Father, I'll take Shan away.

241
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,599
He'll recuperate in my palace.

242
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,439
As for the noble consort,

243
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,920
she is yours.

244
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,539
I will not interfere.

245
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,680
Shan.

246
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,359
Come on.

247
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,319
Get up.

248
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:11,920
Shan.

249
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Shan!

250
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,560
Your Majesty!

251
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,599
Your Majesty!

252
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,479
Your Majesty!

253
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,560
Your Majesty!

254
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,479
Go away!

255
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,239
Shan!

256
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,199
Shan!

257
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,119
Here.

258
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:34,640
Your Highness!

259
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Get out.

260
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
I want to know her secret now.

261
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,400
Quack doctor.

262
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,560
You fear pulse-taking.

263
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,560
Why didn't you tell me what happened?

264
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,839
Your Highness,

265
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm wrong.

266
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:02,959
Forgive me.

267
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
Alright. I know.

268
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,800
What have I done?

269
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,439
Why does Her Majesty refuse to see me?

270
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,959
Do you know

271
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,400
that Yao Zijin met Her Majesty that day?

272
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,719
What did she say?

273
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,079
She said

274
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,280
Her Majesty would be implicated.

275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,560
What else?

276
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:46,839
On the day of the incident,

277
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,719
Matron Hu said that the algae were poisonous

278
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,880
and that gave rise to a lot of disputes.

279
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,199
It was a misunderstanding.

280
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,880
I didn't expect

281
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,280
Noble Consort Guo to blame Her Majesty

282
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,680
for the Prince of Wei's illness.

283
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,000
You did your best to attack dissenters,

284
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,280
but you implicated your mistress. Stupid.

285
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,920
Her Majesty

286
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,439
ordered you to kneel here

287
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,319
until dawn

288
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,079
for talking too much.

289
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Manager of Medicines Ji,

290
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,959
where are Ziping and the rest?

291
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Aren't they back?

292
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,839
You wake up after sleeping for two days.

293
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,400
Don't worry.

294
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,839
It was proven that His Highness has ulcers

295
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,719
and was not poisoned.

296
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,119
They'll be back soon.

297
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,319
Table Maid Yao.

298
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,560
Table Maid Yao.

299
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
The Crown Princess ordered you to deliver a meal.

300
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,599
Your Highness,

301
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,079
I've delivered your meal as ordered.

302
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,199
Do you know why I punish you?

303
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,359
You warned Her Majesty.

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,680
Superficially, you reminded Her Majesty.

305
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,680
In reality, you were exonerating
the Imperial Food Service,

306
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,479
but why did you say the second sentence?

307
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,839
Matron Hu

308
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,640
was only rejected by Her Majesty.

309
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,199
So,

310
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,880
I

311
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,800
made you kneel for an hour only.

312
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,920
All right.

313
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
You can go now.

314
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,439
I won

315
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,760
this round after all.

316
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,640
Zijin.

317
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm fine.

318
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,479
I want to go in and take a rest.

319
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
You're hurt.

320
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,160
Don't deny it.

321
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,199
I saw it.

322
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,119
Stick your hand out.

323
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Let me see.

324
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,599
What?

325
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
Stick your hand out.

326
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,280
Where are the injuries?

327
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:06,880
On the legs?

328
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,439
I said I'm fine. Stand up.

329
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,719
Let me take a look. Hurry up.

330
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,439
Why did you petition to Her Majesty?

331
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,839
Can you withstand flogging

332
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,199
by the Palace Surveillance?

333
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,640
Do you know...

334
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,239
Do you know that you almost died?

335
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,680
Alright.

336
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,199
Don't cry.

337
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,439
Look.

338
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,119
I'm still alive.

339
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,439
Her Majesty won't kill me yet.

340
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,839
Who is it?

341
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,239
Come back. Come back.

342
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,760
Don't cry.

343
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,359
I'm not crying.

344
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,599
Aren't you?

345
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,800
When I returned, I heard
that you went to Qingning Palace.

346
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
Why are you so stupid?

347
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,839
Why did you give up the Crown Prince?

348
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,599
You sympathize with others,

349
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,880
but what about yourself?

350
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,680
All right.

351
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,920
You look ugly when you cry.

352
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,760
Ziping,

353
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
we're all pitiful people

354
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,359
and we have to jostle against each other.

355
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,680
Isn't that lamentable?

356
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,040
I only yield once.

357
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Just this once.

358
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,000
Alright?

359
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,359
Alright. Don't cry.

360
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,760
Your Highness!

361
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,359
-Step aside.
-You're not fine.

362
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:16,760
Please be good.

363
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,439
Step aside.

364
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,479
Don't get out of your bed.

365
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,560
Please listen to us. Please.

366
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,520
Your Highness.

367
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
You'll be fine soon,

368
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,319
but don't get out of bed yet.

369
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,319
Your Highness!

370
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,760
Zhanshan, what are you up to?

371
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,199
I was sick for so long.

372
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,040
Why didn't my mother visit me?

373
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,239
I want my mother!

374
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,760
I want to go back now.

375
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,040
Don't be naughty.

376
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:35,719
Get back.

377
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,439
Imperial Physician Sheng, thank you.

378
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,040
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

379
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
It's part of my job.

380
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:58,280
Imperial Physician Sheng, may I ask you about
the prescription for the Prince of Wei

381
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,319
for two days?

382
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,040
Yes.

383
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,439
Shan.

384
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,439
Don't be mischievous.

385
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,920
Big Brother, is my mother a bad woman?

386
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,439
Who said that?

387
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,520
Everyone says she's a bad woman.

388
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,040
To frame Her Majesty,

389
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,160
she put my life at risk.

390
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,719
Is that true?

391
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,319
My father is angry now

392
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,119
and even he doesn't want me either.

393
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,199
He won't visit me.

394
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,439
He came earlier

395
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,319
when you were asleep,

396
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,640
but he has an urgent meeting now.

397
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,239
Your mother

398
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
went to the temple

399
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,800
to pray for you when you were very sick.

400
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,719
That was why she wasn't here.

401
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,400
Is that true?

402
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,400
When you recover,

403
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,800
you'll know the truth.

404
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,199
However,

405
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,800
if you are disobedient,

406
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll be angry.

407
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,920
Big Brother, after I recover,

408
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,560
don't forget what you promised me.

409
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I want to release the falcon

410
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,800
and hunt.

411
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,800
However...

412
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:06,800
Don't worry.

413
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,800
I will find the best physician

414
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,719
to heal you.

415
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,920
When you recover,

416
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,719
I will take you hunting.

417
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:26,680
Your Highness, there's nothing I can do.

418
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,800
He made a fuss and wouldn't eat.

419
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
He kept asking what had happened.

420
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,680
I...

421
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
I couldn't do anything.

422
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,959
Your Highness, I won't dare next time.

423
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,920
Your Highness,
there are too many rumors in the palace.

424
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,920
If someone deliberately sows discord,

425
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,239
people will misunderstand Her Majesty and you.

426
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
It's better to tell the truth earlier

427
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,040
so as not to hurt fraternal ties.

428
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,560
Even if Noble Consort Guo was wrong,

429
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
she is also Shan's mother.

430
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,920
How can you say those things to a kid?

431
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:57,920
Even so,

432
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,800
I should be the one to tell him when he is well.

433
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,680
How could you decide?

434
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,319
Your Highness, I was wrong.

435
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
I won't repeat it.

436
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Your Highness, I won't dare.

437
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,239
I was wrong.

438
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,319
Leave me. You won't be needed in the future.

439
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,800
Your Highness, I've served you
since the age of six.

440
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:18,920
You are my heaven.

441
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,880
Where could I go?

442
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,319
After I leave you,

443
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,520
I don't have a speck of land.

444
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,199
I was wrong. I was wrong.

445
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,479
I won't do it again.

446
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,359
-I won't.
-Your Highness.

447
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,119
Yuan Qi was wrong, but he did it

448
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,959
for you.

449
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,280
On my behalf, please forgive him.

450
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,319
Yuan Qi,

451
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,319
watch your words and actions. Don't do it again.

452
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,760
I won't.

453
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,920
If I do it again,

454
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,040
cut off my tongue.

455
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,479
Go and take 40 times of flogging.

456
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,479
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you.

457
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,239
Get up.

458
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,160
I'll always remember your great kindness,
Your Highness.

459
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,599
Come on.

460
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:17,719
That's right.

461
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,560
Shan.

462
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,479
From now on,

463
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,359
Yao Zijin is officially promoted to manager.

464
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,280
Yin Ziping will assume the post of table maid.

465
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,760
Do your job properly.

466
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,439
Yes.

467
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,800
Hanying,

468
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,120
let me see Matron Meng.

469
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't transfer me.

470
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
I don't want to go
to the Directorate of Imperial Parks.

471
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,040
Matron Meng, please don't expel me.

472
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,959
Please, Matron Meng. Matron Meng!

473
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,719
Please, Matron Meng!

474
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,679
Please.

475
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,760
Please intercede.

476
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,840
Please help me. Help me.

477
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Matron Meng,

478
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,000
what did Manager Wen do

479
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,040
to deserve this?

480
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,679
Rewards for meritorious deeds
and punishments for demerits.

481
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,120
In the future, only I

482
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
will determine merits and demerits here.

483
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,959
Do you all understand?

484
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,600
Yes.

485
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,800
Matron Meng is domineering

486
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,120
and expelled Wen Yantao without justification.

487
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,360
Anyone who pleads on her behalf

488
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,919
will not end up well.

489
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,080
Alright.

490
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,959
Wen Yantao was eager for quick success.

491
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,520
When Matron Meng met with a misfortune,

492
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
she made life hard for the matron.

493
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,479
Maybe it's a good thing

494
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,360
that she is transferred.

495
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,280
Matron Hu has lost the support of Her Majesty.

496
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,080
She lost her biggest backer.

497
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,879
Those who take refuge in her

498
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,840
will be reprimanded one by one.

499
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,040
Guess

500
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,959
who will be the next one to be expelled?

501
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,520
All right.

502
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,879
Zijin, I'm finally a table maid.

503
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm a table maid! I'm a table maid!

504
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm a table maid!

505
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,760
I've reached this point.

506
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
Why didn't you look for another backer?

507
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,000
If it weren't for Meng,

508
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,800
my master wouldn't be banished from the palace.

509
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,040
I won't seek protection from the enemy.

510
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,199
Besides, it's not over yet.

511
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,399
Don't be so discouraged.

512
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,719
Do you want to watch

513
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,879
the Imperial Food Service
fall into Meng's hands again?

514
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,360
Under the circumstances,

515
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,800
you should wait for another chance.

516
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,399
Your Highness, your meal is ready.

517
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,639
Her Majesty was involved

518
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,479
and I didn't want to rescue you.

519
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,320
How could you

520
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,040
not be resentful in front of

521
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,800
me?

522
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,199
Your Highness, please eat.

523
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,199
Answer me.

524
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,439
Your Highness did not truly put your trust in me.

525
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,000
That was why you were defeated so easily.

526
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,159
What's the use of feeling sad now?

527
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:44,439
You should plan a comeback.

528
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:48,000
Administrative Assistant Dai
has been imprisoned.

529
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
The real disaster

530
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,879
is right in front of my eyes.

531
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,399
Your Highness.

532
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,639
Do your best to fight back
instead of waiting for your doom.

533
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,439
If you are willing to truly trust me,

534
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,120
I'll help you through the crisis.

535
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,439
[Foods Office]
The Prince of Wei has regained his health,

536
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,639
but he is still lethargic and has no appetite.

537
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,080
The Crown Prince is very worried

538
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,840
and ordered everyone
in the Imperial Food Service to do their best.

539
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,080
We must make the Prince of Wei eat like normal.

540
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,040
Yes.

541
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
Everyone heard

542
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,280
Matron Meng's instruction.

543
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
Do what we can

544
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,520
to coax the Prince of Wei to eat.

545
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,959
If we succeed, the Eastern Palace will reward us.

546
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,719
If not, the Imperial Food Service
will be punished.

547
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,919
Go quickly.

548
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes.

549
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,959
Yukuai, help me get that...

550
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,120
Manager Yao.

551
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,800
What meal are you preparing for the Prince of Wei?

552
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,080
Can I help you?

553
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,719
No, thank you.

554
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,719
Since I've decided to stay
in the Imperial Food Service,

555
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,120
we have to compete with each other.

556
00:39:58,959 --> 00:39:59,959
Do you know

557
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,040
that I have helped in kitchens since five?

558
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,080
I practiced day and night.

559
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
Can you compete with me?

560
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,120
I want to be a great chef

561
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,000
and let the world see the beauty of Chinese food.

562
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm doing what I want.

563
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Famous cooks in the Forbidden City,

564
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,439
the female cooks in wealthy families,

565
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,120
street food,

566
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,919

that chrysanthemum in Pu'er
