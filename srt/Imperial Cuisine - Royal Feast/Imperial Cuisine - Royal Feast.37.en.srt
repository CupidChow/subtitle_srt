00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,919
You explained it in such a sensible manner.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
Who taught you to say that?

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,080
I have had an unfortunate fate since young,

7
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,839
where I've experienced warmth
and hostility of the world.

8
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,199
Only Noble Consort Sun treated me sincerely,

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,040
which had melted my heart filled with hostility.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,080
Her Highness ordered me

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,199
to prepare meals

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,480
and collect the world's stories on food

13
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
to make the Empress happy.

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,239
If someone only does it

15
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,400
to have a good reputation,

16
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,399
there's no need to go this far.

17
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,080
If His Majesty punishes the innocent Empress

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
because of a misunderstanding,

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,720
won't Noble Consort Sun's painstaking effort

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,440
be ruined in an instant?

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,399
So I'm saying all these

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,160
to speak up for the Empress

23
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,000
and plead on Noble Consort Sun's behalf.

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,600
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,199
don't believe what she said.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
She'll speak the truth

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,160
as long as we throw her into prison

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,000
and interrogate her.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,119
I'm only reporting the truth.

30
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,559
Please judge this fairly, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,000
Directress Yin is related to this incident.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,119
We mustn't let her have her way.

33
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,880
We'll discuss this matter later.

34
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,440
Just leave for now.

35
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,440
Directress Yin,

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,320
you sure have a gift at speaking.

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,639
You could come up with such an explanation

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,880
in such a short time.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
Not only did you redeem yourself,

41
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,240
but you had also

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,479
cleared Noble Consort Sun of suspicion.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,160
If I may be bold to say this.

44
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,320
You've always

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,839
followed and waited upon the Empress.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
Now she's been confined,

47
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,320
I don't see you visit her at all.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
Who are you planning to frame

49
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,720
by going to Qingning Palace anxiously?

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
Have a pleasant day, Lady of Bright Deportment Wu.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,225
[Qingning Gate]

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Directress Yin.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Directress Yin, I...

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,199
Directress Yin.

55
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,479
That day, I saw...

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Things are always hectic
at the Imperial Food Service.

57
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,720
So I didn't think much of it.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,399
But something happened after that.

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,480
Directress Yin,

60
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,600
do you think Directress Su...

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,519
I'm aware of this.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
Don't tell anyone about this.

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,079
But Directress Yin...

64
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,959
You can go now.

65
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, Directress Yin.

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,559
Your Majesty!

67
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,320
Your Majesty, His Majesty is here.

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,480
His Majesty is here to see you.

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,959
Didn't you make a scene wanting to see me?

70
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:17,880
Here I am.

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,799
What exactly do you want?

72
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,040
You finally thought of me.

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,239
Is she still alive?

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,119
You confined me here.

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
I should be the one asking.

76
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,799
What else do you want?

77
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,880
Depose me?

78
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,359
Summon the imperial physician
to check on the Empress.

79
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,480
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-I'm not ill.

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I'll be here

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
waiting for you to depose me from my position.

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,559
Didn't you wait a long time

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,559
for this day to come?

84
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,320
Ever since Lady Sun entered the palace...

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,079
No.

86
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,519
It wasn't then.

87
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,839
You must have detested me

88
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,880
before that.

89
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,200
You've always disliked people playing tricks.

90
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,040
You're even tired of officials' reports

91
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,320
on auspicious omens.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,320
But look at me.

93
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,640
Do I look like a person

94
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,040
from head to toe?

95
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:37,880
No.

96
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,279
I'm not a person.

97
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,119
I'm only

98
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,119
an auspicious object created by the Hu family.

99
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,559
I'm an exquisite tribute

100
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,880
sent to the royal family.

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,119
But you must admit

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,600
that I'm not of no use at all.

103
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,480
Do you know what you're saying?

104
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,359
Did I say something wrong?

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,200
Your birth

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,359
brought Yongle Emperor an auspicious dream.

107
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
As supposed to be the grandson

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
who'll prosper forever.

109
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,079
With you,

110
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,799
Yongle Emperor managed to achieve his ambition.

111
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,359
Naturally, the wife
of the Great Imperial Grandson

112
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,559
shouldn't be someone of the ordinary.

113
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,200
Such an auspicious object like me

114
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,119
shouldn't be among the people.

115
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,359
It must be

116
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,880
in the Forbidden City.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,480
Am I right?

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,359
You hate auspicious objects.

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,040
You even hate

120
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
to have an arranged fate.

121
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,799
What about me?

122
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,440
What did I do wrong?

123
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Is it because I'm an unfilial daughter-in-law,

124
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,239
not a virtuous wife,

125
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,119
or didn't give birth to a prince?

126
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,880
But she has none too.

127
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,239
No one in the imperial harem

128
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,200
has any sons either.

129
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,799
Empress,

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,799
I've given you my trust

131
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,000
all these years.

132
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,640
I had

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
high expectations from you.

134
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,600
But how did you repay me

135
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
again and again?

136
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:26,839
You lied.

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,519
You've already fed up with me.

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
You're scared.

139
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,880
Scared of what?

140
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,359
Yes,

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
you're the Emperor.

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,960
There's nothing you're scared of doing

143
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
or can't do,

144
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,479
except for that one thing.

145
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,119
What is it?

146
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,119
You love your brother dearly.

147
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,119
You wanted to spare Noble Consort Guo.

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
But there are ancestral instructions
of the Great Ming to follow.

149
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,359
The person who ordered her to sacrifice herself

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,799
is the present Empress Dowager.

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,119
The mother whom you respect the most.

152
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,159
When you saw

153
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,400
what had happened to Noble Consort Guo,

154
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,159
you're worried

155
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
and scared.

156
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,119
You're worried

157
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,400
that I'll also order

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
the person you love to die with you.

159
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:19,760
Am I right?

160
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,799
Would you?

161
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,400
You won't be able to wait for that day.

162
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
We have the Great Ming's ancestral instructions.

163
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,200
Empress Dowager will be watching.

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
The people of the world

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,799
and the civil and military officials
will be watching.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
You won't be able

167
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
to depose the Empress.

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,719
You can try

169
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,599
if you don't believe me.

170
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:17,919
Your Majesty,

171
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,320
deposing the Empress will shake
the empire's foundation.

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
It also concerns

173
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,719
Your Majesty's name in history.

174
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,679
Your Majesty, you must be prudent!

175
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,880
Your Majesty!

176
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

177
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,599
Greetings, Your Majesty!

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,520
All rise.

179
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,559
Thank you, Your Majesty.

180
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,039
There you are, Mother.

181
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,119
Both of you can leave.

182
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,039
What are you up to?

183
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,239
[Qianqing Palace]

184
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,799
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,760
Your Majesty.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Even if the Empress has done something wrong,

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,280
she mustn't be deposed this easily.

188
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,679
You must dissuade His Majesty

189
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
from making a big mistake.

190
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
That's right, Your Majesty.

191
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,479
Don't let His Majesty depose the Empress.

192
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,919
There will be an uproar

193
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,039
among the court and the people

194
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,440
if this matter gets out.

195
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,359
Your Majesty, you have

196
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,000
to persuade His Majesty.

197
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,640
His Majesty has long to do this.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
We're only his subjects.

199
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,479
How can we stop him?

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,960
Sirs,

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,599
let's not make it difficult for Empress Dowager.

202
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,320
If His Majesty does something wrong,

203
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,280
it's our responsibility as ministers
to dissuade him.

204
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
You don't hesitate to flatter the Emperor

205
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,200
for your own glory.

206
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,799
You're not worthy of being a minister!

207
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,880
Let alone a person!

208
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,400
Official Zhang,

209
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,200
watch what you're saying.

210
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,039
Watch what I say?

211
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm even going to hit you.

212
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
How dare you try to flatter the Emperor!

213
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,080
Empress Dowager is present.

214
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
How dare you behave impertinently!

215
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,559
We were out of line.

216
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,840
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,640
All of you are important ministers
of the imperial court

218
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,559
whom His Majesty trusts.

219
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,039
How would I not know of your concerns?

220
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,559
It's just that His Majesty has already decided.

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,239
He won't even heed my words anymore.

222
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,000
All of you should return and discuss

223
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,080
the way to help the Empress.

224
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,520
His Majesty is a filial son.

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
How could he not heed your advice?

226
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,080
Your Majesty,

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,520
you must intervene.

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,239
Please rise.

229
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:57,679
Your...

230
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,039
Your Majesty.

232
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,679
Your Majesty.

233
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,359
Your Majesty! Your Majesty,

234
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,640
you must intervene!

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,599
It's hard to believe

236
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,320
that such an absurd matter

237
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,640
will ruin His Majesty's reputation.

238
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,400
No.

239
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
We can't sit by and do nothing.

240
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,440
We'll call everyone together
and discuss this matter.

241
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,919
Sirs, you can leave the palace now.

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,320
Sirs,

243
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,679
please.

244
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,200
Let's go.

245
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,440
Is this really happening?

246
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,239
Is His Majesty deposing the Empress?

247
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,520
This incident

248
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,799
had never happened in the Great Ming before.

249
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:46,875
[Foods Office]

250
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,559
You can't enter.

251
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,840
Guards!

252
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,799
Guards! You can't go in!

253
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,559
Let her in.

254
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,239
Directress Su,

255
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,000
what makes you barge

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,679
into my chamber regardless
of your position with such a gloomy look?

257
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,479
Noble Consort Sun is still alive.

258
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,280
If the Empress is deposed,

259
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
she's likely to be the Empress.

260
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,239
Perhaps it's not her time to die yet.

261
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,200
It's not like

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
I have power over a person's life and death.

263
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,440
Why are you venting your anger at me?

264
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,039
But

265
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,320
do you hate her that much?

266
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:44,799
Oh, right.

267
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,799
I almost forgot about your hands.

268
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,479
They're supposed to...

269
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:47,919
Shut your mouth.

270
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,119
But that's fine.

271
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,119
Once the Empress is deposed,

272
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,200
she'll be condemned by the people

273
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,440
as an evil woman

274
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,840
after she replaces the Empress.

275
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,799
It won't end well for her anyway.

276
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,280
It's not peaceful in the palace lately.

277
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,320
Don't come here anymore.

278
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,239
Lest our plan gets leaked.

279
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,880
I know what to do.

280
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
But you must be cautious

281
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,440
in your plan next time.

282
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,679
Don't leave any trails

283
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,640
that could implicate me.

284
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
It turns out Prince of Han has planted

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,520
another helper in the palace.

286
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

287
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,640
Looks like

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,599
he told you everything.

289
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,159
I thought he had a legitimate son

290
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,799
at the fief.

291
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,919
You already knew

292
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,239
His Lordship sees only you

293
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,320
as his successor.

294
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
When he has achieved his ambition,

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,679
the world will also be yours.

296
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,440
Your Highness,

297
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,520
we should discuss

298
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,840
our next step.

299
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,039
Your Majesty,

300
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,679
Her Highness seems to be waking up.

301
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,520
Zijin.

302
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,400
Zijin?

303
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,280
Everything is all right now.

304
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,719
You finally wake up.

305
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,199
Come and take a look at her.

306
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,839
Your Majesty,

307
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,160
Her Highness will be all right

308
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,280
after resting for another half a month.

309
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,520
Great.

310
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,280
That's great.

311
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,839
How are you feeling now?

312
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
Your Majesty.

313
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,479
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

314
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,400
Your Majesty,

315
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,880
the ministers are kneeling outside the palace.

316
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,479
Take good care of the Noble Consort.

317
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,199
Don't bother her with anything.

318
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,040
I'll punish you severely

319
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,760
if you disobey me.

320
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,400
Fu Jiang,

321
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,959
what's going on in the palace?

322
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,359
Jin.

323
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,359
Your Highness, you just woke up.

324
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,160
You should focus on recuperating.

325
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Imperial Physician Sheng

326
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,239
has prepared a new prescription for you.

327
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,520
We'll invite him over to check on you.

328
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,719
Official Yang.

329
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:18,880
Official Yang.

330
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,640
Sirs, please get up.

331
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,920
Sirs, please get up now.

332
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,160
It's raining heavily.

333
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,680
What do you want me to do?

334
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:30,920
Official Yang.

335
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,800
Official Xia.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,719
Sirs,

337
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,959
please get up.

338
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,400
You're...

339
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,920
Please inform His Majesty

340
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,680
that I have an important matter
to discuss with His Majesty.

341
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,079
His Majesty has ordered

342
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,079
that he won't see anyone.

343
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,280
I want to see His Majesty.

344
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,199
Noble Consort Sun, please return.

345
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,359
His Majesty has summoned

346
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,479
Grand Academician, Official Yang Shiqi.

347
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:11,075
[Qianqing Palace]

348
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,920
Your Highness, you have just recovered.

349
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,280
The weather is harsh.

350
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,400
You won't be able to endure this.

351
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,640
Moreover,

352
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,000
His Majesty doesn't have any spare time

353
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,439
if you look at the current situation.

354
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,359
Why don't you return to your palace?

355
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,280
Eunuch Chen.

356
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,839
Eunuch Chen!

357
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,119
Your Highness,

358
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,319
do you see the ministers?

359
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,520
They're here to oppose

360
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,640
the removal of the Empress.

361
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:50,920
Evil woman!

362
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,599
You seduced the Emperor.

363
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,599
You'll surely be spit on

364
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
by the people!

365
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,319
Take him away.

366
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,959
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,680
Your Majesty!

368
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,599
You must not

369
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,800
listen to the words of a villain

370
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
and depose the Empress for no reason!

371
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,479
Wait!

372
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
-Wait!
-The Empress is innocent!

373
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,920
You evil woman!

374
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,239
Noble Consort Sun,

375
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,000
if I were you,

376
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,520
I'd return to Yongning Palace right away.

377
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,400
I'd stay in Yongning Palace

378
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,560
before this matter has settled.

379
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,959
Sir,

380
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,479
criticizing the Emperor as fatuous

381
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,959
is the only thing left Duke of Ying hasn't said.

382
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,479
Judging by the situation,

383
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,719
there will be chaos

384
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:10,839
in the imperial court

385
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,880
if His Majesty still insists
on deposing the Empress.

386
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,160
What about the Prince of Han?

387
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:14,400
Hold on a little longer.

388
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,000
What are you doing?

389
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,880
Why?

390
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,400
Are you hiding something from me?

391
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:45,839
Aren't you hiding something

392
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,000
from me too?

393
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Don't you already know

394
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,479
that I want to depose the Empress?

395
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

396
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,560
Empress Dowager will never agree to that.

397
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,920
She already agreed.

398
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,079
Impossible.

399
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,599
I told Empress Dowager

400
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,040
that there was only one reason

401
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,959
I wanted to depose the Empress.

402
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,719
Lady Hu is not fit to be the Empress.

403
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,839
Your Majesty.

404
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:19,959
The Empress is not only

405
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,119
my wife.

406
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,479
She also carries the heavy responsibility

407
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,959
of being an exemplary moral character
to the empire.

408
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,880
No one in this world knows

409
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,920
how to be an empress from the moment they are born.

410
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,000
It's the Empress's first time
ascending to her throne...

411
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,079
Shouldn't you be happy

412
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,280
that I'm deposing her?

413
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,319
Why?

414
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,280
Are you going

415
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,160
to oppose me like

416
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,079
those purists?

417
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,000
If you depose the Empress,

418
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,920
everyone will criticize you

419
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,280
for your mistake.

420
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,760
I don't want you to leave

421
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,920
a bad name in history.

422
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,079
Instead of worrying about being criticized,

423
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,439
you're concerned about me.

424
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,959
It's a pity.

425
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,880
It's already too late.

426
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,119
I'm not trying to amuse you.

427
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,160
Get up.

428
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,359
Zijin,

429
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
you must trust me.

430
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,400
There's always a reason

431
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,680
for every decision that I make.

432
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:53,880
Your Highness,

433
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,040
you can't do this

434
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,479
to your health.

435
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,800
Please have some.

436
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,239
This duck dumpling

437
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,040
is tasty and not greasy.

438
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,199
Look at this.

439
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,439
How about trying this emerald shrimp bucket?

440
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,160
The shrimp is topped with smoked meat.

441
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
It has a pleasant taste.

442
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,560
Directress Yin...

443
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,880
Are the ministers still kneeling out there?

444
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,560
Your Highness.

445
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,359
Your Highness,

446
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,719
Empress Dowager requests for you.

447
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,880
Your Majesty.

448
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,599
Remember this?

449
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,880
Your Majesty,

450
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
it's the Empress's seal.

451
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,160
The Empress sent it

452
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,199
to Qingning Palace

453
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,599
early this morning.

454
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,760
All the items used

455
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,119
during the ceremony
of her appointment as the Empress

456
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,719
are also here.

457
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,760
Since the day you entered the palace,

458
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,760
you've been waiting for today, right?

459
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,640
Now,

460
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,199
you've got what you wanted.

461
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,479
Noble Consort Sun.

462
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,640
How dare you look at Empress Dowager directly.

463
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,079
You're being disrespectful.

464
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,719
I should've known.

465
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,319
Do you think

466
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,000
everything in this world

467
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,719
is within your expectations?

468
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,199
The Zhang family chose me

469
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,920
to enter the palace.

470
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:27,719
I don't know

471
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,400
if it was good or bad.

472
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,479
Since I've accepted the jade pendant

473
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,439
from Yongle Emperor...

474
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,400
Noble Consort Sun...

475
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,640
After the Great Imperial Grandson
married a new wife,

476
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,239
the Zhang family

477
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,119
still refused to give up on me,

478
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:41,880
who was

479
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,479
a pawn they had nurtured for years.

480
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,760
So I still had to enter the palace.

481
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
So what if it is?

482
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,479
I look forward to the day

483
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,599
I become the Great Ming's Matron
of the Imperial Food Service.

484
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,079
But you ruined it for me.

485
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,880
I treat the Empress

486
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,560
more sincerely than waiting

487
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,400
on His Majesty.

488
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,319
I didn't do that so I could be an empress.

489
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,839
I was almost there.

490
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,239
It was one last step.

491
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,560
Now, you're asking if I'm happy?

492
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,479
All right, then.

493
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,680
I'll let you see it

494
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,719
for yourself today.

495
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,839
Guards!

496
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,199
-Guards!
-Fire!

497
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,160
-Get help now!
-Somebody!

498
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,959
-Fire!
-Fire!

499
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Bring the water!

500
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,319
Help!

501
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,079
Your Majesty!

502
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,119
Why panic?

503
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,040
-I...
-Fire!

504
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:55,800
Hurry!

505
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,719
Quickly now!

506
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,959
I want to prove

507
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,800
that you're wrong.

508
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,119
The audacity to rebel to this extent.

509
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
You should've asked

510
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,760
if His Majesty,

511
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,800
I,

512
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
or heaven let you.

513
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,199
I'll take my leave.

514
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,599
Your Majesty, let's leave now.

515
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,359
Your Majesty!

516
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,359
Report this to the Emperor.

517
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,000
Let him see this for himself.

518
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:46,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,079
Mother, what happened here?

520
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:07,920
Well,

521
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,640
your favorite concubine did it.

522
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,640
I can't believe you laughed.

523
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,439
Mother,

524
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,239
you refused to believe it before.

525
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,880
Now, you've seen it for yourself.

526
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,479
If she wanted to be an empress,

527
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,040
she wouldn't have burned

528
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,359
all the items for an empress's
appointment ceremony

529
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,040
in front of you.

530
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,319
Your Majesty,

531
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,239
she's not after the position of an empress.

532
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,959
But what she wanted was more valuable

533
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,239
than this position.

534
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
More valuable than being an empress?

535
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:40,959
Don't tell me

536
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,359
she wants to be the next Wu Zetian?

537
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,000
She wants to win the people's hearts.

538
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,119
It's not just the ancestral law

539
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,119
that she's trying to change.

540
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,359
I'll be frank with you.

541
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,760
Just this wild ambition of hers alone

542
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,359
has beaten

543
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,000
the rest of the women in this palace.

544
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,359
If she did resort to unscrupulous means

545
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,599
to be an empress,

546
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,839
she wouldn't be

547
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,119
the person I have laid my eyes on.

548
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,359
You can't defend her forever.

549
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,239
Have a pleasant night, Mother.

550
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,520
This imprudent woman.

551
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
She almost burned down my palace.

552
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,199
Yuan Qi,

553
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,319
send all these burned copper items

554
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,119
for smelting

555
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,560
to make incense burners.

556
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,719
Look, is this all right?

557
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,599
Maintain the shape of the crab.

558
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:51,280
That's it.

559
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,160
Cover the crab shell too.

560
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,599
All right.

561
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,359
Be careful!

562
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,880
Run! Leave now!

563
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,920
Everyone, get out of here!

564
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,479
Hurry!

565
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,040
Watch out!

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,719
Be careful!

567
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:13,199
Make haste!

568
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:15,680
Over here! Go this way!

569
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,479
Hurry!

570
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,199
Run!

571
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:22,680
Be careful!

572
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:23,800
Hurry!

573
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,640
Come out now!

574
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,119
Come here.

575
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,599
That scared me.

576
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,719
Do a headcount

577
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,880
and see if anyone is injured.

578
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,400
All right.

579
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
Changqing and Changsheng.

580
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,439
Pick six eunuchs

581
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,280
to follow me to the storeroom.

582
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,479
Now?

583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,640
What do you want to do there?

584
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,839
We still need to prepare meals in the palace.

585
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,640
We need

586
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
to sort out food ingredients
and utensils that we can use.

587
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,239
Follow me.

588
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,520
Let's go.

589
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,599
Are you hurt?

590
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,760
No, I'm fine.

591
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,959
I'm glad you're all right.

592
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,239
Is everyone all right?

593
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:52,560
Your Majesty,

594
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,000
the earthquake struck

595
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,239
from the southeast to the city's northwest.

596
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,760
More than a hundred zhang of the city walls
(*a customary Chinese unit of length)

597
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,839
and more than 800 houses had collapsed.

598
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,800
We have to rebuild the walls
and the people's homes.

599
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,199
So we need the Ministry of Revenue
to allocate the funds.

600
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,839
It's Your Majesty's fault
that heaven struck us with disasters.

601
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,359
Duke of Ying.

602
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,160
Your Majesty favors a scheming person

603
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,640
and deposes the Empress for no reason.

604
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,239
You're defying the ancestral's instructions

605
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,400
and going against heavenly principles.

606
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,000
Your Majesty should issue an edict on your sin.

607
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
Take him away and flog him 20 times.

608
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,880
Guards!

609
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,280
Your Majesty,

610
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,160
Duke of Ying is the imperial court's
right-hand man.

611
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,599
You can't flog him.

612
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,400
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty,

613
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,119
you must rescind your order.

614
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
His Majesty has ordered

615
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,439
that the Duke of Ying be flogged 20 times

616
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,160
outside the palace!

617
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,479
Your Majesty deposes the Empress for no reason.

618
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,400
It's a warning from heaven! Your Majesty!

619
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
Your Majesty!

620
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,160
The Great Ming

621
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,760
must never depose its Empress without reason!

622
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,319
Otherwise,

623
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,000
Your Majesty will regret this one day!

624
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,800
The sun and the moon shall bear witness

625
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
to my loyalty!

626
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,599
Sir,

627
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,359
even the earthquake won't stop

628
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,640
His Majesty's determination.

629
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
He's serious about deposing the Empress.

630
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,119
His Lordship has sent words many times.

631
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,079
Inform Father

632
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,360
to respond to Prince of Han's coup.

633
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,879
Yes, sir.

634
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,639
Wait.

635
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,159
Let me think.

636
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,760
Wait?

637
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:20,399
Sir,

638
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,479
what are you waiting for?

639
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,879
You've caught a cold

640
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,120
when you woke up this morning.

641
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,959
I'll head back to get your mantle.

642
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,479
Go to the Medicines Office

643
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,719
and request them to send a Manager of Medicines

644
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,399
to check on Her Highness.

645
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,399
Yes.

646
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,675
[Le'an]

647
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,120
Your Lordship.

648
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,150
[The Emperor is deposing the Empress
for no reason and refusing to change his ways.]

649
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Look at my nephew.

650
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,560
For the throne,

651
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,080
he murdered his father.

652
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,280
He even listens to the corrupted ministers

653
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,000
and uses all kinds of means

654
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,600
to oppress me, his uncle.

655
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Now, he's deposing the Empress without reason

656
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,919
and received a warning from heaven.

657
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,560
Yet, he refused to change his way!

658
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,800
Since only corrupted ministers

659
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,159
are in the imperial court,

660
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,080
how could I sit by

661
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,199
and watch the people suffer?

662
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,719
I've decided

663
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,959
to follow Yongle Emperor's footsteps

664
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:05,560
and rebel against the traitors!

665
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,040
We shall be with Your Lordship

666
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,199
and vow to serve you

667
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,520
to the death!

668
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,560
Your Lordship,

669
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,479
Commander Jin Rong from Shandong

670
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,120
promised to lead the army

671
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,719
as long as you gave out the order.

672
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,000
Good!

673
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,399
Mei Qing,

674
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,399
sneak into the capital city

675
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,320
and coordinate with Zhang Fu, the Duke of Ying.

676
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,719
When I set out with the army,

677
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,000
please ask him

678
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,080
to lend me a hand from inside.

679
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,080
Yes, Your Lordship.

680
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,800
I heard

681
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
the Empress refused to see you

682
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
when you visited her twice.

683
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,760
Is that true?

684
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
Are you here

685
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,159
to taunt me?

686
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,560
No.

687
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,800
The Empress locked herself in her palace

688
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,919
and refused to see anyone.

689
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,159
I'm worried about her health.

690
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,159
Noble Consort Sun,

691
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,439
I have a plan

692
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,159
that could change the Empress's mind.

693
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
But I'll need you

694
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,639
to go to Kunning Palace.

695
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,439
Why are you doing this?

696
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,320
I've entered the palace for many years.

697
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,080
She took good care of me.

698
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
I can never repay for such kindness.

699
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,199
The Empress has ended up in this situation.

700
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,199
I don't feel at ease at all.

701
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,879
I may not be powerful.

702
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,840
But I sincerely

703
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,919
want to help the Empress

704
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,199
and help you

705
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,439
to get out of this difficult situation.

706
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,879
Jin,

707
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:44,679
His Majesty has planned

708
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,320
to have his meal here at noon.

709
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,760
Please head to the Qianqing Palace

710
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,679
and apologize on my behalf.

711
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,159
Yes, Your Highness.

712
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,000
[Kunning Palace]

713
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,399
You've already gotten what you wanted.

714
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,439
Why do you still want to see me?

715
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,439
There was a time

716
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,800
I really wanted to trust you.

717
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,120
I was too naive.

718
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,879
You only wanted

719
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,679
to be the Empress.

720
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,560
Your Majesty...

721
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,080
I've studied the art of healing for ten years.

722
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,760
I only know how to save people.

723
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,879
I don't know anything about scheming

724
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,679
or harming others.

725
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,879
It's only natural

726
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,040
for a useless person like me

727
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,600
to end up like this.

728
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,159
Seeing kindness

729
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,800
as weak

730
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,679
and malicious intention as scheming.

731
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,040
These are the scariest things

732
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,320
in the Forbidden City.

733
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,040
Your Majesty,

734
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,800
you call yourself useless.

735
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,760
So is it useful

736
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,840
to scheme and harm

737
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,120
the innocent?

738
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,600
Your Majesty,

739
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,159
there are some heartfelt words

740
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:26,879
I wish to tell you.

741
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,800
But...

742
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
All of you can leave.

743
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:33,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

744
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,320
I've told Huaping

745
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,439
that if you burn this incense
with calming effect for too long,

746
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,760
it'll lose its effectiveness.

747
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,919
Noble Consort Sun taught me how
to make this citrus fragrance.

748
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,239
I add some fragrance with calming effects.

749
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,879
So it's especially refreshing.

750
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:54,560
Miaoxian,

751
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
what was it that you wanted to tell me?

752
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,239
Your Majesty,

753
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:58,399
I've worked hard

754
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,600
to prepare your lunch.

755
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,040
Why don't you have your lunch

756
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,760
and I'll report it to you, then?

[Two Phoenixes Return to the Nest]

758
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,159
Noble Consort Sun,

759
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,840
you've gone too far.

760
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,879
Your Majesty.

761
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,439
Get out.

762
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,560
The Empress told you to leave.

763
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
Step back and don't enter.

764
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,000
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,

765
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,280
you said you wanted to help me advise the Empress.

766
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:50,000
Is this how you're advising her?

767
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,520
Your Majesty,

768
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,000
the Forbidden City

769
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,600
has no room for two empresses.

770
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,919
His Majesty is determined to depose you.

771
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,520
Why won't you permit it?

772
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
You should take the initiative

773
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,399
to step down from your position.

774
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,439
His Majesty is a benevolent person.

775
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:05,399
He'll definitely think for old time's sake.

776
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,360
You'll still have

777
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,439
your titles, maids,

778
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,560
and all the privileges

779
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,120
an empress would have.

780
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:16,280
Is this your idea

781
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,840
or the Emperor's idea?

782
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,679
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

783
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,080
I did come here

784
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,040
to persuade you on behalf of the Emperor.

785
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,760
You should let go when it's time.

786
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,679
Stop being stubborn.

787
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,399
Your Majesty...

788
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,679
If His Majesty has something to say,

789
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
he can tell me directly.

790
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm going to see him now.

791
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,439
Your Majesty...

792
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,760
Noble Consort Sun,

793
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,159
you'll suffer from inflammation of the liver.

794
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,120
Do you see the Empress?

795
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:47,679
The more emotional you are,

796
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,120
the faster the properties

797
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,479
of the herbs will flow

798
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:51,600
all over your body.

799
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,479
I admit

800
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,959
I was the one

801
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,040
who tampered

802
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,639
with your food.

803
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,159
You had the chance

804
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:03,719
to poison me.

805
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,719
Why didn't you just take my life?

806
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:11,199
It's not that hot anymore.

807
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:34,239
Well,

808
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,919
if something happens to the Empress,

809
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,280
who do you think the people will suspect?

810
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,360
Me or you?

811
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,479
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu,

812
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,080
even if you've succeeded,

813
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:48,560
you were also in the palace.

814
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,320
You'll also be suspected.

815
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,239
Noble Consort Sun suddenly fell out
with the Empress

816
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,560
and hurt someone after losing her senses.

817
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,040
I was injured

818
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:05,120
because I was trying to protect the Empress.

819
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,120
Your Majesty, are you all right?

820
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,199
Your Majesty!

821
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:08,919
See?

822
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,080
The witness is here.

823
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,679
Your Majesty!

824
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,479
-Guards!
-No!

825
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:13,280
Guards!

826
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,479
Don't do it!

827
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,000
Summon the imperial physician.

828
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,040
Take her away.

829
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:39,239
Your Majesty.
