and oppresses the people

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,839
will have his name removed
from the officials' records.

5
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:57,239
His head will be hung above the firewood market.

6
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,839
I give these men the duty

7

I've always been vigilant and introspective.

17
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,679

21
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,520
a truly prosperous country.

22
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,679
My men are my eyes and my ears.

23
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,119
They patrol everywhere and monitor my territory.

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,839
This applies to the Imperial Court and the harem.

25
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,399
The harem

26

is full of informants

27
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,880
and foreign spies.

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,039
I can't afford

29
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,320

over 2,000 people were implicated,

35

and you oversaw the execution.

I don't want your name

For 20 years, I have sat on the throne.

43
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,800
I diligently attend morning and evening
imperial court assemblies.

44

I always think about

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,839
Am I free to personally attend to
trivial palace matters

47
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,119
and watch the execution?

48
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,600
The rumor-mongers have tunnel visions

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
and are stupid.

50
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,800
These are rumors,

51
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,039
but if Lady Yu continues to make wild charges,

52
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,839
more innocent people will be implicated.

and free the rest?

57
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,639
So,

59
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320

00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:00,960
Back off.

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
Step back. Back off.

197
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,799
You too.

198
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,880
Your Highness, what are you doing?

199
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,119
You came just in time.

200
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,080
I want to say something to my father.

201
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,960
Please relay it to His Majesty.

202
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,679
For more than 20 years,

203
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,400
four times His Majesty led the army
on northern expeditions

204
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,799
and put me in charge.

205
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
I took care of

206
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,320
even trivial matters,

207
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
but my father believed in the rumors
spread by despicable people.

208
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,640
The subjects in the Eastern Palace
are imprisoned.

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,359
I'm trembling with fear as if walking on thin ice.

210
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,000
Now,

211
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:45,080
my father believes Lady Yu's slander.

212
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,880
This... This... This...

213
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,400
This is unreasonable.

214
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,640
People say

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,880
a son never criticizes his father's mistakes.

216
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
I've been holding back for more than 20 years.

217
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,640
I must say this today.

218
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,960
I know my father loves my second brother

219
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,799
and wants to make him the Crown Prince.

220
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,679
I can tolerate that.

221
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,119
I can even cede to my brother,

222
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,159
but today I have to say this.

223
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Help me down first.

224
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,239
What the Emperor wishes,

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,000
the officials will oblige.

226
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
What the higher-ups do,

227
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
the people will follow.

228
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,679
My father trusts the imperial guard
and the eunuchs

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
and uses strict laws to rule.

230
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,559
After a long time,

231
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,840
the Imperial Court has oppressive officials.

232
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,520
The common people are used to attacking others.

233
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,000
This...

234
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,440
This is wrong.

235
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,479
Help me up.

236
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,719
Don't move.

237
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,119
-Your Highness.
-Today, I...

238
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:54,479
No!

239
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:54,840
I...

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,799
No, Your Highness!

241
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,239
Your Highness, what are you doing?

242
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:58,960
Step back.

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,400
If you take one step forward, I'll kill myself.

244
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,919
No! No! No!

245
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,080
Your Highness! Your Highness!

246
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,440
(In hindsight,)

247
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,119
(she was irritable the past two months,)

248
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,960
(like another person.)

249
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
(I have no idea)

250
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,119
(and don't understand.)

251
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,960
(Beauty Yu is not a favorite,)

252
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
but she shouldn't be so frugal

253
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,760
[Corn Cake]
and eat so little.

254
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
Is she becoming immortal?

255
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
Wrong! His Majesty is wrong!

256
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,919
-No.
-Your Highness! Your Highness!

257
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,599
Your Highness!

258
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,280
You!

259
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,080
Move back!

260
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't come near.

261
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,599
If you step forward,

262
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll kill myself.

263
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm here.

264
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,719
What are your last words, Father?

265
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,840
I will relay them to my grandfather.

266
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,679
You!

267
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,359
You are irritating me even at this moment.

268
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,599
I'm just following your instructions.

269
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm not irritating you.

270
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,640
He...He...He...

271
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,679
He is making me mad.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
He did it on purpose.

273
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,559
Should I kill myself now?

274
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:56,960
Your Highness!

275
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,719
Son!

276
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,039
Don't fool around like your father!

277
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,039
You're

278
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
still behaving like a child!

279
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
Father, get down and talk.

280
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,680
No.

281
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,119
Get down.

282
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,359
No.

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
I haven't ascended.

284
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,640
How can I descend?

285
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Your Highness!

286
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,359
One,

287
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
two,

288
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
three.

289
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,280
Your Highness.

290
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,040
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

291
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,280
Your Highness!

292
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Your Highness, are you alright?

293
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
My dearest.

294
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
You scared me.

295
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
I fell.

296
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,160
You're fine. I'll go back first.

297
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,079
My dearest consort.

298
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
Your Highness.

299
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,239
Your Highness, since you are fine,

300
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,280
I'll take my leave then.

301
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,439
Rest early, Your Highness.

302
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,839
Your Highness, you scared me to death.

303
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,719
You...You...

304
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,680
There are no tears.

305
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,439
Can people outside the hall

306
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
hear me yelling?

307
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Your Highness,

308
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,520
it was so loud just now.

309
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
Of course, they heard you.

310
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,599
Help me up.

311
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,520
I just want His Majesty...

312
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,040
I just want my father to hear

313
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,160
that his son is innocent.

314
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,079
Order people

315
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,439
to prepare a meal immediately.

316
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm hungry.

317
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

318
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,680
Your Highness, what's going on?

319
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
I'm confused.

320
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Highness.

321
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
Go and check Lady Yu right away.

322
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,599
Yes.

323
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Yuan Qi!

324
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Yuan Qi!

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,599
Your Highness.

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,439
Your Highness.

327
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,560
I couldn't

328
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,040
get her to stay.

329
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:39,906
[Yu]

330
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,905
[Foods Office]

331
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,280
We should tear down the door.

332
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
It's useless to close the door anyway.

333
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,160
Yes.

334
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,439
Officer You,

335
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,400
are you searching for
palace maid impersonators?

336
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,920
Lady Yu confessed

337
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,920
that the Crown Prince ordered her
to poison His Majesty.

338
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,839
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
and the Imperial Food Service are implicated.

339
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:11,920
Matron Meng,

340
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
forgive me.

341
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,800
The Great Ming Code

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,640
says an official

343
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,359
can only be convicted in a formal trial

344
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,880
where His Majesty presides.

345
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,040
In the harem,

346
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,439
the Palace Surveillance is in charge of this.

347
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,040
I am a fifth-rank inner-court female official.

348
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,680
I should be interrogated

349
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
in the Palace Surveillance

350
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,359
and not the Imperial Prison.

351
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,400
There is no need for the imperial guard.

352
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,239
The office cannot try this case.

353
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,040
I apologize, Matron Meng.

354
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Take her.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,560
Wait.

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,760
Did the criminal, Lady Yu, accuse me

357
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,359
or the Imperial Food Service?

358
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,920
Of course, not everyone knows
about the conspiracy.

359
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,959
Okay.

360
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
If it's just me,

361
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,839
imprison and interrogate me.

362
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,000
Matron Meng.

363
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,920
Sir.

364
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,280
Lady Yu

365
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,439
argued with Secondary Consort Guo
at the flower viewing banquet.

366
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,280
Maybe she framed the Crown Prince

367
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,520
and implicated the Service

368
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,439
out of spite.

369
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,680
Officer You, don't be deceived by Lady You.

370
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,000
It's not your place to speak.

371
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
Officer You.

372
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,000
[Fine Meal, Divine Work]
The Service serves food to the palace.

373
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,839
It is an important place.

374
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,119
Why don't you

375
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,359
detain me?

376
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,680
Free Patron Meng first.

377
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,400
I am duty-bound

378
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,839
to be strict.

379
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,560
I apologize to you three.

380
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:35,920
Take them away.

381
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,520
Don't worry.

382
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,880
You don't have evidence.

383
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,439
You can't take them away

384
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,040
only based on what the criminal said.

385
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,800
Starting today,

will be carefully checked.

388
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,560
If you make mistakes,

389
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,000
you don't go to the Palace Surveillance

390
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,000
but to the Imperial Prison.

391
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,719
Trust me.

392
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,719
You don't want

393
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,040
to know what the prison is like.

395
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,199
What should we do?

396
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,079
We haven't delivered food
to Consort Zhuang for three days.

397
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,359
With them guarding us,

398
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,599
we can't get out at all.

399
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,280
We should find another way.

400
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,680
Don't be reckless.

401
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,800
Come on.

Eat something.

00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,319
You can't stand guard

407
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,359
without water and food the whole day.

408
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,280
Help yourself.

409
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:04,680
Come here.

410
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,760
Let's go.

411
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,040

Come on.

414
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,520
Come on. Give me.

415
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,920
Come on.

Arrest her.

419
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,119
Every time I see you,

420
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,199
I have to say the same thing.

421
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,520
Take her away.

[Northern Imperial Prison]

423
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,439
Sir,

00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,119
she is a maid.

425
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,400
She's scared.

426
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,199
Just keep her in a cell,

427
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,400
and we will have the confession by tomorrow.

428
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:17,719
You think?

429
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,640
We'll make her say what we want,

430
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,520
word by word.

431
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:54,839
Your Majesty,

432
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,839
the maid confessed.

433
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,079
After Consort Zhuang was held,

434
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:00,959
Matron Meng sent food

435
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,479
against the imperial edict.

436
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,439
We can tell that Lady Yu and Consort Zhuang

437
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,000
conspired with the Imperial Food Service.

438
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,239
Repeat what you said.

439
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,119
When and where did Lady Yu

440
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,599
conspire with others?

441
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,280
Don't leave out anything.

442
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:15,880
Officer You,

443
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,280
don't torture me.

444
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll say what you want.

445
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,160
I'll confess.

446
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,599
Father, did you hear that?

447
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,760
The imperial guard tortured
and persecuted the innocent.

448
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,400
I am innocent.

449
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,760
In front of His Majesty,

450
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,680
how dare you talk nonsense?

451
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280

but failed to carry it out.

Lady Yu set the fire

457
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,280
when Your Majesty was staying in her place.

458
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:01,959
Your Highness,

459
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,880
I didn't say anything.

460
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,439
I didn't mention your illness.

461
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,160
I didn't say anything.

462
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:10,800
Your Highness.

463
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,920
I didn't say anything.

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,239
Your Majesty,

465
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,319
Lady Yu apparently harbors evil intentions.

466
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,319
What is her illness?

467
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,839
How can a maid of the Imperial Foods office

468
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,280
know about this?

469
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,160

470
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,959

Stop stammering!

00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,760
His Majesty will know what to do.

474
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,439
Yes. Yes.

475
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,319
I thought

476
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:42,920
recently

477
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,079
Lady Yu has changed her menu drastically.

478
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,040
Maids often came for honey and candied fruit.

479
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,000
People in the palace were saying

480
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,239
that Her Highness' illness was strange.

481
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,439
Your Majesty.

482
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,599
I'm a newcomer.

483
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,599
I don't even recognize the roads.

484
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,520
Officer You arrested and interrogated me

485
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
about a conspiracy.

486
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,560
I don't know anything.

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,839
Have mercy, Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

489
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,079
I am innocent.

490
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,119
Your Majesty,

491
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,119
I'll ask the Imperial Physician
to diagnose Lady Yu.

492
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,599
Summon Imperial Physician Sheng.

493
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,280
What's the use of checking?

494
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
I'll tell you instead.

495
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,359
The Crown Prince wants to kill Your Majesty

496
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,599
because he's tired of waiting.

497
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,719
He can't wait to be the Emperor.

498
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,119
I...

499
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,599
was ignored for many years.

500
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,119
I endured poor treatment
and bullying in the palace.

501
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm tired of living already.

502
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,119
Lady Yu.

503
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,959
His Majesty does not see you often

504
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,359
but treats you well.

505
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,719
Why is there so much resentment?

506
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,959
How could you be so vicious

507
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,119
and want us to die with you?

508
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,599
Consort Zhuang,

509
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,719
do you think His Majesty loves you?

510
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,920
We are nothing but hwamei birds
and black-naped orioles

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,520
that belong to the imperial family.

512
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,319
Even they may be set free one day.

513
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,079
But we

514
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,479
can only hang on until we're old

515
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,560
and toothless.

516
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,040
Your Majesty.

517
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,199
Your Majesty.

518
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,599
If you are not interested in us,

519
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,400
why ruin my whole life?

520
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,599
You're mad!

521
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,280
Sheng Yin greets Your Majesty.

522
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,880
Imperial Physician Sheng,

523
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,839
please take Lady Yu's pulse.

524
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:11,880
Yes.

525
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,319
Why bother checking and interrogating?

526
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,000
What's there to check?

527
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,560
This pulse...

528
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,520
This pulse is wiry and soft on the left bar,

529
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,280
and the right...

530
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,359
What is the disease?

531
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,400
According to the pulse,

532
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
she has had chest pain and heartache
for more than three years already.

533
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,239
It is terminal.

534
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,640
She'll die soon.

535
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,560
She likes to eat candied fruit

536
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,560
because her mouth tastes bitter
because of her weak heart.

537
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,479
Your Majesty,

538
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,920
kill me.

539
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
Your Majesty, I beg you.

540
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
Please kill me.

541
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,319
Your Majesty.

542
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,319
Your Majesty, you heard it.

543
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,599
Lady Yu has lost all hopes

544
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,560
and wants everyone to perish with her.

545
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,880
We are all innocent.

546
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Your Majesty is wise.

547
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,760
Please absolve us.

548
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,640
Father,

549
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,199
can you trust a terminally ill woman

550
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,199
who

551
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,560
talks like a maniac?

552
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,520
If I want to find someone to act with me,

553
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,280
I won't find a dying person.

554
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,359
In your eyes, is your son

555
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,040
a willful and frivolous fool?

556
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:42,920
Father.

557
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,880
Who ordered you to frame the Crown Prince?

558
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,599
Tell me.

559
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,640
You all won't die with me.

560
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,079
What a pity.

561
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,079
Crown Prince,

562
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,319
please don't blame me.

563
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,680
Blame your good secondary consort.

564
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,120
She blatantly bullied me.

565
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Poor me.

566
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,239
I had to choose to settle the score with you.

567
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,320
If the Eastern Palace is destroyed,

568
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
I will get my revenge.

569
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,040
The more people die with me, the better.

570
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,479
Lady Yu, you still refuse to tell the truth.

571
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
Grandfather,

572
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,560
a few days ago,

573
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,159
someone sent a jar of gold to the Yu family

574
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,399
and promised to take care of her parents.

575
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,760
Lady Yu knew she would die,

576
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,199
so she agreed to set fire
to frame the Crown Prince.

577
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,719
We have the witness and proof.

578
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,520
The eunuchs who delivered the news
are waiting for your order.

579
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,679
Who is the mastermind?

580
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,600
Second Uncle, what do you think?

581
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,040
Zhu Zhanji,

582
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,760
I have nothing to do with this.

583
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:08,520
Grandfather,

584
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,959
I asked around.

585
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,000
Someone said

586
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,199
it was a personal attendant
from the Prince of Han's Residence.

587
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,159
You framed me.

588
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,199
This is out-and-out framing.

589
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:20,959
Father,

590
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,320
I have never seen this woman.

591
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,120
I didn't send gold to the Yu family.

592
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,120
Father, believe me.

593
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,800
If I want to frame the Crown Prince,

594
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,639
I will do it secretly.

595
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,479
Why would I send my own man?

596
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,439
Won't I be exposed?

597
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,600
Someone failed to frame the Crown Prince
and wanted

598
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,879
to alienate the imperial family members.

599
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,760
Father, please judge wisely!

600
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,520
Uncle, don't worry.

601
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,919
You can air your grievance.

602
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,879
How can I?

603
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,719
Who won't be worried if he is framed?

604
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,879
I'm innocent.

605
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,280
Father, please judge wisely.

606
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,520
Uncle, don't lose your composure.

607
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,000
Zhanji, you believe me, don't you?

608
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,159
Tell your grandfather

609
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,800
that I'm innocent.

610
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm innocent.

611
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:09,719
Enough.

612
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,120
Send Consort Zhuang back to her palace first.

613
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,399
Lady Yu will be imprisoned
for another trial later.

614
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,760
Yes.

615
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,919
Your Majesty, the Imperial Food Service
is innocent, too.

616
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,520
Release them.

617
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,800
Father! Father!

618
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Don't you believe me?

619
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,399
Big Brother.

620
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,800
Third Brother.

621
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,760
Third Brother.

622
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,919
Officer You, please wait.

623
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,320
Yes, Your Highness?

624
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,080
Officer You,

625
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,399
do you feel

626
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,040
that something is not right?

627
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,879
This isn't a conspiracy.

628
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,760
Lady Yu will die soon

629
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
and hated the Eastern Palace's
secondary consort.

630
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,360
She wanted others to die

631
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,719
and framed the Crown Prince

632
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,719
and implicated the innocent.

633
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,800
Since His Majesty didn't issue

634
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,679
an edict on the Prince of Han,

635
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I can't pursue further.

636
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,919
Please forgive me.

637
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,439
I feel

638
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,399
that the witness

639
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,679
and proof were like they waiting for me.

640
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,679
We got the truth

641
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,000
and the prince is safe.

642
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,199
Your Highness, please excuse me.

643
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,840
Your Highness, watch where you step.

644
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,919
Thank you. Just...

645
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:03,479
Let's go.

646
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,760
Don't follow me.

647
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:16,679
Go away.

648
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,120
Go away.

649
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,199
Prince of Han,

650
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,639
don't be furious.

651
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,919
They're freed so quickly.

652
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,800
You look like

653
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,800
you've suffered a great injustice.

654
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,399
What?

655
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,639
Do you think I bribed Lady Yu

656
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,520
to frame the Crown Prince?

657
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:42,760
Didn't you?

658
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,199
Bribing a terminally ill woman

659
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,199
to assassinate my father,

660
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,360
framing the Crown Prince,

661
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,199
and leaving behind a witness and proof.

662
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:51,919
Do you think

663
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,959
I am that stupid?

664
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,840
In that case,

665
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:59,120
someone deliberately alienated you all.

666
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,719
It wasn't Zhu Gaochi

667
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,840
or Zhu Zhanji.

668
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,959
How so?

669
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
My big brother studies

670
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,320
the books of sages and upholds
the art of gracious sages.

671
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,520
He won't be able to do that.

672
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,760
Zhu Zhanji

673
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,959
is shrewder than my big brother.

674
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,199
He won't undermine his own father

675
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,959
just to frame me.

676
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,159
So someone deliberately led him to check.

677
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,800
Who would this person be?

678
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:32,485
[Tomb of Lady Zheng, My Mother]

679
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,479
Zhanli!

680
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,919
Unfilial son!

681
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,040
It was you!

682
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,239
We passed each other，

683
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,760
but you didn't recognize your own son,
Prince of Han.

684
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,959
Why?

685
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,639
You recognize me now?

686
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,879
Of course I'll know everything

687
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,399
after seeing this tombstone.

688
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,719
Up close,

689
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,280
you do not look like me at all.

690
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,199
You look more like that filthy woman.

691
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,879
Your Lordship, please calm down.

692
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:19,719
Your Lordship.

693
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,600
You filthy woman!

694
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,959
Your Lordship!

695
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,080
You filthy woman!

696
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,040
Mother!

697
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,879
After your mother died,

698
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:33,800
you sneaked out of my residence.

699
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,800
I sent people to search to no avail.

700
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,280
After so many years,

701
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,439
you look very different.

702
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,520
When I saw you for the first time,

703
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,719
I still suspected it.

704
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,479
It seems that you set up

705
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,280
the corpse in Jinan that looked exactly like you

706
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:50,639
seven years ago.

707
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,199
You saved His Majesty

708
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,399
in an expedition

709
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,639
and were transferred to the capital.

710
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,520
You were promoted all the way.

711
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,760
The imperial guard selection is very strict.

712
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,199
Did His Majesty know...

713
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,320
I'm a maid's son.

714
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,320
I never got the chance to meet my grandfather.

715
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,159
So no one knows who I am.

716
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,760
Neither should you

717
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,879
frame your own father

718
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:19,280
for a woman who disobeyed her husband.

719
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,959
Now you know how it feels to be wronged.

720
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,760
My mother was accused of having an affair.

721
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,000
She couldn't even defend herself.

722
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,600
She was even more aggrieved.

723
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,840
She suffered a hundred,
thousand times more than you.

724
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,280
Scoundrel!

725
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,040
How can you disregard your father?

726
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,600
Don't forget

727
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:03,159
that my blood flows in you.

728
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,360
Is that so?

729
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,159
I thought you trusted the rumors

730
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,719
and believed my mother
had an affair with someone else.

731
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,639
Maybe,

732
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,560
I'm also a love child.

733
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,280
After she died,

734
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,239
I regretted

735
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,600
acting too rashly.

736
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,639
I sent people to look for you

737
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,360
all over the country.

738
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,840
I don't blame you

739
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,560
for hating me.

740
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,679
You've been a clever boy since young.

741
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,639
You've always been my favorite.

742
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,399
If it weren't for etiquette,

743
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,679
you would be the heir of the Prince of Han.

744
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,919
Zhanli.

745
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,919
If you don't want to go back with me,

746
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,280
I won't force you.

747
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,120
I hope one day

748
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,040
you will call me father.

749
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:31,800
Go now.

750
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:37,439
[Northern Imperial Prison]

751
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,719
Leave us.

752
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:58,800
I did what I promised.

753
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,840
What about what you promised me?

754
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,199
I found your two siblings who were kicked out

755
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,080
by your stepmother.

756
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,360
They are in a foster family.

757
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,000
They will grow up healthy and safe.

758
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,479
As for the ungrateful couple,

759
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:25,199
they will die with you.

760
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,320
Now I feel relieved.

761
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:36,360
There is one more thing that I don't understand.

762
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,560
What is it?

763
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,919
You used me

764
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,800
to frame the Prince of Han.

765
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,679
What is your intention?

766
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,439
Naturally,

767
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,800
it is to go back to my beloved father.
