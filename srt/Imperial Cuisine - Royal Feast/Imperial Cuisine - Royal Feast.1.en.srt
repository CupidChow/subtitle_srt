[20th year of Yongle]

4
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,960
[Zhu Gaochi, Crown Prince]
Although talented people are difficult to find,

5
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,039
a good cook is even more difficult to find.

6
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,030
[Meng Ziyun, Matron of the Imperial Food Service]
Matron Meng,

7
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,199
did the selection of the Table Maid
in the Foods Office

8
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
go smoothly?

9
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
Your Highness,

10
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,000
at this moment,

11
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,639
we're reviewing the candidates.

12
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,470

[Su Yuehua]

16
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Your Highness, please show mercy!

17
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,720
I was careless just now.

18
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,959
It's fine.

19
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
Take this away.

20
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Your Highness is magnanimous indeed.

21
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,359
Your Highness, if you keep
tolerating their mistakes,

22
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,399
the servants will only grow more brazen.

23
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,760
They are daring enough to treat
the meal preparation of the Eastern Palace lightly.

24
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,200
Who knows what kind of trouble
they will cause in the future?

25
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,110
[Zhang]
[Crown Princess]

26
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,160
Why are you

27
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,279
here again?

28
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,079
Empress Xiaocigao once said this
when she was alive.

29
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,519
"To serve one's husband, one must chew
the food personally before serving it to him".

30
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,040
This has been a norm since ancient times.

31
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
Under the grace of Empress Xiaocigao,

32
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,000
I handle Your Highness's meal personally.

33
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,720
One must pay extra attention when it
comes to preparing the Crown Prince's meal.

34
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
Your Highness, you look after
the nation on His Majesty's behalf.

35
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,920
Your Highness is exhausted from
handling state affairs from day until night.

36
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,679
There is no reason for me not to be here.

37
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Matron Meng,

38
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
you have always been a rigorous person.

39
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,640
How could you commit such mistakes?

40
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,000
[Jiang Wanying, Directress of the Foods Office]
Your Highness, the Matron will retire soon.

41
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,000
Matron Meng will leave the palace
and return to her hometown soon.

42
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,279
It is common for her

43
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,559
to commit such a blunder.

44
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,839
Your Highness, please show her some mercy

45
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,839
on account of her rigorous demeanor

46
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,079
for many years.

47
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,079
This is a minor matter.

48
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,160
Do not worry.

49
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
How dare you plead for her sake

50
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
when she has committed such a serious mistake?

51
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,480
Your Highness,

52
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,440
Matron Meng
guided me when I first entered the palace.

53
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,079
That's how I was able to learn how to cook.

54
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,640
Now, it is fair for me

55
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,760
to repay her favor.

56
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,399
Your Highness, please show mercy.

57
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,600
So

58
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,359
that means you're indebted to her.

59
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,440
You do know how to be grateful.

60
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,640
It's no wonder many people had told me

61
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,799
to let you assume her position as the Matron.

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,320
Your Highness, I do not deserve such praises.

63
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
I do not dare to assume
such an important position.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,279
So since your benefactor
has committed a mistake,

65
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,760
I guess it is fair for you
to accept the punishment on her behalf.

66
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,239
Someone.

67
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,760
Take her away and beat her 50 strokes.

68
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,760
Expel her from the palace.

69
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,920
Your Highness!

71
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,359
Even though the Matron
is to leave her post in three months,

72
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,399
it seems like you can't
wait to frame your superior.

73
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Who else shall I punish if not you?

74
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Take her away!

75
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,839
Your Highness, I was framed!

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,559
Your Highness, I do not dare to do so!

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Your Highness!

78
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Your Highness, please show mercy!

79
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,559
Your Highness!

80
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,959
I have chosen the wrong person for the job.

81
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,559
Your Highness, please punish me as well.

82
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,200
You'll be dealt with later.

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,959
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,920
His Majesty is on an expedition.

85
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,679
The Great Imperial Grandson
has not returned from his southern patrol yet.

86
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,880
There's no need to make the feast
of this year's Chongyang Festival

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
a grand one.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,559
Your Highness!

89
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,000
Speak.

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,839
Your Highness!

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,239
His Majesty went on
an expedition to defeat Arughtai

92
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,480
and has returned victorious!

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,959
His Majesty has already
passed through Changping!

94
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,839
Send someone to investigate

95
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,160
the whereabouts of the Great
Imperial Grandson immediately.

96
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,040

(His Majesty is returning to the palace.)

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,119
(Prince of Han has entered the capital in secret.)

101
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
Stop!

102
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,599
Your Highness.

103

[Yuan Qi]
[Attendant of the Great Imperial Grandson]

104
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,359
Why are you shouting?

105
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:45,960
Stop shouting.

106
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,400
His Highness is resting! Why did you shout?

107
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,559
I have something important to report to him.

108
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,760
If I must say,

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,799
you're really dumb.

110
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,159
Now, our priority is to hurry on with our journey.

111
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,719
Go away!

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,760
What's the matter?

113
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,159
Your Highness, His Majesty
is on his journey back to the palace.

114
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,679
But Prince of Han is already in the capital,
waiting for His Majesty's return.

115
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm afraid he's up to no good.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,359
Your Highness?

117
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,679
Pick up the pace.
We need to hurry back to the capital.

118
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,840
Your Highness, are you okay?

119
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,479
Everyone, push the carriage together!

120
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,799
Yes, sir!

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,840
What's wrong again?

122
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,479
Push it!

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,919
Hurry up!

124
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,640
Put some backbone into it!

125
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,359
Harder!

126
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,280
Come on! Push harder!

127
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,840
Hurry up!

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,679
You guys are idiots! Hurry up!

129
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Such idiots!

130
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,719
Your Highness, are you awake?

131
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,719
Your Highness, it's not that
I'm trying to criticize you here.

132
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,159
But why aren't you nervous at all?

133
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,599
Why should I be nervous?

134
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,200
Please pardon me for this.

135
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,559
Once His Majesty returns to the palace,

136
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,479
I'm afraid the Crown Prince
will be blamed at every turn.

137
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,359
His Highness won't be able to sleep in peace.

138
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,919
Father is used to it.

139
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,239
It's fine that His Highness
is used to that type of lifestyle.

140
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,359
But this time, Prince of Han is there as well.

141
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,559
I don't know how much trouble he will create.

142
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,320
Father will get used to that too.

143
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,599
Your Highness!

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,239
His Highness is hoping that you can return

145
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,479
and resolve the situation for him.

146
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,799
Are you nervous about it?

147
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,840
Of course!

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,479
I'm nervous for my master
from the bottom of my heart.

149
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,559
Listen to this if you don't believe me.

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,719
My heart

151
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,200
is going to jump out soon.

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
It's beating rapidly.

153
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,760
I do have an idea.

154
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:31,960
Your Highness, please tell me.

155
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,320
Turn around.

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
Instead of panicking in the carriage,

157
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,039
it's more practical for you
to go down and push the carriage together.

158
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,320
Your Highness!

159
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,359
Your Highness, you mustn't do so!

160
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,239
Move aside!

161
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,320
Your Highness, please return to the carriage!

162
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,000
According to the almanac, we should avoid

163
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,719
traveling today.

164
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,119
Indeed.

165
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,760
We were met with plenty of difficulties

166
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,000
on our way home.

167
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,599
But I'm a lucky boy

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,359
since young.

169
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,320
Back then, Master Yao said

170
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,599
that my life is blessed with three wonders.

171
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,760
The lucky star had given me its blessings.

172
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,799
Even though I might face difficulties,

173
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,119
I'll be able to overcome them.

174
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,320
-That's a given.
-No problem.

175
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,359
Now, I will borrow some luck from the heavens.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,919
If I think I can overcome this,

177
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,400
I will surely overcome this.

178
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,880
Come on, everyone, let's try again.

179
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,080
Come on! Hurry!

180
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on, let's push this together!

181
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,799
Come on!

182
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,599
Your Highness, I got it.

183
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,400

Go!

185
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,159
Push harder!

186
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,679
Go!

197
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,760
Three of you, come out.

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,919
Directresses,

199
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,000
these three have their own specialties.

200
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,880
It is hard for us to judge their capabilities.

201
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,559
Please decide for us

202
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,119
and choose one of them as the first place winner.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,599
These dishes may look simple,
but they do put one's cooking skills to the test.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,239
But this is my first time

205
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,559
witnessing such a situation.

206
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,719
Do the three of you

207
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,159
know the Art of Food?

208
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,559
People of the world treat
poems, essays, verses, and paintings as art.

209
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,840
That's right.

210
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,280
A great painting and a great verse
can be passed down through the ages.

211
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,840
But to me,

212
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,359
food is the first necessity of the people.

213
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,280
Food is a top priority.

214
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,200
An exceptional cook

215
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
can transform mediocrity into magic.

216
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,159
I'm entering the palace

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,679
in order to learn about the true Art of Food.

218
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,719
I want to prepare a feast
that has never been seen before

219
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,840
and become the number one cook in the world.

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,039
She's so arrogant.

221
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,359
Mind your words.

222
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,400
I lived in the marketplace since young.

223
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,919
I know that a bowl of porridge

224
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,719
can save a person's life during famines.

225
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,200
Our current emperor is frugal

226
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,119
and compassionate.

227
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,719
Meal-making is the art

228
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,400
of transforming the cheapest ingredients

229
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
into delicacies that can fill our tummies.

230
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,559
Those so-called famous feasts

231
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,320
are just a waste of food

232
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,679
for one to maintain one's undeserved reputation.

233
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,640
What about you?

234
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,760
If I don't enter the palace,

235
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,960
my father will force me to get married.

236
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,239
That is why I must enter the palace.

237
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,479
Drive all three of them

238
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,239
out of the palace.

239
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,760
Directress Wang,

240
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,479
three of them are
exceptional among all the candidates.

241
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,799
Why have they failed the test?

242
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,919
Yin Ziping,

243
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
are you an expert in famous feasts

244
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,280
all around the world?

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,880
Since you're not an expert,

246
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,359
how dare you insult them with your rude remark?

247
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,039
And you, Su Yuehua,

248
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,919
you're vain and arrogant at such a young age.

249
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,200
Do you even understand the Art of Food?

250
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,640
How dare you boast about being
the number one cook in the world?

251
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,559
As for you, Yao Zijin,

252
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,520
you're utterly insincere about
the reason you want to join the palace.

253
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,159
The palace is a strict place.
How dare you utter such nonsense!

254
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,239
Drive all of them out!

255
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Directress Wang!

256
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,320
I beg you!

257
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,400
Please give me another chance!

258
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,400
Directress Wang,
I will surely turn over a new leaf!

259
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,760
Directress Wang, please forgive me!

260
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Directress Wang,
I will surely turn over a new leaf!

261
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,559
Directress Wang, I beg you!

262
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,799
Get up.

263
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,280
Directress Wang, I beg you! Please forgive me!

264
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,200
Directress Wang, I beg you!

265
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,359
Directress Wang, all of them are talented.

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,280
Are you sure you can't pardon them?

267
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,119
Drive them out!

268
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Don't touch me.

269
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,599
I can leave by myself.

270
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,280
Let go of me!

271
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,119
I won't go! I must stay!

272
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,039
Directress Wang!

273
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,280
Matron Meng, you're back.

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080
Directress Wang, I beg you!

275
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,559
Greetings, Matron Meng.

276
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,520
His Majesty has returned to the palace.

277
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,719
I have just received an imperial decree.

278
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,200
Tonight, the palace will
hold a feast inside and outside of the palace

279
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,599
to reward the officials and the army.

280
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,640
The Court of Imperial Entertainments and
the Directorate for Palace Delicacies need manpower.

281
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,880
They have ordered the Imperial Food Service
to assist them in preparing for the feast.

282
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,960
The candidates who are here today

283
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,200
are to stay in order to help.

284
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,960
Matron Meng.

285
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,559
Everyone, you may start preparing for the feast.

286
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,400
Yes.

287
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,880
The Six Services and One Surveillance,

288
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,559
which are the General Palace Service,
the Imperial Ceremonial Service

289
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,039
the Imperial Wardrobe Service, the Imperial
Food Service, the Imperial Housekeeping Service,

290
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,239
the Palace Workshop Service,
and the Palace Surveillance.

291
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,960
The matrons of the services
are all fifth-rank officials.

292
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,200
Matron Meng is in charge
of the Imperial Food Service.

293
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,919
Under her are the directresses
of the Foods Office, the Wines Office,

294
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,359
the Palace Medicines Office,
and the Palace Banquets Office.

295
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,000
This is the Foods Office.

296
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,159
Hu, Wang, Jiang, and Xu
are the four directresses of the office.

297
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,760
But Directress Xu already retired last month.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,919
There are two food managers
and table maids respectively.

299
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
And there are countless
numbers of female servants.

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
It all depends on your capability

301
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,640
whether or not you can stay here.

302
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,359
Yes, Manager Fang.

303
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Manager Fang,

304
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,599
I thought the palace is holding
a feast to celebrate Chongyang Festival?

305
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,440
Your chore is over there.

306
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,880
Su Yuehua,

307
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,920
you possess good cooking skills.

308
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,239
Directress Hu has arranged
another chore for you.

309
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
Follow me.

310
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,560
Yes.

311
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,319
Let me take a look.

312
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,959
How could you still smile over that?

313
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,920
Do you want me to cry instead?

314
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,359
Even if you cry, you still need to wash the dishes.

315
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,640
It'll be even more painful

316
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,599
when you get the tears on your wound.

317
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
Your Highness, the sun will set soon.

318
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,599
Even if we were to hurry on without any rest,

319
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,479
we could only reach the capital
by tomorrow midnight earliest.

320
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Your Highness, why don't we take the horse?

321
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,439
To keep my father company

322
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,119
is my duty as his son.

323
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,640
But now, my path is obstructed.

324
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,000
Even though my return has been delayed,

325
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm helpless about it.

326
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,479
Seems like

327
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,160
Father has to swallow some grievances again.

328
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Your Highness, do I need to
prepare your horse for you?

329
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,319
The scenery out there is amazing.

330
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,199
It's rare for us to be on a journey like this.

331
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Since we're already late,

332
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,640
why don't we enjoy the scenery
before we head back?

333
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,800
What do you say?

334
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:52,640
Let's go.

335
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,000
Your Highness!

336
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,439
Your Highness!

337
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,800
The imperial decree is here!

338
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,880
According to His Majesty's decree,

339
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,000
the vastness of Heaven and Earth

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,359
encompasses all things.

341
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,640
Under an emperor's reign,

342
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,199
all beings are equal.

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,239
I embrace the order of the heavens

344
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
to differentiate ourselves
from the barbarians.

345
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,479
[Zhu Di, Yongle Emperor]
I work tirelessly day and night

346
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,439
to govern the nation
so that all beings in the world

347
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,239
can have what they wish to have.

348
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,239
But the deceased

349
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:37,239
Arughtai had let down the imperial grace
and invaded our border time and time again.

350
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,839
To protect the people,

351
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,560
I had mobilized my troops to hunt him down.

352
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Now that we have achieved victory,
the contributors will be rewarded.

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,719
According to the list of rewards and
punishments prepared by the Ministry of Rites,

354
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,359
[Huang Yan, Eunuch of the Directorate of Ceremonial]
those who have contributed to this expedition,

355
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,839
you are to sit at the front row
and enjoy the best delicacies.

356
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,839
[Yang Shiqi, Grand Secretary]
Those whose contributions cancel out their faults,

357
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,199
you are to sit in the next row
and enjoy the second-best delicacies.

358
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,479
[Jian Yi, Minister of Personnel]
To those who have not contributed anything,

359
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,549
[Liu Shun, Assistant Minister]
you are to sit at the last row

360
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:01,839
[of the Court of State Ceremonial]
and enjoy the third-best delicacies.

361
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,319
As for those who have contributed nothing
but mistakes, you are to stand at the side.

362
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,640
Accept the decree.

363
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,719
Father.

365
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,599
[Yang Rong]
Official Yang.

366
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,360
[Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Library]

367
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,146
[Jin Youzi]
Official Jin.

368
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,646
[Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Library]

369
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,199
Two of you have
contributed greatly to this expedition.

370
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,479
According to His Majesty's oral decree,

371
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,959
you two are to sit at the front row
and enjoy the best delicacies.

372
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,439
They are hereby promoted by two ranks,
and they will receive one golden satin attire

373
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,000
and 5,000 guan in cash.

374
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

375
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We shall follow your decree.

376
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,479
I was late! Father, please pardon me!

377
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,000
Greetings, Father.

378
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,970
[Zhu Gaoxu]
[Prince of Han, Second Prince]

379
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,719
I have not summoned you.

380
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,880
How dare you return to the capital
without permission?

381
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Lately, I've discovered

382
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,959
a stalk of three-ear grain in my fief.

383
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,359
It signifies the peace of the Ming nation.

384
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,119
Father, you are supremely fortunate
and your might knows no bound.

385
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,319
Coincidentally, I had to enter
the capital to offer my tribute.

386
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,160
That is why I have entered the capital

387
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
to offer the tributes in person.

388
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,959
Father, please pardon me.

389
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,479
Father, Second Brother is just
anxious to deliver his good news to you.

390
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,920
Please pardon him.

391
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,160
You are a good brother indeed.

392
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,119
Do not repeat this.

393
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,839
Father, thank you for your magnanimity.

394
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Big Brother, it's been half a year since we last met.

395
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,239
Seems like you have gained some weight.

396
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,239
I can't compare with you.

397
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,079
Look at you.

398
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,959
You look so spirited and awe-inspiring.

399
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,400
Please.

400
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,920
Serve the dishes.

401
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,479
Your Majesty, the dishes are served.

402
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,959
Your Majesty.

403
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Look, the fish's mouth and gills are still moving.

404
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,319
Is it still alive?

405
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,640
The carp looks alive even though it's dead.

406
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,680
You can see the shocking speed at which she cooks.

407
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,319
Your Majesty,

408
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,920
This dish is called Burnt Bone.

409
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,000
[Burnt Bone]
It was invented to celebrate the army's victorious return.

410
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,079
Even though our enemies were as tough as iron,

411
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,839
they were no match for your peerless might.

412
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,959
It's even harder for them
to win against our mighty army.

413
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,439
So our enemies were as tough as iron?

414
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,760
Do you expect me to grow a set of
iron teeth in order to chew them down?

415
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,199
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
is getting sloppier.

416
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,079
How dare a mere kitchen cook

417
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:01,520
to step out of his place and try to please me?

418
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,160
His sin is unforgivable.

419
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,640
Someone, take him away.

420
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Your Majesty, this is
the Sweet and Sour Live Carp.

421
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,650
[Jing Quan, Chief Minister
of the Court of Imperial Entertainments]

422
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,750
[Crispy Peach Rice Crust]

423
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,680
Your Majesty.

424
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,560
Even until now,

425
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,160
His Majesty hasn't taken a single bite.

426
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:28,640
Meng Ziyun, you better think of something.

427
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,599
You would've been fine

428
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,439
if you just stick to serving the food.

429
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,000
Since you've done so much in order
to get the right to prepare the imperial feast,

430
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
if you don't do a good job today,

431
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,359
you'll be in for a treat!

432
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,920
Manager Fang, it still didn't work?

433
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
If His Majesty doesn't consume any of our dishes,

434
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
[Wang Kuai, He Ling, Table Maids]
does that mean all of us will have to be punished?

435
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,359
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
had warned us before.

436
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,000
If His Majesty doesn't eat, it shows
the ineptitude of the Imperial Food Service.

437
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,319
Since all people here are inept,

438
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
there's no use in keeping us here.

439
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,199
What should we do?

440
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
You guys should hurry and think of something!

441
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,239
Hurry and think of something!

442
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:12,920
Don't worry.

443
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,719
Over here, we have to prepare
a feast for the Chongyang Festival.

444
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
Outside the city, we have to prepare
a feast to reward our victorious army.

445
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,199
The cooks in the Court of Imperial
Entertainments cannot prepare the food in time.

446
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,839
Now, the army is getting restless.

447
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,000
According to His Majesty's oral decree,

448
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,640
the Directorate for Palace Delicacies
and the Imperial Food Service are to assist us.

449
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,079
You mustn't do so. The feast
for the Chongyang Festival hasn't ended yet.

450
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,560
Even so, you have to go.

451
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,079
Why are you guys still standing there?

452
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,359
Hurry and follow me.

453
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
The dishes for the military
and civil officials have been served.

454
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,280
It's useless for you guys to stay.

455
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,079
Hanying,

456
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,359
take them and follow the minister
out of the palace.

457
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:46,760
Follow me.

458
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,239
Two of you should tag along.

459
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,359
Let's go.

460
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:02,119
Directress Hu, what should we do?

461
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,119
What should we do about the feast?

462
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,560
What should I do?

463
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,000
Continue.

464
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,560
Why are you panicking?

465
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,839
Let me cut the chicken livers.

466
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,280
(Zhanji,)

467
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,520
(why haven't you returned yet?)

468
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,239
(Do you know)

469
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,160
(that your father is in a tough spot right now?)

470
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,800
I had already issued my decree long ago.

471
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,599
Gaochi, why didn't you receive me outside the city?

472
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,680
Father, I have a heavy body.

473
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm not good at horse riding.

474
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,000
It's my fault

475
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,880
for being late in receiving you.

476
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
Father, please punish me.

477
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,000
Father,

478
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,040
you cannot blame Big Brother for this.

479
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,640
It's the fault of his useless aides!

480
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,719
During my return from the North,

481
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,439
I've already received a report.

482
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,040
Zhang He, Secretary of the Ministry
of Revenue, son-in-law of Lyu Zhen,

483
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,680
Minister of Rites, has committed a breach
of etiquette during the morning court assembly.

484
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,000
Gaochi, you actually tolerated his behavior

485
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,400
and let him be.

486
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm truly disappointed in you.

487
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,359
Father,

488
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,239
it's my fault for mishandling my subordinates.

489
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,160
Please punish me!

490
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,700
[Ming Military Camp, Outskirts]

491
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,119
Hurry!

492
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,199
Where's our food?

493
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,719
I don't care!

494
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,560
We want food!

495
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,359
Stop wasting our time!

496
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,880
Sir, please wait. We're already cooking them.

497
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,079
Didn't His Majesty grant us a feast?

498
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,920
It's almost midnight!

499
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,119
That's right.

500
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,800
Where's our food?

501
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,680
-Yes, sir.
-He's right!

502
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,359
I want food!

503
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:33,880
Hurry and bring us our food!

504
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,319
Bring us our food!

505
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,880
You guys are here to reward the army.

506
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,839
Why can't we eat yet?

507
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,680
Sir, I know it's been tough on you guys.

508
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,280
But you have too many people here.

509
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,880
Please calm down.

510
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,839
Don't go!

511
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,560
Assistant Minister, you're finally here.

512
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,839
Now, all the cauldrons we've brought here

513
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,520
and the cauldrons we found in the military camp

514
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,479
are fully occupied.

515
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,479
We don't have enough cauldrons.

516
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,640
His Majesty has already issued
an imperial decree.

517
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Now, we have to prepare
a feast for thousands of people.

518
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,800
But I can't do it!

519
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,239
Why don't we check out the kitchen again?

520
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,079
Maybe there are extra cauldrons in the store?

521
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,520
Why are you so flustered?

522
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
Of course I'm flustered.

523
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,239
We have help from the Imperial Food Service.

524
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,479
Since Matron Meng is that capable,

525
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,760
I'm sure everyone under her is exceptional.

526
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,359
That's right. Official Zhao, you're right.

527
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:19,280
Go on.

528
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,719
Okay.

529
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,680
Hanying, the Court of Imperial
Entertainments has 3,000 cooks.

530
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,199
What do they mean by they can't do it?

531
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,319
Moreover, if the military camp
doesn't have enough cooking utensils,

532
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
how do they cook for the entire army
when they go on an expedition?

533
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,599
It's obvious that they're
making things difficult for us.

534
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,680
This place will be a mess.

535
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,920
We should hurry and return to the palace.

536
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,520
If we return right now,

We will be executed.

Back then, when the Court
of Imperial Entertainments

539
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,160
prepared the menu, the Directorate
for Palace Delicacies prepared the dishes,

540
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,920
and the Imperial Food Service served the food,

541
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,839
that was what you call order.

I'll go and borrow some cauldrons.
