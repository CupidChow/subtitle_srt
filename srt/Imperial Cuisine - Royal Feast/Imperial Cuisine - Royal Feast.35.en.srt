[Royal Feast]

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,760
It's tasty

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
but too hot.

5
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,160
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,680
I'll stand guard outside.

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,760
Directress Su,

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,879
your dishes are delicate.

9
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,680
Officer You

10
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,559
can't wait to go out for some pancakes.

11
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
Nice. It's delicious.

12
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,839
Coming. Coming.

13
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,039
Directress Yin.

14
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,399
Although you can change
the order of serving food,

15
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,119
you still must observe
the principle of going from salty to mild

16
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,759
and from thick to thin.

17
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,039
By messing up the order,

18
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
you spoil the appetite

19
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
and the original taste of the food.

20
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,199
What is this?

21
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,240
I have never seen it before.

22
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Your Highness,

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
this is a rice roll.

24
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,039
The filling is crunchy and delicious

25
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,240
even though it is just
pickled vegetables and eggplants.

26
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,639
It's yummy!

27
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,080
[Rice Roll]

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
Big Brother, try it too.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
I think you are hungry.

30
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
Where is this dish from?

31
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,600
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
It is said that when the Yuan Dynasty's army

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,279
retreated from Nan'an Prefecture in Jiangxi,

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
the food in the city was looted.

35
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,919
A quick-witted and nimble-fingered woman

36
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,679
collected broken rice

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
on the ground

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,839
and ground it into a gruel.

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
She steamed it in a winnowing basket

40
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,119
and used all kinds of fillings.

41
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,559
Then she brushed tea-seed oil

42
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,960
to make very delicious rice rolls.

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,839
It is super delicious.

44
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,440
It doesn't look special,

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
but it's very fragrant.

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,875
[Crab Roe Soup Dumpling]

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,359
Your Highness.

48
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,839
Don't eat so fast even if you're hungry.

49
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,200
The soup dumpling doesn't look hot,

50
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:28,839
but if you're not careful,

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,679
you can have heartburn.

52
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,519
You are right, Officer You.

53
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,640
It is said that during the Three Kingdoms period,

54
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,399
Sun Quan married off his sister to Liu Bei.

55
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,519
Madam Sun had loved to eat crabs since young.

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Away from her native place,

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,799
she missed crabs even more.

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Then, someone used crab roe as the filling

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
for soup dumplings

60
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
in memory of her.

61
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,320
It's hot,

62
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
but it should be eaten hot.

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,839
It has a crab smell when it cools down.

64
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,200
Stuffed Rice Rolls accompanied by
Crispy Juntun Stuffed Flatbread.

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
This flatbread

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,760
was a military ration handed down

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,480
by General Jiang Wei

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,959
from the Three Kingdoms period.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
Officer You, please try it.

70
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,359
I forgot to remind you

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,799
that there's pepper powder inside.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
You better try the fried cake first

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
or sugar rolls.

74
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,559
Officer You,

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,119
are you alright?

76
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,519
Do I look alright?

77
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,359
Sir, forgive me.

78
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,279
I ground the pepper myself

79
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
and the taste is heavier.

80
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,160
Did you give me

81
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,720
a pot of pepper powder?

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Yunzhou often leaves Beijing for assignments.

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,880
You must have tasted food

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,799
from all localities.

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,880
How could there

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,079
be something you haven't tasted?

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
All the cuisines of the world converge in China.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,720
If one eats three meals

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
of fresh delicacies every day

90
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,600
and lives to be 1,000 years old,

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
he still can't finish sampling the delicacies.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
This is Sheep Head Meat Roll.

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,119
Wang Anshi, counselor-in-chief
of the Song Dynasty,

94
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
considered fame and wealth as floating clouds.

95
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,880
When he studied late at night,

96
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,519
he loved this Sheep's Head Meat Roll.

97
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,920
In Wang's Residence,

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
the best Sheep Head Meat Roll

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,920
was not made by the cook of the residence

100
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,399
or Madam Wang,

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,679
but...

102
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,279
Who?

103
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,519
This is a long story.

104
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,160
Noble Consort Sun,

105
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,399
I like Directress Yin's stories.

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Let her cook for me in the future.

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Your Majesty,

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,679
you took Directress Su personally,

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,160
now you want to take Directress Yin too.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
What if I'm not used to

111
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,519
the meals made by others?

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
What should I do?

113
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,880
I will exchange with you.

114
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,600
This...

115
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm afraid that's not good.

116
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,760
If Her Majesty likes it,

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,799
let Directress Yin

118
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,679
prepare meals for Kunning Palace in the future.

119
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

120
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,160
We can't wait any longer.

122
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,679
Now is the best time.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Wait.

124
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,000
Leave me.

125
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,279
They are prepared.

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,480
Retreat.

127
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,679
Let's go.

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,000
Eunuch Chen, you did not stand guard
outside the shack

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
to serve His Majesty.

130
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,399
Where did you go?

131
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,000
Directress Yin has to prepare food.

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,719
So, I walked around.

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,400
Walked around?

134
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,840
I have to change my clothes. Do as you please.

135
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,359
Forgive me, Brother.

136
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,840
I did not do it on purpose.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
With you as my brother,

138
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
I would have more grey hair.

139
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,679
I'll check if the soup is ready.

140
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll see how Directress Yin

141
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,400
cook.

142
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Your Majesty, please go ahead.

143
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,239
Your Highness is generous.

144
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,880
You even gave away your chef.

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,599
As far as I know,

146
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,280
Directress Yin is illiterate.

147
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Even after studying for two years,

148
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,280
she still cannot talk about cuisines

149
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,840
with great familiarity.

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,080
Who do you think

151
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,080
was the storyteller?

152
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,479
How dare you question me

153
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,080
just because you won His Majesty's favor?

154
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,919
You've overstepped.

155
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,239
How many of Chen Wu's subordinates

156
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,400
are office workers from the Eastern Depot?

157
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,559
He won't even dare unveil some things.

158
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,599
Naturally, there are reasons for that.

159
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,719
After today,

160
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,559
the eunuchs and officials involved

161
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,599
will hate you down to the bone.

162
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't even care about your reputation.

163
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,200
I am

164
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,359
short-sighted.

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
I only care about the present.

166
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,400
I can't control the future.

167
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,440
What can't you control?

168
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,200
Your Majesty.

169
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
I only like

170
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,159
this flatbread with rice noodles.

171
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,679
I'll eat as I please.

172
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,159
I already approved.

173
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,239
No one can tell you what to do.

174
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,599
That was more

175
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,919
or less what happened.

176
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,479
Your Majesty,

177
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,640
permit me to speak out of turn.

178
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,559
Noble Consort Sun

179
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,159
is out of control

180
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,119
because His Majesty likes her.

181
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,400
According to old rules,

182
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,039
Her Majesty

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
should be bestowed a gold sculpture
and gold foil edict.

184
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,080
While the Noble Consort is only given
the gold foil edict.

185
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,520
However, His Majesty bestowed upon
the Noble Consort a gold sculpture also.

186
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,799
This

187
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,840
has never happened in all dynasties.

188
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,679
Moreover, it should be the only honor

189
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,760
in the land under heaven.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,559
He also said

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,599
In this palace,

380
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
there is no evergreen.

381
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,000
She

382
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,439
relies on a bit of favor

383
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,000
and is full of herself.

384
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
She is stepping on me!

385
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,719
On me!

386
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Observe.

387
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,239
I'll see how long this noble consort

388
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,160
can hang on.

389
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,439
Don't tell anyone I said this.

390
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:01,680
I want to play too.

391
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,760
Slow down. Wait for me.

392
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,479
Hurry up.

393
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,000
Let me play for a while.

394
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
Hurry up.

395
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,319
Slow down.

396
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
Wait for me.

397
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,760
Hurry up.

398
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,239
Wait for me.

399
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:16,719
Come on.

400
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:17,959
Are you alright?

401
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm fine.

402
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,479
Go play.

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Come.

404
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,079
Let me help you.

405
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,119
Madam, let me do it.

406
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,239
Thank you.

407
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:40,560
It's alright.

408
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,319
Granny, where do you live?

409
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,199
Let us send you back.

410
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,439
Just in front.

411
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,400
Alright.

412
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,640
Come on. Slowly.

413
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,400
Thanks.

414
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,199
It's alright.

415
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,359
Go in and rest for a while.

416
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,400
Alright.

417
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,439
Come.

418
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,920
Stay here and stand guard.

419
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,760
Come. All of you, come in.

420
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Come in. Come in.

421
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,800
You all go in and sit for a while.

422
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,239
I'll get you a bowl of water to drink.

423
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,880
I've run out of water.

424
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,160
Wait a while.

425
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,319
I'll fetch you water.

426
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,319
I'll go with you.

427
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,479
Thank you.

428
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,920
Initially, when Hongwu Emperor
built poorhouses,

429
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,439
he wanted to care for lonely old folks

430
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,319
and disabled people,

431
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,520
but...

432
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,040
Your Majesty,

433
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,839
Beijing City's poorhouses

434
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,439
accepted

435
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,800
4,500 lonely old folks.

436
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,560
The Imperial Court has a heavy burden.

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,079
The world is vast, and there will be oversight.

438
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,680
You shouldn't blame yourself.

439
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:43,680
No.

440
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,359
I'm not good enough.

441
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,119
Yesterday, I asked

442
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,160
how many refugees are in Beijing,

443
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,560
and everyone was mumbling

444
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
and tried to cover things up.

445
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,800
I feel sad.

446
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,800
If everyone

447
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,680
could be like you,

448
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,640
being dedicated to their duty,

449
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,280
the people under heaven

450
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
might be much better off.

451
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,920
My late grandfather and father

452
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
overlooked your talent.

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,479
From now on,

454
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,959
I will let you display your talent

455
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,719
and do what you really should be doing.

456
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,400
Water is here.

457
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:33,760
Come on.

458
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,199
Drink a bowl of water first.

459
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:35,719
Thank you.

460
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,160
Here.

461
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,119
Sit down.

462
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,199
Get the Regional Investigating Censor

463
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,280
to recheck all localities.

464
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,599
Local officials who reject people who qualify

465
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,760
for admission into poorhouses

466
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,119
will get sixty strokes by heavy sticks.

467
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
Whoever dares to embezzle

468
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,160
will be severely punished.

469
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,640
Yes.

470
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,000
Your Majesty,

471
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,560
it is time to go back to the palace.

472
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:54,858
[Yongning Gate]

473
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,525
[Puff Pastry with Three Types of Shreds]

474
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Your Majesty's appetite

475
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,640
has been good lately.

476
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,800
However, you like to eat

477
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,119
sweet desserts and drink soup.

478
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,680
When will you eat proper meals?

479
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
Your Majesty,

480
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,199
Directress Yin goes to Yongning Palace

481
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,199
around 5 to 7 PM every day.

482
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,079
She stays for two hours before going back.

483
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,239
Your Majesty, you...

484
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,280
Now,

485
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,719
it's her turn to pity me.

486
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,079
Your Majesty.

487
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,560
Your Majesty.

488
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,920
How did you get injured?

489
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm fine.

490
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,239
Where's the memorial?

491
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,040
It's on the table,

492
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,400
but...

493
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,719
Why are you here?

494
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,119
Your Majesty.

495
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,439
Your Majesty left in plain clothes

496
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
and came back late at night.

497
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
If the Empress Dowager finds out,

498
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,439
she'll be very worried.

499
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,520
What is this?

500
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

501
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:39,439
Hurry up and change it.

502
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,719
Let me do it.

503
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,839
Let them do it.

504
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
You ran around for the sake of the people.

505
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,439
This is nothing.

506
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,560
Leave.

507
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,040
Are you waiting to be scolded?

508
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,239
I went to many places today.

509
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,640
I saw an old woman.

510
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,719
Her children and grandchildren

511
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,239
died on the battlefields.

512
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,719
She eats a full meal every two days.

513
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,000
Other than wild vegetable roots in the pot,

514
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,880
she had nothing.

515
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,520
I felt ashamed seeing that.

516
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,719
I felt terrible

517
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,839
when I saw that.

518
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,119
Your Majesty,

519
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,079
I know.

520
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,479
Stop washing.

521
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm hungry.

522
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:46,719
Serve my meal.

523
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:50,675
[Noodles Served with Fried Bean Sauce]

524
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,839
I didn't alert the Imperial Food Service.

525
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,239
I made the noodles myself.

526
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,119
I hope you don't mind, Your Majesty.

527
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,959
You're quite comfortable.

528
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Next time if I come back late,

529
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,040
don't wait.

530
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,959
When Your Majesty comes back late at night,

531
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,160
aren't you happy

532
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
to see me?

533
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,719
Yes, I am.

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,239
Then I will wait.

535
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,239
Regardless of when Your Majesty comes back,

536
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,400
I will wait here.

537
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,599
If I get tired from waiting,

538
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,560
I'll take a nap on Your Majesty's low bed.
Alright?

539
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,160
Aren't you afraid of criticism
from the imperial harem?

540
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,560
In that case, I won't wait.

541
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,079
Eat more.

542
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:46,719
Alright.

543
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,560
Work after we eat.

544
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,359
Try this.

545
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,560
Today's dish tastes good.

546
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,079
Yes.

547
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,119
Have some.

548
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,160
Eat more.

549
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
Eunuch Chen,

550
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,000
you didn't eat for a day.

551
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,839
Please eat first.

552
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,000
Thank Her Highness for me.

553
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,959
Thank Her Highness.

554
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,199
Come and taste.

555
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,160
It's hot.

556
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,760
Be careful. Eat slowly.

557
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,479
It's delicious.

558
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,479
Try it.

559
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,359
This pancake is delicious.

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,560
Sir,

561
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,640
have a pancake.

562
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,160
Sir.

563
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,359
Sir.

564
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,639
Wait a moment.

565
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,399
Your Majesty has an appetite now,

566
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,199
but you can't

567
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,679
only eat snacks every day.

568
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,520
I have prepared a proper meal today.

569
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:52,879
Please try it, Your Majesty.

Directress Yin,

571
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:03,840
what is this?

572
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,399
This morning,

573
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,719
I specially picked lotus roots

574
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,600
for Her Majesty

575
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
[Fried Lotus]
to cook this fried lotus.

576
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,560
I heard that Xi Shi loved to pick lotus for food

577
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,600
to nourish her extraordinary beauty.

578
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,239
That was why the later generations claimed

579
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,879
the lotus could clear the heat
and cool the blood.

580
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,600
It is also beauty food.

581
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,719
Porridge

582
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,560
served with fried salted shredded fish

583
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,159
[Fried Salted Shredded Fish]
tastes the best.

584
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
Didn't you say it was hot yesterday?

585
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,719
Today, I specially prepared Ice with Cream.

586
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,159
[Ice with Cream]
However, Your Majesty has just resumed eating

587
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,239
and shouldn't eat too much,

588
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,919
or it might be bad for your body.

589
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,159
Your Majesty,

590
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,719
I don't know what I did wrong

591
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,239
to displease you.

592
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,199
Your Majesty.

593
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,159
Noble Consort Sun

594
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,239
is waiting outside the hall as summoned.

595
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,719
Let her in.

596
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,560
Yes.

597
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

598
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,719
I didn't serve a good meal.

599
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,120
Please forgive me.

600
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,760
No need.

601
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,679
Noble Consort Sun,

602
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,520
take her back.

603
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,919
I don't want to see her again.

604
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,239
Your Majesty.

605
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:24,919
Directress Yin.

606
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,639
I have something to say to Her Majesty.

607
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,719
Please leave us.

608
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,159
Your Majesty hates me

609
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,439
because of Matron Hu?

610
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,639
Noble Consort Sun,

611
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,919
I know His Majesty favors you very much,

612
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,520
but I am the Empress.

613
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,320
You are going too far.

614
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,520
I did not explain earlier

615
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,560
because it is obvious.

616
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,159
With your wisdom,

617
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,120
how could you misunderstand?

618
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:15,800
Unless

619
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,159
you

620
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,600
are venting your displeasure
and anger over the loss of a loved one

621
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,439
on me.

622
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,399
(I sincerely pray to heaven)

623
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,879
(that you may live in peace and joy.)

624
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
(This wish is enough.)

625
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Had you not entered the palace,

626
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,280
and without you in the world...

627
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:41,719
Your Majesty.

628
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
You lost your sister,

629
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,040
but what about me?

630
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,479
You took the Empress' position.

631
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,719
I do not have any foothold in this world.

632
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:51,919
In this world,

633
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,479
there is no one to protect me.

634
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:55,520
Have you ever thought

635
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,479
of my past situation?

636
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,719
Everything is predestined.

637
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,439
Can people

638
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,239
deny their fate?

639
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,080
Look at me.

640
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,040
Was my fate cast in stone?

641
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,320
Life is full of twists and turns

642
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,040
and unpredictable.

643
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,879
Why must you accept your fate?

644
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:19,600
What were you thinking

645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
over half a year?

646
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,000
Water.

647
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,360
Water benefits many but takes no credit.

648
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,800
Even in the most painful situation,

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
I will tell myself

650
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,959
that if there are boulders ahead,

651
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I will take a detour.

652
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,760
What if there is no detour?

653
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,520
If I can't detour,

654
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,879
the constant dripping of water
will make a hole in the boulders.

655
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,080
His Majesty went on tour in plain clothes

656
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,320
and returned after 7 PM.

657
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,600
He finished reviewing memorials
on the fourth watch.

658
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
He did it because he wished to be

659
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
an enlightened ruler.

660
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,959
However, people concealed
the true states of affairs from all

661
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:00,919
and confused the public.

662
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,800
He has to personally see,

663
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,959
listen, and visit.

664
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,800
Even the soles of his boots were torn.

665
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,959
The son of heaven doesn't always get his wish.

666
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,679
What more can ordinary people expect?

667
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,399
Your Majesty,

668
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,479
please reinvigorate yourself

669
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,560
and continue living properly.

670
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:49,639
Your Majesty,

671
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,959
the food is cold.

672
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,600
She clearly gave the instruction
not to deliver meals anymore,

673
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
but she changed her mind in an instant.

674
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,439
How did you

675
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,000
persuade Her Majesty?

676
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,159
The weather is hot
and there are many government affairs.

677
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,639
Naturally, His Majesty
has intense internal heat.

678
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,560
He is more irritable.

679
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,879
You should cook more

680
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,639
food that clears heat and dryness.

681
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,080
I checked all the menus you sent me.

682
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,719
Several dishes have scallion
and peppers in them.

683
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,120
You should remove such food

684
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,159
that promotes dryness.

685
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,000
Why are you so quiet

686
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,080
and why stare at me?

687
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes.

688
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,040
I'll change that.

689
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,120
I'll go back.

690
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,239
You're so meticulous

691
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,280
about His Majesty's diet and daily life.

692
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,199
However, others are still criticizing you
behind your back.

693
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,439
They say that you are cunning,

694
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,479
good at winning people over,

695
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:24,679
and you wrap His Majesty

696
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,239
around your little finger.

697
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,560
According to you,

698
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:28,879
given his temperament,

699
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,280
can His majesty be easily manipulated?

700
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,800
You should

701
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,159
deliver the meal a bit later.

702
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,000
Let them talk first.

703
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,320
I'm leaving.

704
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,080
Do you have a son?

705
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,879
I ask you if you have a son?

706
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,600
I have two sons.

707
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:10,760
You have two sons

708
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,239
but didn't

709
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,800
send them to learn craftsmanship.

710
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,679
Your Majesty, I...

711
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,280
You were short of craftsmen

712
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,679
and stopped projects that weren't urgent.

713
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,000
Why did you go to Yingtian Prefecture

714
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,040
to choose 5,000 children
to come to Beijing to learn craftsmanship?

715
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,520
You are a father.

716
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:26,080
Don't you feel compassion and sympathy

717
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,199
for their parents?

718
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,439
Your Majesty.

719
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:29,439
This...

720
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,959
This is the arrangement
of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs.

721
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm telling the truth.

722
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,800
Telling the truth?

723
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,959
As the Minister of Works,

724
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,040
you didn't listen and report

725
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,080
when you should have.

726
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,320
Get out.

727
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,840
Aren't you in charge
of the Directorate of Palace Eunuchs?

728
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,159
Your Majesty,

729
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:01,760
I have no idea about that.

730
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,479
I don't know, Your Majesty.

731
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:04,800
It wasn't me.

732
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,280
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

733
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:07,639
I'm innocent.
