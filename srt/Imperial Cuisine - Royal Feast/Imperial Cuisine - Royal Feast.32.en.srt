1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,080
They can't test it.

4
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,720
I can test the medicine myself.

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,879
What...

6
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,199
I would like both of you to be the witnesses.

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,559
After I test it,

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
please report to Empress Dowager truthfully.

9
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,519
Your Highness,

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,360
don't do it.

11
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,519
How can you harm yourself

12
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,199
because of Directress Yin?

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
If a test is needed,

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,599
let the female physicians repeat the test.

15
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,600
If they repeat the test,

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,679
can they get a result?

17
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,720
I have nothing to say about
Empress Dowager's partiality

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,679
to Kunning Palace,

19
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,759
but this concerns people's lives.

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,479
I can't yield.

21
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,199
Your Highness should understand

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,440
that even if you test it,

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,839
the result will be the same.

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,839
Why must you do it?

25
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,000
If I know what is right and wrong

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
but keep quiet for the sake of advantages

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,039
to avoid the disadvantages,

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
and disregard my conscience

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,199
for self-preservation,

30
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,759
what virtues and capabilities do I have

31
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,880
to hold the position of the noble consort?

32
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm doing it

33
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,559
not just for Ziping,

34
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,399
but for the justice of the world.

35
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:52,880
Your Highness,

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
Qianqing Palace suddenly
removed Directress Yin

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,919
from the imperial prison.

38
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,119
His Majesty wants to personally
interrogate her.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,520
This...

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,839
Your Majesty.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,559
What's wrong?

42
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,600
Didn't Your Majesty ask me to come here

43
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,520
to hear your interrogations?

44
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,960
Am I going to interrogate?

45
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,639
A kitchen

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
is a place where food is prepared.

47
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,720
It is supposed to be

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
the cleanest place in this world.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Not just food,

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
such cleanliness applies to the people's hearts.

51
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,520
However, some people

52
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
repeatedly used the Imperial Food Service

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
to stir up trouble.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,119
I'm going to handle this according to law today.

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Let this be a warning to all.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,679
Those who suffered injustice
or made false accusations

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,679
will be flogged to death
if they stir up trouble again.

58
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,240
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,039
I feel unwell,

60
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,399
so please permit me

61
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,000
to leave first.

62
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,920
Why does Your Majesty look at me like this?

63
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,600
Nothing.

64
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,920
Let's go out together for a walk.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,119
My Empress,

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,559
I sent someone to the library to sort out

67
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,119
Shennong's Herbal Classics Volume III

68
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,600
that you were looking for.

69
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,880
I've sent it to Kunning Palace.

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
I am deeply grateful

71
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,600
for Your Majesty's great kindness,

72
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,600
but there's no need for it.

73
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,760
I won't need that anymore.

74
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,959
My Empress has suffered

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,279
because of the Imperial Food Service's mistake.

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
These people

77
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,119
deserve to be punished.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,720
My Empress, why is your complexion

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,600
so awful?

80
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,920
Since young, I couldn't watch such scenes.

81
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,920
I am still sick

82
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:28,119
and I get chills when the cold wind blows.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
Please permit me

84
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,040
to leave first.

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
A great physician feels great compassion

86
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,720
when he treats an illness

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,880
and vows to save the suffering of the soul.

88
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,320
All human beings in the world,

89
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,440
both rich and poor,

90
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,959
are kin to a physician. Their lives matter,

91
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,839
and he treats them impartially.

92
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,799
My Empress,

93
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,760
your maternal grandfather
was a famous physician.

94
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,119
He must have taught you a lot

95
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,399
about the principles
of practicing medicine and conducts.

96
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,119
Did he guide you

97
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,440
the same way?

98
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
I am stupid.

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
I don't understand what you mean, Your Majesty.

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,839
To save a seriously ill person,

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,079
a physician

102
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,559
has to spend a lot of effort and time.

103
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,519
The two people in front of you

104
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,000
will die in an instant.

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,079
Are you indifferent towards them?

106
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,279
I believe

107
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,440
heaven is benevolent

108
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,519
and will not protect sinners.

109
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,600
Sir, she passed out.

110
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,600
Continue.

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,519
Stop!

112
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,279
Step aside.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,279
Stop!

114
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,399
Yukuai!

115
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,880
Ziping!

116
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,279
Ziping!

117
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,119
Ziping!

118
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,720
It's fine.

119
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:26,839
Your Majesty!

120
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,000
Your Majesty!

121
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,559
Please rescind your order

122
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,119
and stop the execution.

123
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,920
Pull the Noble Consort away.

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
-Your Highness.
-Your Majesty!

126
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
His Majesty is furious. Don't contradict him.

127
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,119
Your Majesty!

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Your Highness!

129
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:42,720
Your Majesty!

130
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:46,920
Get out of the way!

131
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,959
Your Majesty, heaven's manifestation is clear.

132
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
When someone breaks the law,

133
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,119
you will order the offices to reexamine the case.

134
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,720
You will never kill innocent people.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,399
However,

136
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,440
there is no evidence now.

137
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,799
Why do you insist on using tortures?

138
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,799
For

139
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,040
the so-called face of the imperial family,

140
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,640
will you disregard

141
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
innocent lives?

142
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Tell me why.

143
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,880
Your Majesty the Empress,

144
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,760
tell me,

145
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
did Yin Ziping

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
make you hysterical?

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,119
Did she harm you?

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,760
Tell me!

149
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,200
Zijin.

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,760
Ziping.

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,679
Don't beg them.

152
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,080
Don't beg them.

153
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,599
Ziping.

154
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,280
Imperial physician!

155
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Jin, summon the imperial physician!

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,039
Go.

157
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:56,679
Yes.

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
Your Highness, you came just in time

159
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,799
to see her off on her last journey.

160
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Say whatever you want to say

161
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,159
while you still have the chance.

162
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,520
Ziping.

163
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,960
Zijin.

164
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,080
Ziping.

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
I was born a social pariah.

166
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,840
I resigned to my own backwardness.

167
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,479
I did a lot of wrong things.

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,520
I entered the palace

169
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,559
to seek riches and prosperity.

170
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,520
I want to get rid of my identity,

171
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,039
but everyone looks down on me.

172
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,239
I felt hopeless every day

173
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,280
until I met you.

174
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,719
Ziping.

175
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Don't worry, it's alright.

176
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,320
The imperial physician will be here soon.

177
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,200
Zijin, after I met you,

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,159
I live like a human being.

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,039
I cook with sincerity.

180
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,080
I am filled with hope every day

181
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,880
because of you.

182
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,200
I know.

183
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,559
Of course, I know,

184
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,679
but now

185
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,880
is not the time to say this.

186
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,159
Be a good girl.

187
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm fated

188
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,640
to have no blessings, kinship,

189
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
and longevity.

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
The only thing I have

191
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
is you, my friend.

192
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,000
I promised you

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,280
to be a good person,

194
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,799
but I...

195
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
but I always...

196
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,200
I always have a lot of bad thoughts.

197
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,440
I have to work

198
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
very hard to suppress them.

199
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,640
In my next life,

200
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
I will never do bad things again.

201
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
What do you mean by the next life?

202
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,440
Don't say that.

203
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,559
I will be a good person in my next life.

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Your Majesty.

205
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,359
Five more people from the Imperial Food Service
have been detained.

206
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
How should I handle them?

207
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,559
They are all accomplices.

208
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,520
Handle them the same way.

209
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,320
Your Majesty.

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,679
It's all my fault.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,280
It has nothing to do
with the Imperial Food Service.

212
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
If Your Majesty wishes to punish,

213
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,559
punish me.

214
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,679
Your Majesty!

215
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,239
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
after my big sister died,

217
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,679
I fell sick because I missed her.

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I was bedridden with a lingering illness.

219
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,679
The imperial physicians couldn't find the cause

220
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,919
and were afraid Empress Dowager
would blame them.

221
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,039
That was why they suspected the medicinal food

222
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
and implicated those
in the Imperial Food Service.

223
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,039
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Let them go.

225
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,080
Why didn't you say it earlier

226
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,919
when you suspect that?

227
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,840
A physician can't heal himself.

228
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,400
I have been ill for a long time

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,239
and have become confused.

230
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,479
I will explain

231
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,799
to the Empress Dowager.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,239
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

233
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,119
Pardon them.

234
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,400
If that is the case,

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,200
presumably

236
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,679
the Imperial Food Service

237
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,520
won't make any mistakes
in meal preparations anymore.

238
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,039
Your Majesty made painstaking efforts

239
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,880
to warn everyone.

240
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,960
From now on, everyone should
conduct self-examinations

241
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,840
and take this as a warning.

242
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,679
Who would dare to make trouble again?

243
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,640
Pity you, Directress Yin.

244
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,479
Directress Yin,

245
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,200
you did not suffer in vain.

246
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,719
After this,

247
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,200
no one would dare

248
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,159
pick on the Imperial Food Service.

249
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,919
Zijin,

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,679
help me

251
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,840
do one last thing.

252
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,760
Burn it.

253
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,640
What do you mean one last thing?

254
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,799
You embroidered

255
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,119
only half of it

256
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,760
and made me embroider the rest.

257
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,359
It is ugly.

258
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,760
How can I give it as a gift?

259
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,200
Ziping,

260
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,599
are you fine?

261
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,559
Ziping.

262
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,919
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your graciousness.

263
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,239
Thank you, Your Majesty the Empress,

264
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,159
for righting the injustice.

265
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,719
Your Highness,

266
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,679
I told you before

267
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,320
that imperial bodyguards can beat
in different ways.

268
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
When done lightly,

269
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,840
even a piece of tofu can escape unscathed.

270
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,679
Not to mention it was Directress Yin.

271
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,880
Your Majesty.

272
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:21,799
She...

273
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Your Majesty the Empress,

274
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm afraid that one fainted

275
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,599
because she was terrified.

276
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,599
Zijin.

277
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,280
How can I escape unscathed?

278
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,840
I am in pain.

279
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
It really hurts.

280
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,280
Zijin.

281
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,039
Your Highness,

282
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,520
I came across Imperial Physician Sheng.

283
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,440
I've been waiting outside as ordered.

285
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I understand.

286
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,840
You worked together to deceive me.

287
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,679
Zijin.

288
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,679
Zijin, Zijin!

289
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,320
It really hurts.

290
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,479
Zijin!

291
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,520
Your Highness.

292
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Zijin! Zijin!

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,559
I was wrong, Zijin!

294
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,359
Zijin!

295
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:10,799
Your Majesty,

296
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,919
why did you deceive me?

297
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,479
Your Majesty.

298
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,320
Let me help you up!

299
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,640
Your Majesty,

300
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,719
you seemed to have badly offended

301
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,359
both Her Majesty and Her Highness.

302
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,039
Did I?

303
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,479
I told you to be serious in the beating,

304
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,559
but I didn't ask you to make it so bloody.

305
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,440
You must have scared them.

306
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,359
Even if Your Majesty said so,

307
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,599
I can't

308
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,719
apologize on your behalf.

309
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,760
Matron Meng.

310
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,919
Before Directress Yin returns to the kitchen,

311
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,919
everything in the kitchen

312
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,159
must be the same as before.

313
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,719
Hanying, you'll handle that.

314
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,320
Yes.

315
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,479
Matron Meng,

316
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,599
Directress Yin was detained
in the imperial prison.

317
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,799
She might have met her fate already.

318
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,599
The Imperial Food Service

319
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,840
cannot be without a person in charge.

320
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,880
Manager Fang is busy training

321
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,959
maids who just entered the palace.

322
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,119
If it's only a month or half, it would be fine.

323
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
However, if this goes on for a long time,

324
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,040
she would be overextending.

325
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,040
One month is enough.

326
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,119
After Directress Yin recovers,

327
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
she'll come back to the kitchen.

328
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,040
Matron Meng,

329
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,479
is Directress Yin alright?

330
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:23,800
Finally, she is alright.

331
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,119
No.

332
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,640
Your Highness.

333
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,280
What's wrong?

334
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,439
His Majesty orally instructed

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,040
Your Highness to stay in Yongning Palace

336
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,359
and reflect on your mistakes.

337
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,640
Eunuch Yuan,

338
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,599
why does His Majesty

339
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,439
ground Her Highness?

340
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,000
His Majesty said

341
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,719
that you should

342
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,760
ponder over your mistake.

343
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,439
After you figure it out and get over it,

344
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,760
you may go out.

345
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,359
Permit me to leave.

346
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:56,760
This...

347
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,040
What did

348
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,479
Her Highness do wrong?

349
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,239
Your Majesty.

350
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,959
What are you looking for?

351
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,920
Your Majesty!

352
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,040
Your Majesty, don't do that.

353
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,800
Your Majesty!

354
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,040
Your Majesty!

355
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,199
Your Majesty,

356
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:17,839
your hands!

357
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,479
Your hands!

358
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,439
Your Majesty.

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
Leave us.

360
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:32,920
Your Majesty.

361
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,359
Yes.

362
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,640
Wait.

363
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,479
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

364
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,439
Your Majesty

365
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,880
must be secretly laughing at me now

366
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,400
for being

367
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
a useless and vicious woman.

368
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,079
After all, you know everything.

369
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,119
Don't you?

370
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,119
Before I became your empress,

371
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,760
these hands

372
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,959
performed acupuncture, took the pulse,

373
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,400
and gave prescriptions to save lives.

374
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,640
I studied for 10 years

375
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,839
before my maternal grandfather
let me see patients.

376
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,439
I naively looked forward to

377
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,079
becoming a famous physician

378
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,599
like him one day.

379
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,400
Not anymore.

380
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,560
There won't be another chance like that.

381
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,319
I killed someone.

382
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,880
I caused the death of a patient.

383
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,000
Now,

384
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,680
I will use these hands

385
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,880
to hurt more innocent people again.

386
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:10,880
Your Majesty,

387
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,479
I'm scared

388
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,079
of what I've become.

389
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Will a conscientious person

390

be unable

392
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,599
to differentiate between right and wrong

393
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,319
because of a momentary setback?

394
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:29,880
From the start to the end,

395
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,280
your hesitations and your struggles

396
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,239
proved that there is goodness in you.

397
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,839
I'm glad that my grandfather

398
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,319
did not choose the wrong person.

399
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,760
I believe

400
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,640
you're just sick.

401
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,000
After you recover,

402
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,199
you are still my good empress.

403
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:54,760
Your Majesty,

404
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,000
am I your empress

405
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,119
or your wife?

406
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,280
Do you not hate me?

407
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,839
I thought that after this,

408
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,640
you wouldn't want to see me anymore.

409
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,719
Sheng Yin greets Your Majesty

410
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,280
and Your Majesty the Empress.

411
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,359
My Empress,

412
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,719
do not let your mind wander.

413
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,400
Rest and recover.

[About Medicine]

415
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
Don't make Empress Dowager worry.

416
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:13,100
[Kunning Palace]

417
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
After the beating,

418
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,239
she is close-mouthed now.

419
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:19,479
Your Majesty,

420
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Her Majesty

421
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
should recuperate properly.

422
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,520
What mistake did Her Highness

423
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
commit?

424
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,680
I don't understand.

425
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
I think even Her Highness

426
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,280
doesn't understand either.

427
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,599
She can think.

428
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,239
If she doesn't understand,

429
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,280
she can forget about getting out.

430
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,599
Jin.

431
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,479
Did Her Highness say anything?

432
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,479
Directress Yin,

433
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
what are you trying to do?

434
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,160
There is no cuisine in the world

435
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,319
that can't melt a heart.

436
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:25,675
[Steamed Eel]

437
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,680
(It's so refined.)

438
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,719
(No wonder the eel meat)

439
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,439
(melts on the tip of the tongue.)

440
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,680
(What is this?)

441
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,199
(Crunchy, cool, and delicious.)

442
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,119
(The greasiness of the eel)

443
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,920
(disappeared in an instant.)

444
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
The eel has too much fat.

445
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,000
(To get rid of the grease,)

446
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,839
(I specially selected carp fillets)

447
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,599
(to make a cold salad.)

448
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,000
(I also added mustard and chicken sauce.)

449
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,760
Isn't it delicious?

450
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,479
This one

451
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,640
is the Smiling Conch.

452
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,959
[Smiling Conch]
You must try it.

453
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,199
(Xuelu is clumsy.)

454
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:36,839
(In the end,)

455
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,280
(I cleaned the conch myself.)

456
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
I also wrapped the dumplings.

457
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
Crispy conch slices

458
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,439

460
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,319
Is it tasty?

461
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,199
(The heat is just right.)

[Popped Crab]

463
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,400
(The crab shell popped,
but the crab meat is not burnt)

464
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,439
(How did she do it?)

465
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,800
The real secret

466
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,839
is hidden in this dish of sesame oil.

467
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,599
I'll tell you if you ask me.

468
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,000
[Rice with Abalone Sauce]

469
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,520
(This is an abalone sauce)

470
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,439
(that I made by stewing)

471
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,319
(abalone, scallop, hen,)

472
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,400
(Jinhua ham, and pork bone.)

473
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
(I stewed for four hours a day)

474
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,520
(for three days in a row.)

475
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,119
(The soup is delicious and fragrant.)

476
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm so attentive,

477
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,560
aren't you going to forgive me?

478
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,319
Directress Yin.

479
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,920
The fallen people in East Zhejiang
often wear head caps.

480
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
They look weird and funny.

481
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,959
People follow them and gawk at them.

482
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,239
I made some modifications
especially to cheer you up.

483
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Don't you want to take a look?

484
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,000
To make this hat,

485
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
I pricked

486
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
all 10 fingers.

487
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,920
Yes, I didn't tell you earlier,

488
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,400
but I did it for a reason.

489
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,839
There wasn't enough time.

490
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,439
I overacted,

491
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,599
but that was

492
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,079
to convince Her Majesty.

493
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
I didn't expect you to believe it

494
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,239
and to be so sad.

495
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,359
Don't be angry, alright?

496
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,599
You haven't talked to me

497
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,920
for two months.

498
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,160
According to my previous edict,

499
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,400
assign dukes, marquises, earls,

500
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,280
five military commissions, six ministers,
grand academicians,

501
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,199
and supervising secretaries
to carefully review

502
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,000
serious criminals in the prisons.

503
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,479
To prevent perfunctory handling,

504
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,359
as the investigating censor,

505
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,920
you should keep a careful eye on things.

506
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,920
Rest assured, Your Majesty, I understand.

507
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,079
Your Majesty,

508
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,359
my mother suffers from consumptive coughs
for a long time.

509
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,160
She has seen famous physicians to no avail.

510
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,400
With all due respect,

511
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,119
can Your Majesty

512
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
ask the Noble Consort

513
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,479
about the pearl and jade two-treasure porridge

514
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,560
that can relieve this symptom?

515
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:54,839
I don't know...

516
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,839
Chen Wu,

517
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,439
tell Sheng Yin to go back with Official Mei

518
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,920
to treat his mother.

519
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:01,920
Yes.

520
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,239
My gratitude is without bounds

521
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,400
for Your Majesty's favor.

522
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,680
The recipe for the medicinal food...

523
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,079
Official Mei, please.

524
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

525
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,000
Your Majesty.

526
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,000
Recently, Your Majesty

527
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,839
looked very tired.

528
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,599
Government affairs are never done.

529
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,319
The chrysanthemums in the Qiongyuan Court

530
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,479
are beautiful.

531
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:42,119
Do you want to invite Her Majesty

532
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,400
to view the chrysanthemums together?

533
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,199
Continue. Why did you stop talking?

534
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,319
Your Majesty,

535
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,040
do you want me

536
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,680
to send a few pots to Yongning Palace?

537
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,599
Did I ask you to do that?

538
00:33:59,359 --> 00:33:59,920
Your Majesty, don't get angry.

539
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,920
My mouth

540
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,000
is clumsy

541
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,479
and has displeased Your Majesty.

542
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,160
It should be beaten.

543
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,120
Get out.

544
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,120
Wait.

545
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,800
Your Majesty.

546
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:17,239
How long has it been?

547
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,760
Is Your Majesty asking about
how long she's been grounded?

548
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,399
It's been two months.

549
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,560
I think Her Highness

550
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,239
must have reflected on herself.

551
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,719
You go to Yongning Palace

552
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,639
and ask her a question for me.

553
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,919
Your Highness,

554
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,040
Eunuch Yuan requests to see you.

555
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,120
Your Highness, I have a message from His Majesty.

556
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,639
Do you admit that you are wrong?

557
00:34:59,159 --> 00:34:59,959
Your Highness,

558
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,159
are you still mad?

559
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,919
Your Highness,

560
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,120
His Majesty grounded you

561
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,239
against

562
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,560
his own will.

563
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,120
Nowadays,

564
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,760
he doesn't enjoy looking at flowers,

565
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,280
or playing weiqi.

566
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,959
He wants to paint,

567
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,760
but turns around and puts down his brush.

568
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,639
Actually, His Majesty

569
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:24,840
thinks of you

570
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:27,320
all the time.

571
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,120
Now and then,

572
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,280
he'll send me to ask.

573
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,679
Why don't you succumb to him

574
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,760
and say something?

575
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,479
No.

576
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,000
Say three words: I was wrong.

577
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,840
I will immediately go back to report

578
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,239
and you may get out.

579
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,040
Your Highness.

580
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,479
Your Highness?

581
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,199
Your Highness!

582
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,919
I'll take my leave.

583
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,399
[Yongning Palace]

584
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,239
What happened?

585
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
Eunuch Yuan,

586
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,120
we are afraid that Her Highness
will get sick from boredom.

587
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,479
Please

588
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,919
ask His Majesty

589
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,879
to pardon Her Highness as soon as possible.

590
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,520
Fine, fine.

591
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,919
Sick from boredom?

592
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Even I don't believe that.

593
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,399
The imperial physician
checks her pulse every day.

594
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,520
If she is sick, he would have reported it already.

595
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,040
She is angry with His Majesty, right?

596
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,159
No, no.

597
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,159
She is too temperamental!

598
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,040
Eunuch Yuan.

599
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,760
Eunuch Yuan!

600
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,840
Your Majesty,

601
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,159
the Noble Consort said...

602
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,719
Sir,

603
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,919
this darn eunuch

604
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,399
is nasty.

605
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,639
How did the mistress of Yongning Palace

606
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,719
offend him?

607
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,360
I heard what he said.

608
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,399
He exaggerated and schemed.

609
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,199
Noble Consort Sun

610
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,280
is destined to offend vile characters.

611
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,879
She won't get out this time.

612
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,600
Do you think this eunuch,

613
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,080
he...

614
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,760
You talk more than him.

615
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,719
I...

616
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:54,479
I...

617
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,879
Sir,

618
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
did I say something wrong?

619
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,120
I...

620
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,080
Wait for me, sir.

621
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:04,725
[Kunning Palace]

622
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,040
During lunch,

623
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,679
Your Majesty

624
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,760
didn't touch the venison pot.

625
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,439
You've

626
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,520
not eaten your favorite

627
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,199
tiger eye candy.

628
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,560
You look

629
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,159
like you've lost a lot of weight too.

630
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,760
Your turn.

631
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:32,639
Your Majesty.

632
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,479
I've delivered this year's

633
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,800
Double-Nine Table for Cold Relief.

634
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,639
Eunuch Yuan.

635
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,639
You can send a junior eunuch

636
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,800
to run the errand.

637
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,840
Eunuch Yuan

638
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,239
is the favorite man by His Majesty's side.

639
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,360
How can we trouble you to do this?

640
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,199
Your Majesty,

641
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,840
I will always remember

642
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,040
your great kindness to me.

643
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,679
To be able to greet

644
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,120
Your Majesty

645
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,120
is a great honor for me.

646
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,560
I won't dare to be inattentive.

647
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,800
Eunuch Yuan,

648
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,639
months pass,

649
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,959
winter solstice is approaching.

650
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,320
Hasn't that person in Yongning Palace

651
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
finished her introspection?

652
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,919
Miaoxian.

653
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,399
It was a casual question.

654
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,239
Your Majesty,

655
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,919
permit me to boldly speculate on
His Majesty's intention.

656
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,399
Your Majesty can choose to listen.

657
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,040
His Majesty

658
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,439
originally planned to let Her Highness Sun

659
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,600
carry out introspection for three or five days

660
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,719
and then pardon her.

661
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,080
Guess what?

662
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,719
Her Highness Sun was stubborn

663
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,679
and was unwilling to admit her mistake.

664
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,000
His Majesty

665
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,399
wasn't angry at first,

666
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,719
but after a while,

667
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,159
he couldn't stand the suffering caused by her.

668
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,919
Right now,

669
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,080
no one dares mention this matter,

670
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,520
or His Majesty will definitely
hold us accountable.

671
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,840
It was just a small matter.

672
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,600
His Majesty has let it go.

673
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,120
She still won't yield.

674
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,120
Your Highness,

675
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,399
would His Majesty

676
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,560
tolerate anyone's temper?

677
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
He gave her face.

678
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:04,919
It's something

679
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,239
that other people desire.

680
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,800
His Highness Sun

681
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,560
doesn't understand His Majesty's disposition.

682
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,040
No matter how good his temper is,

683
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,439
he is still the son of heaven.

684
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,679
I think

685
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,959
Noble Consort Sun

686
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,840
will never get out.

687
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,520
That's interesting.

688
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,439
Your Majesty,

689
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
let's visit her.

690
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,080
Where were we just now?

691
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,439
Your Majesty,

692
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,280
permit me to leave first.

693
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,080
Your Majesty,

694
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,080
look at this incense burner with elephant ears.

695
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,520
It is simple yet elegant.

696
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,840
The Ministry of Rites made this replica

697
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,879
by referring to the specifications
of bronze implements

698
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:52,679
in the Illustrated

699
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,280
Catalogue of Antique Objects
from the Xuanhe Hall.

700
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,560
What do you think?

701
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,080
The shape is wrong.

702
00:40:59,199 --> 00:40:59,959
The color is uneven.

703
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,199
It feels rough to the touch.

704
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,040
What a waste.

705
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
It's such good Siamese tribute copper.

706
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,560
I remember

707
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,080
that Yongning Palace

708
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,000
has a three-legged incense burner

709
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,040
made by Jun ware.

710
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,679
It's as smooth as jade

711
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:14,719
and was made with superb craftsmanship.

712
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,280
It can be used as a reference.

713
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,040
Should I

714
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
force myself to take a look?

715
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,719
To avoid wasting good copper,

716
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,040
Your Majesty will have to tire yourself.

717
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,239
Alright.

718
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:38,760
Raise your hands.

719
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,399
I waited three months

720
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,439
for you to say a sentence.

721
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,280
Even if you write a confession,

722
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,360
it should be finished by now.

723
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,199
Do you think if you don't speak,

724
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,479
you can dismiss your mistake?

725
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,760
Did I punish you for no reason?

726
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,080
I want to punish you.

727
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,919
I punish you for keeping quiet
when you suffer indignation,

728
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,479
for taking the risk to test the medicine

729
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,560
instead of begging me,

730
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,080
for hiding everything from me,

731
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,199
for always staying on guard against me,

732
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,199
and for always treating me like an outsider.

733
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,280
You said it yourself.

734
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,800
Outside the study, I am the Emperor.

735
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,560
What you did was deceive the Emperor.

736
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,080
Inside the study, I am your husband.

737
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,679
What you did was akin to
rebelling against your husband.

738
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,679
Talk.

739
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:11,560
Why don't you talk?

740
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,439
Are you dumb?

741
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,840
Your Majesty, there is an urgent report
from Guangxi.
