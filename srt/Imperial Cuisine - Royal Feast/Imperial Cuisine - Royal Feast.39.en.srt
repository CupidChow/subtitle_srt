There's also a cellar inside it.

5
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:47,440
We've tried

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,639
various storage methods.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
Unfortunately, much of the food

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,639
was eaten by bugs and gone rotten.

9
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,080
There are all dried rice

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
and soybeans hidden there.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,919
So this is the secret

12
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,120
that you've been hiding.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,839
It's not considered a secret anyway.

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
We just never made it publicly known.

15
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,959
Matron Meng said we must prepare for rainy days.

16
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,559
So we can use them in times of famine.

In that case,

That's great.

It's great.

You're the one to talk.

Matron Meng is truly remarkable

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,240

Yuehua,

58
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
I've been thinking

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
about why

60
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,440

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Perhaps

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,759
it was me who neglected you in the past.

63
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,839
You're such a strange person.

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880

Even if she had Empress Dowager's decree,

of all the poisonous wild herbs.

165
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,640
Go to the beggars in the city

166
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,679
to make up words and sing them as a song.

167
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,159
It must be able to teach the people

168
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,320
how to differentiate poisonous herbs

169
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,640
so that they won't eat them by mistake.

170
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes, Your Highness.

171
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,479
Your Majesty,

172
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,840
leave it here.

00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,400
Le'an is right in front of you.

175

how many...

How many years have you served me?

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,599
I've started serving Your Majesty

183
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,119
when I entered the palace at six.

184
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,039
It has been about 24 years now.

185
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,840
I remember when you first entered the palace,

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,280
you took me as a playmate

187
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,559
and took me to climb trees.

188
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,239
We were caught.

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,039
But I don't remember

190
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
what happened after that.

191
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,479
I remember what had happened.

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,719
After that,

193
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,400
Yongle Emperor was furious

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
and almost ordered the guards

195
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,840
to beat me up.

196
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,440
It was you

197
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,559
who pleaded for me.

198
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,520
That was how I escaped from death.

199
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,880
Do you know everyone said
you're a treacherous eunuch

200
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,119
who's timid and loves to flatter?

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
That's slander.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,119
That's absolutely slander.

203
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,400
Your Majesty,

204
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,239
it's a slander.

205
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,239
Your Majesty.

206
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,599
Get up.

207
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,799
I know

208
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,760
there were times

209
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,599
that you were brave too.

210
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:25,919
That year,

211
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,320
I followed Grandfather
on his war expedition in the north

212
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,440
and was caught in the enemy's camp.

213
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,840
From 500 cavalry to 13 cavalries.

214
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,239
I remember

215
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,640
this incident vividly.

216
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,880
You were only 16 at the time.

217
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,799
But you were a valiant soldier.

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
You shot down

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,760
the enemy's general from his horse

220
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,599
with an arrow.

221
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,799
The enemy panicked.

222
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,359
That was how we managed to break the siege.

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
That year,

224
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,799
you were the only one

225
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,000
who breached the siege with me.

226
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
I think you were shot by two arrows.

227
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:03,760
Your Majesty,

228
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
I'd have to protect you

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
even if I had to die.

230
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,080
I can only die in peace

231
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,520
as long as I manage

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to escort you away safely.

233
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:18,960
It's just that the arrows shot

234
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,320
at my bottom.

235
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,599
So I was laughed at for a long time.

236
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,159
Your Majesty...

237
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,479
Nothing.

238
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,200
Before we left the palace,

239
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,799
Noble Consort Sun has taught us two

240
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,520
of your favorite midnight snacks.

241
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,719
Would you like to...

242
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

243
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,100
[Le'an]

244
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,880
Summon Grand Academician Yang Shiqi now!

245
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,080
Hurry.

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,440
How is it?

248
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,919
Hurry.

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,760
All right.

250
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,580
[Le'an]

251
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:37,640
Your Lordship.

252
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,919
The Emperor is dead.

253
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,679
It's time for a decisive battle.

254
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,000
Open the city gates!

255
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,719
Yes, Your Lordship.

256
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,599
Your Majesty.

257
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,079
Your Majesty.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,880
Zhanji.

259
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,959
Why are you still here?

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,239
Your Majesty,

261
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
Empress is still in the sick berth.

262
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,400
She's concerned about you.

263
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,760
So I'm here to share her burden.

264
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,520
So it's right that I serve you.

265
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,599
Sit.

266
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,839
If she didn't tell you to come,

267
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
are you not coming, then?

268
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,959
You are the Noble Consort,

269
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,959
the second-highest ranking in this palace.

270
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:03,160
It's not the place for the rest to serve me.

271
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

272
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,119
I'd still come

273
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,239
even if the Empress didn't tell me to come.

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,239
Why?

275
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,400
You're His Majesty's birth mother.

276
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Judging by the number of days,

277
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,160
the army should have reached Le'an now.

278
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,760
But isn't there

279
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,400
any report from the army?

280
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:57,640
I don't agree

281
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,319
with the Emperor leading the army in person.

282
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,400
Without the Emperor here,

283
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,640
I don't feel at ease

284
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,400
with him away.

285
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,239
His Majesty is blessed

286
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
by heaven.

287
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Heaven will definitely help

288
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,239
His Majesty return with victory.

289
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
The Empress never dares to talk back at me.

290
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,520
I only

291
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,880
answer what I know, nothing else.

292
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,640
Let me ask you this, then.

293
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,359
Have you finally

294
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
let go of the idea

295
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
of changing the ancestral instructions?

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,599
Your Majesty,

297
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,439
the ancestral instructions
will be passed down forever

298
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,400
if it's right.

299
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,680
If otherwise,

300
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,439
I'll see it perish

301
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,239
with my own eyes

302
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,599
one day.

303
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,880
If...

304
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,479
If I fail to do it,

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,959
there will be someone after me to do it.

306
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,439
It seems like

307
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,040
I've found myself

308
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,920
a tough opponent.

309
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,079
Return to your palace.

310
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,280
It's going

311
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,479
to be a long night.

312
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,880
The Prince of Zhao is farsighted.

313
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,359
He ordered us to help you seize

314
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,000
the palace gate at the second watch tonight.

315
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,719
This gift is for you.

316
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,719
Before more imperial armies find out,

317
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:31,920
we must hold Empress Dowager captive first.

318
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
So no one dares to fight back.

319
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Take action now.

320
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,719
Hurry!

321
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,439
[Jixian Inn]
Your Lordship!

322
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,800
Your Lordship, if...

323
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,560
Your Lordship,

324
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,719
if Empress Dowager finds out,

325
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,160
she'll be infuriated.

326
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,560
My brother entrusts the state affair to me.

327
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,079
I'm managing the country.

328
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,479
She always humiliates me.

329
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,800
She's gone too far!

330
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,479
A woman is usurping a man's power!

331
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,319
Your Lordship, hush. There are ears everywhere.

332
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,040
Get lost!

333
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,319
Get lost!

334
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,040
Your Lordship! Your Lordship!

335
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,719
-Your Lordship!
-Your Lordship!

336
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,760
Your Lordship, watch your step.

337
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,599
Instead of following the Emperor's order,

338
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
what are you doing here?

339
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Your Lordship,

340
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,319
I need a favor from you.

341
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,280
What are you doing?

342
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,160
Let me go!

343
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,079
What's this? No, I don't want to eat it.

344
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,160
Let's go!

345
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,000
Let me go!

346
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,719
Jin,

347
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,560
go to Kunning Palace in person

348
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,319
and pick

349
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,560
some winter clothes

350
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,199
and the Empress's favorite snacks.

351
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
The sick berth doesn't have much food.

352
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,040
The weather is getting colder lately.

353
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,319
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,280
Zijin! Zijin!

355
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,959
Stop!

356
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,479
What are you doing?

357
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,760
Where's the Empress?

358
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Your Highness!

359
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,280
I... I know.

360
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,560
I know.

361
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,719
Don't harm them.

362
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,079
I'll go with you.

363
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,780
[Guang'an Gate]

364
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,119
Jin.

365
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,479
Huaping.

366
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,079
Your Majesty.

367
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,560
There's a coup in the palace.

368
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,239
The Imperial City...

369
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,479
It's likely the whole capital city

370
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,719
is under the rebels' control.

371
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,319
Before His Majesty left the capital city,

372
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,079
he ordered Duke Xu Yongchang

373
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,800
and the Earl of Chengbo,
Zhang Chang to defend the Imperial City.

374
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,079
Also,

375
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,719
the Marquis of Anxiang, Zhang An,

376
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,719
and Earl of Guangning,
Liu Rui, garrisoned the capital city.

377
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,000
How could they easily rob the military power?

378
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:52,920
They...

379
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,719
What if

380
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,599
the Regents, Prince of Zheng and Prince of Xiang,

381
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,880
fall into the hands of the rebels?

382
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,800
And Empress Dowager too.

383
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,439
No one would dare to make any move.

384
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,359
What will they do to us?

385
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,959
I deliberately told them

386
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,199
this is the isolation room
for infectious diseases.

387
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,719
So they only

388
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,119
quarantined this place.

389
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,199
Sir,

390
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,000
we've driven out

391
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,359
the Imperial Army in the Forbidden City

392
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,959
and control the Forbidden City
and Imperial City.

393
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,079
There were many high-ranking ministers close

394
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,400
to the Emperor protecting the compounds.

395
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,599
How can my foster father be unprepared

396
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,479
after years of plotting?

397
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,119
It's funny to think that the Emperor thought

398
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,079
that everything would be fine

399
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,199
if he eradicated the power of the Prince of Han.

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,319
He didn't know what was waiting for him.

401
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,160
But

402
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,239
we don't know the whereabouts
of Prince of Xiang, Zhu Zhanshan.

403
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,599
Search the city.

404
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,439
Yes, sir.

405
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,160
Your Majesty?

406
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:48,880
Guards!

407
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,839
-Your Majesty!
-Don't move.

408
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,680
Her Majesty has passed out.

409
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,599
Guards!

410
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,160
Why are you yelling?

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,079
Her Majesty has a high fever.

412
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,959
Bring the imperial physician here now.

413
00:26:59,199 --> 00:26:59,959
Why are you standing there?

414
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,479
Didn't you want

415
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,439
to hold the Empress as your hostage?

416
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,680
If she dies,

417
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,959
how are you going to answer?

418
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,680
Go now!

419
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,359
Also,

420
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,839
bring Her Majesty's

421
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,719
maid here too.

422
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,239
Sir.

423
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:44,959
Sir.

424
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,920
The Empress is suddenly ill.

425
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,239
It looks like it's pretty serious.

426
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,079
She vomited all the medicine I fed her.

427
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,599
She just stained these clothes.

428
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,719
Are you trying to send out a message?

429
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:10,719
Take her away.

430
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,160
Your Majesty,

431
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,640
you have a fever.

432
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,479
Stay away from me.

433
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,119
Let me take a look.

434
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,479
You only control the capital city.

435
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,359
There are more than one million soldiers
in every town combined.

436
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,239
The empire hasn't

437
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,199
fallen into your hands yet.

438
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,479
The Empress is still useful to you.

439
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,640
Summon the imperial physician.

440
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,319
The sick berth is filled with diseases.

441
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,640
The Empress's illness is serious.

442
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,959
If you were infected,

443
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,239
you'd die with her.

444
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,400
Leave this place with me now.

445
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,000
Summon the imperial physician.

446
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,000
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,319
If it weren't for her,

448
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,599
you'd be

449
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,239
the Empress.

450
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:29,920
I can't believe you want to protect her.

451
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,719
It's the strangest thing in the world.

452
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,000
The Empress

453
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,479
is of high status.

454
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,719
Yet, she risked her life.

455
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
If she didn't come here,

456
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,839
she wouldn't be infected.

457
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If this matter gets out,

458
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,640
it's also a strange thing.

459
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,439
Mine is nothing out of the ordinary.

460
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,239
You're seeking death.

461
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
You're a high-ranking officer

462
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,560
with a bright future.

463
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,079
You're also taking the risk

464
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,719
to be part of the rebellion.

465
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,119
Isn't this seeking death too?

466
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,599
We never had

467
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,000
a nice conversation.

468
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,160
I seldom argue with people.

469
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,280
So it's my fault, then.

470
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,439
If Zhu Zhanji doesn't return,

471
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,199
the Great Ming will have a new emperor.

472
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,319
What would you do?

473
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,599
You're a smart person.

474
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,319
A smart person makes
a smart choice depending on the situation.

475
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,319
You will not

476
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,599
die with Zhu Zhanji.

477
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,199
All the hardships

478
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:02,599
are upon me.

479
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,439
I can, and I'm willing to endure it

480
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,760
because that person is Zhu Zhanji.

481
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,319
That is all.

482
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,599
It's a pity

483
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,640
that I no longer

484
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:26,760
have the chance

485
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
to tell him this.

486
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,560
Imperial Physician.

487
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,079
Your Majesty.

488
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
What a fool.

489
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,719
How is she?

490
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,599
Your Highness, forgive me for my incompetence.

491
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,160
This illness...

492
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:30,599
Imperial Physician,

493
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:34,839
brew medicine

494
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,520
based on this prescription.

495
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,880
Anemarrhena can dispel
internal heat and dehydration.

496
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,040
It nourishes Yin energy and relieves asthma.

497
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,839
Lanxangia tsaoko can dispel phlegm
and prevent malaria.

498
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:44,760
Imperial Physician,

499
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,520
go and prepare the medicine.

500
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,199
Father.

501
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,439
Well done, my son.

502
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,239
It's all thanks to you.

503
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:12,400
Follow me to Qingning Palace.

504
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:34,560
Run!

505
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:04,719
Imperial Physician.

506
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,679
Your Majesty.

507
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,560
I can't treat this illness.

508
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,560
It can't be cured!

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Imperial Physician,

510
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,040
you can't leave!

511
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
Imperial Physician!

512
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,639
Your Majesty,

513
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,399
you'll get better after you drink this medicine.

514
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,199
You said

515
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,760
you could leave

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,320
the sick berth safely after entering it.

517
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,120
You'll keep your word.

518
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,120
Your Majesty!

519
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,639
Your Majesty!

520
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,320
Your Majesty!

521
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,080
Stay away.

522
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,520
Don't come any closer.

523
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,639
That woman's illness...

524
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,120
The physician back then

525
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,360
only prescribe medicine
to dispel humidity in her body.

526
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,159
The medicine doesn't cure the root of the cause.

527
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,239
My grandfather

528
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,959
studied for decades

529
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,639
and left a prescription for the fever.

530
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,320
I let the woman drink it.

531
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,040
But there was no obvious effect.

532
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,120
I thought

533
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,520
the medicine would cure the root cause.

534
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,520
It was just the disease was too serious
that needed extra dosage.

535
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,679
So I increased the dosage for Lanxangia tsaoko

536
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,320
and magnolia-bark.

537
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,199
It looks like it doesn't work this time either.

538
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,360
Go now.

539
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:25,959
I'm not going anywhere.

540
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,399
When I was enjoying infinite glory

541
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,159
as the Consort of the Great Imperial Grandson,

542
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,719
you were confined

543
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,879
where you had nowhere to go.

544
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,439
I'm the cause of your misfortune.

545
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,600
But you've never resented me.

546
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,560
If I were you,

547
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,679
I wouldn't

548
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,520
have the amount of tolerance you have.

549
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,639
Your Majesty,

550
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,679
I'm not as good as you said.

551
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm a petty person.

552
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,479
I've never forgotten

553
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
what you've said.

554
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,479
Even if

555
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
I always wanted to win you

556
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:11,439
from the bottom of my heart one day,
I must win you.

557
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,719
You risked

558
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,840
your life to save others.

559
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I can never

560
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,479
be that selfless.

561
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,239
Is that so?

562
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,840
But I'm dying from this illness soon.

563
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,120
Yet, you're the one beside me.

564
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,280
Life is indeed unpredictable.

565
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,080
I always think

566
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,520
I'm a useless person

567
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,919
in the palace.

568
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
But when I'm here,

569
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,280
I feel unrestrained

570
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,800
and comfortable.

571
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,320
Your Majesty.

572
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,439
You'll recover.

573
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,919
Everything will be fine.

574
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,879
Zijin,

575
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,800
I need to entrust you with something.

576
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,600
In the past,

577
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,199
I couldn't do well no matter how hard I tried,

578
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,399
but I know

579
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,959
you can do well.

580
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,520
Accompany him,

581
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,239
motivate him,

582
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,560
and never abandon him.

583
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,199
I know

584
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,479
it's lonely to be in a high position.

585
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,800
He is more afraid of loneliness than I am.

586
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,800
Your Majesty.

587
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
It'll be fine.

588
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,760
I'm tired.

589
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm very tired.

590
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,719
It's so dark here.

591
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,679
Zijin.

592
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

593
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't want to be alone.

594
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
You won't be alone.

595
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,360
I'll stay here with you.

596
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,060
[Qingning Palace]

597
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,000
I heard you're seriously ill.

598
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,520
So I'm here to see you.

599
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,439
Prince of Zhao,

600
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,959
you left your fief and entered the palace
with your army

601
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,360
without being summoned at this hour.

602
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,840
What's your purpose?

603
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
Sister-in-law, calm down.

604
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,919
I heard my second brother...

605
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,399
No, he doesn't deserve to be called that.

606
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,639
This traitor, Zhu Gaoxu had raised

607
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,800
a rebellion against the Emperor.

608
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,479
The refugees in the capital took
the opportunity to make trouble

609
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,159
and the empire of the Great Ming is in danger.

610
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,800
As the Emperor's uncle,

611
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,919
how can I sit by and do nothing?

612
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,239
So

613
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,080
you're here at this late hour

614
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,439
to protect the royal family?

615
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:08,520
Of course.

616
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,360
I guess you still don't know

617
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,679
that the Emperor...

618
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,639
My good nephew,

619
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,919
Zhanji, was killed

620
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:21,239
by the traitor, Zhu Gaoxu,

621
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,360
in Le'an.

622
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,199
Sister-in-law,

623
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,040
write an edict

624
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,959
to appoint me to manage the state affair.

625
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,120
I'll mobilize the soldiers from every town

626
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,080
to the capital city

627
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,040
to fight Zhu Gaoxu to the death

628
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,320
and avenge Zhu Zhanji's death.

629
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,639
Sister-in-law,

630
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,840
Prince of Zheng and Prince of Xiang,
who are in charge of the state affair,

631
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,320
and the Empress and concubines

632
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,159
in the imperial harem are in danger.

633
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,159
I suggest you think about this carefully.

634
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,239
If you insist on refusing me...

635
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,879
You can't resist

636
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,159
the Imperial Army

637
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,879
and the garrisoned troops in the capital city.

638
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,439
You only want to hold the concubines

639
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:12,040
and me captive

640
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,840
and capture the important ministers

641
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,800
to threaten the Emperor.

642
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,800
If I refuse,

643
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,399
you'll kill Prince of Xiang and the Empress.

644
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:20,959
Am I right?

645
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,080
Zhu Gaosui,

646
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,520
is Prince of Xiang even in your hands?

647
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,239
Close the doors!

648
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,280
Yes, sir!

649
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,760
Your Lordship,

650
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,080
the Imperial Army has surrounded
the Imperial City.

651
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:15,360
What?

652
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:27,719
Zhu Gaosui,

653
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,280
when my son dares
to entrust everything here to me

654
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,399
while he went to war,

655
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,439
did you really think

656
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,199
I'm just a display

657
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,760
after supporting the Late Emperor for years?

658
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:38,439
You can go out

659
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,320
and see for yourself outside.

660
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I'll have to trouble Your Majesty

661
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,360
to escort us out.

662
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,439
Mother!

663
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,719
It's impossible for the Prince of Xiang

664
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,679
orchestrates such a plot.

665
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,879
Can the person who commands

666
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,000
the Imperial Army show yourself now?

667
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:01,879
Zhu Zhanji?

668
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,560
Third Uncle,

669
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,120
I thought you wanted to reunite with your family.

670
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
I brought Second Uncle back,

671
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,280
so you won't be disappointed.
