[Royal Feast]

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,580
[Episode 40]

3
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,180
[Le'an]

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,559
Be on the alert!

5
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,160
Retreat to the city!

6
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,839
Third Uncle.

7
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,279
Did You Yifan tell you

8
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,039
that after the capital was seized,

9
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,679
you should make an excuse

10
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
to trick the Prince of Han into the palace

11
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
and wait for a chance to get rid of him

12
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,520
so that you can ascend the throne?

13
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,080
Third Brother,

14
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,919
he told me

15
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,320
that you were taken hostage in the capital.

16
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,800
If I deployed the troops north,

17
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,119
he would accuse you

18
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,360
of killing Empress Dowager

19
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,360
and then I could be

20
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,240
a virtuous prince who rid His Majesty
of evil ministers.

21
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,559
After the Prince of Han entered the capital,

22
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,199
You Yifan

23
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,960
would kill him and blame you

24
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,679
and then restore his status.

25
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,559
He'll be the real winner.

26
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,119
You two

27
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,839
are just his pawns.

28
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Yifan,

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
is this true?

30
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,839
What an ungrateful

31
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,440
and capricious villain!

32
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Have you forgotten

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,279
how I treated you?

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,600
How dare you betray me now?

35
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,679
Father, you were nice to me.

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
That year, you threw me to the wolves

37
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,600
and purposely turned back to save me.

38
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,839
I was young and alone,
but I had to face the wolves myself.

39
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,320
I will never forget

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,399
your kindness.

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Your Majesty,

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,600
I was held hostage by him.

43
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,040
He planned everything.

44
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,320
He coerced me.

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
That was why I made this big mistake.

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,559
Your Majesty.

47
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,279
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, save me. Your Majesty.

48
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,119
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

49
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:34,640
Your Majesty,

50
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,239
save me!

51
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:35,959
Your Majesty!

52
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,959
Your Majesty!

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
Disobedient maniac!

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
Did you plan everything

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,600
to take revenge

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
on your biological father?

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,799
You are truly my good son.

58
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,359
Do you know

59
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
that if I ascend the throne
and become the Emperor,

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,359
you will be the future son of heaven?

61
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,200
Because of hatred,

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
you ruined everything that was within reach.

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
You are an out-an-out lunatic.

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
You destroyed

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,200
all of us along with you!

66
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,720
This is retribution.

67
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,679
It is karma!

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,559
You Yifan.

69
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,239
No.

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
It should be Zhu Zhanli.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,079
Release Empress Dowager.

72
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,119
Zhu Zhanji,

73
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,480
if you were me,

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,399
would you give up?

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,399
Sir, be careful!

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,519
Your Majesty!

77
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,920
Zhanji.

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Are you alright?

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,279
I'm fine.

80
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,079
Send Empress Dowager back.

81
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:01,880
Yes.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,559
Your Majesty!

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,519
Release the arrows!

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Wait,

85
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,399
I want him alive.

86
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,320
Sir!

87
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,519
Zhu Zhanji.

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,519
You and I both have the royal bloodline.

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,079
We are the grandsons of our grandfather.

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,480
You have been pampered from birth,

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,279
while I repeatedly risked my life
to save his life.

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
But he still regarded me as nothing.

93
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,040
Why?

94
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,000
In terms of competency in government, martial arts,
mental ability, and resourcefulness,

95
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,200
am I inferior to you?

96
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,359
You are a wise ruler

97
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,440
who is praised by all,

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,279
while I stain my hands with blood

99
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,320
and am eternally reviled.

100
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,839
Why?

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
The people suffered
in the northern military expedition,

102
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,600
during the wanton relocation of the capital,

103
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,720
and in the long-distance water transport
of grain to the capital.

104
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
They endured hard labor services

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,399
and starved year after year.

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,679
While they,

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,519
the descendants of the Zhu family,

108
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,720
fought with and tried to kill each other

109
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,600
for positions and power.

110
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,279
Has anyone ever said

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,399
that they fought for the throne

112
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,399
to help the country

113
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,440
and save disaster victims?

114
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,480
They were greedy and stupid
but enjoyed the emolument of office without merit.

115
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,200
They were the imperial clan
and therefore enjoyed emolument.

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,679
Why should they?

117
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,079
My grandfather marched in battle arrays.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,839
Didn't he want to be an emperor in peacetime

119
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,320
and the son of heaven who had no worries?

120
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
However, the northern part of the Gobi Desert
wasn't peaceful

121
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,440
and the people at the borders were uneasy.

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,200
The riverways were blocked,
and the canals needed upgrading.

123
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,239
Far away,

124
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,600
envoys were dispatched in all directions.

125
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,479
That wasn't for momentary and short-term success.

126
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,239
Grandfather wanted to protect

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,159
long-term reign

128
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
and seek everlasting benefits.

129
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
Everyone in the land could misunderstand him,

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,719
but you and I shouldn't.

131
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,440
As for royal ills,

132
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,080
what Grandfather was reluctant to give up,
I would.

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Why?

134
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,039
I want you alive.

135
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,559
How many people could understand

136
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
the regrets of my grandfather?

137
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:18,119
He wanted peace and prosperity under heaven.

138
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,479
I want you to witness that.

139
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,119
Zhanli!

140
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:50,840
Sir!

141
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,320
Yunzhou!

142
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
A person who murdered his wife

143
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
should be punished by hacking.

144
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,479
What is the punishment

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
for a person who kills his father?

146
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
There are no bandits in the mountains,

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
no vagabonds on the streets,

148
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
no mediocre ministers in the imperial court,

149
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,239
and no starvation in the country.

150
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,919
That is my dream country.

151
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,640
I promise you

152
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,119
that I will spare no effort

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
to make the Great Ming prosper

154
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,520
and bring peace to the common people.

155
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,840
Zhu Zhanji,

156
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,359
remember the vow you made today.

157
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Don't disappoint the great country

158
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,239
he left you.

159
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,740
[Kunning Palace]

160
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,520
You're awake.

161
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,239
That was

162
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,159
a very long night.

163
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,200
Come.

164
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,159
Thank you.

165
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,320
Thank you.

166
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
You can get it in front too.

167
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,679
Go to the front.

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,200
If it's not enough, you can have more helpings.

169
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,359
Thank you.

170
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,039
Careful.

171
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,080
Thank you, miss.

172
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
Miss.

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
The queue for porridge
has gotten shorter lately.

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,479
-Here.
-You're nice, miss.

175
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Go.

176
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,559
You're back.

177
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
I knew already.

178
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,400
Thank you.

179
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,000
I have something to say to you, mister.

180
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,359
Over the years,

181
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,440
I've honed my skills.

182
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,479
I wanted to become a matron.

183
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:15,320
I have always adored you.

184
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,119
I've not forgotten even for one day.

185
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,479
However, those walls made of food

186
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,840
are a promise that I must keep my whole life.

187
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,559
This promise has a bearing
on the lives of many people.

188
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,039
So, I didn't strive to become the matron.

189
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,159
I tolerated the pain

190
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,039
of not confessing to you.

191
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,559
Although I'm just a humble cook,

192
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,119
there are things I must do.

193
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Now that everyone knows the secret,

194
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:58,520
I can tell you my secret

195
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,119
so that I will have no regrets.

196
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,119
Thank you

197
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,679
for letting me finish my speech.

198
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:13,919
So,

199
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,400
farewell.

200
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,880
Move the food inside quickly.

201
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Cover it.

202
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,440
Don't let it get wet.

203
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Keep the food.

204
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,760
Cover it. Quickly.

205
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,359
Cover it. Quickly.

206
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,880
Cover this!

207
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,520
Come on.

208
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:02,840
Cover it.

209
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,599
Those over there were covered.

210
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,000
There!

211
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,560
There's another cart there.

212
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,479
Quick! Pull it back.

213
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:23,959
Come on!

214
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,000
Get up quickly.

215
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,199
Matron Meng rendered
a great meritorious service.

216
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,119
Empress Dowager grants you
a reinstatement to your original position,

217
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,239
but

218
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,800
there is one more thing you have to do.

219
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:26,079
It's a pity to have food but no wine.

220
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,599
What?

221
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,599
Did they ask you to bid me my last farewell?

222
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,520
Empress Dowager said

223
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,680
that I'm your old friend.

224
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,959
She wanted me to bid farewell to you.

225
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,800
After that, I will be reinstated.

226
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,560
She even wants to promote me to a higher rank.

227
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,000
That's the Great Ming's
only top-ranking female official.

228
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,560
I remember that when our mother was alive,

229
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,560
the favorite food

230
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,800
among the three brothers

231
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,800
was our mother's handmade dumplings.

232
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,119
I miss it more than any delicacies.

233
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,359
I spent my whole life

234
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,760
overcoming obstacles

235
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,479
and fighting bloody battles.

236
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,439
I did my best for my father's territory,

237
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,439
but he expelled me to Le'an

238
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,719
because of his precious eldest grandson.

239
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,680
Maybe

240
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,280
he knew Zhanli's identity,

241
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,239
but he deliberately buried

242
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,959
the sword that would pierce my chest.

243
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,640
What about you?

244
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,319
I protected you for so many years

245
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,520
but got this glass of wine instead.

246
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,199
Funny.

247
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,280
In my whole life,

248
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,880
I am empty-handed.

249
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Congratulations to the only top-ranking
female official

250
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
of the Great Ming.

251
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:18,959
Ziyun!

252
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,239
In my life,

253
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,959
I had been a death row inmate

254
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,479
and the highest-ranking female official
in Great Ming.

255
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,839
I've fulfilled my long-cherished wish.

256
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,800
I also paid the only debt I owed in my life.

257
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,319
I feel so relaxed now.

258
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,520
How is it?

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,199
I'm more awesome than you.

260
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,560
How can you?

261
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,400
Thank you.

262
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,479
Thank you for saving me back then.

263
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,640
I've always kept that in my heart.

264
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,800
There were so many things

265
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,599
that I wanted to do.

266
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,119
I am sorry.

267
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:28,959
Now,

268
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,280
I can finally go with you

269
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,959
and repay half a lifetime's affection from you.

270
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,680
(Matron Meng was willing to exchange
her merits for your life.)

271
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,959
(Your punishment is commuted
to a lifetime of hard labor.)

272
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,479
(By the decree of gracious Empress Dowager,)

273
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,520

[Chunyou Gate]

276
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,439
Mother!

277
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,719
Mother, I was wrong.

278
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,040
I was wrong, Mother.

279
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,439
I am sorry.

280
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,359
I'm sorry, Mother.

281
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,920
I am sorry.

00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,680
(During the disaster relief in the capital,)

283
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,719
(the Imperial Food Service
rendered great service.)

[Fine Meal, Divine Work]
By Empress Dowager's oral instruction,

285
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:32,959
from now on, Yin Ziping is promoted
to the matron of the Great Ming.

286
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,479
Great!

287
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,760
Thank Empress Dowager for the favor!

288
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,439
-Yes.
-Yes.

289
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,959
Ziping, thank Empress Dowager!

290
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,119
Thank Empress Dowager, Matron Yin.

292
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank Empress Dowager!

293

-Matron Yin.
-Come on.

294
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,199
Directress Yin said

295
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,079
that she honed her culinary skills

296
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,599
to win true respect from everyone

297
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
and become the matron of the Ming Dynasty.

Ziping

299
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,239
did very well.

300
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,880
Now, she's going to succeed.

301
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,640
Directress Yin said

302
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,880
that Your Highness was right.

303
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,400
A person who still has evil thoughts

304
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,920
will feel remorseful and uneasy

305
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,280
in her position.

306
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,760
Your Highness understands

307
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,400
that someone else

308
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,079
should be the matron.

309
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,880
(I should have said goodbye,)

310
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,400
(but I was afraid I couldn't bear leaving.)

311
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:15,000
(Zijin, you once said)

312
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,680
(that there is always someone better than you.)

313
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,839
(The wonders of cooking are hidden
in the common folks.)

Your Majesty.

332
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,079
It has been verified
that in the name of the palace,

333
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,160
Yuan Qi sent people to Guangdong
for procurement

334
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,000
and exploited the people's wealth
and extorted excessive taxes and levies.

335
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,640
By the law of the Great Ming...

336
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,839
Yuan Qi
