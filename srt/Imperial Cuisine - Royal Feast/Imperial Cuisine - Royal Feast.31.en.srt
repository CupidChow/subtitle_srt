00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,279
Your Majesty.

4
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:05,039
Long live Your Majesty!

5
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,399
How does Your Majesty know

6
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,000
that I'm here?

7
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,279
Because you don't like Yongning Palace.

8
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,720
Why is that so?

9
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,759
Because I don't like it either.

10
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,199
I helped Your Majesty find out the truth.

11
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,039
It was done with good intention.

12
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:35,279
Why did Your Majesty blame a good person?

13
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,039
Liar.

14
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,279
Sacrificial burial
is one of the instructions of the ancestors.

15
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,039
What you did

16
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,559
would make Mother think

17
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,360
that you still bear a grudge

18
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
and deliberately gave her trouble.

19
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,399
I was afraid that Your Majesty would be deceived.

20
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,399
I think you were sympathetic to

21
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,960
the Prince of Wei and his mother.

22
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,039
Didn't you, Your Majesty?

23
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,360
What's that got to do with me?

24
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Your Majesty promised me

25
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240
that you wouldn't treat me like a maid.

26
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,839
Did I wrongly think

27
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
that I'm the favored one?

28
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
In Your Majesty's heart,

29
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,399
I'm not as important as that jar.

30
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,399
Didn't I do that...

31
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,279
Your Majesty fooled me.

32
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,320
Hongwu Emperor laid down an iron-clad rule

33
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,519
forbidding the imperial harem
from interfering in political affairs.

34
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,760
Your Majesty does not allow anyone

35
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
to go what is above and beyond the call of duty.

36
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,399
You might listen to Empress Dowager's advice

37
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,440
if it suits you.

38
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,480
As for other people,

39
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
they should learn from it.

40
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,079
Am I right?

41
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:00,959
Outrageous!

42
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,799
Your Majesty wants me to say the truth,

43
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,559
but you are the supreme ruler

44
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,480
and the master of the land under heaven.

45
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,880
In front of you,

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,959
I can't even cry to my heart's content,

47
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,239
let alone tell the truth.

48
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,559
Why?

49
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,200
If Your Majesty finds me pleasing,

50
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,040
I can be a weeping beauty
and still, win your love and compassion.

51
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,959
If one day you get bored with me,

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,959
crying is disrespectful.

53
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
You give an order,

54
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,839
and countless people will decorate the palace

55
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,760
and hang lanterns high up.

56
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,600
However, I made this little puppet

57
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
myself.

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,480
Your Majesty,

59
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,959
you hope that I am sincere with you,

60
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,600
but when I said what I wanted

61
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,959
and did what I wanted,

62
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,440
you lost your temper.

63
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,600
You put me on the spot.

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
What do you want then?

65
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,359
Outside this study,

66
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll do my duty

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
and be a good concubine,

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,920
but in here,

69
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,760
you are you,

70
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,160
and I am me,

71
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,600
just like always.

72
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,399
Isn't it good

73
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,959
to be a favored consort

74
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,920
and live a carefree life

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,559
under my wings?

76
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,880
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,519
For many years,

78
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,839
many people taught me

79
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,920
how to be obedient and patient

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,079
and how to please Your Majesty.

81
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,799
However,

82
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,359
when I was in the Imperial Food Service,

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,799
I understood

84
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,519
that I have a heart and I am a human.

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,959
A human

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,720
has her opinions and ideas

87
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,279
that may contradict Your Majesty's

88
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,640
and even offend Your Majesty.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,519
However, I like myself this way.

90
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,480
Even if Your Majesty wants me to go back,

91
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,239
I can't anymore.

92
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,040
But that was my true self.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,279
You must understand

94
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,760
that if you want to be treated as equals,

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,839
I will set different demands

96
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,279
on you.

97
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm afraid...

98
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:24,519
I'm afraid some of the responsibilities
might overwhelm you.

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
You are asking for trouble.

100
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,160
Mr. Chen, I will deliver.

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,440
Leave.

102
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,119
Leave quickly.

103
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,280
Let's talk outside.

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What happened to the Empress?

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
Answer Empress Dowager's question

106
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,719
truthfully.

107
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,159
Your Majesty,

108
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,599
maybe it's because Her Majesty thinks too much.

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
Every night,

110
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
she would lock herself up in the bedroom alone,

111
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
and cried and laughed.

112
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,479
During day time, I sounded her out,

113
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,640
but she never remembered anything.

114
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
Why didn't you report earlier?

115
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,719
Your Majesty,

116
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,719
I dare not spread this outside.

117
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,440
I am wrong and deserve to die.

118
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,239
How did she get hysteria all of a sudden?

119
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,200
Did I

120
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,919
push her too hard?

121
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,119
Your Majesty,

122
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,719
it's probably not that simple.

123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,359
(The lady Sun is of noble birth)

124
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,159
(and carefully chosen at a young age.)

125
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,599
(She served as an imperial concubine
for a long time.)

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She has the splendor of a woman of virtues;

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,679
is respectful, serious, kind, and amicable;

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,080
has jade-like qualities;

129
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,039
(is modest and pure;)

130
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,280
(and follows the rules of the Book of Songs,
the Book of History, and other books and history;)

131
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,440
(She is suitable for a harmonious relationship.)

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,919
(She gets up at the crack of dawn,)

133
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,000
(works hard day and night,)

134
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,760
(and is helpful.)

135
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,880
(With the honor of this ceremonial gown,)

136
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,559
(and decorated as His Majesty's auxiliary,)

137
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,080
(you are hereby bestowed
the special title of Noble Consort.)

138
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
(Ah!)

139
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,679
(For the great unity and good internal affairs,)

140
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,359
(you shall work hard to assist.)

141
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,919
(You will lead the nine concubines
as the secondary motherly model)

142
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,000
(with great beauty and goodness,)

143
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,760
(by showing respect with sacrificial offerings,)

144
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,599
(with benevolence
when recommending qualified persons,)

145
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,320
(by regarding goodness as your honor,)

146
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,719
(by regarding modesty as your lofty virtue,)

147
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,320
(by regarding frugality
as the way to more blessings,)

148
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,239
(and by speaking carefully
for your good reputation,)

149
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,080
(Obey my precepts
and you're given honor and riches.)

150
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,640
(As dictated.)

151
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,375
[Gentle, Wise, Attentive, and Calm]

152
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,719
Long live and health
to Your Highness the Noble Consort!

153
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,559
Forgo the formalities.

154
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
You may rise.

155
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,359
Your Highness,

156
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,840
Miaoxian was rude before.

157
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,919
I shouldn't be like that.

158
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,599
Your Highness,

159
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,320
please excuse me and don't make a fuss.

160
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,159
What if I want to make a fuss?

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Your Highness!

162
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,000
All right, get up.

163
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Are you not blaming me?

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,239
As long as you don't blame me.

165
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,719
Stand up.

166
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,000
Your Highness,

167
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,840
can I come to your palace

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,159
to disturb you in the future?

169
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
Bring your pipa

170
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,559
with you when you visit.

171
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,280
We haven't finished

172
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
composing our last song.

173
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,440
I will come again tomorrow.

174
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,960
Not tomorrow.

175
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,960
Her Majesty is sick.

176
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,960
Everyone should visit her.

177
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,359
Is Her Majesty sick?

178
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,975
[Principle of Correct Diet]

179
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,239
Your Highness,

180
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,640
in the past, when Lady of Bright Deportment Wu
saw you,

181
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,799
she was arrogant.

182
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
Now, she is a trifle apologetic.

183
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,760
These people

184
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,479
are respectful on the surface

185
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,520
but fight covertly and overtly behind your back.

186
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,039
They have a lot of nasty ideas.

187
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,880
Don't be fooled by them.

188
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
Lady of Bright Deportment Wu

189
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
is similar to Yantai.

190
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,239
If you stroke it the wrong way,

191
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,479
it'll be furious.

192
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,640
However, Fu Jiang,

193
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,559
intimidation brings fear

194
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,640
but not respect.

195
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,919
Don't be prejudiced against them.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,159
Think about it.

197
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,919
They are like the flowers in Qiongyuan Court.

198
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,840
If you don't water and fertilize them,

199
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,960
their hearts will gradually wither.

200
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,200
One should have universal love and tolerance,

201
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,840
and give them attentive care,

202
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
and then they will repay you

203
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,039
like the flowers.

204
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,239
Understand?

205
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,359
You are nice to everyone,

206
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,200
but in this world, human hearts
are unpredictable.

207
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,080
We shouldn't go empty-handed

208
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,440
when we visit Her Majesty.

209
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

210
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,799
Jin.

211
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,280
What are you doing?

212
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,080
Directress Yin,

213
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,520
this is swill

214
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,559
that will be sent to
the Directorate of Imperial Parks.

215
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,479
Continue.

216
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,919
Your Majesty.

217
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,400
Administration Vice Commissioner Kang Qing

218
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,840
and other prefecture and county officials

219
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,200
numbering more than 300 people passed the exam.

220
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,760
Among them, 250 are competent
for their positions,

221
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,320
60 people have average scores,

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,159
and 40 are incompetent.

223
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,520
None went through the three-year evaluations
for their official performances.

224
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
According to the imperial court practice,

225
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,000
they should be reinstated.

226
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,479
Every day, they shouted
that the people are the country's foundation.

227
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,320
In the entire imperial court,

228
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,840
who truly remembers that?

229
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,960
The common people suffer from hunger and cold

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,239
and are bullied.

231
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,640
They depend on prefecture
government authorities

232
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
to hear their grievances.

233
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,159
The local officials

234
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,239
obviously are incompetent

235
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
but will go through three evaluations

236
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,719
before they are rejected or promoted.

237
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:03,960
The process takes nine years.

238
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,799
During that time,

239
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,960
how much suffering will the people
have to go through?

240
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,239
Your Majesty,

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,119
officials are assigned first

242
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,479
and his words and deeds are observed later

243
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,359
to find out if he is truly virtuous.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,960
The three-verification methods

245
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,479
were inherited from ancient times.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,080
It is the customary practice.

247
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,119
Why can't I change

248
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,159
a bad practice?

249
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Summon the Ministry of Personnel

250
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,760
to write a new rule.

251
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Before I get rid of this corrupt practice,

252
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,640
get the Regional Investigating Censor

253
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,799
and Surveillance Commission
to conduct strict inspections.

254
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:33,960
When they encounter

255
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,599
greedy and lawless local officials,

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,119
the latter will forgo the three evaluations

257
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,119
and will be removed for investigation
and dealt with accordingly.

258
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,119
Yes.

259
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,880
Your Majesty, forgive me.

260
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
Forget it.

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,559
You are not used to delicate work.

262
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,799
Summon Yuan Qi.

263
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,599
I thank my master on behalf of Yuan Qi.

264
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,159
Why are you staring at me?

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,160
Your Majesty, given your temperament,

266
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,839
you would have rebuked the officials

267
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,839
of the Ministry of Personnel already.

268
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,479
Moreover,

269
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,079
Eunuch Yuan knelt and begged for many days,

270
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,239
but Your Majesty refused to pardon him.

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,959
What is the good news

272
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,280
that makes Your Majesty so happy?

273
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,439
What?

274
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,119
Am I beaming with delight?

275
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,079
No.

276
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,439
Like I said.

277
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,359
You are young

278
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
and don't observe well.

279
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,079
Continue.

280
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,319
Yes.

281
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:44,200
[Guang'an Gate]

282
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,199
Take her away.

283
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,119
Your Majesty.

284
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,280
Your Majesty,

285
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,199
the Gracious Consort invited my mistress

286
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,560
to go to Kunning Palace together.

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,079
Usually, she doesn't do needlework.

288
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,680
What is this for?

289
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,160
Your Majesty,

290
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,280
I saw my mistress

291
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,560
made a pouch before.

292
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,439
It must have been for you.

293
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,719
You should pretend you don't know about it.

294
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,400
Can she still remember me?

295
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,920
She must just be trying to please me.

296
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,920
I should be extra careful.

297
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,959
Her Majesty took her medicine
and has just rested.

298
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm sorry you made the trip in vain.

299
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,479
After she wakes up,

300
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,839
I'll tell her immediately.

301
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,880
What's Her Majesty's illness?

302
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,160
Why doesn't she see me?

303
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,119
Let's go back first

304
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,160
and come back later in the afternoon.

305
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,920
Your Highness,

306
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:46,719
why did you

307
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,479
give Her Majesty halva?

308
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,160
Medicine is bitter.

309
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,839
Your Highness.

310
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,079
Your Highness!

311
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,959
Your Highness!

312
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Wait.

313
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,239
Lower the sedan chair.

314
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,079
Forgive me for being rude.

315
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,880
You're excused.

316
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,319
Manager Fang, what happened?

317
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,640
Ziping, Xuelu,

318
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
and four female scribes
of the Imperial Food Service

319
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,239
were taken away by Chief Liao.

320
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,560
Why?

321
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,359
I heard

322
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,640
that after the imperial physician
diagnosed Her Majesty,

323
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
the Palace Surveillance investigated

324
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,319
and suspected the medicinal food again.

325
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,319
Your Highness,

326
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,359
with all due respect,

327
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,680
please intervene and save them.

328
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,119
Who sent you here?

329
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,520
I'm asking you again.

330
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,640
If something happens
at the Imperial Food Service,

331
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,160
you should go to Matron Meng
of the General Palace Service immediately for help.

332
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,959
Why do you come to me right away?

333
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,400
Your Highness,

334
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,719
Matron Meng

335
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,719
asked me to see you.

336
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
She asked me to give you this message:

337
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,239
The one who ties the bell should untie it.

338
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,880
She said you'd understand.

339
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:10,800
Your Majesty,

340
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,079
I specially came here to ask you to punish me.

341
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
What have you done?

342
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,560
With Your Majesty's permission,

343
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,560
the Imperial Food Service

344
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,079
dedicated the Bazhen Pastry to the Late Emperor

345
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,280
and almost got into trouble.

346
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,040
I used radish juice

347
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,599
to water down the medicinal properties

348
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,280
of the tonic food.

349
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,280
Although it was a stroke of luck,

350
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
everyone believed

351
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
I know about medicinal properties.

352
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,239
Her Majesty has hysteria now.

353
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,479
All imperial physicians think

354
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,760
that the problem is likely

355
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,239
the nutmeg porridge.

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,239
Directress Yin

357
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,119
cooked the porridge.

358
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,880
She is my old friend.

359
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,000
In this world,

360
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,959
could such a coincidence happen?

361
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,359
It is obvious who the mastermind is.

362
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,199
The Palace Surveillance

363
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,599
has detained Directress Yin.

364
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,959
You are not implicated.

365
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,800
Why do you put your head in a noose?

366
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,839
I am not guilty now,

367
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,680
but I will be later.

368
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,920
Your Majesty, Matron Meng asks to see you.

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,599
Your Majesty,

370
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,239
I'll remove myself first.

371
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,959
Greetings, Your Majesty.

372
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,760
Your Majesty,

373
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,800
this is a matter of grave concern.

374
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,640
That is why I brought her here.

375
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,839
You may get up.

376
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,599
Repeat

377
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,920
what you said to me

378
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,719
to Her Majesty.

379
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes.

380
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,000
I...

381
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,560
wish to report on an offender.

382
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,040
Noble Consort Sun.

383
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,079
Yes.

384
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,680
I wish to report on Noble Consort Sun

385
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,119
for conspiring with Directress Yin Ziping

386
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,079
of the Imperial Food Service

387
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,719
to murder Her Majesty.

388
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

389
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,040
Your Majesty,

390
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,920
please investigate.

391
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,560
Detain her.

392
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,839
Your Majesty,

393
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,439
I swear to heaven.

394
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,800
I am telling the truth.

395
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,640
Your Majesty.

396
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,520
I swear to heaven.

397
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,400
I...

398
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,520
Thank you, Your Majesty, for upholding justice.

399
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't believe in groundless accusations.

400
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,560
I only want facts and evidence.

401
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,560
Whether it is Directress Yin

402
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,599
or the maid who accused you,

403
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,599
they must be subject to strict interrogations

404
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
to get to the bottom of things.

405
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,319
Yes.

406
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:14,800
[Qingning Gate]

407
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,239
Matron Meng, thank you for the tips.

408
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,719
When something happens at Kunning Palace,

409
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,079
everyone will connect it

410
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,439
to Your Highness.

411
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,719
I am

412
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:23,920
only forming a good tie.

413
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,280
Your Highness,

414
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,920
if you're in doubt, you can tell me.

415
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,319
For a long time,

416
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,280
I wanted to ask you this.

417
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,760
Why did you turn your back against
Noble Consort Guo?

418
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,599
Because

419
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,479
she'd never get the position of an empress.

420
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
One more thing.

421
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,199
I know Matron Meng

422
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,400
is busy rectifying palace practices.

423
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:06,400
To seize power

424
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,239
from inner-court eunuchs,

425
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,920
you have to neglect the Imperial Food Service.

426
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,760
However,

427
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,800
this time, the trouble

428
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,680
starts inside,

429
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
not elsewhere.

430
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Go back and investigate thoroughly.

431
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,160
Your Highness,

432
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,119
His Majesty came just now.

433
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,640
Jin,

434
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,959
come here.

435
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,760
Your Highness, do you want...

436
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't ask.

437
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:58,920
Go now.

438
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,719
Yes.

439
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,079
Your Highness,

440
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
why don't you beg His Majesty?

441
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,319
You may all leave.

442
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,000
Your Majesty, the meal delivery person is here.

443
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,025
[Honey Rose Taro]

444
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,824
[Thin Pancake]

445
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,199
Your Majesty drank wine
during the Mid-Autumn Festival

446
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,599
and your intestines and stomach are not well.

447
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,920
You have a poor appetite.

448
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,079
I asked

449
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,119
the imperial physician

450
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
and chose more than 10 types of cakes

451
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,439
from among 300-plus cakes

452
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,520
for Your Majesty's enjoyment.

453
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,199
This is the white sugar cake, water chestnut cake,

454
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,760
green bean cake, China root cake,

455
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,839
yam and red bean cake, and osmanthus cake.

456
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,439
Perhaps,

457
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,839
you might like to try

458
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:37,719
this.

459
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,875
[Almond Tofu]

460
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,040
It looks like tofu

461
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,719
but tastes...

462
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:04,880
Your Majesty,

463
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
this is made with sweet almonds

464
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,199
and fresh milk.

465
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:09,920
Her Highness the Noble Consort

466
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,119
told me

467
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,040
that Your Majesty dislikes sweet douhua.

468
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,680
This almond tofu

469
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,359
is similar to sweet douhua

470
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
but tastes better.

471
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,760
Were you a close friend of the Noble Consort?

472
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,359
I'm not worthy,

473
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,479
but

474
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,479
while in the Imperial Food Service,

475
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,199
I

476
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,839
got along quite well with her.

477
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,239
Actually,

478
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,439
this is Directress Yin's

479
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,640
specialty.

480
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm just

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,439
borrowing her recipe to serve you.

482
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,479
With all due respect,

483
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,760
please pardon Directress Yin.

484
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,040
Directress Yin

485
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,959
isn't bold enough

486
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,359
to murder Her Majesty.

487
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:00,920
Your Majesty.

488
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:02,920
Her Majesty?

489
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,199
Outrageous!

490
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,119
How dare you talk nonsense to His Majesty?

491
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,040
Leave!

492
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,040
Tell me

493
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,439
everything.

494
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,520
Yunzhou.

495
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,040
Yes.

496
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,280
You will take over

497
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,599
the matter at Kunning Palace.

498
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,319
All of those involved

499
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,479
will be transferred to the imperial prison.

500
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,680
Before you find out what happened,

501
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,319
no one is allowed to intrude.

502
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,479
Yes.

503
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,800
[Yongning Palace]

504
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,599
Greetings, Your Majesty.

505
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,000
I will inform

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,959
Her Highness.

507
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,640
No need.

508
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,000
Your Majesty.

509
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,520
I heard you went to visit the Empress.

510
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,839
How is her condition?

511
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,719
Unfortunately,

512
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,319
I didn't get to see her.

513
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,719
What else?

514
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,359
Also,

515
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,439
I made walnut halva

516
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,319
for Her Majesty.

517
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,479
There isn't much left.

518
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,079
Only this?

519
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,680
As the saying goes,

520
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,000
one should take a sweet after tea

521
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,560
to cool off.

522
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,920
Carefully chew Osmanthus
fragrans aurantiacus.

523
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,599
It is sweet and crispy
and smells of fragrant sesame.

524
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,760
Your Majesty, have a piece.

525
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,160
Don't you have anything to say to me?

526
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,239
I want to say

527
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,319
that if Your Majesty is considerate,

528
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,520
you can visit Her Majesty.

529
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,599
When she sees you

530
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,760
and feels happy,

531
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,479
she might recover.

532
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,199
Are you trying to get rid of me

533
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,000
with this leftover?

534
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,640
You're insincere.

535
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,760
Keep it for yourself.

536
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,680
Your Majesty,

537
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,079
if you don't like walnut halva,

538
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,760
what do you like?

539
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,920
Think about it yourself.

540
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:34,880
Sir.

541
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
How do we interrogate this case?

542
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,359
Must I teach you

543
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,400
how to interrogate?

544
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,719
That's not what I mean.

545
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,800
Even the most vicious criminal

546
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,280
will talk

547
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,040
after he gets into this jail.

548
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,280
However, this time,

549
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,880
on one side, there is Her Majesty,

550
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,400
and on the other side, there is
the favored noble consort.

551
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,839
The Empress Dowager sent people
to ask about this,

552
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,880
and His Majesty is watching us.

553
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,319
It is a tough case.

554
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,760
Moreover,

555
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
the decision about the imperial harem

556
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,760
depends on His Majesty.

557
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
You're a blockhead,

558
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,599
but you've improved a bit.

559
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,119
How do I deal with this?

560
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,800
Please give me clear instructions, sir.

561
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,079
Use severe punishments.

562
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:13,760
Sir.

563
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,479
Sir.

564
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,520
Stand up.

565
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,079
Hurry up.

566
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,119
No.

567
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Behave yourself.

568
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
No.

569
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,880
Go.

570
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:29,640
No.

571
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,640
(I found a small object)

572
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
(in the box yesterday.)

573
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,280
(I don't know how to embroider.)

574
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,119
Can you help me?

575
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,439
Where is my book?

576
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,280
Zijin.

577
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,880
Help me.

578
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,400
Please help me.

579
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,599
My arm.

580
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,520
Your Highness,

581
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,159
this is the nutmeg skin you want.

582
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:26,280
Mother.

583
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,000
Kneel.

584
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:31,679
I told you to kneel.

585
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
Don't you understand?

586
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,040
What did I do wrong?

587
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:44,840
What are you doing?

588
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
I knew earlier,

589
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,719
but I was still hopeful.

590
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,199
I hoped that it wasn't you.

591
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,479
If you want to defeat Yin Ziping,

592
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,959
you can have a fair competition.

593
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,000
Who allowed you to use this

594
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,760
despicable means?

595
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,919
Do you know

596
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,679
how many innocent people will be implicated?

597
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,840
I do not know what you're talking about.

598
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,919
You do not know?

599
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,159
You do not know.

600
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,120
I'll beat you until you know.

601
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Enough.

602
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,520
Su Yuehua.

603
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,760
When did you become

604
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
what you are today?

605
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,679
It's all thanks to you.

606
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,639
Me?

607
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,439
Don't look at me like that.

608
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,639
You're the most unqualified person

609
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,280
in the world

610
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,239
to censure me.

611
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,600
For many years,

612
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,040
you abandoned your husband

613
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,120
and daughter so that you could enter the palace.

614
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
To keep your position as the matron,

615
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,679
you sat and watched my master suffer injustice.

616
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,479
What did I do wrong?

617
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,639
I'm just emulating you.

618
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,600
I advise you to stay out of this.

619
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,199
Otherwise, I'll go to the Empress Dowager

620
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,760
and tell her about our relationship.

621
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,800
I will also say

622
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,879
that I was following your instruction.

623
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,360
Your Majesty, His Majesty left.

624
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,639
You should rest early.

625
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,879
Get out.

626
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,959
I told you to get out now.

627
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,360
Your Majesty,

628
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,399
do you remember

629
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,560
what you said to me?

630
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,639
Because of Sun,

631
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,479
you are separated from the one closest to you.

632
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,280
If you don't miss that person,

633
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,159
will you be lingering on your sickbed

634
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,600
in a confused state of mind?

635
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,639
All disasters are caused by Sun.

636
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,760
Your Majesty,

637
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,840
you are wise,

638
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,520
but your heart is too soft.

639
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,159
Empress Dowager

640
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,199
deeply empathizes with your situation.

641
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,800
She deeply believes

642
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,239
that hysteria is caused by medicinal food.

643
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,439
There is no need for evidence.

644
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,639
Spread some gossip and rumors,

645
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,360
and a conclusion will be drawn.

646
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,560
As for the Noble Consort...

647
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,040
Empress Dowager will blame her.

648
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,760
It's not your fault.

649
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,120
So, at the crucial moment,

650
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,639
don't be soft-hearted.

651
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,800
(You abandoned your husband)

652
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,000
(and daughter so that you could enter the palace.)

653
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,560
(to keep your position as the matron.)

654
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,360
(You sat and watched my master suffer injustice.)

655
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,150
[Pick them when they're ripe
for eating after autumn]

656
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,675
[Nutmeg]

657
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,040
Walk with me.

658
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,040
Did you get anything from the interrogation?

659
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,320
Both sides stuck to the original confessions.

660
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,760
They know

661
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
that whoever breaks down

662
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,479
will die.

663
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:51,840
With your capability,

664
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,679
is this the only result you can give me?

665
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:54,399
Your Majesty.

666
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,399
The Emperor Dowager sent someone
to bring an imperial decree

667
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,919
forbidding the use of torture
to extract confessions

668
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,199
so that they won't confess because of tortures.

669
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,639
In front of the palace messenger,

670
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,000
I can't use whatever means

671
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,199
that I have.

672
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,959
What are you going to do?

673
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,159
Your Majesty, I'll do

674
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,439
whatever you want.

675
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,439
You are cunning.

676
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,840
If you can't share my worries,

677
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,000
why should I keep you?

678
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:18,719
Your Majesty,

679
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:20,719
this case is difficult for me to handle,

680
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,120
but in the hands of Your Majesty,

681
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,520
it can be handled easily.

682
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,120
From what you said,

683
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,840
you're pushing the assignment back to me.

684
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,239
Your Majesty knew the answer.
That was why you deliberately moved the people

685
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,239
to the imperial prison. Correct?

686
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,080
I tried everything

687
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,679
and she still wouldn't tell the truth.

688
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,199
What a tough nut to crack!

689
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,159
I don't believe this.

690
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,199
I want to see

691
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,760
how long she can persevere.

692
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,120
Empress Dowager wants
to call someone to account,

693
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,439
but she found no evidence
after the interrogations.

694
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,760
She still wants to get the murderer.

695
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,560
Really?

696
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,800
Your Highness,

697
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,560
perhaps I should advise you

698
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,000
to go

699
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,560
to Kunning Palace.

700
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,840
Calling both of us here

701
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,719
will not help.

702
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,879
Kunning Palace?

703
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,919
Apologize to Her Majesty

704
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,000
and then kneel in front

705
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
of the Empress Dowager and His Majesty

706
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:20,520
to confess my intention?

707
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,040
Finally,

708
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,639
dissociate me

709
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,000
from Directress Yin.

710
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:26,120
Is that right?

711
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,639
Your Highness,

712
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,320
this is not the time

713
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,800
to talk in anger.

714
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,679
Do I look like someone who is talking in anger?

715
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,600
I invited both of you here today

716
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,840
to let you see one thing.

717
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,959
This is nutmeg.

718
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:53,719
Jin.

719
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,040
This is the fruit of nutmeg.

720
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,399
Nutmeg fruit

721
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,919
can treat spleen and stomach deficiencies

722
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:04,120
and gastric pain due to fullness.

723
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
However, it is hallucinogenic.

724
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,040
When making medicine and medicinal food,

725
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,439
one has to be extra careful.

726
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,399
The hallucinogenic poison

727
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,000
can only be found in the skin of nutmeg.

728
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,439
The seed is used as medicine in the porridge.

729
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,360
It has very low toxicity.

730
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,280
The Medicines Office

731
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,520
strictly controls the dosage.

732
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,199
Tell me,

733
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,080
where does

734
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,959
the hysteria come from?

735
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:31,399
Your Highness,

736
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,600
it would be rash

737
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,120
for you to say that.

738
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,159
Her Majesty saw the hysteria

739
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,719
in Kunning Palace with her own eyes.

740
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,840
Who in the Imperial Academy of Medicine
dares to refute that?

741
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,719
The female physicians who tested the medicines

742
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,040
all kept quiet.

743
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,560
No one would talk.

744
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,239
Directress Yin's offense

745
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,199
is solid.

746
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,040
They can't test it,

747
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,679
but I can test the medicine myself.

748
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,840
What...
