taste different.

6
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,480
I think the cook was not paying attention.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
No way, Your Highness.

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,199
She wouldn't dare.

She might be inattentive.

13
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,800
If Miss Yao's skill is unsatisfactory,

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
I'll get a new cook from the Directorate

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,599

19
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,919
So is the Crown Prince.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
The Crown Princess asks you to go there and check.

21
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,880
Can I persuade them?

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
What should we do?

your body can't take it.

28
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

He advised His Majesty to stop
using the talisman.

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600

and ordered two personal attendants
to be beaten.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,760

They can be used for soup and porridge.

that King of Hell You will visit on Laba

and you should avoid him.

198
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Why did you say it now?

199
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,280
What?

200
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,359

211
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,760
Don't summon him.

212
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,760

00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,760
yesterday,

290
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,239
I was promoted to a Table Maid
in the Imperial Food Service.

291
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,239
A lowly position.

292
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
Is that what you want?

293
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
The female official, Wang,

294
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,920
was known for her morality and knowledge.

295
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,920
His Majesty wanted her to be a concubine.

296
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,640
Consort Quan even invited her to ride a carriage.

297
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,160
It was an honor,

298
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,640
but she politely declined

299
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
and left the palace for home.

300
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,000
His Majesty did not force her

301
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,079
but gave her monetary gifts when she left.

302
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,119
I may not be a respectable person,

303
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,839
but His Majesty is always your model.

304
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:47,680
His Majesty is broad-minded.

305
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
Your Highness is even more so.

306
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,479
You will not force a maid.

307
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,359
Did you forget that you said

308
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:55,839
that you adore me?

309
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,959
I didn't

310
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,319
and dared not forget.

311
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,319
I wish you will

312
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,000
return my love.

313
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
However, does your heart

314
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
know my heart?

315
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,880
I have a humble status

316
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,239
and dare not trust you with my heart.

317
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,439
Stand there.

318
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,040

319
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,319
Yes.

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,040
You'll get 20 beatings with the stick.

322
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,719
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

323
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,280
I'm as innocent

324
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,359
as the heavy snow.

325
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,040
I did it to let you vent your anger.

326
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,880
Forty.

327
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,599

00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,640

331
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,680
-Awesome.
-Yes.

332
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
So much.

333
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,959
What are the dishes?

334
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Let me see.

335
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,199

336
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,560
You're cold.

338
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,719
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

339
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Didn't I say I'd go?

340
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,880
You're weak.

341
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,079
Why did you run around?

342
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,599
I'm alright.

343
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,199
I feel much better.

344
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,359
What's going on?

345
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,040
Look at our special dish.

346
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,079
We can deal with that.

347
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,920
Yes. We'll definitely beat them.

348
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,959
What's going on?

349
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
I heard that at the New Year's Eve banquet,

350
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,680
the Imperial Food Service and the Directorate
for Palace Delicacies will have a contest.

351
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,719
The winner

352
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,520
will prepare the imperial meals for next year.

353
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,000
She found out what dishes the Directorate

354
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,040
would do this year.

355
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,599
Strangely,

356
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,359
the Directorate is trying their best to beat
the Imperial Food Service.

357
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,719
Why would they reveal the menu?

358
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,479
Where did she get that from?

359
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,079
What are the remaining dishes?

360
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,199
Wasn't Caozhou hit by a disaster?

361
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,400
Are those peonies that arrived here

362
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
after Mid-Autumn from Henan?

363
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,400
Henan was told

364
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,199
that it doesn't have to send peonies.

365
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
The flower farmers heard

366
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,520
that the noble ladies donated

367
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,239
hairpins and jewelry for disaster relief.

368
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,839
So, they picked the best seedlings
and sent them here.

369
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,000
The palace grew them

370
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,319
in a heated room.

371
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,119
They are grateful even for
what little help we gave.

372
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,520
I feel very sad.

373
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,199
When my mother was alive,

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,560
she worried that the people's houses
would collapse in heavy snow

375
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,040
and that crops would wither in the summer heat.

376
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,479
She was even worried when she died.

377
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
She thought about the families of soldiers
who died in the rebellion.

378
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,839
She asked my father to give them
rewards and remunerations.

379
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,040
This is the true virtue of women.

380
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
We're in the imperial harem.

381
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,280
We should do our best

382
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,319

383
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,479
Crown Princess,

384
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,839
you imitate Empress Xiaochengren

385
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,280
and make it your responsibility
to be a motherly model of the nation.

386
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,800

387
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,520
If what you said spreads outside,

388
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,800
[Lady Wei, Princess of Han]
What should the Crown Princess do?

389
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,160
How can a nation-founding statesman

390
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,479

391
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,199
like you?

392
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,560
You'll destroy the reputation of the Guo family.

393
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,439
How dishonorable it is for

394
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,920
the Prince of Han

395
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,800
to be fighting out of jealousy.

396
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,640
What?

397
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,199
Are you worthy of talking about women's virtues?

398
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,239
Consort Zhuang,

399
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,479
it's windy in the Qiongyuan Court.

400
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
I feel dizzy after viewing the flowers.

401
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,400
Excuse me.

402
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,239
I'll leave first.

403
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,160

404
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,479

407
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Peonies are not festive flowers.

408
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,640
They fared poorly in the heated room.

409
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,319
The plum blossoms are blooming.

410
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Let's view them.

411
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,839
Secondary Consort Guo is domineering.

412
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,839
Father is humble and kind,

413
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,520
but she is outrageous.

414
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,239
Secondary Consort Guo is his favorite.

415
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,479
She is our elder.

416
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,400
The younger generation
should not criticize an elder.

417
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,839
How noble she is.

418
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,239
I'm mad.

419

Let's go.

426
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,119
The fish you sent

427
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,160
looks dull.

428
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,079
The scales have fallen off.

429
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,079
The prawns'

430
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,479
heads and tails have dropped off.

431
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,719
The shells are black

432
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,880
and feel slippery and sticky.

433
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,880
They are not as fresh as you claimed.

434
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,079
How could you

435
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
deliver these to the palace?

436
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,920
How did you check them?

437
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,000
Directress, don't get angry.

438
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,880
His Majesty will hold a banquet
for the ministers today.

439
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,400
The Court of Imperial Entertainments is busy.

440
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,680
Perhaps, it was an oversight.

441
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Moreover, the fish and prawns came from

442
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,839
far away.

443
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,680
Inevitably...

444
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,280

445
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,319
The smell can be masked with oil and salt.

00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,719
However, you can't fool people

449
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,560
Such stale ingredients

450
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,239
are bad for health

451
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,640
and destroy the conscience of the cooks.

452
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,680
When there's no will,

453
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,680
they can't cook.

454
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,680
Return all these ingredients.

455
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,160
Yes.

456
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,119
Remove them quickly.

457
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,920
Matron Meng,

458
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,560
the ingredients used in the palace
are all carefully selected.

459
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,560
The mistake was made

460
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,199
because the Court of Imperial Entertainments
favors the Directorate for Palace Delicacies

461
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,319
and wants us to lose.

462
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,400
Normally, they nitpick on us.

463
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,640

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,880

467

570
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,239
Your Majesty.

571
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,040
The Great Imperial Grandson
advises you to drink less.

572
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,020
[Braised Sea Cucumber with Scallion]

573
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,100
[Two Types of Quick-Fried Slices]

574
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,500
[Seal-Holding Director Wan
of the Directorate for Palace Delicacies]

575
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,919
(Why is he not eating?)

576
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,639
Manager Fang.

577
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,199
Manager Fang.

578
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,439
His Majesty only glanced
at the braised sea cucumber

579
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
with scallion

580
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,560
but didn't touch it.

581
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,080
Didn't I say the quality of
this year's sea cucumbers is bad?

582
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,959
I said to use black sea cucumber,

583
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:57,719
but you wouldn't listen.

584
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,159
A lower-grade ingredient will taste inferior.

585
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,840
Black sea cucumber is inferior.

586
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,479
Is Matron Meng very angry?

587
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,360
Check again.

588
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,040
Yes.

589
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,040
Quickly.

590
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Prepare the next dish.

591
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,080
Let's go.

592
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,719
Do you think the fresh taste

593
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,360
of Yipin Pot can be better than the Three Tastes?

594
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,600
Steamed sea cucumber and fish maw can't beat

595
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,199
a broth cooked for over 20 hours.

596
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,600
What's more, it's too late now.

597
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:36,719
Then,

598
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,760
what about mutton?

599
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,719
Nothing works.

600
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,520
Should we just

601
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,000
concede defeat?

602
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:45,320
Let me think.

603
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,800
Zijin.

604
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
What are you looking for?

605
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,620
[Duck Cooked in Three Styles]

606
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,800
It's interesting.

607
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,760
Don't underestimate this dish.

608
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:39,399
Removing the bones
with the flesh and skin intact

609
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,600
takes skills.

610
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,159
Grandfather,

611
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
this squab meat was steamed until tender

612
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,919
and the soup is very nourishing.

613
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:53,959
Try it.

614
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,199
Matron Meng, thank you.

615
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,900
[Clear Soup with Cabbage]

616
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,959
This isn't really clear soup.

617
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,760
There is

618
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,320
duck, chicken, and ham in it.

619
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,320
As His Highness mentioned,

620
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,719
this meal is prepared especially for
the Crown Prince by the Imperial Food Service.

621
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
There is a folk saying.

622
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,760
Without ham, it isn't tasty;
without chicken, it isn't fresh,

623
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:10,239
without duck, it isn't fragrant;
and without trotter, it is not thick.

624
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,159
That's right.

625
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:12,520
A connoisseur indeed.
