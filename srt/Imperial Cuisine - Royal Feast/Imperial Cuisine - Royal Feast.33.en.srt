It's snowing outside. It's beautiful!

Why are you still like this?

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,559
Stop wasting your effort.

8
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,639
I heard the mistresses of every palace

9
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,800
even started a wager.

10
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,320
They wagered

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,199
who could make Her Highness speaks.

12
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,839
How dare they behave impertinently?

13
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,320

Your Majesty had raised this hawk since young.

22
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,320
Since you can't bear to part with it,

23
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,119
why did you release it?

24
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,079
No matter how reluctant I feel,

25
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,160
I must release it to the wild
after the hunting season,

26
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
so it can breed.

27
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:06,399
Your Majesty,

28
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,679
I received information

29
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
that the Prince of Han frequently sent
people to Zhangde.

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm afraid he's plotting something.

31
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,839
Is that so?

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,040
Do you mean my second uncle

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,239
is drawing my third uncle to his side?

34
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,559
What do you think about my third uncle, then?

35
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,399
I dare not comment.

36
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Just speak.

37
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,119
When the Late Emperor was alive,

38
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,119
Prince of Zhao took the initiative

39
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,119
to remove his imperial guards

40
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,480
and only kept one.

41
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,279
He even transferred 3,000 soldiers

42
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,839
to Mount Tianshou to build
the imperial mausoleum.

43
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,359
Everyone says

44
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
the Prince of Zhao intends

45
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,959
to live a peaceful life as a feudal lord.

46
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
But the human heart is fickle.

47
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,559

00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,559
Before my third uncle left for his fief,

50
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,079
he donated all his salary grain
stored in his granary

51
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,239
to the Ministry of Revenue.

52
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,119
Normally,

53
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,600
what's essential in rebelling

54
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,640
is nothing more than army provisions.

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,799
This shows he doesn't have this ambition.

56
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,519

If we delay,

145
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,679

the palace maids patrol day and night.

149

They fear that the silkworm room may be too cold.

150
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,440
So they ignited moxa cones
made from peach leaves.

151
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,039
Also,

152
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,960
they've carefully selected

153
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
the most tender mulberry leaves to feed them.

154
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:15,719
They wouldn't dare to neglect their duties.

155
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,960
What about the mulberry leaves?

156
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,559
Did you use

157
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,000
mulberry leaves that are still wet
from morning dew

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,719
to feed them again?

159
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,359
I've said this many times.

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,960
You can only pick the mulberry leaves

161
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,840
when there's no morning dew.

162
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,719
You must always pay attention
to the silkworm room's temperature

163
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,479
and the silkworms' feeding time.

164
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,119
I only rested for two days.

165
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,119
I left all these tasks to you,

166
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,239
and this is the outcome?

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,159
When this happens again,

169
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,359
mix dried mulberry leaves

170
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,559
with the fresh ones,

171
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,440
the silkworms won't be sick again.

172
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,919
Yes.

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,159
All of you can get up.

174
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

175
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,359
Where's the Empress?

176
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,599
The Empress sent someone to report

177
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,119
that she hadn't fully

178
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,719
recovered from her cold since spring.

179
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,119
Before she's fully recovered,

180
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,159
she dares not visit Qingning Palace.

181
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,080
She fears her sickness might infect others.

182
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,640
The Empress has always been frail.

183
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,840
I don't have the heart to blame her.

184
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,320
What about Noble Consort Sun?

185
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,400
Shouldn't you let her check on the silkworms too?

186
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,400
Your Majesty,

187
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,640

by His Majesty.

I want to see her.

190
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,919
Do you know who she was?

192
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,559
The wife whom Yongle Emperor respected the most,

193
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,760
Empress Xiaochengren of the Xu Clan.

194
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,679
She was also Zhanji's grandmother.

195
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,559
Everyone says I'm like her the most

196
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,119
and valued by Yongle Emperor.

197
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,239
Thus, I've retained

198
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,880
my husband's position as the Crown Prince.

199
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,119
Rightfully,

200
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,559
I should be grateful to her.

201
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,080
But in my heart...

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,880
When Zhanji was born,

203
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,799
he was taken to be raised by her.

204
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,799
When Zhanji was old enough,

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
he was closer to his grandmother than me,

206
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,799
his birth mother.

207
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,719
But I respect her from the bottom of my heart.

208
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,320
In my fourth year

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,159
as the consort

210
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,359
of Prince of Yan's son,

211
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,719
Li Jinglong took the opportunity to attack
the city while Yongle Emperor was away

212
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
for a war expedition.

213
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,239
She stood at the lookout tower in armor
to supervise the war

214
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,679
and led the city's old and young women
and children

215
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,400
to protect this city.

216
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,159
All her life,

217
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,760
she never sought

218
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,280
any personal pleasure,

219
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,320
nor did she seek any position

220
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,080
for the men of the Xu family.

221
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,119
But whenever she asked something
from the Emperor,

222
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,159
it was always for the benefit of the people.

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you understand

224
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
what I'm trying to say?

225
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,719
Since His Majesty grounded you in your palace,

226
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,679
you've stopped speaking.

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,679
Are you defying

228
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,080
His Majesty's order,

229
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,119
or you can't let go

230
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,440
of the resentment you have for me?

231
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,440
Farming and business

232
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
can help a family.

233
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,960
Practicing medicine and learning

234
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,080
can benefit thousands of people.

235
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,679
But in the imperial harem...

236
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,359
Everyone says

237
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,280
behind this imperial harem's wall,

238
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,640
there are women who exist
to entertain the Emperor.

239
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,039
But

240
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,320
women like Empress Ma

241
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,359
and Empress Xu

242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,880
treated their foes coldly

243
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,840
and treated the people as their own children.

244
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:05,919
Their significance

245
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,039
never lies

246
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
in their gentle obedience to the emperors.

247
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
Let alone having

248
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,280
their reputation last forever.

249
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,559
But it lies

250
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,080
in the well-being of the empire.

251
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,520
Women like

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,440
these two empresses,

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,039
their virtues concerned

254
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,679
the fortune of the Great Ming.

255
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,320
The well-being of thousands
of people is tied to them.

256
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,239
It's not something ordinary people

257
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,520
can reckon with.

258
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,039
I've been searching for someone

259
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,159
who can

260
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,679
stay by Zhanji's side for a long time.

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Someone who can respect him,

262
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,440
protect him, and advise him.

263
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,359
If he wants to kill someone,

264
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,520
she'll help him discern the good and the bad.

265
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,880
If he wants to build a luxury garden in the palace,

266
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,679
she'll dare to advise and stop him.

267
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,080
If he wants to add taxes,

268
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,760
she'll remind him of the people's hardship.

269
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,280
Even if

270
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,039
everyone turned their backs on him one day,

271
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
she'd still stay by his side.

272
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,880
I've been searching

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,760
for someone like this.

274
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,960
Back then,

275
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
Mother brought you to me.

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,799
She said you might be the one
I've been searching for.

277
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,320
So I made you stay.

278
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
If you achieve something

279
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
in the future,

280
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll thank you on behalf of the people.

281
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,039
If you think of your own interest

282
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,039
by the Emperor's side,

283
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,320
the history and the future generations
will criticize you for me!

284
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
It's easy to say

285
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,239
for the benefit of the people.

286
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,440
But it's hard to achieve.

287
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,239
You better remember this.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,280
As for your hate and resentment,

289
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,160
just leave them on me.

290
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,680
Never mind.

291
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,680
You can go now.

292
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm not ordering you.

293
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,839
It's a request.

294
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
It's called "Dragon Removes Its Robe".

295
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
Isn't this just stir-fried shredded eel?

296
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
Why is it called "Dragon Removes Its Robe"?

297
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,920
When the eel is skinned,

298
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,599
it's the same

299
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,800
as a general taking his armor off.

300
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:24,880
Since there's a dish taking off the robe,

301
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,040
is there one wearing the robe?

302
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,000
Tomorrow,

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll coat the eel shreds with batter

304
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,560
and deep fry them.

305
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,959
Then we'll have "The General Wears His Robe".

306
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,199
The armor will be gold in color.

307
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:52,920
Directress Yin.

308
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,000
Wait.

309
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,199
Show me.

310
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,719
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

311
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,920
Who stuck

312
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,800
the clam shells together?

313
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,959
It's my fault.

314
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,439
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

315
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,225
[Yongning Palace]

316
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,760
Rise.

317
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,239
You couldn't speak?

318
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,319
Is there something wrong with your throat?

319
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,760
I'll get the imperial physician now.

320
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:51,640
Sit.

321
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:58,959
When did you start

322
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,119
not being able to speak?

323
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,119
What disease is she suffering from?

324
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:32,959
Your Majesty,

325
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,000
Noble Consort Sun is

326
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,520
physically healthy.

327
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,640
But she can't speak.

328
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,160
Your Majesty,

329
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,000
as the saying goes,
all diseases come from the qi flow.

330
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,040
"Anger drives qi to flow upward.
Joy makes qi flow sluggish.

331
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Grief consumes qi.
Fear drives qi to flow downward.

332
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,880
Fright disrupts qi flow.
Anxiety causes stagnant qi flow."

333
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,599
Emotional distress and depression

334
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,280
are the cause of Noble Consort's illness.

335
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,439
Her illness

336
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,199
must be treated with Banxia Houpu decoction

337
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,040
and Chinese licorice decoction

338
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,479
for her recovery.

339
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,400
Go and prescribe her medicine.

340
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,880
All of you are dismissed.

342
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,400
Why didn't you tell me?

343
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,079
I grounded you

344
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,079
and made you remember the past.

345
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,319
Were you grounded

346
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,800
at Madam Peng Chengbo's mansion

347
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,880
before this?

348
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,400
I'm going to ask Mother

349
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:47,880
why she pushed you

350
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,839
to this extent.

351
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,479
How could she do such a thing?

352
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,959
It was fear.

353
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,079
It was because of fear.

354
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,400
You're scared that you'll be locked up again

355
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,160
like before.

356
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,199
That's why you couldn't speak

357
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,160
out of a sudden.

358
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,400
I didn't know.

359
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,280
Yet, I...

360
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,079
I want you to be truthful to me.

361
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,800
But every time you do,

362
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,079
it's not for your sake.

363
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,520
When it comes to your problems,

364
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,439
you'd rather endure them

365
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,800
and not tell me anything.

366
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,119
I thought

367
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,359
you did it out of spite.

368
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,439
I never thought

369
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,560
that you couldn't speak at all.

370
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,000
But...

371
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,560
you could've written it down

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,839
when you can't speak.

373
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,959
You should let me know about this.

374
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,479
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,359
I'm sorry, Zijin.

376
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:59,775
[I knew you'd be like this.
That's why I didn't tell you.]

378
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,079
You didn't even tell me.

379
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,560
You'd rather have

380
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,959
everyone blame you.

381
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,359
How

382
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,199
hard-hearted can you be?

383
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
I know

384
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,040
you've been helping me

385
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,880
and treating me kindly.

386
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,119
But I hid things from you and lied to you.

387
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
That's why you refuse to forgive me

388
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
and trust me again.

389
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,119
You didn't even tell me

390
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,719
about something serious like this.

391
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,359
Zi...

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,599
Ziping.

393
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,839
Ziping.

394
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:55,599
Zijin?

395
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,760
You can speak?

396
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,319
Your Highness?

397
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,560
There, there.

398
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,680
There, there.

399
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,239
Listen to me.

400
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,199
It's not what you think.

401
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:12,839
Are...

402
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,199
Are Imperial Physician Sheng's prescriptions

403
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,319
that effective?

404
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,959
Before I entered the palace,

405
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,880
my heart was heavy as a stone.

406
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,119
There were times

407
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,719
when I couldn't speak like this

408
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,319
in the past.

409
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,560
No matter how indifferent I behaved,

410
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,800
but the fear is still there.

411
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:40,040
That was my fear towards the Empress Dowager

412
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,040
and fear of being confined.

413
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,880
But I've met you.

414
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,359
When I see

415
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,119
how hard you work to learn cooking

416
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,839
and I see you need my help,

417
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,359
only then do I manage to hang on.

418
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,119
Listen to me carefully.

419
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,119
I wasn't the one who had been helping you.

420
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,319
You were the one helping me.

421
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,079
Thank you.

422
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Thank you for returning to the right path.

423
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Thank you

424
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,959
for accompanying me all the time

425
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,439
when I couldn't speak.

426
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,199
But why did

427
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,760
you hide it from us?

428
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,599
I don't want you to worry.

429
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,599
Also,

430
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,599
I don't want His Majesty to feel troubled too.

431
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,800
His Majesty asked why I didn't write to him.

432
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,479
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

433
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,359
I can't.

434
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,959
There's no room

435
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,599
for a mute noble consort

436
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,000
in the Forbidden City.

437
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,959
It's better to let others think

438
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,719
that I'm spoiled

439
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,520
than to be reproached.

440
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:01,760
It would only put

441
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,479
His Majesty in a difficult position.

442
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,239
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,839
I didn't tell you about this.

444
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,880
It's my fault.

445
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,359
Your Highness,

446
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,560
when did you start...

447
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,800
The day I came back from Qingning Palace.

448
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,199
I suddenly find

449
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,959
that she's not invincible.

450
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:29,880
She's not

451
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,599
as terrifying as I thought she was.

452
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,079
After all, she's still a mother.

453
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,199
Zijin,

454
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,520
I don't understand

455
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,239
what you're saying.

456
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,560
It's all right.

457
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,400
In any case,

458
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
the heavy stone

459
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,119
in my heart

460
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,760
is no longer there.

461
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,839
Your Highness,

462
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,199
you've already recovered earlier.

463
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,359
Then His Majesty...

464
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,119
Since I'm already sick,

465
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,319
I can't be sick for nothing.

466
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,680
It's his fault for locking me up for a long time.

467
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,040
I should let him worry about me for a bit.

468
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
It's not too much, right?

469
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,359
Ziping,

470
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,359
it's not easy

471
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,839
to be the woman

472
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,479
the Empress Dowager wants me to be.

473
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,680
But

474
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,119
I can walk out

475
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,719
of the study now.

476
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,680
Study?

477
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,839
I even made

478
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,680
a new friend.

479
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,160
Your Highness,

480
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,359
Matron Meng requests to see you.

481
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,119
Directress Su, you're here just in time.

482
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,959
I was about to send someone for you.

483
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,239
How may I be

484
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,680
at Your Highness' service?

485
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:24,800
Your Highness.

486
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,680
Matron Meng,

487
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,880
you've been assisting Empress Dowager
to set things right at the palace.

488
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,599
You've punished more than 100 greedy

489
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,000
and corrupted palace eunuchs.

490
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,719
Everyone in the palace is watchful
of their conduct,

491
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,520
and it has become a common practice.

492
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,520
So you shouldn't stop me

493
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,280
from punishing her.

494
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,599
If we let her small mistakes slide,

495
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,199
she'll commit an even worse mistake.

496
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,079
It was because I backed down once

497
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,119
that made you worse

498
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,719
without learning your lesson.

499
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Matron Meng, you must believe me.

500
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:53,880
I have no idea

501
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,719
what she's talking about.

502
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,040
You don't?

503
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,640
What did you do

504
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,119
with the hands you used to prepare food?

505
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,599
She's venting her anger on me.

506
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
She was confined by His Majesty.

507
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,599
That's why she's venting her anger on me.

508
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:05,800
You must believe

509
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,760
that I'm innocent.

510
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,880
You must plead with the Empress Dowager for me.

511
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,239
I didn't do anything.

512
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,560
You must believe me, Matron Meng.

513
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,439
Well,

514
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,400
how do you plan to punish her?

515
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
Matron Meng.

516
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,599
Directress Su,

517
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,359
I said those words hoping

518
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,599
you would always

519
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,280
be cautious and in awe.

520
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,800
I hope you won't repeat the mistakes.

521
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,959
It's too bad that you didn't listen.

522
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,359
Rest assured.

523
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,239
I'll not personally punish you.

524
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll send you to the Palace Surveillance

525
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,439
and let them punish you
according to the palace rules.

526
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,920
Noble Consort Sun, don't forget

527
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,560
that the Empress admitted

528
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,439
that she was delusional

529
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,000
because of overthinking.

530
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,640
What does that have to do with me?

531
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,839
Even if you send me to the Palace Surveillance,

532
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,800
what crime will you punish me for?

533
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,160
Yukuai had confessed everything.

534
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,199
Her Highness

535
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,640
didn't expose you right away that day

536
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:08,680
because

537
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,079
she wanted to protect the Empress's image.

538
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,119
All this while,

539
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,680
she has been waiting for you
to confess your crime.

540
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,640
But you were too stubborn to do so.

541
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,800
You even mistakenly thought you'd be safe

542
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,359
when Her Highness was grounded.

543
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Your Highness,

544
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
please allow me to handle her.

545
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,959
Matron Meng,

546
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,479
you want to punish her yourself?

547
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,959
The Imperial Food Service is
where food is prepared.

548
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,079
Rotten food can't be eaten.

549
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,359
Covetous hands can't be kept.

550
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,599
What are you doing?

551
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,560
Who says you can act on your own?

552
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,599
Let me go.

553
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,439
Let me go! No!

554
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,239
Food is a gift from heaven.

555
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,959
It's the most precious thing in the world.

556
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:52,760
I won't allow

557
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,880
such corrupted hands

558
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,680
to touch them again.

559
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,599
It's your fault

560
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,640
that I turned out like this.

561
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,119
You have no right to punish me. You have no right!

562
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,280
If you must cut off my fingers,

563
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,599
Noble Consort Sun,

564
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,760
do you dare to do it yourself?

565
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,560
You were the one

566
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,599
who saved my hands back then.

567
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,280
Then please do it yourself.

568
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,040
I don't want her to touch me.

569
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
Do you understand, Noble Consort Sun?

570
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,000
Do you understand?

571
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,239
I taught you about food

572
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,160
and preparing food.

573
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,160
Naturally, I should be the one

574
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
who should help you return to the right path.

575
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:01,880
Matron Meng,

576
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,000
why did you do this?

577
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,399
I'm willing

578
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,560
to use my own hands

579
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,840
in exchange for her chance
to turn over a new leaf.

580
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,760
Matron Meng.

581
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,760
I've been in charge
of the Imperial Food Service for many years.

582
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,959
Yet, such absurd things

583
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,399
have happened one after another.

584
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,719
I truly can't face Empress Dowager,

585
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,600
who puts her trust in me.

586
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,879
I'll personally seek punishment
from Empress Dowager.

587
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,439
I'll step down from my position as the matron.

588
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:38,919
I'll retire to Anle Hall

589
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
to take care of the sick

590
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,600
and atone for my crimes.

591
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,520
Send Matron Meng out.

592
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,840
Did you see that?

593
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,199
Did you see that?

594
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
Who else in this world

595
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,159
would do this

596
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,320
for you?

597
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,120
Su Yuehua,

598
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,199
I hope you can understand

599
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,560
a mother's intention.

600
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,399
Directress Jiang.

601
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,800
Hanying.

602
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,320
Since I've entered the palace,

603
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:35,919
I've always been by your side.

604
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,159
No matter what difficulties,

605
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,320
you've never yielded.

606
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,760
Now, you finally have everything.

607
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,520
Why did you give up so easily?

608
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,760
Hanying...

609
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,360
No, you must not do this.

610
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,600
Directress Su must be responsible

611
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,959
for her crime.

612
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,159
You can't do this.

613
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,159
I'll go to Qingning Palace

614
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,520
and kneel outside to beg

615
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,479
the Empress Dowager
until she rescinds her order.

616
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:00,560
Don't do meaningless things.

617
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,439
Perhaps I'm nothing

618
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
to you.

619
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,600
But I've always

620
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,679
treated you as my master

621
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,800
and even

622
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,639
my mother.

623
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,159
Are you going to abandon me

624
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,239
because of Su Yuehua?

625
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,320
You're wrong.

626
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,040
I'm not doing this for her.

627
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,639
I'm doing this for me.

628
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,280
For you?

629
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:39,879
I admit

630
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
everything I've been striving for

631
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,919
in the past ten years

632
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,320
is right in front of me.

633
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,479
To go through these thorn bushes

634
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,520
to the end,

635
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:54,000
I've also made many mistakes.

636
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
In the past, I thought

637
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,080
it was right to eliminate
the influence of eunuchs

638
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,239
and let female officials

639
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,439
regain power.

640
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,719
But I was wrong.

641
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,239
I've set

642
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,919
the wrong example

643
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,159
for the Imperial Food Service

644
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,919
and the female officials by doing so.

645
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,639
I thought a heart with bad morals was far better

646
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:25,679
than the disasters caused by the eunuchs.

647
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,159
Yet, there's no way to turn back.

648
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,399
Everything is

649
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,639
all my fault.

650
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:40,679
Have you really decided?

651
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,080
Hanying,

652
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,520
I'll have to leave everything

653
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,639
in your hands from now on.

654
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,679
Don't let me down.

655
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:19,375
[Foods Office]

656
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,000
[Noble Consort's Precious Drawing]

657
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,840
Send this to the Ministry of Rites.

658
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

659
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:22,919
Zijin,

660
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,000
come here.

661
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,280
I'm here to pay my respect to Your Majesty.

662
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,479
I want to show you a treasure.

663
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,600
Yuan Qi.

664
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,840
What do you think?

666
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,560
Yunzhou gave this to me.

667
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,800
Officer You gave this to you?

668
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,399
What's wrong?

669
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,120
Before this, Officer You

670
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,439
also gave Yongle Emperor

671
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,840
and the Late Emperor

672
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,280
the most precious treasures in the world.

673
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,520
Now, he's brushing you off

674
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,080
by giving you

675
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,239
an impenetrable soft armor for you.

676
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,479
Don't you think he's being stingy with you?

677
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,080
We're not at the study now.

678
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:14,639
Can't I voice my opinion?

679
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,840
Nobody told you to act on your own
to compensate me.

680
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,719
I don't want that.

681
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,199
Who's there?

682
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,840
Sir,

683
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,040
His Majesty summons you.

684
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:57,439
What are you doing here?

685
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,280
Sir,

686
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
His Majesty is asking for you. You should go now.

687
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,080
Do you also think I did wrong?

688
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,959
That's something

689
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:16,959
you should ask yourself.

690
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,959
Some people can be forgiven

691
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,919
again and again

692
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:23,399
after they make mistakes.

693
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,719
But when it comes to me,

694
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:25,760
everyone condemns me

695
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,360
when I've made one mistake.

696
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,360
Miss Su,

697
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,360
why are you...

698
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,120
I didn't do anything wrong!

699
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,439
No one in this world

700
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:33,360
has the right

701
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,080
to criticize me!

702
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,919
Sir!
