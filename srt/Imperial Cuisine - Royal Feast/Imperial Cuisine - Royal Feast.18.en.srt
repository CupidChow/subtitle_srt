00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,040
Yao Zijin, what's the meaning of this?

4
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,800
Su Yuehua,

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,760
are you here to provoke us
because you're not happy that you lost?

6
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
-Ziping, stop.
-Tell me why did you win.

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Say something!

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,319
You must admit your defeat.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,919
Ziping.

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Ziping,

11
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,800
keep quiet.

12
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,559
At that time, Her Majesty was obviously...

13
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,880
Something was amiss.

14
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Tell me.

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
What exactly did you do?

16
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,839
Wang Mojie practiced meditation
and worshipped Buddha.

17
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
However, the original Wangchuan Villa

18
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,679
only has a boatman, travelers.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
All except a monk.

20
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,559
Monk?

21
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,399
The monk under the tree?

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,279
Hongwu Emperor was once a monk
at the Huangjue Temple.

23
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,399
He hated it when others mentioned

24
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,440
bald heads and monks.

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,839
The consequences were unimaginable
if anyone in the Forbidden City dared

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
to utter such remarks.

27
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,759
However, things have changed now.

28
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,279
Not many people in the palace
remember this taboo.

29
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,240
However, Her Majesty knows better.

30
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
Why would she let you win, then?

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,039
So you deliberately misled me.

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,399
Su Yuehua,

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,639
when someone set up a trap for a rat,

34
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,600
why did you have to be the rat

35
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,119
and got yourself in the trap?

36
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,320
Ziping.

37
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,880
That was nothing more than a cheap trick.

38
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,679
In today's competition,

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,639
I'm the...

40
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,360
I won.

41
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,600
Yuehua,

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,839
did you think the hardest part
of the original Wangchuan Villa really lies

43
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,759
in the reproduction
of its aesthetic conception?

44
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,039
Are you telling me it's not?

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,919
The replica of the Wangchuan Villa

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,720
is indeed the world's most exquisite
and fancy cold dish.

47
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,440
It's a pity when the wind blows

48
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,639
during a cold season,

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,679
all the ingredients become colder and harder.

50
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,360
It works as a display than to be served as food.

51
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,440
At first, I planned to use

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,679
the preserved food carving method
of Jingzhou, Huguang,

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,880
and preserve the food ingredients in advance

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,160
to serve them to the important guests.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,759
It was too bad.

56
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,040
You stole the painting.

57
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
How could you not consider this in advance

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,279
when I did?

59
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,799
Because you focus your idea

60
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,519
on showing off your skills.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Yet, you forget that food is to be eaten.

62
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,200
You reproduced the replica
of Wangchuan Villa beautifully.

63
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,880
If you use your talent the improper way,

64
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,519
your path in cooking is going

65
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,920
to stop here.

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
Zijin, let's go.

67
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,720
Just ignore her.

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,959
I had no idea.

69
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,559
You're impressive.

70
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,079
Officer You,

71
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,640
you believe anything that I painted.

72
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,279
Are you really that naive?

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,519
Come on.

74
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
That's annoying.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,559
What a sore loser.

76
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,119
Stop being upset.

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,519
The person who was sent to get
the painting didn't study it carefully.

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,519
She made a trap instead.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
But it is interesting when both sides
are well-matched in strength.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
You only lose once.

81
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,119
No need for that awful look.

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
She was never this serious.

83
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
What changed her?

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,519
(Tall rise building overseeing the country.)

85
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,600
(Climb up high to enjoy the distant view.)

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
(Lush mountains in the West connected
to the East Sea.)

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
(Travel to Beijing from the south.)

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,920
(The red palace in the evening glow.)

89
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,279
(Sunset in the farm meets the autumn harvest.)

90
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,279
(The sky is deserted and boundless.)

91
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,959
(Seeing a message off to a long journey.)

92
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
What do you think?

93
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,440
It's an excellent poem.

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,040
Your Highness,

95
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,559
"Gazing into the distance
from the tall building at night."

96
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,799
Don't tell me
there's a beautiful woman on the boat.

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,079
What's wrong with your eyes?

98
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,760
There's no beautiful woman late at night.

99
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,679
A woman ghost is more like it.

100
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
This looks like someone.

101
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,239
You're full of nonsense.

102
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,920
I just did it casually. It looks like no one.

103
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,239
Yes, it looks like no one.

104
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,399
My eyes were seeing things.

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
I saw it by mistake.

106
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,799
I deserve to be punished.

107
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Your Highness.

108
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Matron Hu, I was careless.

109
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,000
Please forgive me.

110
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,799
Kunning Palace sent an edict.

111
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,840
As of today,

112
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,039
you're no longer the Manager of Foods
of the Imperial Food Service.

113
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,520
Matron Hu,

114
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,760
please give me a second chance
in the competition.

115
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
You already lost in the first round.

116
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
How dare you boast without shame.

117
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,960
Get out.

118
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,200
If you lose in the second round again,

119
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,559
what would you do?

120
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,799
Only I can beat

121
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Yao Zijin.

122
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
She's a nobody.

123
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
She's not worth mentioning at all.

124
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,640
If I were you...

125
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,760
I can give you one last chance.

126
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,640
But if you lose again this time,

127
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,239
you must leave
the Imperial Food Service forever.

128
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,039
I accept.

129
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Manager Su's carving skills

130
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
were truly incredible.

131
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Just look

132
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
at the mountains and water.

133
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,559
They do have some aesthetic conception
of the original painting.

134
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
She's the descendant
of the famous cook of the Su family.

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Naturally, she's extraordinary.

136
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,200
It's too bad.

137
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,960
The Empress had the intention to help Matron Hu.

138
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,960
She wasn't going to judge it fairly.

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
That meditating old monk...

140
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
For a person to predict
the Empress mind so accurately,

141
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,039
the Imperial Food Service sure has talent.

142
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Their tricks can never fool you.

143
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,000
Wang Mojie's Wangchuan Villa
and the meditating monk

144
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,080
complement each other.

145
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,280
However, the second round of the competition

146
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,200
isn't for the concubines
of the imperial harem to decide anymore.

147
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,159
Do you mean...

148
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
On behalf of His Majesty,
the Eastern Palace will invite

149
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,559
the ministers to visit Taiye Lake.

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
The second round of the competition

151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
will be at the Western Park.

152
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,425
[Chestnut Yam Dessert]

153
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:11,919
Your Highness,

154
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
here's chestnut yam dessert.

155
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,400
I know you don't like anything too sweet.

156
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,640
So I specially told them to add less honey.

157
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,559
They only used osmanthus for seasoning.

158
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,320
Try it.

159
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,440
Your Highness,

160
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,960
you've been writing and drawing lately.

161
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
Don't you have to handle any official affairs?

162
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
I rarely have time to spend with you.

163
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,719
Isn't this nice now?

164
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,200
When the Late Emperor was around,

165
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,000
he'd either take you hunting in the north

166
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,760
or force you to manage state affairs.

167
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
There were too many memorials for you to review,

168
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,280
even I couldn't see you.

169
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,039
Now that you have spare time,

170
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,239
I'm delighted.

171
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,359
However, it hasn't been long
since Father succeeded the throne.

172
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,280
He has to handle too many state affairs.

173
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,719
As the Crown Prince of the nation,

174
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,039
you should share the responsibility with him.

175
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,919
That's only if he's willing
to let me share it with him.

176
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,239
Your Highness, I think it's getting cold.

177
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm tired.

178
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
Your Highness,

179
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,640
His Highness is...

180
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,919
Seems like

181
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
His Highness never forgets
what happened in the past.

182
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,325
[Thunder Chestnut]

183
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,119
Your...

184
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,599
Since you're sleepy,

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
why bother making thunder chestnut?

186
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Excuse me. Move aside.

187
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,239
Since we're already here,

188
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,039
let's enjoy ourselves.

189
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,000
Your Highness, look at that.

190
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,159
Your Highness.

191
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,040
Your Highness,

192
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,359
His Majesty has arrived.

193
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,079
Big Brother! Big Brother!

194
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Your Highness, I thought His Majesty was unwell.

195
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,280
The Emperor has arrived.

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,560
Tell the kitchen

197
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,319
to prepare the meal.

198
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,239
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,719
Father.

200
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

201
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,280
You may rise.

202
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Hurry up! Quickly now!

204
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Get to it!

205
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,479
Put this over there.

206
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Here, over here.

207
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,760
Be careful.

208
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Don't interrupt His Majesty.

209
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:13,880
Eunuch Zhao,

210
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
the guests don't have a godlike hearing.

211
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,000
How can they hear us from far away?

212
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,839
Have you been living too long?

213
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,280
Just do your work.

214
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,800
Eunuch Zhao,

215
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,599
let them do all these trivial works.

216
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
You don't have to trouble yourself here.

217
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,599
The last time His Majesty
came to the Western Park,

218
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,319
he ate cold food

219
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
and had cold wind blowing at him.

220
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,160
He fell ill when he returned to the palace.

221
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
So Her Majesty ordered me here

222
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,439
to tell you

223
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,119
to pay special attention

224
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,680
to exotic foods.

225
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,599
Please rest assured, Eunuch Zhao. We understand.

226
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,920
I'll leave you two at it, then.

227
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,400
A good sword indeed.

228
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
His Lordship did as you said

229
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,199
to be the first person to persuade
to ascend the throne.

230
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
Sure enough, he won the favor of the Emperor.

231
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,640
No need to deliver anything to me next time.

232
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,280
I don't lack anything.

233
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,839
His Lordship says

234
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,880
to be careful in everything.

235
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,880
I have not fully recovered from my cold.

236
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,079
So the Crown Prince invited
all of you here on my behalf.

237
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,199
Prince of Zhao is also here.

238
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,119
It's been such a long time

239
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,199
since we visited Western Park.

240
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,319
Let's enjoy the day today.

241
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,359
As soon as Your Majesty ascended the throne,

242
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
you increased my salary.

243
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm grateful for the grace

244
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,160
you've shown me.

245
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,239
So it's only right for me to be here
to express my gratitude.

246
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
We're brothers.

247
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,199
No need for such formalities.

248
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,640
Come and sit here.

249
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,719
Thank you, Brother.

250
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,719
Shan,

251
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,400
come here.

252
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
After you've completed
the calligraphy I sent you,

253
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,239
I'll take you out to release the eagle. All right?

254
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,319
Really?

255
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,920
Since Prince of Wei was young,

256
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
he has had a very close relationship
with the Crown Prince.

257
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,880
Big Brother is my favorite person in the world.

258
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
Brother,

259
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
the Crown Prince may be young.

260
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,359
Yet, he's revered

261
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,760
and has won the hearts of all.

262
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,400
Even Prince of Wei admires him so much.

263
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,839
It's no wonder Father often said

264
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,599
that he'd bring prosperity to the country
as an emperor.

265
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,680
I am most concerned

266
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
about the sufferings of the people,

267
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,199
and the opinions of the ministers and the people.

268
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:59,160
You're all loyal ministers
who served the Late Emperor

269
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,800
for more than 20 years.

270
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,760
You're the pillars of our country.

271
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,479
If I have oversights in my governance,

272
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,359
I hope all of you can use

273
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,760
this seal to point it out to me

274
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,199
in a secret memorial.

275
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,520
I'll be sure

276
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,640
to consider it.

277
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,640
I grant you this seal is for us

278
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,199
to be honest with each other.

279
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640
The last thing I like is flattery.

280
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:36,079
What I love most are the truth

281
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
and your thoughts.

282
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,160
We're honored to accept this, Your Majesty.

My dear ministers,

284
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,800
do you have any advice?

285
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,800
Your administration is clear
and political affairs have no faults.

286
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,359
We dare not speak of lies.

287
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,640
My dear ministers...

288
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,000
It's great that Father can accept criticism
and ask for advice.

289
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,239
But it's rare for us to spend a nice day out today.

290
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,760
Why don't we put aside official matters for now?

291
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
After they think about it,

292
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,920
it won't be too late to offer you advice.

293
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,280
His Highness is right.

294
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,160
Please allow us to think about it.

295
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,880
I asked for advice the moment
I ascended the throne.

296
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,920
But until today,

297
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,479
I received nothing from you.

298
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,839
Fine.

299
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,640
It's all right, then.

300
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,359

Father,

306
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
the thinly sliced raw fish may be delicious.

307
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,959
But it's a fishy ingredient,

308
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,079
which is cold to the stomach.

309
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,359
I fear it's not good for your health.

310
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,479
Why don't you stop eating it?

311
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Eat less oily food. Don't eat too much.

371
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,880
There's blood.

372
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,760
You're smudging it all over your face.
How are you going to meet the others?

373
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,119
What about now?

374
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,719
Is it still obvious?

375
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,839
Go now.

376
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,719
What's wrong, Shan?

377
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
Let me see.

378
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Don't move. Let me see.

379
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,760
What's going on?

380
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,079
Shan!

381
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,359
Shan!

382
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,839
Don't come close. Make some room.

383
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,160
Shan!

384
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,959
Get off!

385
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,719
Your Highness!

386
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,839
Shan! Shan!

387
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,520
Shan!

388
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:25,839
Shan!

389
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,479
Get the imperial physician!

390
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,040
Shan.

392
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,719
Seal off Western Park. Don't anyone in or out.

393
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,160
Yes, sir.

394
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,199
Is there anything different
before Prince of Wei came out?

395
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,199
Nothing is different.

396
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,680
His Highness was fine just now.

397
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,719
What's wrong with him?

398
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,280
It's the algae.

399
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,119
Algae must be the reason.

400
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,319
How dare you spout such nonsense.

401
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,160
Algae grow in the wild.

402
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,959
It's inevitably to be contaminated
with poisonous snakes or toxic insects.

403
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,400
It must be blanched with mung bean soup
before being consumed.

404
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,359
Prince of Wei is being poisoned now.

405
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm afraid they overlooked this matter.

406
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,320
Your Majesty, we were careful
when we prepared the dish.

407
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,919
We'd never commit such a grave mistake.

408
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,080
We should get the imperial physician
to treat Prince of Wei.

409
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,360
Capture all cooks involved in the preparation!

410
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,239
Who made the algae dish today?

411
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,879
They did.

412
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,520
What happened?

413
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,399
Take them away!

414
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Why are you taking us away without any reason?

415
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,639
What are you doing?

416
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Move it!

417
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
What did I do?

418
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,760
Let me go!

419
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,520
Let go of me!

420
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,919
Quiet!

421
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,479
What did we do?

422
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,679
Let me go!

423
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,479
What's going on?

424
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,600
Move it!

425
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,000
Miss Yao,

426
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,280
you must not go there.

427
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,080
What happened?

428
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,679
Matron Hu,

429
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,399
what happened just now?

430
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,600
Matron Hu,

431
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,360
the fresh algae were blanched

432
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,719
with mung bean soup.

433
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,120
Matron Meng and Ziping are innocent.

434
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,760
You barely escaped with your life.

435
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,600
You still have time to be concerned
about their life and death?

436
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,199
You're really an extraordinary person.

437
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:49,879
Our grudge has nothing

438
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,639
to do with our workplace.

439
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,439
Matron Meng and the rest are thrown into prison.

440
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,040
It's going to tarnish
the Imperial Food Service's reputation.

441
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,080
The task of food preparation will fall

442
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,639
in the Directorate for Palace Delicacies' hands.

443
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,280
How will this benefit you at all?

444
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
Matron Meng fails to manage her subordinates.

445
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,760
That's why this mistake happened.

446
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,520
When I officially take over in the future,

447
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
I'll take back the right for the meal preparation.

448
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,080
I don't need a table maid to give her opinions.

449
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,479
But the imperial bodyguard

450
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,600
didn't find anything amiss

451
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,959
with the algae.

452
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,199
How can you be so sure...

453
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,320
The residue of the venom and toxins.

454
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,919
Who can assure the dish Prince of Wei used

455
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,879
has no problem?

456
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,679
Yuehua,

457
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,520
you were in the kitchen all the time.

458
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
You should have seen

459
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,959
every alga was blanched

460
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,639
with mung bean soup to get rid of the toxins.

461
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,159
I didn't see anything.

462
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,239
Yuehua!

463
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,239
Only Yin Ziping and Fang Hanying's

464
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,959
names are on the meal tag.

465
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,280
You managed to escape this time.

466
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,639
But don't forget,

467
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,959
Matron Meng won't be here to protect you anymore.

468
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,719
If you forget your place
and act in defiance again,

469
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,719
don't blame me for being merciless.

470
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,679
Yuehua.

471
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,280
I can win with my skills.

472
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,159
There's no need to complicate things.

473
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,239
I hope you don't think

474
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,360
I did something with the algae.

475
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,040
They were the ones who were careless

476
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,439
and it had to be His Majesty's favorite young son.

477
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,719
Heaven wants her dead.

478
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,159
What if the imperial physician diagnosed

479
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,360
that Prince of Wei's illness really had
nothing to do with them?

480
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,719
Prince of Wei fainted after eating it.

481
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,639
How can they run from that responsibility?

482
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,919
Yuehua, you must understand.

483
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,600
This was not done by anyone.

484
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,919
Everything is heaven's will.

485
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,879
All we do

486
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,360
is just watch and do nothing.

487
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,360
Understand?

488
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,479
Yes.

489
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,199
Your highness,

490
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,320
about Prince of Wei's illness...

491
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,919
Administrative Assistant Dai,

492
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,199
everyone in the palace knows

493
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,479
that my son has been healthy before this trip.

494
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,360
He ate the poisoned algae.

495
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,159
Your Highness, I dare not say that with certainty.

496
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,639
Our priority isn't finding the cause.

497
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
The most important thing

498
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,560
is to treat Prince of Wei.

499
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,675
[Yongning Gate]

500
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,159
Miss Yao.

501
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:48,719
Changqing.

502
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
I've asked someone I know.

503
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Prince of Wei is ill with a high fever.

504
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,320
His Majesty is praying for him

505
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,679
and waiting on him all night in person.

506
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,560
The physician couldn't find
the cause of his illness.

507
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,919
I'm afraid things won't go well for Matron Meng.

508
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,000
Stop waiting.

509
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,919
I want to request an audience
with Noble Consort Guo.

510
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,800
I have something to tell her.

511
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,840
Prince of Wei is seriously ill now.

512
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Noble Consort Guo is angry with Matron Meng now.

513
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,719
Forget about not being able to meet her.

514
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Even if you meet her,

515
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm afraid you'll get implicated too.

516
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,919
Changqing,

517
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,080
can you tell me

518
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,919
what symptoms does Prince of Wei have?

519
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,080
I can't know that.

520
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,320
Let's go.

521
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,600
It won't be just Matron Meng and the rest.

522
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,800
The Directorate of Imperial Parks
and the Court of Imperial Entertainments too.

523
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,919
Anyone who's involved
in this will be implicated too.

524
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,600
It's beyond our control now.

525
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,560
You've been waiting for four hours here.

526
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,320
You've already done all you can.

527
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,560
Just go back.

528
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,080
Come on.

529
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,600
Changqing.

530
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,520
Come on.

531
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,760
Your Majesty,

532
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,959
His Highness may have taken
the antivenom decoction.

533
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,879
But he's too young.

534
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,919
Now, his head is swollen

535
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,239
and has a rapid floating pulse.

536
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,919
I'm afraid he won't be able to make it.

537
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,479
Your Majesty...

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,239
But his back...

539
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,040
He has red dots, swelling, fever,
and painful sensations

540
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,479
because of the accumulation
of toxins in his lungs.

541
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,399
Your Majesty, Shan is just like you.

542
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,760
He's usually frail and sickly.

543
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,919
Why must he suffer like this?

544
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
If we want him to overcome this,

545
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,639
we have to beg heaven to have pity on him.

546
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,840
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince is concerned
about Prince of Wei's illness.

547
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,120
He has been requesting an audience.

548
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,919
No. Tell him to go back.

549
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

550
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,080
Your Majesty, why would Shan get poisoned

551
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,239
for no reason at all?

552
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:12,320
Someone must hate me

553
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,080
and want to take Shan's life on purpose.

554
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,919
Your Highness,

555
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,399
His Majesty asked you to go back.

556
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,760
When Prince of Wei is better,

557
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,800
only then you...

558
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,360
Let's go. Chen Wu.

559
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
This is from the Crown Prince's heart.

560
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,800
Please convey it to His Majesty.

561
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:20,360
Hurry!

562
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,320
Report this to Matron Hu.

563
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,159
Yes.

564
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,080
Your Majesty!

565
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,040
The Imperial Food Service has been wronged.

566
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,600
I'd like to state the case in your presence.

567
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,879
How dare you

568
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,120
stop Her Majesty's sedan.

569
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,879
Leave now!

570
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
Your Majesty,

571
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
the Imperial Food Service has been wronged.

572
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
Somebody, drag her away.

573
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:12,800
Your Majesty,

574
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,320
Hongwu Emperor set up drums
at the main gate of the imperial palace

575
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,919
to allow those who were wronged
to complain in person.

576
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:21,120
Empress Xiaocigao and Empress Xiaochengren
also followed the way of the imperial court,

577
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,560
encouraged freedom of speech,
and redressed injustice.

578
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,560
But now injustice lies before Your Majesty.

579
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,959
How can you just sit and do nothing?

580
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,159
Stop her from talking!

581
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:30,120
Your Majesty!

582
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:30,959
Wait.

583
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

584
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,719
Meng committed a grievous mistake
from her carelessness.

585
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,719
Why are you seeking justice for her?

586
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,679
Take her away.

587
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,600
Matron Hu,

588
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:52,919
how can you make such a claim
in the presence of Her Majesty?

589
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,760
If there's no injustice,

590
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,280
why do you forbid me from defending?

591
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:57,639
What are you waiting for?

592
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:58,719
Matron Hu.

593
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,840
Your Majesty,

594
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,520
please don't listen to her misleading words.

595
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,080
She's a part of Meng's faction.

596
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,800
That's why she's using all means to vindicate her.

597
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,239
I'll send her to the Palace Surveillance

598
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:10,280
as a warning to everyone.

599
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,040
She just mentioned Empress Xiaocigao

600
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,000
and Empress Xiaochengren.

601
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,879
If I don't listen to her grievance,

602
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,080
it means I'm a heartless person.

603
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,239
Your Majesty, Hongwu Emperor did say clearly

604
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,239
that only those who suffer from great grievances
or have classified information can seek justice.

605
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,360
There are still people in the harem

606
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,199
who falsely accuse innocent people on purpose.

607
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,840
Her words can't be trusted.

608
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,879
Now, she's clamoring to seek justice
in your presence and block your sedan.

609
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,320
She has violated the palace rules.

610
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,479
I'm willing to accept my punishment

611
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
for stopping your sedan.

612
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,120
I'm now begging Your Majesty to seek justice.

613
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,800
You need to think about this thoroughly.

614
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,439
If you refused to be punished after this,

615
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,760
you'd be punished for causing trouble.

616
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,199
When that time comes,

617
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,320
I'll send you to the Palace Surveillance
to receive extra punishment.

618
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,000
I beg that Your Majesty help me seek justice.

619
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,199
Your Majesty.

620
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,199
All right.

621
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,000
I'll help you.
