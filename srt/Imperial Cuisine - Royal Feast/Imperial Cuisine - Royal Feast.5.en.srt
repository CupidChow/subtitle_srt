[Episode 5]

3
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,879
I ask for your understanding

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,239
of this inconvenience.

5
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,400
If you confess now,

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
you might get a lighter sentence.

7
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,239
There's a black mole on that girl's left palm.

8
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,239
I remember it vividly. It's here.

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,600
[Fine Meal, Divine Work]

10
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
No need to get physical.

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,960
I will show you myself.

12
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,520
Look.

13
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,279
Sorry, Miss Yao.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
I must be mistaken.

15
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
As long as the truth remains clear.

16
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,960
Chief Liao, though His Majesty said

17
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:08,360
the imperial bodyguard can go anywhere

18
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,399
and can arrest anyone,

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,039
it doesn't mean

20
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,000
they can arrest innocents on a whim.

21
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,720
If I

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
remain silent this time,

23
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,440
I will only bring shame
to the Imperial Food Service.

24
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
It's all just a misunderstanding.

25
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,880
What if the one who infiltrated
the royal palace bears ill intentions?

26
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,720
It's a matter of royal security

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,919
and it shall not be taken lightly.

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Chief Liao, now that the truth has prevailed,

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,839
if you refuse to relent

30
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,720
your searches here,

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,279
we will not be able to proceed with our duty.

32
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,199
No one is free in the Imperial Food Service.

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Stop staring.

34
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,960
Go back to your post.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,559
Officer You, ever since Consort Zhaoxian
passed away,

36
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,960
the Crown Princess has taken over
the affairs in the imperial harem.

37
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,759
She is always fond of Matron Meng.

38
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,960
I was planning to report to you
after I conducted my own investigation,

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,000
but...

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,759
Matron Meng.

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,679
Can you give me your word

42
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,160
that the Imperial Food Service
harbors no infiltrator?

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,759
Yes.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,520
All right then.

45
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,759
Since you give me your word,

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll take it.

47
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,559
But if

48
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,600
someone found a fake maidservant

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,079
within the Imperial Food Service,

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
you will be held liable too, Matron Meng.

51
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,119
You have done your investigation.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,839
I need not explain further.

53
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,480
Officer You.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,279
Farewell.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,559
When Matron Xiao was still indentured,

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
the Palace Surveillance
was the defender of justice.

57
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,239
Now that she's gone,

58
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,519
everything is crumbling down.

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
During the reign of Emperor Hongwu,

60
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,519
the directress of delice is established
to handle food preparation and meal planning.

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
It is from this tradition

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,799
that the Imperial Food Service becomes
the one in charge of sustenance.

63
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,519
However, we are now being called clout chasers.

64
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,959
If the Imperial Food Office has suffered so,

65
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,399
I dare not imagine other offices.

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,119
Gone are the glorious days

67
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,040
of the Six Services and One Surveillance.

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
If only Empress Xiaochengren was still with us.

69
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,640
All right.

70
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,359
Come with me.

71
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:00,799
Follow me.

72
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,720
I said, follow me.

73
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,279
Get inside.

74
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,480
Show me your hand.

75
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,239
You even removed your own mole.

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,640
Ruthless, aren't you?

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,239
Let go.

78
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,559
Let me go!

79
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,200
You

80
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,200
were worried that the imperial bodyguard
might find out about your infiltration.

81
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
If I die now,

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
my death will be ruled as suicide.

83
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:10,839
You will then be spared

84
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,000
from the controversy and questioning.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Is that so?

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
But you didn't expect

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,679
the witness to arrive this early.

88
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,760
Come.

89
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,160
Come with me.

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,119
Just so you know,

91
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,359
now that my problem is over,

92
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,760
yours will begin.

93
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
You and I are going to Matron Meng

94
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
to explain everything.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Come.

96
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:33,720
Come!

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,279
What are you doing?

98
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
I will not come clean.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,279
I would rather die than leave this palace.

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Never!

101
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,320
Fine.

102
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,320
You're not afraid of death.

103
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,119
Tell me then.

104
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,839
What is more daunting than death?

105
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
You will never understand this.

106
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,040
Our nation has many people.

107
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,000
We have different social classes,
categorized by our trades.

108
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,799
Most people are Commoners.

109
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,399
But there are many Outcasts
in Zhejiang and Zhili.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,880
Just because their ancestors supported
the previous regimen.

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
They endure discrimination

112
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,799
and their offspring remain
in that social strata.

113
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,320
They can't take the imperial examination.

114
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,279
They have to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

115
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
And women who look above average?

116
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,880
They have to offer their bodies

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,079
once they grow up.

118
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,080
They are taxed heavily.

119
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,799
My parents expended all their fortune

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
to gather whatever they could

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,239
to get rid of their social status.

122
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,200
But it was all in vain.

123
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
Do you know

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
my whole family is dead?

125
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,919
I'm all alone now.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,280
I don't want to harm you,

127
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,200
but if I'm found out, my people
will be punished again.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,719
So

129
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
you came here

130
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,039
for revenge?

131
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,200
Revenge?

132
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,559
I already struggle to survive.

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,880
What revenge?

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Against whom?

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,679
I don't want to sell my body like my mother did,

136
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,679
nor do I want to grovel
to anyone like my father did.

137
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,919
And worse, I don't want to be like my brother

138
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,520
who lost his life because of one cricket.

139
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,919
I want to live with dignity.

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,479
So I pretended to be dumb.

141
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
And finally, I had the chance

142
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,679
to escape.

143
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,039
I went through many restaurants.

144
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,400
I ran errands. I was a kitchen helper.

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
They don't want a female worker,

146
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,479
then I say I don't want any salary.

147
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,280
I will eat leftovers.

148
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,760
Whatever they put me through,

149
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,400
I'll endure it.

150
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,640
That's my only way

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,159
to learn how to cook in secret.

152
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
Why are you glaring at me?

153
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:31,840
Yes,

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,559
I'm from a low social class.

155
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
I almost became a prostitute

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,440
and I learned how to cook in secret.

157
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I am a thief.

158
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,320
The owner of Changsheng Restaurant does not
want his daughter to enter the palace,

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,320
so he bribed the eunuch.

160
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
That's why I'm here.

161
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,960
It's my only chance.

162
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,599
My only chance!

163
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,400
(Born to a low social class with nowhere to turn to.)

164
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,679
(It's so similar to her situation.)

165
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,679
There. There.

166
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,280
There. There.

167
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,799
Listen to me.

168
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,119
Suicide and homicide

169
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,359
leave different traces.

170
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,840
Don't do something stupid anymore.

171
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,840
Just do what I said.

172
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,000
Matron Meng.

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,479
I would like to report something.

174
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,039
I shall take my leave.

175
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
What happened?

176
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,799
Don't worry.

177
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,039
I will not mention that again.

178
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,200
But this is a matter of grave import.

179
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You need to know.

180
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,719
Directress.

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,320
Yes?

182
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,239
Don't you put great emphasis
on manners, Big Sister?

183
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,400
Why did you barge in here?

184
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,520
Give us a moment, Huaping.

185
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
What do you think you're doing?

186
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
You know the answer already.

187
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,599
Forgive me, Your Highness.

188
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,119
(Your Highness, for the past six months,)

189
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,479
Consort Hu sent her people to
the Medicines Office several times

190
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,003
[Moral and Virtue]

191
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,719
to retrieve medicinal herbs
on the grounds of ailment.

192
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,599
She prescribed herself the medicine

193
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,119
and the directress did not find
any problem with her prescription.

194
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,919
She then gave the approval.

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
You're a skilled healer.

196
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
You know how to get your hands on medicinal herbs.

197
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,280
But I don't understand this.

198
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,719
The consort of Great Imperial Grandson
is a prestigious title.

199
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,919
Why do you wish death upon yourself?

200
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,239
Right.

201
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,039
Being the consort
of Great Imperial Grandson is great.

202
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,760
Cozy bed, comfortable clothes,
and wonderful food.

203
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,119
But Big Sister,

204
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,320
if everything comes at the cost of human lives,

205
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,599
how can I ever be happy?

206
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,799
Human lives?

207
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,479
What human lives?

208
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,599
Have you forgotten?

209
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,599
Back then, I refused to listen to

210
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
our father's orders,

211
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,799
I hid in our grandfather's abode.

212
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,719
(When he was not in the apothecary,)

213
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,559
(I even took over as the physician.)

214
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,119
(This one time,)

215
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,919
(I gave this woman a prescription.)

216
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,440
(Within three days,)

217
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,440
(she and her baby were dead.)

218
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,239
You charlatan!

219
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,520
You killed my wife.

220
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,119
You have to pay for it!

221
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:08,559
Get up!

222
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,960
What are you doing?

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Destroy everything.

224
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,799
Stop!

225
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,559
If you can't heal,

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,119
don't set up an apothecary.

227
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,280
You have to pay!

228
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,799
Stop!

229
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,039
(You lacked medical knowledge.)

230
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,039
(Yet, you defied our father)

231
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,719
(and tried to heal someone yourself.)

232
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,080
(The patient was pregnant)

233
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,239
(and you gave her a prescription
that promotes blood circulation.)

234
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,479
(It's a recipe for disaster.)

235
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,200
She had three daughters already

236
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,559
and her family struggled to feed them.

237
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,280
I heard her plead

238
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
and I couldn't help

239
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,359
but intervene.

240
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,359
Due to your selfish action,

241
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,599
you committed a grave mistake.

242
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,359
If our father didn't toil hard to clear your name,

243
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,719
you wouldn't be standing right here.

244
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Clear my name?

245
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,119
Clear my name?

246
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,320
I thought my incompetence

247
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,359
killed someone.

248
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,599
I tarnished my grandfather's reputation

249
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
and my father had to clean up my mess.

250
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,760
And so, I listened to all of you like a little lamb

251
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,359
and be a consort.

252
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,239
And then, Grandfather told me

253
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,479
that to force me to go back,

254
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,719
you lot increased the dosage

255
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,200
and killed the patient.

256
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,239
Big Sister.

257
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,599
What is your heart made of?

258
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,359
Why would you commit such cruelty

259
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,880
for fame and riches?

260
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,679
Your Highness!

261
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,250
[Hongqing Palace]

262
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,599
It's still sour.

263
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,080
Your Highness.

264
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,680
Your Highness?

265
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,079
Your Highness?

266
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,239
I am the auspicious star made by my family,

267
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,079
a tool for you to have access
to greater power and riches.

268
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,439
You tread on thin ice

269
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,680
and treat me like royalty.

270
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,560
Now that I know your true face,

271
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,199
you don't have to pretend anymore.

272
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,439
You always add

273
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
a minuscule amount of poison to your food

274
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,680
in hopes that your body

275
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,479
will eventually succumb to it

276
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,239
without raising any suspicion.

277
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,040
I intercepted all your endeavors, 

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,359
but you don't plan to give up.

279
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:51,040
The plan even misfired that day,
jeopardizing the Great Imperial Grandson's health.

280
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:52,479
Is that right?

281
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,479
Count yourself lucky

282
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
that His Highness is fine.

283
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,680
Oh, my auspicious star.

284
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,599
I don't care about your tantrum

285
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,760
or your pain.

286
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,319
Remember this.

287
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,439
It is through sheer luck that this scandal
did not travel far.

288
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,280
Otherwise, you won't be the only one dying.

289
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,239
The entire family will die with you.

290
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,160
You don't care about me or Father,

291
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,640
but you certainly do care about your mother

292
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
and other innocent siblings, don't you?

293
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,439
Be a dear and be the consort.

294
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,199
If the Great Imperial Grandson is bored of you,

295
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,560
then you're no longer the auspicious star.

296
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,800
[Foods Office]

297
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,119
Zijin, let me help you.

298
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,839
Yin Ziping, come here.

299
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,760
Yes,

300
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,479
Manager Fang?

301
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,839
From now on,

302
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,760
you're not allowed in the main kitchen.

303
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,800
Why?

304
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:07,800
What happened?

305
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,319
What did Yin Ziping do wrong?

306
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,319
Exactly, what did she do?

307
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,400
Manager Fang.

308
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,439
No more questions.

309
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,319
Go back to your work.

310
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
I told Matron Meng

311
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,079
about Yin Ziping's true origin.

312
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,319
You were eavesdropping?

313
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't understand

314
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,760
why you gave someone like her a second chance
over and over again.

315
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,000
But I

316
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,560
will never work with her kind.

317
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,959
But

318
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,719
Matron Meng gave her word in public

319
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,000
that there was no infiltrator
among the Imperial Food Service.

320
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,959
She's lucky then.

321
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,239
Even if the entire service

322
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,640
knows her secret,

323
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,719
no one will spill it.

324
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,920
Once the scandal is over,

325
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,599
we can just find any reason to expel her.

326
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,719
Move aside.

327
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,520
Is what Manager Fang said true?

328
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,560
She's so dirty.

329
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,160
No idea.

330
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,719
Let's go. Let's not get involved.

331
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,199
Come in.

332
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,439
Careful.

333
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,000
All right.

334
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,599
This will do.

335
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:56,760
Come.

336
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,040
This one.

337
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,280
Yuehua.

338
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,719
My wound has healed.

339
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:48,959
Thanks.

340
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,079
Why are you here with me?

341
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,719
It's too cold outside.

342
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,719
They asked me to bring some blankets to you.

343
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,719
Remember to take your medicine too.

344
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,439
I'll go back in.

345
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,520
You're lying.

346
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,560
They think I'm tainted and disgusting.

347
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,959
They won't care about me.

348
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,479
I had a tutor.

349
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,479
An intelligent woman

350
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,599
who mastered reading and drawing.

351
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,959
(She was a performer.)

352
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,400
(Just like panhandlers,)

353
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
(it belongs to the Outcast category.)

354
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,359
According to the laws,

355
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,000
a performer cannot live a luxurious life

356
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,520
and cannot marry a Commoner.

357
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
She couldn't even walk
in the middle of a thoroughfare.

358
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,439
She was looked down upon all her life

359
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,199
and she never had a home.

360
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
However, she never

361
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,599
submitted to her fate.

362
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,439
The lower your status is,

363
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,520
the tighter you should grab onto your ambition.

364
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,439
Even if I want to change,

365
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,520
it's too late already.

366
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,760
My tutor

367
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,319
loved drinking wine.

368
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,719
When she was drunk,

369
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,359
she would keep repeating,

370
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,000
"It's not fair!"

371
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,800
"It's not fair!"

372
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,160
"It's not fair!"

373
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,319
That's who she is.

374
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,319
No matter how much everyone despises
or loathes you,

375
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,079
you have to prove to everyone

376
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,119
that you can live with dignity.

377
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,800
It's not fair!

378
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,800
It's not fair!

379
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,800
It's not fair!

380
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,079
It's not fair!

381
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,000
It's not fair!

382
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
It's not fair!

383
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:14,959
Better now?

384
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,839
Take the medicine.

385
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,040
Sleep under the stove.

386
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,239
It's warm there.

387
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:22,959
I'll head back in.

388
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:33,680
You...

389
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,079
Sorry.

390
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,079
I was wrong.

391
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:53,000
[Chunyou Gate]

392
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,520
Miss.

393
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,520
Miss.

394
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,239
Don't you have to go to the Wines Office?

395
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,719
Let us do it.

396
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,760
Thank you.

397
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,040
Thank you.

398
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Miss Yao is so friendly

399
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,239
and she looks after us too.

400
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,319
She would make a great manager.

401
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,599
Let's go.

402
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,359
Matron Meng.

403
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,520
I'm begging you.

404
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,359
I beg of you.

405
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,920
Please, Matron Meng.

406
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Please.

407
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,680
Get up.

408
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:40,680
Matron Meng.

409
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,959
Can I cook now?

410
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,959
Do you have no shame?

411
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:18,839
You will take part in the competition?

412
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Of course.

413
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm not like you

414
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,160
who can't even catch his shadow.

415
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,680
I did.

416
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
What?

417
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,719
You went through all that

418
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
just to take a glance?

419
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,319
Oh well.

420
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,880
One is a noble and distant royalty,

421
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,839
while the other is a maidservant
who is cleaning dishes.

422
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
The distance between you two

423
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,040
is greater than the universe.

424
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
I don't think you two are meant to be together.

425
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,359
Hold your horses.

426
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:07,640
We might be.

427
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,359
(Back then, my mother was bedridden.)

428
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
(I was sent to the north to my grandparents'.)

429
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,479
(I hated how boring it was there,)

430
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,359
(so I snuck out)

431
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,040
(and played with the girls from nearby houses.)

432
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,640
(His Majesty wasp showing
the Great Imperial Grandson how to tend a land)

433
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,640
(and that's how I met him.)

434
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,280
Stay put.

435
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,640
Look.

436
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,839
Get up. Come on.

437
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,119
Have some water.

438
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,680
Go.

439
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,439
If this is not fate, what is?

440
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
You fool.

441
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,599
It's just a chance encounter
and you think it hints at a greater meaning.

442
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,280
Do you know him?

443
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,760
What if you don't like him

444
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,199
once you get to know him in person?

445
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,400
That's why you need to

446
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,079
know his character first

447
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,839
before deciding if you want to pursue him.

448
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:45,359
You know a lot for your age.

449
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
As the saying goes,

450
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
a talented gentleman and a beautiful lady
make a great couple.

451
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,880
I have watched many operas, you know.

452
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,880
May all lovebirds

453
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,640
in this world

454
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,239
know no separation or parting.

455
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,800
Zijin,

456
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,199
what are you on about?

457
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,400
I was saying how everyone recites
Romance of the Western Chamber

458
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,599
but forgets about Yingying's Biography.

459
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,760
You must have had a busy day, Matron.

460
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,479
I have been waiting for a long time.

461
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,479
Your Lordship?

462
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,040
The gate has been locked.

463
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,800
How dare you trespass into the imperial harem?

464
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,319
You misunderstand, Matron.

465
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,719
I played chess with my father today

466
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,959
and I'll have a meeting with him tomorrow.

467
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,640
That's why I'm spending a night here.

468
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
But you shouldn't be here.

469
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,040
Farewell.

470
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,439
It's fine if you want

471
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,599
to put on a stoic face in front of your savior.

472
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,640
But to do that when you finally

473
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,560
reunited with your own daughter?

474
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,319
Your heartlessness and ungratefulness

475
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,959
are second

476
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
to none.

477
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,079
It was you.

478
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,359
Indeed.

479
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,599
It was me who sent someone to inform Su Yuehua.

480
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,599
Look at the hard work I put in

481
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,400
to reunite you and your daughter.

482
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Why are you staring at me?

483
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,400
Don't get too emotional.

484
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,800
You want to blackmail me?

485
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,359
Did you forget who saved you?

486
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,199
Let go of me!

487
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,040
Let go!

488
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,199
Help!

489
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:03,839
Stay here.

490
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,360
Let go of me!

491
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,959
Injustice!

492
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,719
Sir!

493
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:23,679
Insolence!

494
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,280
Sir!

495
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,600
Move aside.

496
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,520
Sir, it is not my fault.

497
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,560
-It is not my fault, sir!
-Let go.

498
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,639
Let go!

499
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,800
Sir!

500
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
It's injustice!

501
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,520
Let go!

502
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
I

503
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,600
merely killed someone who wished

504
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,080
to commit a crime while drunk.

505
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,919
You killed your brother-in-law.

506
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,520
But you know I killed him

507
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,360
in self-defense.

508
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,479
I am innocent.

509
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,719
Familial virtues outweigh right and wrong.

510
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,080
By right, you should be dead.

511
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:07,000
Yet you lived

512
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
because the Emperor pardoned everyone.

513
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,199
You're exonerated from the death penalty.

514
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,320
And then, you were expelled from your own family.

515
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,719
Out of generosity, I took you in

516
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,239
as a maidservant.

517
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,159
Now, you're the venerable Matron Meng.

518
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:24,360
You owe it to me.

519
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,639
When I first came here,

520
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,600
I was but a lowly maidservant.

521
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,719
I rose to this position on my own.

522
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Besides, I have helped you too.

523
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,919
My debt towards you might be huge,

524
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,760
but it can be repaid eventually.

525
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,520
Whether you trust me or not,

526
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,159
I did not expect

527
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,840
any return when I helped you.

528
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
When I first saw you,

529
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,120
I...

530
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,479
Why are you smiling?

531
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,600
Your Lordship.

532
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,439
You should know

533
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,239
that the moment I killed Su Feng,

534
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,280
the innocent Meng Ziyun died with him too.

535
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,320
The current me

536
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,159
has no father,

537
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,560
no husband, no daughter,

538
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,919
and no heart.

539
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
I can help you one last time.

540
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:39,919
Speak.

541
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,239
Do this for me.

542
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,719
Get out now. Out!

543
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,080
Your Highness.

544
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,679
Father.

545
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,679
Father.

546
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
You left in a hurry just now.

547
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,639
Did your leg pain return?

548
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,760
Let me massage your leg.

549
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,520
Come on.

550
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,600
Mother.

551
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,879
Your Highness.

552
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,399
You know very well that Prince of Han

553
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,840
is His Majesty's favorite.

554
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
Why are you doing this to yourself then?

555
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,879
During his sojourn in the capital,

556
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,239
he used the imperial wagon many times
without permission

557
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
and refused to return to his fief.

558
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,719
All ministers submitted memorandums
and asked for an impeachment,

559
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,879
but after reading them,

560
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,959
Father put the blame on my pettiness

561
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,679
and said I was ostracizing my own family.

562
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,760
I haven't met with the ministers for many days,

563
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,760
let alone asking them to impeach Gaoxu.

564
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,959
I know my father favors Gaoxu,

565
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,360
but I am also his son!

566
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,320
His son, I tell you!

567
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,959
Is it because

568
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,760
of my size?

569
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,919
As a father and a ruler,
how can he be this impartial?

570
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:34,719
Your Highness.

571
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,479
Mind your words, Your Highness.

572
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,000
Grandfather is old and his health is declining.

573
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,199
Just do what he wants

574
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,639
and don't talk back.

575
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,080
My uncle might behave like he's above the law now,

576
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
but his military feat after years
on the battlefield with Grandfather

577
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,479
is not to be forgotten.

578
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,600
He might be testing the water
with his bold action now.

579
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,639
I understand your frustration, Father.

580
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,639
But instead of being upset,

581
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,320
why not bring some herbal soup to Grandfather

582
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:07,919
to show that you care?

583
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,239
Make sure you don't sound resentful

584
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,639
and botch this reconciliation.

585
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,199
Okay.

586
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,280
Well done, my son.

587
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,479
Let me get some air.

588
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,879
His Majesty wants you
to reflect upon yourself here.

589
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,199
Where are you going?

590
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,000
If he ever puts me in prison,

591
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,360
you'll be the prison warden.

592
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,000
For 27 years, you watch over me.

593
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:51,600
What now?

594
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,639
I can't even

595
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,280
go out to get some air?

596
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,399
Prison warden!

597
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:15,800
Mother.

598
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,239
I shall take my leave now.

599
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,199
Go.

600
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you find anything?

601
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,399
Prince of Han did not enter the palace
to explain himself.

602
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,919
But His Majesty was furious out of a sudden
after lunch

603
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,159
and summoned the Crown Prince.

604
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,239
Lunch?

605
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,320
These are all rejected from Qianqing Palace?

606
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,159
Yes.

607
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,360
His Majesty did not eat anything we served

608
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,600
and sent them all back.

609
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,439
This is...?

610
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,080
A snack made by Matron Meng.

611
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,239
Emperor Taizu of Song encountered a stalemate
in his attempt to conquer Southern Tang.

612
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
He was so anxious and troubled
that he couldn't eat.

613
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
He then fell sick within the encampment.

614
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,000
Fortunately, a chef

615
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,719
made a snack out of local candied mandarin

616
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,479
and walnut.

617
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:59,120
That managed to solve the crisis

618
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,639
and this tide-turning snack

619
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:04,239
is called Emperor's Savior.

620
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,520
I heard that during the war,

621
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,080
Prince of Han was the first to charge in

622
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,399
with his troop whenever His Majesty
was in danger.

623
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,439
His selflessness turned the tides

624
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,879
of many battles.

625
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:23,320
That's why

626
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,439
when His Majesty sees this snack,

627
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,000
he will be reminded of Prince of Han's
contributions and filial piety.

628
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,080
You're dismissed.

629
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,080
Noted.

630
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:54,120
It seems like a storm is brewing
in the Imperial Food Service.

631
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:02,719
Thank you for your forgiveness, Your Highness.

632
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,719
I merely agreed to help the Prince of Han

633
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:07,560
to appease him.

634
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:11,159
I wanted to know what he is up to in the capital

635
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,639
and if he poses any threat to the Crown Prince.
