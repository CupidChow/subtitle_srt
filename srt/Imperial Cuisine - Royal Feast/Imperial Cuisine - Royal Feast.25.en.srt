[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 25]

3
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,160
Your Highness.

4
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,639
Your Highness,

5
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,360
brush this butter on these skewers.

6
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,839
Why are you using butter?

7
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
roasting meat uses different heat.

9
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,839
For instance, firewood, charcoal,
and hemp can bring out

10
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,960
different flavors.

11
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,119
Different meat

12
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,839
requires different ways of grilling methods.

13
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
For instance, roasted pork ribs were originally

14
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,639
a popular cuisine of Kaifeng
of the Northern Song Dynasty.

15
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,160
They brush a mixture of pepper and salt
on the meat while roasting.

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,199
But Your Majesty's constitution is prone
to internal heat.

17
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,880
That's why I especially switched to using butter.

18
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,759
I've been for a long time now.

20
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,919
Stop grilling already.

21
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,880
The meat is going to get tough.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,479
Father,

23
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,119
it's hot.

24
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,479
It's not that crisp.

25
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,880
Your Majesty,

26
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
the first bite will definitely be tender

27
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
if we brush with butter

28
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
while grilling it.

29
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,639
If it's crispy,

30
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,479
it's because of the improper way of grilling.

31
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,375
[Roasted Lamb Ribs]

32
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,479
Father.

33
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,640
Do you still remember

34
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,480
I sent someone

35
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,320
to deliver

36
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,359
roasted lamb to you one time?

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,799
That was my first game of wild goat

38
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,119
during my hunting trip.

39
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,200
We're using

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,119
more succulent lamb ribs

41
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
which are more flavorful.

42
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,279
Burnt.

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,279
Burnt?

44
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,040
I mean

45
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,720
the lamb you grilled that time was burnt.

46
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,440
It was too awful to eat.

47
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,720
Because that was

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,399
the first time I roasted something.

49
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,679
I had no experience.

50
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,040
Manager Yao,

51
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,799
roasted meat is greasy.

52
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,880
His Majesty had toothache after eating these.

53
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,920
How can you serve this without permission?

54
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,119
Directress Su,

55
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,600
I've added some thyme powder

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
in the seasonings.

57
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,799
It can dispel the heat and gamey smell.

58
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,359
It also works as a seasoning
and improves flavors.

59
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,519
His Majesty's meal is complemented

60
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,480
with chrysanthemum tea, reducing internal heat.

61
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,279
As long as the meal is paired well,

62
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,040
roasted meat can protect the body from cold.

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
This nourishment therapy also has
the effect of treating deficiencies.

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,320
Moreover,

65
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,679
didn't you

66
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,559
and Matron Hu prepare

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
roasted meat during the banquet that day?

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,640
Your Majesty,

69
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,040
I've prepared meals

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,279
for you meticulously.

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
What's this?

72
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:21,150
[Roasted Mandarin Fish]

73
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,559
Quickly.

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Your Majesty, please have a taste.

75
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
It has

76
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
the taste of scallops.

77
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
You're right, Your Majesty.

78
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
In the fish belly,

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
(I've added bamboo shoots, mushrooms,)

80
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,119
(sea cucumber, scallops,)

81
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,440
(egg white,)

82
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,119
(and pork to season it.)

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,799
(Because the fish)

84
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,920
(was wrapped tightly in caul fat and flatbread.)

85
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,359
The fish will taste fresh

86
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
and not greasy with all the aromas overflowing

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
even if the fish is roasted.

88
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,799
This roasted mandarin fish also has the effect

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
of nourishing the heart, moistening the lungs,

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,359
and excreting oil.

91
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,959
The name of this fish does rhyme

92
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,440
with riches and nobility.

93
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,440
It's a good omen.

94
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,399
Why aren't you eating?

95
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,640
Father,

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,320
I've caught a cold when I was practicing

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,000
my sword just now.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't feel well.

99
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,679
I'll take my leave for now.

100
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,279
Summon Sheng Yin.

101
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,839
I didn't expect

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,959
that you'd come

104
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,359
before His Majesty to flatter him.

105
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Zijin,

106
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,799
don't get in my way.

107
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,000
Your Majesty.

108
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,840
Let's go

109
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,280
and take a look.

110
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,080
Your Highness,

111
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
my right hand isn't that nimble.

112
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,919
Never mind. Let Yuan Qi do it.

113
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,880
I worry some clumsy person might aggravate

114
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,440
my injuries.

115
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,880
I can understand using my injuries as an excuse.

116
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,679
But why did you want me

117
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,159
to bring up the lamb incident?

118
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,799
These are

119
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,719
Cat's Eye crystals

120
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,719
all the way from Ormus.

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Do you like them?

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Your Highness,

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,359
I dare not say.

124
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,559
Speak.

125
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,640
I'll pardon you.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,359
How is a man closer to his grandson

127
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
than his son?

128
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,039
Even wood element stays away
from fire element to stay close to earth element.

129
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,159
In the Late Emperor's heart,

130
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Your Highness

131
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,960
is his beloved grandson.

132
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,400
While His Majesty

133
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,359
was the eldest son, blamed for everything he did.

134
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,599
Most of the time,

135
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,400
Your Highness and the Empress had to help him.

136
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,280
In the long run,

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm afraid Your Highness also thinks

138
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
that you've played a role in His Majesty

139
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
ascending the throne successfully.

140
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,000
Naturally,

141
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
there's less admiration and awe

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
for His Majesty

143
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,400
in your heart.

144
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,880
You have such audacity.

145
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
Is your hand not fully recovered yet?

146
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Highness,

147
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,080
Imperial Physician Sheng's treatment
is miraculous.

148
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
My recovery has progressed greatly.

149
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,359
"Two countries compete and use their troops

150
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,200
to set up a team to determine
the victor and loser."

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,479
"The horses lead the way

152
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,919
to defend the palace from enemy's march."

153
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,359
"Mount the chariots to stop the losing soldiers

154
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,479
with cannonballs flying over the city."

155
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,359
"When the military situation
is easily understood,

156
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,080
peace is seen after success."

157
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,520
It's the poem

158
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,159
Father composed when he was the Crown Prince

159
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,280
to reply to Zeng Ziqi.

160
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,000
This poem appears
to be talking about chess moves.

161
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,719
But lies hidden

162
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,960
is the current Emperor's vision

163
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
to build a peaceful

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,599
and prosperous era.

165
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,200
You speak

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
as if you know my father

167
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,359
more than I do.

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
As soon as the Emperor ascended the throne,

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,799
His Majesty stopped all purchases by officials.

170
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,400
He also passed down dozens of decrees

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
for disaster relief and tax exemptions.

172
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,559
Not only does it lighten the burden

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
of the hard laborers and taxes,

174
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,000
but it also straightens out
the officials' administrations

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,039
and encourages the freedom of speech.

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
Throughout the dynasties,

177
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,719
there were founders of dynasties
with outstanding talent

178
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
and wise emperors who maintained
their predecessors' achievements.

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,119
However, an emperor like His Majesty,
who's generous, kind,

180
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,799
respectful, thrifty, and loves his people

181
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,599
should have his fame remembered

182
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,919
and passed down for generations to come.

183
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,679
If I am to speak of His Majesty's wisdom,

184
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,840
three days and three nights aren't enough
to speak of it.

185
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,919
However, there's one thing...

186
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,280
Father. Mother.

187
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
What brings you here?

188
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,919
I heard you had relapsed
from your old injury at the drill ground.

189
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,479
So I especially came to visit

190
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,280
with your father.

191
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
I can't believe you.

192
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:50,919
Why didn't you

193
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,280
tell us that you were injured?

194
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,039
I'm at fault

195
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,239
for having worried you.

196
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,640
There, go on.

197
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,520
Your Majesty,

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
I spoke without thinking.

199
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,320
I deserved to be punished.

200
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,000
No harm.

201
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I won't blame you

202
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,960
for anything you say today.

203
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,679
-Your Majesty.
-Father,

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
this daring lass said

205
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
your achievement

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,559
will be famous through the ages.

207
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,200
I didn't ask you.

208
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,400
You said three days and three nights

209
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,799
are not enough to discuss
my merits and achievements.

210
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
There was only one thing
that was not handled properly.

211
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,840
What is it?

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,239
How dare a lowly female official

213
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,000
talk about the Emperor.

214
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,559
She should be punished.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,479
Speak.

216
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,679
Your Majesty,

217
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,919
I only heard these from the marketplace.

218
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
They said...

219
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:48,799
They...

220
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,359
Speak up.

221
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,640
They said

222
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,280
the treacherous officials
and main perpetrators

223
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,239
from Emperor Jianwen's
reign had been brought to justice.

224
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,280
It's just pitiful

225
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
that their innocent wives and daughters

226
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:57,880
had to suffer...

227
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,400
Silence!

228
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,400
Speak.

229
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,559
They were either all implicated,

230
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
subjected to the Music Office,

231
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,479
or become slaves to meritorious officials.

232
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,520
Some were even exiled far away

233
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,039
and died in foreign lands.

234
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,559
Your Majesty granted an amnesty

235
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,400
when you ascended the throne,

236
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,239
which was praised by the people.

237
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,479
Your Majesty's grace is like
the brightness of the sun

238
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,559
that even the sinners can be forgiven.

239
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,200
However,

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,359
why can't this light shine

241
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,280
upon those who suffer

242
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,640
the most in this world?

243
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
Reckless words. Take your leave now.

244
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
Father,

245
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,159
she's just an ignorant girl.

246
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,799
Please show her some generosity

247
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,280
and don't blame her.

248
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,919
I ascended the throne

249
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
to rule the people.

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
However, the world is vast

251
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,760
with many complicated affairs.

252
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,400
How can I manage it all by myself?

253
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
It was my sincere intention

254
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
when I issued a request asking for advice.

255
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,159
But there were only a few
who offered their advice.

256
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,520
If no one says anything,

257
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
the subordinates will follow
their superiors' conduct.

258
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,799
The corrupted
and the honest officials mingled around.

259
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,640
There won't be any discipline at all.

260
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,799
A female official from the imperial harem

261
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,200
has spoken the truth to me today.

262
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,760
How can I blame her?

263
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,039
I've said this before.

264
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,559
Merits will be rewarded,
and offenses will be punished.

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,159
You are...

266
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:32,919
Your Majesty,

267
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm a manager of the Imperial Food Service.

268
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,159
Your Majesty has promoted you as the directress.

269
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,039
Show your gratitude to His Majesty.

270
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

271
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,559
Take good care of yourself.

272
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,760
Depart to Nanjing after you've recovered.

273
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Thank you, Father.

274
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,440
My Empress,

275
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,359
it was Father's decree to punish

276
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,200
the families of treacherous officials.

277
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,760
Now,

278
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
if I pardon them,

279
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,479
will that mean I'm defying Father's decree?

280
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,799
All women in the harem are forbidden

281
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,719
to discuss affairs outside the palace.

282
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,400
Since you've asked me,

283
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm obligated to answer.

284
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
You were about ten years old

285
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,159
when you waited upon Hongwu Emperor.

286
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,799
You're naturally abiding
by the ancestral's instructions.

287
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,960
Instructions of the Ancestor
of the August Ming stated

288
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,520
that laws and punishments are intended
to warn others.

289
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,119
They're not usually used by their predecessors.

290
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,479
When the future generations ascend the throne,

291
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,280
they shall abide by these instructions
and the Great Announcement.

292
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,640
They shall not impose new laws

293
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,520
for fear of accidentally implicating

294
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,719
the innocent.

295
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,359
These women were innocent, to begin with.

296
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,959
If you pardon them at this moment,

297
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
you're truly abiding
by the ancestral's instructions.

298
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,920
My Empress,

299
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,520
have you been holding

300
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,400
these words in your heart

301
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
for a long time?

302
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,560
That palace maid may be bold.

303
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Yet, she has spoken

304
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
what has been on your mind.

305
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,479
As your empress,

306
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
I should share this burden with you.

307
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,040
Pass down my decree.

308
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,760
The treacherous ministers
and the main perpetrators

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,880
during Jianwen's reign were executed.

310
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,040
Their family was subjected to the Music Office,

311
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,040
imperial bodyguards,

312
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,199
Palace Laundry Service,

313
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,000
craftsmanship,

314
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,439
and as slaves for meritorious officials.

315
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
If there are any survivors,

316
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
they shall be granted amnesty,

317
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,359
pardoned,

318
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,640
and provided with farmlands.

319
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
You're wise, Your Majesty.

320
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Your Highness,

321
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,040
I should take my leave

322
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,800
now there's nothing else.

323
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,000
You used me.

324
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:20,280
Your Highness,

325
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,959
I didn't know

326
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,800
His Majesty would come.

327
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,199
When I think about it carefully,

328
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,119
Father will definitely examine my injury

329
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,479
from the drill ground in person.

330
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,239
You already knew he was coming.

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,640
Your Highness.

332
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,560
You've gone too far

333
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,520
with your flattering towards Father.

334
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,479
Your purpose was

335
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,760
to appeal

336
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
to those exiled women.

337
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
Your Highness, you've misunderstood.

338
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,000
I didn't do that.

339
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,040
I wouldn't dare.

340
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,359
Stop lying.

341
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,479
Your Highness,

342
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,439
those innocent women were demoted

343
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
as musicians overnight

344
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,400
because of their clan's mistakes.

345
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
They were forced to entertain people
with their voices and looks

346
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
and were subjected to all kinds of humiliation.

347
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,280
This unfortunate ordeal

348
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,680
is similar to my mother's.

349
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,199
Your Highness,

350
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I also did you a favor.

351
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
If I didn't,

352
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,719
you'd have left for Nanjing already.

353
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,479
I shouldn't

354
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,640
have given a rabbit to you.

355
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
A fox would have been

356
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,479
a better match for you.

357
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,520
The obedience and cleverness

358
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,359
you've shown me were all pretenses.

359
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,479
I...

360
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,599
Liar.

361
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,439
You lied to me too.

362
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,719
What?

363
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,680
You said you'll let me leave.

364
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,199
Was that true?

365
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,199
You took advantage of me
because I'm not versed in the art of war.

366
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,560
I didn't know advancing by taking a step back.

367
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,319
You made every attempt

368
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,079
to just trick me.

369
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,719
If there's nothing else,

370
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,839
I'll take my leave now.

371
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,839
It was true that I tricked you.

372
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,680
It was also true

373
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,280
about letting you leave.

374
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,760
-Don't go in.
-Why?

375
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,640
Don't stop me.

376
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,520
I have something urgent to report.

377
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,040
His Highness is busy.

378
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Your Highness.

379
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,319
Your Highness,

380
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,239
he barged in.

381
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:34,719
He...

382
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,600
[Foods Office]

383
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,040
Miss Yao!

384
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,920
Miss Yao is back.

385
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,839
Directress Yao.

386
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,479
Miss Yao.

387
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,520
Directress Yao is back.

388
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,599
Congratulations, Directress.

389
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,880
You may have injured your hand.

390
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,119
Yet, it's a blessing in disguise.

391
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,280
You were even rewarded by His Majesty.

392
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,119
This is

393
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,439
such good luck.

394
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,839
-That's right.
-She's right.

395
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,280
Let us all chip in something

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,359
for tonight's get-together

397
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,520
and have fun together. What do you think?

398
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,880
-Sure!
-All right!

399
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
That's enough.

400
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,959
We're suffocating Miss Yao

401
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,160
from surrounding her.

402
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Miss Yao,

403
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,959
are you teaching us how to cook

404
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,119
after you've become the directress?

405
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,680
-Yes, are you?
-Are you?

406
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,079
Are you going to teach us?

407
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,880
Miss Yao, you must teach us.

408
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,319
That's right. Teach us.

409
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,839
Please teach us.

410
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,800
-Come on.
-Let's go.

411
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,640
Get back to work.

412
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,359
Directress Yao,

413
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,239
Her Majesty summons your presence.

414
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,520
Directress Yao, don't move.

415
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,760
Let Directress Jiang check

416
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
for a diagnosis and treatment for you.

417
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,319
Her medical skills

418
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,880
are far more skillful than Directress Pan,

419
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
who's recuperating outside the palace.

420
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,359
Directress Jiang, how is she?

421
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,719
Please report to Her Majesty.

422
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,280
Directress Yao's

423
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,400
right hand is recovering very well.

424
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,319
As long as she doesn't use the ladle and cook,

425
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,239
it won't affect her muscles and bones.

426
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,760
She has a healthy body.

427
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,160
She's just a little depressed.

428
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,959
I think it's due to fatigue from overwork.

429
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,560
As long as she takes proper rest,

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,079
it won't be a problem.

431
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,199
I'll prescribe Yueju Pill

432
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,800
to regulate her energy flow
and treat her depression.

433
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,160
I'll leave it to you, then.

434
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,719
Congratulations.

435
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,079
What's the meaning of this?

436
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,760
Come in.

437
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,839
Stop her.

438
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,719
Let me out.

439
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
Li.

440
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,040
Old Madam.

441
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,439
Li will be conferred
as the Crown Prince's Concubine.

442
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,079
She shall use

443
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,520
the best hairpins and earrings.

444
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,560
Old Madam.

445
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Imperial Concubine?

446
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,479
Old Madam,

447
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,280
we must send envoys to perform

448
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,520
the conferment of the Imperial Concubine.

449
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,359
We must abide by the rituals.

450
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,719
Her Majesty has ordered

451
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,439
that everything be done
according to Old Madam's wishes.

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
Yes.

453
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,000
The Eastern Palace is upright and decent.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,760
He's also the Crown Prince.

455
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,479
Why would he take the risk
and order the assassination?

456
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,920
If the Crown Prince was behind this,

457
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,680
why would he let the imperial bodyguard
take over?

458
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,800
Won't that be telling everyone

459
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
who's the one behind the assassination?

460
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
There are many doubts in this matter.

461
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,839
Your Majesty must not trust others easily.

462
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,760
I have my own opinion about this.

463
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
You haven't recovered yet.

464
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,040
So don't worry about it.

465
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,160
Your Majesty,

466
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,560
the imperial bodyguard failed

467
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,319
to investigate everything.

468
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,560
I failed in my duty.

469
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Please allow a grace period of three days.

470
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,680
I'll start the investigation again

471
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,119
to find out the person behind this matter.

472
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:50,800
Please announce my arrival.

473
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
His Highness, the Crown Prince, has arrived.

474
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,599
Father,

475
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:04,294
I've sent some men to investigate

476
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,199
and was informed

477
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,560
that the craftsmen

478
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,719
who set up the black powder
for the Aoshan Lanterns

479
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,280
were killed during the commotion

480
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,719
on the night of the celebration.

481
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,280
After that incident, you showed mercy
on innocent craftsmen

482
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,239
who were wrongfully accused.

483
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,680
Not only did you not blame them,

484
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,640
but you also made compensation for the lives

485
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,959
of craftsmen that were lost.

486
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,079
This person

487
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,119
had also escaped

488
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:21,959
the imperial bodyguards' interrogation.

489
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,800
No wonder.

490
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,800
We've strictly interrogated craftsmen

491
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,400
who were alive.

492
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,520
Who would

493
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
even suspect the dead?

494
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,479
Your Majesty,

495
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,359
I'm sure we can find evidence on this person.

496
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,000
His master

497
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,560
used to work

498
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,640
for the Prince of Han ten years ago.

499
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Prince of Han?

500
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,160
Are you all right?

501
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

502
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,959
You're still recovering
from your serious injuries.

503
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,599
Yet, you're here to plead for me.

504
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I should be thanking you.

505
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
This trick of planting and framing

506
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,400
is despicable.

507
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,160
The Emperor was blinded

508
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
in a moment of anger.

509
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Your Highness, please rest assured.

510
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,280
However, there's one thing.

511
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,280
I'm worried someone might use this opportunity

512
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
to lure you away from here.

513
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:22,880
You must be careful, Your Highness.

514
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,520
Don't leave the capital in the meantime.

515
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,000
Get well soon.

516
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,280
You can take them out now.

517
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,239
All right.

518
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,280
Pay attention

519
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
to the position of this placement.

520
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,319
All right.

521
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,920
You have to place it layer by later
in food plating.

522
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,760
Don't get in everyone's way here.

523
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,160
Leave now.

524
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,719
I'm also a table maid
of the Imperial Food Service.

525
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,239
Table maid?

526
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,520
This is as far as

527
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,359
an inferior rank can go.

528
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,760
When I take over the Imperial Food Service,

529
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:21,800
maybe I can

530
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
share some leftovers with you.

531
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Your Majesty.

532
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,959
Your Majesty,

533
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,880
it's windy out here.

534
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,959
We should go back early.

535
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,599
My chest has felt tight lately.

536
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,280
I should take a stroll.

537
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:58,920
Eunuch Liu,

538
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,760
is His Majesty worried
about the assassinations?

539
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Why aren't you in full prostration

540
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,319
in His Majesty's presence?

541
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
The Imperial Food Service
prepared some pastries.

542
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,280
May Your Majesty enjoy them.

543
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,839
You've put a lot of effort into this.

544
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.

545
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,199
What do you think, Directress Su?

546
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
You're not the only one

547
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,319
who can please His Majesty.

548
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,079
Looks like I underestimated you.

549
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,040
That's of course.

550
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,000
His Majesty has decreed

551
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,000
that I'm permitted to serve His Majesty

552
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,040
with delicious and interesting meals

553
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,640
in the future.

554
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,079
You can't read much,

555
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
and you don't know medicine.

556
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,000
How can you nurse His Majesty's health?

557
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,280
It's nothing

558
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,760
but a momentary novelty, that's all.

559
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,359
Once His Majesty is bored with it,

560
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
you'll go back to where you were.

561
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,119
I suggest you watch

562
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,239
how I rise in the ranks.

563
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,599
She's out of her mind.

564
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,079
Where's Zijin?

565
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Other than her,

566
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,160
no one can manage Yin Ziping.

567
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,959
Where's she?

568
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,560
Why are you standing there like a log?

569
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,439
Come out.

570
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,119
Your Highness.

571
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,719
What are you doing?

572
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,640
The entrance.

573
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,000
Li!

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,599
Old Madam!

575
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,040
You can't barge in here, Old Madam.

576
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,359
Old Madam.

577
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,839
Find her!

578
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,439
Old Madam,

579
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,760
watch the steps.

580
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,199
Careful.

581
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,239
You better search

582
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,959
every room for her!

583
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,680
All right.

584
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,359
You must find her!

585
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,280
Old Madam,

586
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,599
you can't come in here.

587
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,599
Li!

588
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,079
Old Madam,

589
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,119
careful!

590
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,040
Li!

591
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:36,959
Grandmother,

592
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,160
you're here?

593
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
Your Highness.

595
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Drop the formalities.

596
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,000
I know where

597
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,000
to find what you want.

598
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,439
Really?

599
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Didn't you hear her?

600
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,319
Grandmother wants to find Li.

601
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,119
Take it out.

602
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,359
Yes.

603
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,000
Grandmother,

604
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I heard you calling out

605
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160
to Li.

606
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,000
I think you're looking for this cat, right?

607
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,760
No.

608
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,359
Old Madam,

609
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,239
His Highness

610
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,520
named this cat

611
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Yantai.

612
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,359
Grandmother,

613
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,319
I still have some important affairs to deal with.

614
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,439
Why don't you go back and take a rest first?

615
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:22,680
But...

616
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,319
Guards.

617
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,199
Send Old Madam back.

618
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,880
Your Highness.

619
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,520
Careful.

620
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,000
Your Highness.

621
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,000
Your Highness,

622
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,000
I...

623
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,000
Come out.

624
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Chen Wu,

625
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,239
Grandmother just left.

626
00:31:59,239 --> 00:31:59,959
Call her back here.

627
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,880
Yes, Your Highness.

628
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,359
Your Highness!

629
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,920
Are you really going?

630
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?

631
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,959
Why do you fear my grandmother that much?

632
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:26,520
Li.

633
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,199
Li.

634
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,520
Li.

635
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,680
Madam Peng Chengbo followed me

636
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,319
everywhere I went all day.

637
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:46,000
I came into your study room

638
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,119
because I had no place to hide.

639
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,000
No matter what,

640
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,839
they won't search this place.

641
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,520
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

642
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,119
Why are you that afraid of her

643
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
when you dare to use me?

644
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,719
Do you still remember

645
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
when I had to leave the palace

646
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,719
to recuperate from my severe illness?

647
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,520
There was nothing
the imperial physician could do.

648
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,959
If Old Madam didn't give up

649
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,199
on hiring famous physicians for me,

650
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,479
I'm afraid I wouldn't be alive today.

651
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,119
When I was at my worst state,

652
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,000
only Old Madam didn't give up on me.

653
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,439
Old Madam's recommendation is

654
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,359
to strengthen the power of the Zhang family.

655
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,160
But I can't forget

656
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,719
her kindness to me.

657
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,959
Do you really want to be the matron?

658
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,479
The position of a matron may be

659
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,160
after the directress position.

660
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
But the gap is huge.

661
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,520
You're still young.

662
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,760
Yet, you wanted to be the head of all the offices.

663
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,680
That's tremendously ambitious of you.

664
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,719
Your Highness,

665
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,920
it's not the way of a gentleman

666
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,520
to ridicule others.

667
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,119
I wasn't ridiculing others.

668
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,520
I was only ridiculing you.

669
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,239
I never know Your Highness

670
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,640
to be this unkind.

671
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,400
I never know

672
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
you're this scheming either.

673
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,719
What do you mean, Your Highness?

674
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,520
You came here on your own

675
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,719
to make me sympathize with you,

676
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,959
so I'd take the initiative to cover it up for you.

677
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,120
You were hoping

678
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,639
that I'd plead with Mother

679
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,439
to let you live freely.

680
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm being forced

681
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
because of you.

682
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,919
You used me again and again.

683
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,199
You never went soft on me.

684
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,520
Yet,

685
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,919
I went soft on you time and time again.

686
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,159
I even took the initiative
to carry all that burden for you.

687
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,959
Is that fair?

688
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Have you ever thought

689
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,479
that I had no other choice?

690
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,360
Go, then.

691
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,760
Yes, Your Highness.

692
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,919
Your Highness.

693
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,000
Let's go.

694
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,439
Where to?

695
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,280
Kunning Palace.

696
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,919
Kunning Palace?

697
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,040
Your Highness,

698
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,919
didn't you say

699
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,000
you're not going to let her succeed this time?

700
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,919
I want to fulfill

701
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,919
every wish of hers

702
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,280
because I don't want

703
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
to see her sad anymore.

704
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Your Highness.

705
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,879
That hurts!

706
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:39,040
Let go!

707
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
This is important.

708
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,679
Since when do you have anything important to say?

709
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,040
This is

710
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,639
the meal list

711
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,040
I'm preparing for His Majesty tomorrow.

712
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,040
Please help me check

713
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
if there's anything wrong.

714
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,199
Steamed pork tripe?

715
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,439
Roasted goat's head and trotters?
Northern ground squirrels?

716
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,719
These are too greasy.

717
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,639
Don't repeat Yuehua's mistakes.

718
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,919
[Bazhen Pastry]
Are you making Bazhen pastry?

719
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,600
That's why I need your help.

720
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,760
His Majesty has been in poor health recently.

721
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,959
The Medicines Office

722
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:18,719
told me

723
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:19,879
that Bazhen pastry has the effect

724
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,280
of regulating His Majesty's
weak spleen and stomach,

725
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,360
improving brain function, and calming his mind.

726
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,719
It's perfect for His Majesty's consumption.

727
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,239
Ziping,

728
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,679
you don't know medicinal properties.

729
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,120
You should make use of your strengths
and avoid your weakness.

730
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,120
Why do you suddenly think

731
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,239
of preparing medicinal food?

732
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,120
Of course, it's for...

733
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,479
Wait a minute.

734
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,225
[Bazhen Pastry]

735
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,719
Your Majesty,

736
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,280
Noble Consort Guo has been
seeking your audience

737
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
for the third time today.

738
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm not seeing her!

739
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

740
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,959
Your Majesty!

741
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,719
Your Majesty, are you all right?

742
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Your Majesty!

743
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,879
Summon the imperial physician!

744
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:51,919
Your Majesty!

745
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,840
Please bring forth His Majesty's meal list.

746
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,479
Your Highness,

747
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,360
the imperial physician has examined.

748
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,520
There's nothing wrong with the meal.

749
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,719
Your Majesty,

750
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,000
I've examined

751
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,600
the meal just now.

752
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,159
Nothing is amiss.

753
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,320
His Majesty fainted out of a sudden today.

754
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,239
I'm afraid it's a relapse from his old disease.

755
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,040
This concerns His Majesty's health.

756
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,560
We must not be careless.

757
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,239
The meals may not be poisoned.

758
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,280
It doesn't mean they made no mistakes.

759
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,639
Food ingredients are the same
as traditional Chinese medicine.

760
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,159
If they collide with each other,

761
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
it'll cause harm and not benefit.

762
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,080
We still need to examine them carefully

763
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,560
before coming up with a conclusion.

764
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,719
What should we do now?

765
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,800
Who made

766
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,879
this Bazhen pastry?

767
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,159
Your Highness,

768
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,520
I made the Bazhen pastry.

769
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,600
What ingredients

770
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,159
did you use for Bazhen pastry?

771
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,919
The Bazhen pastry among the common folks

772
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,479
uses Chinese yam,

773
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,159
white lentils, lotus seeds,

774
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,120
China root, job's tears, prickly waterlily,

775
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,520
hawthorn, and malt.

776
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,479
Bazhen pastry in the Imperial Palace

777
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,600
is a prescription
by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

778
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,239
I replaced the last two flavors

779
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,479
with dangshen

780
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,560
and deer antler.

781
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,280
That's where it went wrong.

782
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,159
Mother,

783
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,120
I've just examined

784
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,879
Father's daily medicinal diet.

785
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,399
In the prescription,

786
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,280
there are Ganoderma, deer antler, and dangshen.

787
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,000
The dosage is already enough

788
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,040
for a patient.

789
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,560
The cooks from the Imperial Food Service

790
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,840
have little knowledge of pharmacology.

791
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,399
Yet, they have the nerve to change
the ingredients of medicinal food.

792
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,360
Father's spleen is weak.

793
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,080
If he consumes so much tonic,

794
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,159
won't it cause

795
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,320
more diseases?

796
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,120
Your Majesty,

797
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
His Majesty has been in poor health lately.

798
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,959
The Imperial Food Service
would naturally be meticulous.

799
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,560
We'd report to the Imperial Academy of Medicine
of the list of medicinal food first.

800
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,719
The Imperial Academy of Medicine
will prepare the prescription.

801
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,760
Then the Medicines Office will pick
the medicinal herbs.

802
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,159
The type of medicinal ingredients

803
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,199
and dosage were all recorded.

804
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,120
We'd never dare to make any mistakes.

805
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,479
The Imperial Academy of Medicine
and the Medicines Office

806
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,159
should be punished as well.

807
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,560
They knew Father was too weak
to consume such nourishing tonic.

808
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:37,479
Yet, they let the Imperial Food Service
prepare medicinal food.

809
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,399
Especially deer antlers,

810
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,040
if a weak person takes

811
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,080
too much,

812
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
he'll overflow with energy

813
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,040
and even cause

814
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,399
vomiting and fainting.

815
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,719
As I see it,

816
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,399
the person who made the Bazhen pastry

817
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
to please the Emperor.

818
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,239
She completely disregards Father's health.

819
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
She should be heavily punished.

820
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Do you know your mistakes?

821
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,280
Why aren't you pleading for forgiveness?

822
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,800
Your Majesty,

823
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,959
His Majesty loves meat and fish.

824
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,520
His spleen and stomach
aren't regulating normally.

825
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,959
The imperial physicians

826
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,280
often prescribe a large amount of tonic

827
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,919
for His Majesty.

828
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,280
For instance, deer antler, ginseng,

829
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,159
Ganoderma, and so on.

830
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,280
Like Your Highness has said.

831
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,120
Excessive tonics can also be harmful to health.

832
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,280
However,

833
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,399
the Imperial Academy of Medicine

834
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,080
determines all medicinal meals

835
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,840
in the palace and the dosage.

836
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Also, there are many

837
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,360
precious medicinal ingredients
in medicinal food.

838
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:34,040
Someone is assigned to supervise

839
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,399
to avoid theft.

840
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,840
So...

841
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,479
Does that mean you can push
the responsibility to others

842
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,520
because

843
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,840
the Imperial Food Service doesn't decide
on the dosage?

844
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,520
So

845
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,719
I especially roast the ginseng

846
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
(for more hours.)

847
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,639
(I pounded it into a charcoal-like texture)

848
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,159
(and added raw radish juice)

849
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,840
(into the water for the batter.)

850
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,919
Raw radish juice?

851
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,000
Yes.

852
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,719
Noble Consort Guo,

853
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,239
raw radish juice is a cooling ingredient.

854
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,719
It can relieve phlegm,

855
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
clear internal heat, remove toxins,

856
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
and descend effects.

857
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,000
It has neutralized

858
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,159
the excessive effects of the tonics.

859
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,239
Radish

860
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,479
helps with digestion
and improves one's appetite.

861
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,719
It's definitely beneficial

862
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,199
and not harmful to His Majesty's health.

863
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,800
So

864
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,600
His Majesty's relapsed

865
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,520
has nothing to do with Bazhen pastry.

866
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,239
It seems like

867
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:24,520
you knew

868
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
something was amiss with
the Imperial Academy of Medicine's prescription.

869
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,800
Yet, you kept quiet instead of reporting it.

870
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,120
Why did you hide this matter?

871
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,000
I can walk by myself.

872
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,159
How inconvenient to walk with you next to me.

873
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,280
It's hot.

874
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,320
You spoke frankly before me.

875
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,679
Since you have such courage,

876
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,320
why didn't you tell everyone

877
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,439
about this matter?

878
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,159
Your Majesty,

879
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,080
there are tonics added

880
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,000
to the Bazhen pastry.

881
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,679
It's indeed beneficial

882
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,040
to Your Majesty's health.

883
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,360
There's nothing wrong with this, to begin with.

884
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,760
It's just that Your Majesty believed

885
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:18,879
that a prescription is only effective

886
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,239
if it contains ginseng and deer antler.

887
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:21,800
The imperial physicians

888
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,199
wouldn't dare to disobey your wishes.

889
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,560
They're worried about the excessive dosage.

890
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
If I report this,

891
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,159
it'll cause misunderstanding.

892
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,239
If something goes wrong,

893
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,120
it'll implicate many imperial physicians

894
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,840
and the female physicians
of the Medicines Office.

895
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,639
I might just use dangshen and the deer antler

896
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,800
to nourish the vital energy

897
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,719
and use radish to regulate the energy flow.

898
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,600
The circulation of vital energy
won't be stagnant this way.

899
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:47,600
As a cook,

900
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,520
not only can you prepare such exquisite meals.

901
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,120
You're also understanding.

902
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:53,879
You work in such

903
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,000
an orderly way.

904
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,879
It's a waste of talent

905
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,800
for you to be a directress.

906
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,320
I think...

907
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,399
I think

908
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,959
we should just confer her
as the Crown Prince's Concubine.
