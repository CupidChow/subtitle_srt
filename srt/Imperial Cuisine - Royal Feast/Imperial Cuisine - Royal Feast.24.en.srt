00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,800
Your Highness,

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,040
the assassins

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,319
were well-trained fighters who pledged to die.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
There were two survivors.

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,839
One died from a serious wound in jail.

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,040
The other is alive.

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,519
The imperial bodyguards

10
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
are investigating this lead.

11
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,599
On the Lantern Festival day,

12
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,919
the palace entry-and-exit registration

13
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,800
recorded 643 performers from acrobatic
and song and dance troupes,

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,959
and artisans from the Ministry of Works,
Inner Court,

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,599
and directorates and services.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,199
Everyone was registered.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
It will take some time to check them.

18
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,679
What do you think?

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,960
Your Highness,

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,440
it is abundantly clear who was behind this.

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
If Your Majesty and Your Highness...

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
With all due respect,

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,039
I'd say that it has the hallmarks

24
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,160
of His Lordships the two princes.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Alright.

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
Don't disturb His Highness

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,759
with these things

28
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,559
when he needs rest.

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Your Highness, your lunch is here.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,919
Where is she?

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Outside.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,559
Your Highness, your hat.

33
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,279
Official Mei,

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
I am deeply disturbed

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,679
by what happened last time.

36
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,800
I've been trying to find an opportunity

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,919
to apologize to you.

38
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,039
Did you personally

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
prepare the meal for me?

40
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,199
I see.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
Blame me

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
for any problem with the meal.

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,160
That is enough.

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,039
His Highness has been suffering
from insomnia lately.

46
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't put too much ginseng in the soup.

47
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,399
Too much tonic can cause insomnia.

48
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,600
Manager Yao,

49
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,720
how do you know

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,080
His Highness wasn't sleeping well?

51
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,919
His Highness

52
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,440
didn't finish his lunch.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,759
He only finished the lily bulb and jujube soup

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,639
obviously to calm his nerves.

55
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Your Highness.

56
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:16,959
Your Highness.

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
Don't worry about imperial court affairs.

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,079
You should relax and nurse your wound.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,040
Your Highness,

60
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,040
I won't dare reveal

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,799
these things.

62
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,640
Official Mei,

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
you can bear witness for me.

64
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,839
The moment I stepped across the threshold,

65
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,399
I smelled blood.

66
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,079
Unlike your normal self,

67
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,760
Your Highness looks pale and sounds weak.

68
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,480
You shouldn't put on a brave face.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes.

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Looks like

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,679
I won't be visiting my mother today

72
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,760
less she finds out.

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
I feel good today.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,640
Let's play weiqi.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Your Highness,

76
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,000
do I have dirt on my face?

77
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
If you keep staring at me,

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
I would naturally misinterpret it.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm extraordinarily handsome

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,839
and graceful today.

82
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,239
Your Highness finally smiled.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
Normally, when I came here,

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,839
Your Highness would always greet me with a smile.

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,239
Today, after I crossed over the threshold,

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,399
you've never smiled.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,959
I thought

88
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,679
I must have offended you, Your Highness.

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,519
Shaoyuan,

90
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,119
are you married?

91
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Official Mei.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Let's go.

93
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,720
The imperial physician said

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
you shouldn't get up,

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,079
but you

96
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,000
won't listen.

97
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,679
Great.

98
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,399
Now the wound has reopened.

99
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,320
You

100
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
concealed your wound

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,279
so that Her Majesty won't worry.

102
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,679
Another person has become

103
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,959
the great hero who rescued His Majesty.

104
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
How can this be?

105
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
It's just a superficial wound.

106
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm not that delicate.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
Bring me my book.

108
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,760
Your Highness.

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Your Highness,

110
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,880
the Imperial Food Service
delivered your snacks.

111
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,920
I brought her in

112
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,040
as ordered.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,760
When did I give the order?

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
Bring her in.

115
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,359
Yes.

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

117
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,079
Your Highness hardly touched your lunch.

118
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,399
Matron Meng asked me

119
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,519
to deliver some snacks.

120
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,959
You're awake.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't get up.

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
I came to see how you are.

123
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:30,880
Forgive me, Your Highness.

124
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,840
Forget the courtesy.

125
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:34,960
You're injured.

126
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,840
No.

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
I should thank you.

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
It is my duty to protect His Majesty.

130
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,479
I don't deserve any thanks from Your Highness.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
You protected His Majesty for me

132
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,559
and fulfilled the responsibility of a son.

133
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,039
I should be thankful,

134
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,320
but...

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,840
I only did what I was ordered.

136
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Had I offended Your Highness,

137
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,200
please forgive me.

138
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,479
If you keep saying thank you,

139
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,840
this won't be a visit

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
but a trip that kills you.

141
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,799
Grandfather said

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,159
that you are proficient in military affairs

143
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,400
and are tactically flexible.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,599
You repeatedly performed outstanding service

145
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,520
in suppressing bandits and counter-insurgency.

146
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,880
I thought you were only
interested in military affairs,

147
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,559
but I see

148
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,919
a room full of classics, history,
ancient philosophies,

149
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,799
and travel notes.

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,599
I've just realized

151
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
that you have read extensively

152
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,200
and have lofty aspirations.

153
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,679
His Majesty felt that I'm not knowledgeable

154
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,840
and ordered me to study.

155
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,479
However, I'm a military guy

156
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,520
and not interested in poetry and songs.

157
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,400
I got the books to make me look good.

158
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,799
Please don't laugh.

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,679
Really?

160
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,280
Of course.

161
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,159
Officer You.

162
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,239
Your Highness.

163
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:49,640
Never mind.

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
We'll talk another day.

165
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
His Highness is leaving.

166
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,479
Why are you here, Eunuch Liu?

167
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,159
Officer You.

168
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,159
Accept this edict.

169
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,000
[Death-Exemption Plate]
(His Majesty bestows upon Officer You)

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
(the Death-Exemption Plate.)

171
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,880
Officer You, we serve this meal
at His Majesty's order.

172
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,159
His Majesty gave verbal instructions

173
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,880
that you are exempted
from the rules of etiquette

174
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,760
because you are seriously injured.

175
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,039
Leave it here. You may go.

176
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
Congratulations, Officer You.

177
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,039
It was a blessing in disguise.

178
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,440
His Majesty bestowed upon you

179
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
the Death-Exemption Plate,

180
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,039
and I also heard that the Crown Prince

181
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,159
came to visit you personally.

182
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,359
Hongwu Emperor bestowed
special privilege plates

183
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,239
on officers who performed meritorious
and honorable service,

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,719
but they all died of treason.

185
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Don't curse me.

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
The benevolence

187
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,559
of the son of heaven is widely known
all over the land.

188
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,679
Your blood will not be shed in vain, Officer You.

189
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,239
Really?

190
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,039
That was meant to be a joke.

191
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,919
Why are you angry?

192
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,719
From now on, follow this recipe

193
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,200
when you cook for His Majesty.

194
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,359
Did you forget your promise?

195
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,679
Relax.

196
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
This is not poison.

197
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,159
Leave.

198
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,039
What is it?

199
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,679
Don't move.

200
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,599
Don't do anything more than is needed.

201
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,679
When I was young and naive,

202
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,440
I always hoped that I'd meet someone

203
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
who would bandage my wounds.

204
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,400
Unfortunately, I didn't meet anyone like that.

205
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,599
Today,

206
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,239
I'll poke my nose into your business.

207
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,479
I'm luckier than you.

208
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,239
I met one.

209
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,679
Mister.

210
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,599
Mister, wake up.

211
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,799
A female criminal

212
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,840
was jailed there.

213
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,440
No one knew what her crime was,

214
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,119
why she was jailed there,

215
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,559
and for how long

216
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,239
she'd be jailed.

217
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,840
I was curious

218
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,039
about why an imprisoned person

219
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,799
would meddle in other people's business.

220
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
(So, I disguised as a beggar)

221
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,400
(to take a look)

222
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,359
(at her.)

223
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,799
Freshly steamed baozi!

224
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,200
Piping hot baozi!

225
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,440
Toys and nick-knacks!

226
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,320
Perfumed sachets and bags!

227
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Candied haws!

228
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,520
(When I found out)

229
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,039
(that there was such a fool in the world,)

230
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,640
(I thought)

231
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
(that no matter what her crime was,)

232
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,159
(I would set her free.)

233
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Did you see her eventually?

234
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,719
No.

235
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,359
Your food is cold.

236
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,719
Eat first.

237
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Official Mei.

238
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,359
This way, please.

239
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,040
Official Mei.

240
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,359
Your Highness, I thought you were joking

241
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,439
when you invited me over.

242
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,400
I didn't expect such meticulous preparations.

243
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,199
These are

244
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,439
my favorite dishes.

245
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
It would be disrespectful for me to decline.

246
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,119
Your Highness.

247
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,520
The Imperial Food Service was considerate.

248
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
Allow me to respond, Your Highness.

249
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,359
Your Highness ordered a feast
for Censor-in-Chief Mei.

250
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,880
The Imperial Food Service
dared not be negligent.

251
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Quoting Mr. Shuixin's poem,

252
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,640
before they ripen after the frost,

253
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,079
they are steamed to produce
the Dongting fragrance.

254
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,119
These must be Dongting Tangerine Balls.

255
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,359
Official Mei,

256
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,319
these are made with chopped lotus,

257
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,560
lime leaves,

258
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,520
rice flour, and honey.

259
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Finally, they were wrapped in tangerine leaves

260
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,800
and steamed.

261
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,150
[Dongting Tangerine Balls]

262
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,640
There is

263
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,319
a lingering fresh scent of tangerine.

264
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,520
When I was young,
I read a chapter about stone soup.

265
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,439
Out of curiosity,

266
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,079
I once

267
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,479
boiled stones from a clear spring.

268
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
I didn't feel the so-called vital energy

269
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,040
from the spring and stones,

270
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,800
but I wasted a lot of firewood.

271
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Official Mei can really tell jokes!

272
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,400
Isn't an artsy scholar

273
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
laughable?

274
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,000
Official Mei,

275
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,400
Song Dynasty's Su Yijian
got drunk on a snowy night.

276
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,359
He woke up thirsty in the middle of the night

277
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,839
and found a jar of pickled vegetables in the snow

278
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,040
and drank it.

279
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,680
He thought that was a rare delicacy in the world.

280
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,839
How can sour juice

281
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,400
taste better than rare delicacies?

282
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,520
As the saying goes,

283
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,119
we have different

284
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,599
food preferences.

285
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,400
This explains why ancient people
ate the splinters of jade

286
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
and drank dew drops.

287
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,599
It's stuffy in here.

288
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,760
Let's take a walk outside.

289
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:05,800
Yes.

290
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,719
Don't stand there.

291
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Take the dishes outside.

292
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,000
Manager Fang.

293
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,079
Take them outside.

294
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,800
Wait.

295
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,560
What is this dish?

296
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,479
This one.

297
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,479
This is a roasted squab.

298
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,439
This yellow croaker

299
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,000
tasted like crab meat.

300
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,439
You must explain to me.

301
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,040
Your Highness,

302
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,400
have a cup of hot tea

303
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,280
to warm your stomach.

304
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Official Mei,

305
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,959
His Highness is waiting.

306
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,040
Is

307
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,280
His Highness angry?

308
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,439
It is my fault.

309
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,359
I enjoyed talking to Manager Yao.

310
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,319
By the way,

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I heard that Manager Yao
is proficient in medicinal food.

312
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,719
I have something to ask you.

313
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,079
Official Mei, I don't deserve that.

314
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,439
I'm at your service.

315
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:07,760
I...

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,640
Your Highness.

317
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,040
His Highness has been unwell recently.

318
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,839
How can he sit in the draught?

319
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,000
Your Highness,

320
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
let's move inside.

321
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Manager Yao,

322
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,560
is there any food

323
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
for the heart?

324
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,079
I think His Highness is very sick.

325
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Official Mei,

326
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,920
does His Highness have a heart problem?

327
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,199
I suddenly remember
I have to attend to an urgent matter.

328
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,199
Help me to ask His Highness to excuse me.

329
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,000
I have to leave.

330
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,199
Official Mei.

331
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,359
You haven't viewed the painting.

332
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,079
I'll come back tomorrow.

333
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,119
What are you all doing?

334
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,599
Move the dishes inside.

335
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,239
Manager Fang.

336
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:15,325
[Guang'an Gate]

337
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,719
Stop.

338
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:23,199
Official Mei!

339
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,839
Please stop.

340
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,520
Slow down.

341
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,239
Stop running.

342
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,000
Catch her!

343
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,880
What do you want?

344
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,680
Give this to her.

345
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,000
I heard Manager Yao say
that you are in the palace.

346
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:53,640
So, I keep

347
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,839
this purse with me.

348
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,439
This was the salary that the restaurant owed you.

349
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,119
You were young.

350
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,439
I was afraid you'd spend it

351
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,520
and resort to stealing again.

352
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
I've been saving it for you.

353
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,359
Now that it has been given back to its owner,

354
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,839
I'll leave.

355
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,920
Your Highness, your meal is served.

356
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Play the guqin for me.

357
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,280
Your Highness,

358
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,359
my hand

359
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,680
can't play the guqin.

360
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,359
I'll play and you listen.

361
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
I won't dare.

362
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,520
Your Highness has not recovered.

363
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,760
It isn't good to overexert yourself.

364
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,040
Oh,

365
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,239
I forgot.

366
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,040
He is also good at playing the guqin.

367
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,839
When you want to listen to the guqin,

368
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,359
someone will play it for you.

369
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,560
Send her out.

370
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,959
Yes.

371
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,239
Chen...

372
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,040
Eunuch Chen,

373
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
what did His Highness mean?

374
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,239
Manager Yao,

375
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,359
you're innocent and I won't criticize you.

376
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,760
I would rather keep quiet.

377
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Please don't ask.

378
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,040
You know how His Highness

379
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,079
feel about you.

380
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
How could you break his heart?

381
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,599
Did I break his heart?

382
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,239
What did I do?

383
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,079
I have served His Highness since young.

384
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,160
His Highness was always

385
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,359
in high spirits.

386
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,239
I never saw him

387
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,359
so disheartened before.

388
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,400
You...

389
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
You went too far.

390
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,479
Me?

391
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,040
Forget it.

392
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,959
I shouldn't say that.

393
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,479
Please go back on your own.

394
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,280
His Highness ordered me

395
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,839
to personally send you back.

396
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,920
Please.

397
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,160
Eunuch Chen,

398
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,599
what did I do?

399
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,439
Please.

400
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:08,880
Imperial Physician Sheng,

401
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,880
I leave this matter in your hands.

402
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes.

403
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
What does this mean?

404
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,520
Around 1 to 3 PM every day,

405
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,199
Imperial Physician Sheng will treat you

406
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
until your hand heals.

407
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
I did what His Highness ordered.

408
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,040
I shall leave now.

409
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Well,

410
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,000
do you feel guilty?

411
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,000
Why should I?

412
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,560
♪This girl is rude♪

413
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,439
♪She contradicts me♪

414
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,800
♪I give my heart to the bright moon♪

415
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:32,520
♪But the bright moon shines on the ditch♪

416
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
You!

417
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,760
The lyrics

418
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,040
are inappropriate.

419
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,439
Look!

420
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,800
Give it to me.

421
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,359
I don't know about painting,

422
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
but this one was done in detail.

423
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,199
It's obvious that he is very affectionate.

424
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,000
Aren't you touched?

425
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,560
No, I'm not.

426
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,520
You have a heart of stone.

427
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,319
If it was me,

428
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,400
I would keep the ruby,

429
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,599
emerald,

430
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,760
Canutillos Emerald, and opal.

431
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,760
I won't

432
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,079
keep this nonsense painting.

433
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,640
What is this?

434
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,199
Yin Ziping.

435
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,319
It's a pouch

436
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,040
for men.

437
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,079
Whose is this?

438
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,800
Zijin, give it back to me!

439
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,000
Tell me.

440
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,119
Give it back to me.

441
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,520
Who is this man?

442
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
Give it back to me.

443
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,239
Tell me and I'll give it back to you.

444
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,800
Give it back to me first

445
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
and I'll tell you.

446
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,439
Give it back.

447
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,640
Whose is this?

448
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Give it back to me.

449
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,520
Zijin.

450
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,920
Give it back to me quickly.

451
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Alright, I'll give it back to you.

452
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:52,800
Whose is it?

453
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,040
Give it back to me first.

454
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,680
Alright, alright.

455
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,760
Here.

456
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,560
Gentler.

457
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,119
My hand!

458
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,479
Unfilial son!

459
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,839
His Highness has not recovered yet.

460
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,439
How can His Majesty

461
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,599
ask you to go to Nanjing now?

462
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,719
The imperial bodyguards have found

463
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,280
the intermediary who contacted the assassins.

464
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,640
When they arrived,

465
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,959
he had already committed suicide.

466
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,319
His identity

467
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,119
was special.

468
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Do you remember

469
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,199
that when I was eight,

470
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,560
my grandfather personally

471
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,319
recruited young bodyguards for the Fujun
Imperial Guard's Vanguard from civilians

472
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,199
to practice martial arts with me?

473
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
He was a young bodyguard.

474
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,319
It was a set-up.

475
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:52,920
How can His Majesty

476
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
believe such nonsense?

477
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,359
Whoever he is, he drove a wedge
between my father and me

478
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,319
and tried to transfer me out of Beijing.

479
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,959
He is evil.

480
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,479
Your Highness, your meal is here.

481
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,119
He is upright

482
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,199
and unyielding.

483
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,640
However, an unyielding man can be easily broken.

484
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,160
Getting involved in officialdom too early

485
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
is not necessarily good.

486
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,280
I will find a way

487
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
to transfer him out

488
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,680
and temper him for a few years.

489
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,079
When he is ready,

490
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,239
he will

491
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,959
become the pillar of the country.

492
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,520
He has the world and the country in his heart.

493
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
He is lenient to others

494
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,599
but strict with himself.

495
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,839
With his family, in particular,

496
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,640
he will be too strict.

497
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
You might not get used to it.

498
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,839
Oh, right.

499
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,599
I forgot.

500
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,319
You are so nice.

501
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,079
He won't criticize you.

502
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,479
Your Highness,

503
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
what do you mean?

504
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,479
Aren't you going to leave the palace?

505
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Your Highness, would you let me leave the palace?

506
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,760
However, Her Majesty...

507
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
I have my ways.

508
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,959
This doesn't concern other people.

509
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,959
Your Highness, are you serious?

510
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
Why?

511
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,479
I haven't seen you

512
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,640
laugh so happily for a long time.

513
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,359
At least he can make you laugh.

514
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,640
When you accompany him as his wife

515
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,760
and live harmoniously with him,

516
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
will you

517
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,199
still remember this study?

518
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
Will you remember me?

519
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,239
Who are you talking about,

520
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,119
Your Highness?

521
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,719
Leave

522
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,079
before I regret it.

523
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
Your Highness allows me to leave the palace
and get married.

524
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,439
No matter how good that person is,

525
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,760
he is not my sweetheart.

526
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,640
Who is your sweetheart?

527
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,800
Nobody.

528
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,719
Your Highness,

529
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,239
this Angelica Steamed Chicken

530
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
[Angelica Steamed Chicken]
(is chicken stewed in Angelica)

531
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,760
(and Radix Astragali Preparata.)

532
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,160
(It is the best food for people with qi)

533
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,000
(and blood deficiency after an illness.)

534
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,640
I know you didn't have an appetite lately.

535
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,719
You can eat some.

536
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,920
It will be good for your injury.

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,560
And you say you don't care about me?

538
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Your Highness misunderstood.

539
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,920
This is a prescription given
by Imperial Physician Sheng.

540
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,239
We

541
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,479
made the meal based on the prescription.

542
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,319
Your Highness.

543
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,199
Imperial Physician Sheng knows

544
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,680
that your wound has not healed.

545
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,160
It is best to take your medicine with your meal.

546
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
He ordered people to bring medicinal food today.

547
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,479
Sheng Yin is old

548
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,839
and forgetful.

549
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,160
He told you to prepare a meal

550
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,160
but told someone to send it again.

551
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Permit me to leave.

552
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,479
Li.

553
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,760
Leave us.

554
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
Yes, Your Highness.

555
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,919
If you don't want to say it,

556
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,239
I won't force you.

557
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,199
Anyway,

558
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,560
I can only bother you for a few days more.

559
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,959
I'm going to Nanjing soon.

560
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,000
Your Highness,

561
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
your injury hasn't healed.

562
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,479
You cannot exert yourself.

563
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,199
This is my father's order.

564
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,399
This is the fault of the Crown Prince.

565
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,800
My father is suspicious of me.

566
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,479
Why is it my fault?

567
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,959
Your Highness, if you wish
to reconcile with His Majesty,

568
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
you should break the barriers

569
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,239
and honestly reveal

570
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,439
your sincerity to His Majesty.

571
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,000
Do you think I didn't try?

572
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,520
Every time,

573
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,879
my father

574
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,439
would push me away.

575
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,239
Maybe

576
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,520
you used the wrong approach.

577
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,725
[Butter Oyster-Shaped Abalone]

578
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,399
Well done.

579
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,399
Manager Fang,

580
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,199
can I

581
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,520
deliver the meal with you today?

582
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,879
When did the Imperial Food Service
become so unruly?

583
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
How can a lowly table maid

584
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
enter the Qianqing Palace?

585
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,159
Step back.

586
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,280
Directress Su,

587
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,639
Matron Meng caught a cold today

588
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,399
and can't deliver food to Qianqing Palace.

589
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,840
I only wanted to help Manager Fang.

590
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,239
It's time to deliver.

591
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,325
[Chamomile Seedlings Porridge]

592
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,959
Your Majesty,

593
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,320
this dessert

594
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,879
originated in Lin'an City
in the Southern Song Dynasty.

595
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,879
It is made with cheese and cane sugar.

596
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,439
Back then, oysters were called abalone.

597
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
So, this oyster-shaped snack

598
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,239
is named after the abalone.

599
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,639
This porridge is good.

600
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,399
I used the chamomile seedlings

601
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,080
grown in the heated room to make the porridge.

602
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,560
It is refreshing and appetizing.

603
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
Of course, I know

604
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,239
this is the taste of my hometown.

605
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,919
Nanjing people call this
the Chrysanthemum indicum plant

606
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,959
and use it for soup.

607
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,199
You have made

608
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,560
a lot of progress recently.

609
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,439
I was reckless last time.

610
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,439
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

611
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,040
Father.

612
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Be careful, Your Highness!

613
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,679
That was an unintentional mistake.

614
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,919
I don't blame you.

615
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,919
You're forgiven.

616
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,199
I am eternally grateful to Your Majesty

617
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,399
for forgiving me.

618
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
I heard the imperial physicians

619
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,919
said that since the Lantern Festival Banquet,

620
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
Your Majesty has been in a shock

621
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,080
and felt dizzy all the time.

622
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,280
I remember that chamomile seedlings

623
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,600
can cure dizziness and headache

624
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,199
and took the courage to try it.

625
00:37:58,879 --> 00:37:59,840
Were you scared?

626
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,080
Yes.

627
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,159
I hid in a corner

628
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,080
and trembled.

629
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,199
Later, I saw

630
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,560
the noble consort beside me

631
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,840
and I felt relieved.

632
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,679
Quickly, save me.

633
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,439
Save His Majesty.

634
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,360
Protect His Majesty.

635
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:22,080
Your Majesty.

636
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:25,840
Your Majesty.

637
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Noble Consort Guo seeks your audience.

638
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,360
Rejected.

639
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,639
Yes.

640
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm going to the drill ground this afternoon.

641
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,719
Deliver my dinner there.

642
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:49,600
Yes.

643
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,719
Father.

644
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,120
Aren't you leaving for Nanjing?

645
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,320
Why haven't you set off?

646
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
I've prepared a meal.

647
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,040
Let's eat together.

648
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,679
No need.
