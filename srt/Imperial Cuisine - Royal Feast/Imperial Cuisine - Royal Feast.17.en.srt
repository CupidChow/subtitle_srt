00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,919
Mother, take your medicine.

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
-Go to the palace.
-Mother.

5
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Enter the palace now.

6
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,199
Mother.

7
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Take back what is rightfully yours.

8
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,880
Do you hear me?

9
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Go!

10
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,639
Go!

11
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,360
Go! Go!

12
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,800
If you fail, you'll disappoint me,

13
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
your mother,

14
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,080
and yourself. Do you understand?

15
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,320
If I die,

16
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,559
I will not die in peace.

19
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Why are you daydreaming?

20
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,639
Is this the plum flower mold you want?

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,479
The Crown Prince is too fussy.

22
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,119
The plum trees haven't blossomed.

23
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,239
The plum petals we collected are not fragrant.

24
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,119
Is he intentionally making things
difficult for you?

25
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160

[Plum Blossom Noodle Soup]

27
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,880
There is a faint plum fragrance.

28
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,000
The plum petals we picked

29
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,640
are no longer fragrant.

30
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Seasonal ingredients are better.

31
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,000
Just now, Hu Shanxiang came to the study

32
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
and you didn't come in.

33
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,160
Why?

34
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,119
Answer me.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,160
Hu didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,359
I can't depose of her.

38
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,000
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

39
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,959
I wish to become a female officer

40
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,959
and stay in the Imperial Food Service forever

41
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,359
so that

42
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,959
Your Highness won't feel the slightest guilt.

43
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,559
I will be assured of a living.

44
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,839
What did you say?

45
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,799
I want to become a female officer.

46
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I want to be a cook.

47
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,920
Have you ever had true feelings for me?

48
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,559
If I didn't enter the palace,

49
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,959
would Your Highness remember me?

50
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,040
True.

51
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,040
I admit

52
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,959
I don't recall what you looked like
when you were 10.

53
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,279
I even forgot about you.

54
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,679
From the beginning,

55
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,000
the Zhang family had forced on me the gift
of the Great Imperial Grandson's Consort.

56
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,239
The source of this misfortune

57
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,399
was the Zhang family's flattery

58
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,480
and my grandfather's
stubbornness and suspicion.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
You are being unfair to me.

60
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,399
When the Great Imperial Grandson
wanted a cricket duel,

61
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,119
officials dug three feet into the ground.

62
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,119
Innocent people lost their homes and lives.

63
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
When he became an adult and selected concubines,

64
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,880
many girls were locked in the cold palace

65
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,119
and stayed away from their families.

66
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,519
Everything was done

67
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,160
was for your pleasure.

68
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,640
Your hands were clean,

69
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,440
but your cricket containers

70
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,399
were stained with blood.

71
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,079
In your eyes,

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
whether I knew or not,

73
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,799
and even if no one asked my opinion,

74
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,239
I was still the culprit

75
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,559
because I was the Great Imperial Grandson.

76
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,359
Therefore,

77
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,079
you'd rather stay in the Imperial Food Service

78
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,320
and not by my side.

79
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,279
If you are a bit apologetic

80
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,399
and a bit sympathetic,

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,559
then forgive my transgression

82
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,399
for

83
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,640
refusing to be your concubine.

84
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,040
I don't want to live for you forever.

85
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,239
I don't want to be a puppet on the string.

86
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,200
Your Highness, please grant me my wish.

87
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,520
Get out.

88
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,520
Miss Yao.

89
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,719
From now on,

90
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,479
I don't want to see that woman anymore.

91
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,840
Mother.

92
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,400
You're here. Sit down.

93
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,640
Yes.

94
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,359
Yes, these are what I want.

95
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,599
Throw them away.

96
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,280
Mother,

97
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,799
aren't these the old clothes

98
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,960
you sewed for my father?

99
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,359
You sewed them thread by thread

100
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,159
and stayed up many nights

101
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,280
until your eyes were red.

102
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,359
Don't throw them away.

103
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,919
He is the Emperor now.

104
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
He doesn't need these.

105
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,039
My grandfather wore the clothes

106
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,000
made by my grandmother next to his skin.

107
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,359
He never threw them away.

108
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
These clothes are new

109
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,119
and still wearable.

110
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,679
If my father dislikes the clothes,

111
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,359
make them for me.

112
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,719
I will wear them every day.

113
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,000
If you like,

114
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,239
you can ask the Crown Princess to sew for you.

115
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
She is not good at sewing.

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,719
You haven't even received

117
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:11,919
a handkerchief,

118
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,039
let alone clothes and sachets.

119
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,880
It's your fault.

120
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,000
In all fairness,

121
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,719
Hu doesn't excel in writing,

122
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:26,919
dislikes sewing,

123
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,239
can't discuss poetry with you,

124
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,919
and doesn't share your interests.

125
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,359
However, she has a good heart.

126
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,559
She is considerate.

127
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,960
She was wrong in the past,

128
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,280
but you shouldn't condone her either.

129
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,400
Had you explained things clearly,

130
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,440
you wouldn't be estranged from her now.

131
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,799
Mother,

132
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,960
why is it always my fault?

133
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,960
For the common folks, a mother-in-law

134
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,960
will always side with the daughter-in-law

135
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,359
when a young couple quarrels.

136
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,440
This way, the husband and wife
will live harmoniously

137
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
and the family will flourish.

138
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,559
What's more, she is in the palace.

139
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,719
If I don't side with her,

140
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,280
who will she talk to

141
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,280
when she has grievances?

142
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,479
Zhanji,

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,919
she knew she was wrong.

144
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,799
So give her another chance.

145
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't be like your father and me.

146
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,559
Come.

147
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,599
Help me write a word.

148
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,159
Yes.

149
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
Gently.

150
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,039
Come and see.

151
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,520
What is it?

152
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,520
What does it mean?

153
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,919
Ancient.

154
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,760
[Ancient]
What does this mean?

155
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,599
What does it mean?

156
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,359
I do not know.

157
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,679
How do we handle this topic?

158
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,039
This topic is so strange.

159
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:14,919
I know, right?

160
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,119
What does it mean?

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,520
Her Majesty used
Yan Zhenqing's calligraphy style.

162
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,440
Matron Meng.

163
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,840
Matron Meng.

164
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,119
The topic for the first round is the ancient food.

165
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
Su Yuehua is proficient in this.

166
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,919
I'm afraid...

167
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,960
What?

168
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
Are you afraid of her?

169
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,520
Matron,

170
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,880
I prefer simple and uncomplicated meals

171
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,320
and I can defeat Wen Yantao,

172
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,280
but Su Yuehua came from a family of famous cooks.

173
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,880
She learned famous dishes
of past dynasties from Directress Wang.

174
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,479
If I compete with her,

175
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,119
I might lose.

176
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,479
So,

177
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,239
you all don't have the will to win.

178
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,320
Matron Meng,

179
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
please let me try.

180
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,479
You?

181
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,599
Yin Ziping,

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,200
you're just a female scribe.

183
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
How can you compete with Manager Su?

184
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,679
Step aside.

185
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,880
I will win the first round for you.

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,799
Her Majesty set the topic for the first round.

187
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
If you lose the first round...

188
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,520
Matron Hu asked Su Yuehua to start

189
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,520
because she is certain that we can't compete.

190
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,440
You are not confident of winning.

191
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,280
Do you want Matron Meng to stoop so low

192
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,119
as to compete with a manager?

193
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,440
If she wins,

194
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,159
it's because she has an unfair advantage.

195
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,080
Matron Meng.

196
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,559
Manager Fang.

197
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,320
Recently,

198
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,200
Ziping has practiced hard day and night.

199
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:07,919
Look.

200
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,320
This peony flower carved from water tofu

201
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,559
is better than ordinary carvers' work.

202
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,559
Please give Ziping a chance.

203
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,679
Please trust me.

204
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,880
Alright.

205
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,000
It's decided.

206
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes.

207
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,200
Thank you.

208
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,159
I reminded you many times

209
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,880
that you should always be amicable.

210
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,880
Don't make enemies.

211
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,760
Otherwise, even if you pleased Matron Meng,

212
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,479
others would sabotage you
during the competition.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,919
What would you do by then?

214
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,200
A person with a humble origin like me

215
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,479
can crawl on the ground

216
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,359
but only be blamed for dirtying the place.

217
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Why should I please them?

218
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,679
It's not easy for you to beat

219
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,559
Su Yuehua.

220
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,479
I have you.

221
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,000
Your Highness.

222
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Your Highness.

223
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,200
I overheard my big sister
talking about jasmine soup

224
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,640
and tried it today.

225
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,599
Unfortunately, it is

226
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,760
not as fragrant as in the summer.

227
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,199
Your Highness, I hope you like it.

228
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,119
Your Highness,

229
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,199
you have medical books here.

230
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,719
If there's nothing else,

231
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,680
go back first.

232
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:51,839
Yes.

233
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Your Highness, you can't...

234
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,319
Yuan Qi.

235
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,479
Your Highness.

236
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,359
Pack my things.

237
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,439
We're moving back.

238
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,239
Yes.

239
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:08,479
Your Highness.

240
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,760
Why did he draw...

241
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,359
It's nice.

242
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,479
It's early.

243
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,199
If we climb higher and look far,

244
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,079
we'll see the shadows of distant mountains

245
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:51,400
and lakeside's night view.

246
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,199
Cloudy mist floats past the curtains

247
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,920
and cool breezes come from all directions.

248
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,719
What a pleasure!

249
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,160
Let's go.

250
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,239
I'm not going back to the palace.

251
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,239
Let's go now.

252
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,760
Your Highness, it's getting late.

253
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,680
I don't understand poetry

254
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,839
or drawing.

255
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,920
I will only spoil your mood.

256
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,680
If you're in the mood,

257
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,760
you can invite your officials
to go along tomorrow.

258
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wouldn't that be better?

259
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:18,680
Forget it.

260
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,400
I'll go by myself.

261
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,079
You go back to the palace.

262
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,119
Your Highness.

263
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,719
He has the same temper.

264
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,319
Didn't you say you can fall asleep while sitting?

265
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,359
Go to bed.

266
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,280
It should be finished before dawn.

267
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,079
I asked you to go to bed.

268
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,479
It's late.

269
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,920
Even if Officer You is on duty,

270
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,119
you shouldn't be walking around.

271
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,079
Have you thought about

272
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,920
my suggestion?

273
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,000
I reject it.

274
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,479
Someone took your position.

275
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,680
Don't you resent that?

276
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,680
No.

277
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,199
Hu threatened your life. Don't you hate her?

278
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,160
No.

279
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,239
Can you avoid being killed
by hiding in the kitchen?

280
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,760
Aren't you ignorant?

281
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,680
This is my business.

282
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,800
Don't worry, sir.

283
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,319
I don't believe you.

284
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,280
What don't you believe?

285
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't believe you can stay calm

286
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,199
after losing everything

287
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,520
and don't resent or hate when you're desperate.

288
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,319
Why are you so calm?

289
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,400
(If I die,)

290
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,479
(I will not die in peace.)

291
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,479
Between you and Hu, only one will live.

292
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,439
Is that why you gave up?

293
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,079
Sir, why do you hate Zhu Zhanji so much?

294
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
I interrogate suspects in the land.

295
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,079
Even the most notorious thieves

296
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,880
and cunning public enemies

297
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,199
will eventually succumb.

298
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,160
You're the first woman to interrogate me.

299
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,400
I monitored the Eastern Palace on order

300
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,520
and not because of personal grudges.

301
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,439
I don't know about your enmity
with the Crown Prince.

302
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,280
As the saying goes,

303
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,160
nothing can separate relations

304
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,239
and don't mess with people's relations.

305
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,599
As an officer,

306
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,199
how can you spy on the Eastern Palace

307
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,000
and drive a wedge between the father and son?

308
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,239
I hope you will think twice.

309
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
You still side with him.

310
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,839
Some people are lucky.

311
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,479
He is the heir appointed by the Late Emperor.

312
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,599
He is the most favored.

313
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,199
Even the abandoned wife

314
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,800
is generous and kind.

315
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
How rare.

316
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,239
Rare.

317
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,319
Fine.

318
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You'll be the Bodhisattva

319
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,599
and I'll be the Rakshasa.

320
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,359
We will go our separate ways.

321
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:27,839
Did you just wake up?

322
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,479
Look.

323
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,599
You are amazing, Zijin.

324
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,199
What is it?

325
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,760
What are you looking at?

326
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,400
Nothing.

327
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,680
Is it nice?

328
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,439
You don't understand anyway.

329
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,920
Really.

330
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:41,225
[Foods Office]

331
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,599
What are you doing?

332
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,199
You startled me.

333
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,079
I put the painting here

334
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,640
and locked it on purpose.

335
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,239
It's gone now.

336
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:05,959
I'll look for it.

337
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:06,640
Get down.

338
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,040
-Get down.
-Get out of the way.

339
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,880
Where could it be?

340
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,959
Where did you put it?

341
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,800
I put it there.

342
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,640
Did you search properly?

343
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,359
I can't open your cabinet.

344
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,479
What?

345
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,199
Look! You've made a mess.

346
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,560
It doesn't matter. Come and search.

347
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
I said it isn't there.

348
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,760
You didn't search properly.

349
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,040
It's not here either.

350
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,079
This is Wangchuan Villa.

351
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,640
The Song Dynasty's "Records of Pure Marvels" said

352
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
Bhikkhuni Fan Zheng from the Tang Dynasty

353
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,319
had exquisite cooking skills.

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,520
She used pickles, broth, preserved items,

355
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,239
sauce, melons, and vegetables

356
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,520
to create a scene from yellow and red colors.

357
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,040
Today,

358
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
I will imitate Fan Zheng

359
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,199
and make fancy cold dishes

360
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
to reproduce the Wangchuan Villa.

361
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,680
Are you sure?

362
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,199
I haven't chosen the materials for some scenes,

363
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,640
but I've already decided.

364
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,119
Alright.

365
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,439
From today onwards,

366
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,640
you'll obey whatever Manager Su assigned you.

367
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,599
Yes.

368
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,079
What are you doing?

369
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,800
Don't be impetuous.

370
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,439
Su Yuehua.

371
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,479
There is no Wangchuan Villa copy in the Palace.

372
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,040
Where did you get this?

373
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,760
As far as I know,

374
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,319
you are good at cooking

375
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,680
but can't paint.

376
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,079
Of course, I can't.

377
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,479
This is

378
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,439
an imitation by a painter in the Inner Court.

379
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,079
I borrowed it for reference.

380
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,920
Can't I?

381
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,319
Manager Su,

382
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,959
do you intend to

383
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,760
reproduce the Wangchuan scenes
with fancy cold dishes?

384
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,079
In the Imperial Food Service,

385
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,520
who else has this capability except for Yuehua?

386
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,959
You?

387
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,800
This was painted by Zijin.

388
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,479
I didn't expect the aloof Manager Su

389
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:15,119
to do such a shameless thing.

390
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,839
What an eye-opener!

391
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,719
Yin Ziping!

392
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,000
You make accusations without evidence.

393
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Watch your tongue.

394
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,079
Manager Su,

395
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,119
a replica of the villa

396
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,199
should have its appearance

397
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,319
and aesthetic conception also.
Using fancy cold dishes

398
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,839
to do that is not easy.

399
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,280
I Look forward to seeing the finished product.

400
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:44,959
Ziping.

401
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,280
Ziping!

402
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,199
Let's go.

403
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,640
I don't care how you win.

404
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,599
I only care about the final result.

405
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,599
Yes.

406
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,839
You reproduced the painting from memory.

407
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,479
Why don't you let me expose her?

408
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
We've lost the painting.

409
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,839
If you make a big fuss

410
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,719
without any evidence,

411
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Matron Hu will countercharge your accusation

412
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,880
and disqualify you.

413
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,719
Disqualifying me

414
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:32,880
won't do her any good.

415
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,239
I thought I was bad,

416
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,239
but

417
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,199
benevolent, righteous, and moral people

418
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,920
can be more despicable than me.

419
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,920
-Yin Ziping.
-Why are you laughing?

420
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,479
Remember.

421
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,760
When people make you angry,

422
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,199
don't get angry.

423
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,199
When you're mad,

424
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,599
you'll fall into their trap.

425
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,119
I'm not angry.

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,599
I'm not angry at all.

427
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,439
I'm just very angry.

428
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:08,959
Ziping.

429
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,199
Lower your head when you're ridiculed

430
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,000
and tolerate grievances,

431
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,280
and no one can fight you.

432
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,040
Why must you show joy and anger on your face?

433
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,680
Su Yuehua claims to know
the famous dishes of all dynasties.

434
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,000
We must win the first round

435
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,640
for restoring ancient food.

436
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,880
Are you that confident?

437
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,599
If I want to win,

438
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,000
I will win.

439
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:40,959
Don't get angry anymore.

440
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,040
I didn't expect

441
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,839
you to do that.

442
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
A person who owns a precious item

443
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
will feel timid.

444
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,160
However,

445
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,000
I have nothing.

446
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,400
Why did you do that?

447
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,800
There is one thing

448
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,920
that I must do even if it is immoral

449
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,719
and conscienceless.

450
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,479
You have outstanding cooking skills.

451
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,680
You will win.

452
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,319
Rise, please.

453
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,680
This is not bad.

454
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,479
Rise. Have fun.

455
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,239
Your Majesty.

456
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,439
You're here.

457
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,920
I reckon you are in good health.

458
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Everything is fine.

459
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,640
How about you?

460
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,479
Fine. Fine.

461
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,479
This is a sachet for Her Majesty.

462
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,119
Did you embroider it?

463
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,760
Nice.

464
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,680
Lovely.

465
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:20,966
Sit down. You too.

466
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,319
Crown Princess, what are you reading?

467
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,680
What is this?

468
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,719
Your Majesty,

469
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,800
the Song Dynasty's "Notes on Qianchun's New Year"

470
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
mentions spring orchid
and autumn chrysanthemum.

471
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,439
There are no orchids or chrysanthemums.

472
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,119
How did the title come about?

473
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,000
The white pomegranate and pear

474
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,800
are an allegory of orchids.

475
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,560
The orange flesh means autumn chrysanthemum.

476
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,000
Unfortunately,

477
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,479
the Spring Orchid and Autumn Chrysanthemum
was soaked too long in the green plum brine.

478
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,520
Manager Fang,

479
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,560
Her Majesty said

480
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,400
the Spring Orchid and Autumn Chrysanthemum
was soaked too long in green plum brine.

481
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,520
It is sour.

482
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,400
What about the fragrant cherries?

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,680
She likes it very much.

484
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,400
You can't even make the appetizers.

485
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,160
You better admit defeat.

486
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,319
Manager Fang,

487
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,280
what should we do?

488
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,040
It wasn't the first time I had made a meal.

489
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,160
How can I even get the timing wrong?

490
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,400
I tasted it before serving.

491
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,400
Her Majesty

492
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,239
is helping them.

493
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:45,839
Xuelu.

494
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,679
Look at what she sculpted.

495
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,679
Look. Her cutting technique is good.

496
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,399
Really.

497
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,199
It looks real.

498
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,159
She can't paint,

499
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,239
but she knows how to set things by instinct.

500
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,439
We can't underestimate her.

501
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,360
What did you say?

502
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,600
They changed the ingredient for the stones.

503
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Is it cucumber or winter gourd?

504
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,360
If it were me,

505
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,479
I'd use winter gourd.

506
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,120
I mean,

507
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,800
Wangchuan Villa

508
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,600
depicts mountains and rivers.

509
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,320
It isn't easy to restore
its aesthetic conception.

510
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,919
Su Yuehua

511
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,719
is indeed talented in cooking.

512
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,560
Yao Zijin and Yin Ziping.

513
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,959
Why haven't you started?

514
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,120
Manager Fang,

515
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,239
help me knead the dough.

516
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,520
Knead the dough?

517
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,040
What are you two up to

518
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,800
Previously, I saw the Dragon and Phoenix
Bringing Auspiciousness and Magpie on the Branch.

519
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,080
Nice and auspicious.

520
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,919
What is this?

521
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,800
What a mess.

522
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,800
I've never seen

523
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,320
such strange carved cold dishes.

524
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,520
Zijin,

525
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,919
these are all the items you ordered.

526
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,320
What are they doing?

527
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,000
With that Wangchuan Villa,

528
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,439
whatever they do is in vain.

529
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,560
Why are you so calm?

530
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,439
How can we win with wontons?

531
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,959
No, Zijin.

532
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,479
Your wontons have different shapes.

533
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,560
This won't do.

534
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,360
Zijin.

535
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,560
We're done for. We're finished!

536
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,959
This is the Scene of the Deer Park Village
from Wangchuan Villa.

537
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,800
Wang Mojie lived in seclusion
in Wangchuan in his old age.

538
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,199
He often toured the wilderness
with a few friends

539
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,600
and composed poetry for fun.

540
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,360
He drew the Wangchuan Villa for remembrance.

541
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:24,959
Look.

542
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,600
This is Huazi Hillock.

543
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,080
Qi Lake.

544
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,120
This is Wenxing Hall.

545
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,360
That's the Magnolia Wall.

546
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,199
That's right.

547
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,679
It's the Wangchuan Villa.

548
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,320
Your Highness has discerning eyes.

549
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,679
I have clumsy eyes

550
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
and won't know it is Wang Mojie's masterpiece.

551
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,080
[Crown Prince's Lady of Talents He]

552
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,479
[Crown Prince's Lady of Talents Zhao]
I have never seen such wonderful scenes.

553
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,120
The Huazi Hillock.

554
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,679
[Crown Prince's Lady of Talents Jiao]

555
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,479
Zhuyiyi.

556
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,679
Qi Lake.

557
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,280
[Crown Prince's Lady of Talents Cao]

558
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,679
Just hearing these names

559
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:51,320
makes me infinitely fascinated.

560
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:53,959
I couldn't identify them.

561
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,000
There's no need to flatter.

562
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,080
She used the most common fruits and vegetables

563
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,080
to carve green mountains and waters
as well as boats.

564
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,760
Each cold dish

565
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,000
is the result of the cook's hard work
and ingenuity.

566
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,760
It's really rare.

567
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,399
Noble Consort Guo,

568
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
what do you think?

569
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,439
Ingenious.

570
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,000
Since the Noble Consort said so,

571
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,959
shouldn't we stop the first-round competition?

572
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,679
Unfortunately,

573
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,120
some of the ingredients are not properly used.

574
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,639
The scenes look like the painting,

575
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,879
but

576
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,080
the character's mood

577
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,479
is inappropriate.

578
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,399
This is exquisite carving.

579
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,080
The trees have different shapes.

580
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
All are different.

581
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,399
Look here.

582
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,600
This willow thread is as thin as the spring rain.

583
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,399
I can't tell

584
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,919
which ingredient was used.

585
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,239
Crown Princess,

586
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,280
hot pot is better for this season.

587
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,840
When the cold wind blows,
cold dishes make you feel even colder.

588
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:32,879
I am not kidding.

589
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Would you like to try it?

590
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,760
Matron Meng.

591
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, it's ready.

592
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,399
Take it away.

593
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,520
Bottle gourd and mutton stuffing.

594
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,560
Your Majesty is right.

595
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,639
The Duke of Zhou identified the 24 solar terms

596
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,679
and took advantage of the correct time.

597
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,879
Today, we especially used 24 flower shapes

598
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,000
together with vegetables unique
to the 24 solar terms

599
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,520
to make 24-solar-term wonton.

600
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,199
So,

601
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:47,439
you have the complete set of vegetables
for the 24 solar terms.

602
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,560
Your Highness,

603
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,639
the Chinese toon, water shield, water spinach,

604
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,919
artemisia selengensis, and other vegetables

605
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,120
are cultivated in heated rooms and brick beds.

606
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,000
The wonton is stuffed with
shrimp and Shepherd's Purse,

607
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
and water spinach and fish.

608
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,600
There is clam and lettuce,

609
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,120
and one with a butterfly shape.

610
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,959
This tastes slightly sweet like lotus root.

611
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,600
Vegetables that are offered
are cultivated in heated rooms.

612
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,399
They do not conform to the solar terms

613
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,919
and aren't first-class fresh.

614
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,520
How can they compete with
the Wangchuan Villa replica?

615
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,639
Not only the vegetables in the 24 solar terms,

616
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,919
but the meat filling in each wonton

617
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,959
is a mystery also.

618
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,399
The fillings taste different from usual.

619
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,280
Your Highness,

620
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,840
some of the vegetables are out of season.

621
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,600
We have to work extra hard

622
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,840
on the fillings.

623
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,199
For example, for the pea sprouts
and chicken wonton,

624
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,159
we used fresh sprouts
and added duck oil for seasoning.

625
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,560
For the toon and ham wonton,

626
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:50,879
we used premium quality meat

627
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,840
that is pre-cured with a secret recipe.

628
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,000
Won't such a complicated and trivial method

629
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,520
contradict the original intention
of simple cooking?

630
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,719
Your Highness,

631
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,639
originally, humans ate because of hunger.

632
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,399
Later, they chose the finest food

633
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,040
with meat chopped finely.

634
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,000
Because the weather is fine, the country
prosperous, and the people safe,

635
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,800
the people can enjoy the gifts of nature

636
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,360
and the best in the world.

637
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:17,040
For the pursuit of culinary art,

638
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:19,280
farming, animal husbandry, fishing, hunting,

639
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,399
cooking utensils, food utensils,
and medicinal food were developed.

640
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,280
We even refined literature and art.

641
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:26,719
The reproduction of the Wangchuan Villa
is the best example.

642
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:29,399
Today's ingredients

643
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,399
are all common kitchen items.

644
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,479
They don't cost much,

645
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,479
but they need time and effort to prepare.

646
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,040
How eloquent!

647
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,080
Although ordinary items are used,

648
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:45,520
the stuffings are carefully prepared.

649
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,120
Everything is tasty

650
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:48,520
in different ways.

651
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,399
They're amazing.

652
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,520
Matron Meng,

653
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,080
you trained them well.
