[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,319
Father missed you

4
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,760
when you were gone.

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,279
After all, you're his own daughter.

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,680
Can't you

7
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,160
get over everything?

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Before my mother died,

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
he told me

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,559
that had I not been selected,

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,080
my tutor wouldn't have to die

12
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,879
and my mother wouldn't die with hatred.

13
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,559
He said that everything happened

14
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,720
because of me.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
I wanted to see my mother one last time,

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,199
but he

17
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,639
escorted me to Peng Chengbo's residence

18
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,679
and imprisoned me for half a year,

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,639
during which I only heard
the wind and rain on cold nights

20
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,960
but not

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,639
the caring voices of loved ones.

22
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,360
During that time,

23
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,559
where was my father?

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,399
My elder brother,

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
where were you?

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Her Majesty was compassionate

27
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,399
and let me see you in the palace.

28
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,639
Such grace

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
is rare.

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,720
My younger sister,

31
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,440
you can blame us

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,360
or hate us,

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,600
but you can't just watch

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,479
the entire Sun family suffer!

35
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,679
I

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,639
beg you.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,199
Please.

38
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,199
Leave!

39
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,720
I don't want to see you again.

40
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,320
Even if all of us

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
treated you wrong,

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,039
what about our late mother?

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,919
She cared for you since small.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Did you fulfill her last wish?

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,960
You didn't.

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,399
Her soul in heaven

47
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,279
will watch

48
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,320
her husband

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,360
and son die because of you.

50
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,800
Will she be disappointed?

51
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,679
You weren't intimidated by Her Majesty.

52
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:02,520
You're only worried

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,919
about your status and wealth.

54
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,679
Don't worry.

55
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,080
If

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,479
I'm beheaded,

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,960
you all won't be implicated.

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,160
Are you a man?

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,760
Ziping!

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
-If you want a future,
-Zijin!

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,399
find it yourself.

62
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,880
Hey!

63
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,359
Ziping.

64
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:20,600
Zijin.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't expect nepotism!

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
Ziping!

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
-Cowardly scoundrel!
-Stop beating me.

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,399
Zijin.

69
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,480
Get out of here!

70
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,239
Scram!

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,519
Scram!

72
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,959
Zijin.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Matron Meng,

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,440
originally you chose Zijin

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
to take part in the Lantern Festival banquet.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
Now her hand is badly injured.

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
It won't heal so fast.

78
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,440
Are you...

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,559
Matron.

80
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,160
Aren't you sick?

81
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,200
Matron,

82
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,119
please let me take part in the banquet.

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
As a cook,

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,279
you have to carve and toss.

85
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,600
Your hand is badly injured.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,600
The competition

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
might make it worse.

88
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,880
Can you handle it?

89
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,799
Matron Meng chose me as an assistant.

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,239
If I only care about my hand,

91
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm unworthy

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
of your kindness, Matron.

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,399
My mind is set.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,119
Please let me do it, Matron.

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,200
Alright.

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,959
I agree.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Matron Hu,

98
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
everyone ridiculed you

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
for being too confident

100
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:08,959
and openly provoked others.

101
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,760
My guess is that

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,399
for years,

103
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,079
you have hidden your true strength

104
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,399
and will reveal it

105
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,279
during the competition.

106
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
This is a competition

107
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,399
that you've

108
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,000
waited for 10 years.

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,600
You waited with forbearance for half a lifetime

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
to fight for the coveted glory.

111
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,720
However, this time,

112
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,799
heaven will be on my side.

113
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,079
With this hand of you,

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,160
which might

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,399
never lift a knife again?

116
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,720
Yes.

117
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,399
With this right hand

118
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,279
that might become disabled.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
I want to watch you being defeated,

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,480
losing the power you desired most,

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,679
and leaving the Forbidden City
in abject failure.

122
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,559
As expected of the person I trained.

123
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,079
Fine.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,079
I'll like to see you

125
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,679
fulfill your promise.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,679
You are so annoying! So annoying!

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,480
Stop following me around!

128
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,200
Did Your Highness have a nightmare?

129
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,959
I remembered many things from my past

130
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,920
that I've forgotten.

131
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,919
What is it?

132
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,880
Out with it!

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,599
Your Highness,

134
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,760
the Lantern Festival's

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
Aoshan Long-Live Lantern Show

136
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,039
is being prepared.

137
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,039
His Majesty and the impress, consorts,
concubines, and ministers

138
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,000
will view Aoshan Mountain.

139
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,320
Increase the manpower

140
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,239
and tighten checks.

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,559
Sir,

143
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,880
everything is ready.

144
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,880
You can give up if it hurts so much.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Matron Meng.

146
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,080
Why do you insist on taking part?

147
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,239
I can get another assistant.

148
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Matron,

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
I asked Manager of Medicines Ji

150
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,719
about when I'll recover

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,679
if I rest.

152
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
She said

153
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,119
that fate would decide.

154
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,239
If...

155
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,359
This

156
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,000
might be my last chance.

157
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,880
After injuring your hand,

158
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,919
you've forgotten the most basic skill.

159
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,119
To mash chicken meat,

160
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,239
you shouldn't chop too hard.

161
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,039
Otherwise, the tendons will break.

162
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,239
Do it again.

163
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes.

164
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,159
Since you asked for it,

165
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,400
I will set strict demands on you.

166
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,599
You must persevere

167
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,039
even if that means your hand

168
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,359
will become disabled.

169
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes.

170
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,599
Wonderful!

171
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,320
Beautiful!

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
One more!

173
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,880
One more!

174
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,000
Amazing!

175
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,239
Beautiful fireworks!

176
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,479
Wonderful!

177
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,119
Awesome!

178
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,239
Your Majesty.

179
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:06,880
Awesome!

180
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
One more!

181
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,239
Awesome! Do it Again!

182
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,000
Great!

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
Do it again! Again!

184
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
One more!

185
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,479
Go.

186
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,359
One more.

187
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,239
Great! Exciting!

188
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,400
It's wonderful!

189
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,599
The lanterns will be lighted soon.

190
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,239
The Crown Prince still hasn't arrived.

191
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,239
Great!

192
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,760
Awesome!

193
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,239
Ziping,

194
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,080
why did you bring me here?

195
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,239
I'll be late.

196
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,119
I only have two hours

197
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:02,960
before the banquet.

198
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Don't panic.

199
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,679
Today is the Lantern Festival.

200
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,239
You must see the Aoshan Lanterns.

201
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,200
Look!

202
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,400
Wonderful!

203
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,000
Wonderful!

204
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:41,880
Look!

205
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,000
-Look.
-Such great skills!

206
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,280
That's so beautiful!

207
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Exciting!

208
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,440
Wonderful!

209
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,719
Nice!

211
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,280
-Look quickly.
-Look!

212
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,159
You...

213
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,640
Zijin, where are you going?

214
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,640
Greetings, Father and Mother.

215
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Big Brother, you are awesome!

216
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,599
Your Majesty, look.

217
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,280
The Crown Prince performed

218
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,559
for you.

219
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,960
Please smile.

220
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,919
It was unnecessary.

221
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,200
The Crown Prince of a country

222
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,919
shouldn't be reckless.

223
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,239
That was improper.

224
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,039
I only wanted

225
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,960
my mother to be happy.

226
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,799
Mother,

227
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,119
did you see that?

228
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
Yes.

229
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,840
I am delighted

230
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,119
by your filial piety.

231
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,080
Matron Hu,

232
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,840
you choose the topic.

233
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,479
The eight great Chinese cuisines

234
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,559
are only an outline.

235
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
Our local delicacies
can number more than 10 million.

236
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
Let us compete

237
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,880
without restrictions on cuisines
or localities.

238
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
How about an out-an-out competition?

239
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,679
What is that?

240
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,039
It is customary

241
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,159
for His Majesty to give his favorite dishes

242
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,559
to the ministers' feast.

243
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
We'll try to outdo each other

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,760
to present

245
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
more delicacies to the officials' banquet.

246
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,760
Eventually, it will be apparent

247
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,799
who is the best cook.

248
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
I agree.

249
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,799
If you wish to give up,

250
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,320
I'll get a replacement.

251
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Don't worry, Matron.

252
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,159
He Shu.

253
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,080
I'll do it.

254
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,559
What is Manager Yao doing?

255
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,719
Serve the dishes.

The chicken skin is soft

263
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,800
and the meat is tender.

264
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,719
What an unusual taste!

265
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,199
Your Majesty,

266
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
the Salt-Baked Chicken

267
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,680
was wrapped in oil-absorbing paper

268
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,800
and air-dried.

269
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,520
Salt?

270
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
Interesting method.

271
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,599
Your Majesty,

272
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,319
the Peony-Shaped Delicate Marinated Fish

273
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
looks beautiful

274
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,479
and tastes even better.

275
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,040
It also has a unique smoky flavor.

276
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,400
You're correct, Your Lordship.

277
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:38,880

280

Take this dish...

281
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
Isn't she serving nine cold dishes?

282
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,479
Why is there just a storage box?

283
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
Is she giving up?

284
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,280
She knows her limitations.

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,800
That's good.

286
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,800
Your Majesty,

00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,040

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,199
Don't scare her.

291
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,199
Let me see

00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,079
what are the treasures

00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,599

00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,560
This is the Nine-Variety Box.

297
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,880
This box looks fancy.

298
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,280
Compared to the usual box,

299
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,119
it only has extra cold dishes.

300
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,479
More attention

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
was paid to the earlier dishes.

302
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
Your Highness,

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800

304
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,560

and nine cooking techniques were used.

316
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,640
What is delightful aren't the dishes

317
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,199
but the way one can change the dishes

318
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,199
according to different seasons.

319
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,000
Meat and vegetarian dishes
are mixed and matched.

320
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
The box is small but all-encompassing.

321
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,640
Instruct the Court of Imperial Entertainments

322
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,680
to present this to the ministers' feast.

323
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,920
Yes.

324
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
Why are you laughing?

325
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,439
Your Majesty,

326
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
isn't this drama interesting?

327
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,719
Which drama?

328
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,640
Pain-relieving acupuncture

329
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,199
can only numb the pain for a while.

330
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,599
If it is too painful,

331
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,040
don't exert it.

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,839
What?

336
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,400
Can your hand

337
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,119

338
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,959
After I defeat you,

339
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,119
everything will be clear.

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,920
give it to me.

347
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,640
So it has to undergo slow roasting.

348
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
I want to taste it.

349
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:49,959
Quiet.

350
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,040
Why are they so serious

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,160

the Imperial Food Service
has meticulously prepared the dishes.

354
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
May I

355
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,199
ask Your Majesty to taste this?

than watching performances.

00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,439
That's true.

361
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,400
Your Majesty, please wait.

This duck meat is tender and fresh.

00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,599
The skin is crispy and crunchy.

366
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,680
There is a thin layer of oil

367
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,800
on the skin.

368
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,160
The duck can be greasy when there is too much oil

369
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,760
and not fragrant when there isn't enough.

370
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,119
This is just right.

371
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,359
It's fragrant.

372
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,479
It's indescribably fragrant.

373
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,319
No.

374
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,800
The Court of Imperial Entertainments overcooked
and put insufficient oil on roasted ducks.

375
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,839
This is much better.

376
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,800
Your Majesty,

377
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,959

forced-fed white ducks.

381
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,800
The ingredients are important,

382
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,760
but the cook's skill is the most important.

383
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,719
A little difference in heat control

384
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,359
can make a big difference.

in the unique aroma of ham.

388
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
There is a light floral fragrance too.

389
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,560
That's honey.

390
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
I used the sweetness of honey

391
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
to neutralize the savory ham

392
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,280
and highlight the freshness
of the palmate, which is the main ingredient.

393
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,719
Duck roasting

394
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,079
is all about techniques.

395
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,119
This dish

396
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,479
tests a cook's ingenuity.

397
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,119
It's difficult to tell which is better.

398
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,839
So,

399
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,439
it's a draw.

[Winter Melon Chicken]

401
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,839
The chicken is soft.

402
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,599
This approach is also unique.

403
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,359
Your Highness, anything wrong with this dish?

404
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,775
[Mashed Chicken]

405
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,119
It is fresh and smooth

406
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,880
and tastes mellow.

407
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,239
It looks like douhua,

408
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,760
but how can douhua

409
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,760
be so delicious?

410
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,839
It seems

411
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,199
that the two matrons

412
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,760
tie again.

413
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,439
This winter-melon chicken

414
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,599
uses a winter-melon bowl

415
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,640
for the watermelon spring chicken.

416
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,760
It is very fresh.

417
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,599
However,

418
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,400
watermelon removes grease
while keeping the chicken fresh.

419
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,280
It also imparts

420
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,479
sweetness to the chicken soup.

421
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
However, the winter melon has thick skin.

422
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,400
No matter how beautifully carved,

423
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,040
the melon is only a container.

424
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,760
It does nothing to the soup.

425
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,280
You're correct, Your Highness.

426
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,239
Each ingredient

427
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,599
should be put to good use. Right?

428
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
Your Highness is right.

429
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,920
I'm negligent.

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760

they lose their original taste.

00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,680
The same goes for winter bamboo shoots.

Dug from the forest

450

and baked together with the dirt,

451
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,239

541
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,520
It drinks pepper paste because it is hot

542
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
and its feathers fall off.

543
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
The goose is still alive

544

When cooking geese this way,

547
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,639

00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,000

No matter how great your cooking skills are,

you have no forbearance.

How can you be in charge?

00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,840
The two matrons must have felt

581
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,600
that today's banquet is boring

582
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,959
and specially prepared something

583
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,080
to entertain us.

584
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,360
Alright. Alright. Leave us

585
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,760
and prepare your dishes.

586
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,040
Yes.

587
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,159
Your Majesty.

588
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,719
Is Manager Yao's hand alright?

589
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,919
I wonder that too.

590
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,159
It seems to be badly injured.

591
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,800
She was injured

592
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,239
but still insisted on cooking.

593
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,000
I won't be able to do that.

594
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,439
Neither can I.

595
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,719
Yes.

596
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,520
I wonder

597
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,800
if it'll affect her in the future?

598
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,719
I think if it hurts like this

599
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,719
and she doesn't rest,

600
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,840
it'll have a lingering effect.

601
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,800
I'll do the rest.

602
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,239
You're sweating from the pain.

603
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:12,520
I'll do the rest.

604
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,719
You do something else.

605
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:15,040
Ziping,

606
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,719
do you know this seasoning recipe?

607
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,479
I've peeked so many times.

608
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,560
I've learned it already.

609
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:23,040
Go

610
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,040
and do something else.

611
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:27,199
If I'm badly injured,

612
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,840
I won't even be able to hold a knife.

613
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,280
It's fine.

614
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,840
Be careful.

615
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,040
Zijin.

616
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,199
This is my secret item.

617
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,919
It works wonders for musculoskeletal pain.

618
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,399
At least it can relieve the pain for a while.
