(the Crown Prince of the Great Ming, Zhu Gaochi,
ascended to the throne.)

the Crown Princess sent someone.

11
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,279
The Crown Princess is weak

12
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
from days of mourning.

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,479
She keeps coughing.

14
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
Matron Hu wants you to prepare medicinal food.

15
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,679

18
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,199
His Majesty agreed to take the throne

19
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,720
after rejecting it four times.

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,839
Officials

21
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,279
didn't expect to wear mourning clothes

22
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,600
according to ritual

23
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,759
for more than 27 days.

24
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
The father and son were close.

25
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,080
So was the Crown Prince.

26
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,160
You coughed badly yesterday.

27
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
Don't try to be tough.

28
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,839
Summon the directress
of the Palace Medicines Office.

29
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,320
I was exhausted

30
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,679
and there is stagnant heat in me.

31
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,559
It was cold last night.

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,399
I'll be fine after resting.

33
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,760
Don't be alarmed.

34
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,079
You should take care of your health.

35
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,279
I'll make you a cup of medicine for wind and cold

36
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,880
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

37
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
Drink it.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright.

39
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I'll drink it for the next few days.

40
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,000
You're thoughtful.

41
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,519
The weather is hot.

42
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,559
My chest is tight and my mouth is dry.

43
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
Your Highness has been coughing.

44
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,239
The lotus leaf porridge expels heat
and moistens the lungs.

45
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,720
Please try it.

46
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,239
There is osmanthus and taro cream.

47
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes.

48
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,880
Osmanthus is refreshing and invigorating.

49
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,399
Taro nourishes the stomach and spleen.

50
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,000
However, your spleen is weak.

51
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Taro can cause bloating.

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,399
Don't overeat.

53
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,359
I like the lotus leaf porridge.

54
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Today's meal is light and delicious.

55
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,399
Deliver the same set to the Crown Prince also.

56
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes.

57
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,959
Your Highness,

58
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,640
beware of a wolf in sheep's clothing.

59

In the 22nd year of Yongle Reign,
the household salt and grain are abolished.

reissued registration and given work,

67
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,839
and exempted from conscript labor for two years.

68

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
are also pardoned.

71
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,239
I abolished the acquisitions in all places.

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Are you here because of this?

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,880
Father, stopping purchasing horses
in the Western Regions

74
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,359
and procuring gemstones in Yunnan and Jiaozhi

75
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
is an act of compassion.

76
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,000
I do not object.

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,559
However, please reconsider moving

78
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
the capital back to Nanjing.

79
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,160
Did I say I'll move?

80
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,279
Did I?

81
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,160
You know it before I say it.

82
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,399
Have you sent people

83
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,359
to spy on me?

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,559
Father, don't get angry.

85
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,320
I heard you ordered people to the south

86
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,000
to renovate the Imperial City of Nanjing.

87
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
After the mourning period,

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,839
I thought you would move the capital back.

89
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
Forgive me

90
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,559
if I'm wrong.

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,959
After relocating the capital,

92
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
we divert the grain from the south to the north.

93
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,760
It's a waste of labor and money.

94
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,799
Arughtai keeps creating trouble.

95
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,440
Nanjing

96
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,200
was the capital designated by Hongwu Emperor.

97
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,720
Moving back to Nanjing

98
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,239
accords to the old system of the ancestors.

99
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,040
Father,

100
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
our dynasty thrived in Beijing.

101
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,600
Seeing its topographical advantages,

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,679
Grandfather moved here

103
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,040
to guard the gate of the Great Ming

104
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,640
as the Son of Heaven,

105
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,880
control the Four Barbarians,
and set the foundation.

106
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,200
Rushing back to the old capital

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
will destroy the painstaking efforts
made by Grandfather.

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Father,

109
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
you pardoned people

110
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,919
that my grandfather

111
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
wanted to execute regardless.

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,200

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
in the other direction.

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Why?

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Crown Prince,

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,039
don't be presumptuous

118
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,919
because the Late Emperor favored you.

119
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,359
He loved me

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,719
because only I

121
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,640
understood him.

122
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,119
You don't and will never understand

123
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,039
his aspirations.

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
You want to be a benevolent emperor.

125
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,960
However, the country has big future trouble.

126
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,679
You can't rule the land

127
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,239
with benevolence alone.

128
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,159
Tell me,

129
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,440
what are the future troubles?

130
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,599
Feudal lords.

131
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,000
Do not

132
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,840
criticize me.

133
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,559
Get out.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Get out!

135
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,840
Please excuse me.

136
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Continue.

137
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

Sir,

145
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,159
we've been keeping a watch on the Eastern Palace.

146
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Will His Majesty take revenge

147
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,200
after ascending the throne?

what is this?

Your Highness,

152
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,640
please forgive me.

153
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
I was too lax

154
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,919
and let Yao Zijin commit the crime
of setting Consort Zhuang free.

155
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,280
Setting her free?

156
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Before the sacrificial burial,

157
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,440
Yao Zijin made a meal delivery

158
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
and set Consort Zhuang free.

159
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,559
Jin, a maid in Yongning Palace, witnessed it.

160
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,200
The imperial harem has just settled down.

161

Her Majesty is busy.

162
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
I dare not disturb her.

163
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,039
I came here to ask Your Highness to decide.

164

Matron Hu,

165
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,359
making false accusations is a great crime.

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
You are my big sister,

167
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
but I won't indulge you.

168
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,159
Jin,

169
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,880
tell the truth in front of the Crown Princess

170
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
or you'll die.

171
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,840
Your Highness,

172
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,679
Miss Yao gave Consort Zhuang a jade pendant.

173
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,359
That was how she got out of Bei'an Gate.

174
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,159
What pendant?

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,119
An empress' phoenix pendant.

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,320
The guard is an experienced palace guy.

177
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,679
When he saw the pendant,

178
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,640
he was frightened

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,919
and didn't stop her.

180
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,200
General Chen promised to keep it secret.

181
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,760
To return to the palace,

182
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,919
the pendant was handed over as proof.

183
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,039
Yao Zijin,

184
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,679
where did you get the pendant?

185
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,640
The phoenix pendant was said to be carved
by the Late Emperor himself.

186
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,200
Empress Xiaochengren carried it with her
all the time.

187
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,359
The pendant represented Her Majesty

188
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,679
and orders will be obeyed.

189
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,840
Empress Xiaochengren raised the Crown Prince

190
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,200
and was fond of her grandson.

191
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,559
After she died,

192
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,159
she gave the pendant to the Late Emperor

193
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,440
to be given to the future granddaughter-in-law.

194
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
Tell me.

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,039
Why was the pendant

196
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,679
in the hands of a female official?

197
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,280
Yao Zijin,

198
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,679
who are you?

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,679
Your Highness.

200
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,840
Summon her.

201
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,919
Your Highness.

202
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,719
I want to see her.

203
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes.

204
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,239
What's wrong?

205
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Your Highness,

206
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,719
General Chen, a guard at the Bei'an Gate,

207
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,400
did not disturb you,

208
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,479
knowing you were mourning.

209
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,599
Once you're back,

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,799
he presented this.

211
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Why don't you answer?

212
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,599
Yao Zijin.

213
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,599
She was the wife chosen by the Late Emperor

214
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,320
for the Crown Prince.

215
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,159
Madam Peng Chengbo.

216
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Your Highness.

217
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,840
Sun was 10 years old

218
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
when she was brought to the palace by Madam Peng.

219
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,479
She was raised by the current Empress Zhang.

220
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,119
Half a year later,

221
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,599
she fell sick and left

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
to recuperate in Yongcheng

223
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,919
while waiting to get married when she grew up.

224
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,840
Obeying the mandate of heaven,

225
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,880
the Late Emperor named you the wife.

226
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,679
Sun is narrow-minded

227
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,599
and fell seriously ill.

228
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,239
The Late Emperor

229
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,239
was displeased.

230
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,520
No one dared to mention her since then.

231
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,840
Your Highness,

232
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,359
I said you are kind.

233
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,880
Do you see now?

234
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,799
You've been fooled by this vicious woman.

235
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,599
She entered the palace with a new identity

236
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,960
and lurked beside you.

237
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,760
What is her purpose?

238
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,880
It is self-explanatory.

239
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,559
Matron Hu,

240
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,799
we've known each other for a long time.

241
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,280
Have I done anything bad

242
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,039
or killed anyone?

243
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,440
Do you dare to say

244
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,640
that you hid your identity

245
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,559
without any ulterior motive?

246
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,760
Your Highness,

247
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,000
she is trouble.

248
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,200
We can't keep her.

249
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
I know you can't do it.

250
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,119
I'll handle this.

251
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,320
Men!

252
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,559
Are you going to kill me?

253
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:56,880
Matron Hu!

254
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Matron Hu!

255
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
Table Maid Yao Zijin

256
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
intended to murder the Crown Princess.

257
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
Before being interrogated
by the Palace Surveillance,

258
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
she took poison and committed suicide.

259
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,199
Your Highness.

260
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,680
Here's the evidence.

261
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,880
Your Highness,

262
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,800
earlier,

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,079
you took my status.

264
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
Now, are you going to frame me

265
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,479
and kill me?

266
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,199
I always thought you were kind.

267
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,640
When something concerns you,

268
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,199
you will still twist things around

269
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,000
and have no sense of justice?

270
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,439
No.

271
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Big Sister,

272
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:01,880
don't do this.

273
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,520
She must die, Your Highness.

274
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
You must kill her.

275
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:07,920
Big Sister.

276
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:09,800
Big Sister.

277
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,199
Big Sister.

278
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,599
After entering the palace,

279
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,040
I lost a younger sister.

280
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,079
When I saw you,

281
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,719
I thought I found one again.

282
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,040
Before yesterday,

283
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,800
I thought

284
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,239
you were so smart

285
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,160
and I mustn't let you down.

286
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,959
In the future,

287
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,280
I should let you assume my mantle.

288
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,359
However,

289
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,959
you've posed a threat to the Hu family

290
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,199
and the Crown Princess.

291
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,280
I have no choice.

292
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
In the next life, I'll do anything

293
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,439
to atone for my sin.

294
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,920
Big Sister.

295
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,439
How foolish!

296
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,359
Any woman can enter the palace,

297
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,400
but not her.

298
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,959
I'm doing this for you, Crown Princess.

299
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,599
Do it for your family

300
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,599
if not for yourself.

301
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,479
What are you doing?

302
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,199
Come on, Zijin.

303
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,680
Are you alright?

304
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Zijin!

305
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:52,920
Your Highness.

306
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,719
Take her away.

307
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,119
Your Highness.

308
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,319
(Zijin.)

309
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,000
(If I didn't send people to keep an eye
on the Qingning Palace,)

310
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,800
(are you going to lie to me forever?)

311
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,079
Your Highness, don't worry.

312
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Miss Yao was just scared.

313
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
She is fine

314
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
and will wake up soon.

315
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,079
Leave us.

316
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,119
Yes.

317
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,479
I'll take my leave.

318
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
Are you leaving

319
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
without an explanation?

320
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,719
Yao Zijin.

321
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
No.

322
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,520
Well, your surname is not Yao.

323
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,199
Is your name fake also?

324
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,640
Your Highness is forgetful.

325
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,680
When I first saw you,

326
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
you were only 10 years old.

327
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,439
Yes.

328
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,880
I entered the palace

329
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,479
when I was young.

330
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,439
Many years have passed.

331
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,160
Not just Your Highness,

332
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,479
no one in this palace remembers me.

333
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
My grandmother brought you in
with a fake registration.

334
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,560
Correct?

335
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,599
Will you prosecute me for impersonating?

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,640
I told you

337
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,599
not to call yourself a maid.

338
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,199
If I'm not a maid,

339
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
what am I?

340
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,439
You came in with a fake identity

341
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
and got close to me.

342
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,319
What do you want?

343
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:10,959
Your Highness,

344
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,119
that year,

345
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
I went to pray with my mother.

346
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,880
I bumped into Madam Peng Chengbo.

347
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,920
After that,

348
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,400
she often visited the Sun family.

349
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,239
My mother

350
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,439
became stricter.

351
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,800
I found out later

352
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,439
that to consolidate the power
of the Zhang family,

353
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,880
Madam searched for smart girls

354
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,280
and taught them carefully

355
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,599
to prepare them to be
the Great Imperial Grandson's Consort.

356
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,719
Finally,

357
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,199
she picked me.

358
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,520
Your Highness, you like to play weiqi with me

359
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
and listen to me playing the zither?

360
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,680
Besides the guqin, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

361
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,479
I learned pipa, wind instruments,

362
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,319
sewing, cooking,

363
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,959
Cuju, riding, and shooting.

364
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,199
I had to master

365
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,160
the things you like to do.

366
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,719
Otherwise,

367
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,839
I'd be beaten.

368
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Serving Your Highness

369
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,000
and living for you

370
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,760
were the only meaning in my life.

371
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,160
I didn't know about this.

372
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,119
Yes.

373
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,359
How can I dirty your ears

374
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,920
with such trivial matters?

375
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,359
You won't know

376
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,839
what happened to the Sun family

377
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,439
before I had an audience with His Majesty.

378
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Your master taught you.

379
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,599
You were the first choice
for the Great Imperial Grandson's consort.

380
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,479
It was a good thing.

381
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,000
Why did she...

382
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
She was not my tutor.

383
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,280
She was my mother.

384
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,079
Since young, I knew

385
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,680
she was my mother.

386
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,119
But I never called her mother.

387
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,000
Because of her lowly status,

388
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,719
she would disgrace the Sun family.

389
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,119
We spent all the time together.

390
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
We held hands.

391
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,800
She taught me to read, write,

392
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,239
and play the guqin.

393
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,199
But she wouldn't let me call her mother.

394
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,000
I nearly blurted it out so many times,

395
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,520
but I refrained.

396
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,439
She died

397
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
for me.

398
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,439
A consort of the Great Imperial Grandson

399
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,959
could not let others know

400
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,479
about her mother's entertainer household.

401
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,760
My mother was proud

402
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,520
and never gave up.

403
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,760
But she gave up

404
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,199
for my future.

405
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,079
For me to have a clean background,

406
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
she hung herself.

407
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,359
Your Highness,

408
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,239
for you,

409
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
it's just getting a new candidate.

410
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,199
For me,

411
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,199
it means my mother sacrificed in vain.

412
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,920
It means her death is meaningless.

413
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:05,959
I don't want

414
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,959
to be the Great Imperial Grandson's Consort.

415
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,119
I only wish she could be alive.

416
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,439
I'm wrong.

417
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,800
I regret

418
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,839
that while she was alive,

419
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,920
I didn't call her mother.

420
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,599
I am sorry.

421
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,439
Zijin.

422
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,640
Your Highness, you asked me

423
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
why I entered the palace.

424
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,560
Lady Xu was not my biological mother,

425
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,359
but she pitied my mother

426
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,319
and treated me like her own.

427
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,640
When she was very ill,

428
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
she struggled to stay alive,

429
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,839
waiting to see me getting married.

430
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,199
But in the end,

431
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,640
she didn't hear what she wanted.

432
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Your Highness,

433
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,680
because of this betrothal,

434
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,119
I lost the most important people in the world.

435
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,520
So, I enter the palace

436
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,400
to see for myself

437
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,239
how good the woman who replaced me is.

438
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,719
I would like to ask Your Highness

439
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,199
what was the mistake I made.

440
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,719
You didn't do anything wrong.

441
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,839
It wasn't your fault.

442
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:41,839
I promise,

443
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
from now on,

444
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
no one will hurt you again.

445
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,479
I promise.

446
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,359
Your Highness.

447
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,800
His Highness...

448
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,839
Don't worry, Your Highness.

449
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
His Highness wanted to punish Matron Hu,

450
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
but Miss Yao said

451
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
that they were acquainted

452
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,079
and begged for mercy.

453
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,359
His Highness ordered Matron Hu
to reflect on what she did.

454
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
But if she repeats it,

455
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,119
next time...

456
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
Your Highness,

457
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,640
His Highness ordered me
to send you back to the palace.

458
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,300
[Xingyun Cottage]

459
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,079
Keep watch outside.

460
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,239
Yes.

461
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,920
Big Sister, you were careless

462
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,640
and annoyed His Highness.

463
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Are you satisfied now?

464
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,560
I've never groomed someone so carefully.

465
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,280
It is because of you that I wanted to

466
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,680
kill her.

467
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,839
You're unrepentant.

468
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,160
Even if she was betrothed to His Highness,

469
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,439
the times have changed.

470
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,680
Am I so narrow-minded?

471
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,920
There are many beauties in the harem.

472
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,599
One more doesn't matter.

473
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,640
Why are you laughing?

474
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
Why don't you

475
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,800
answer?

476
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Per the ancestral teachings
of the Hongwu Emperor, the imperial harem

477
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,560
can't interfere in politics

478
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,800
and royal relatives can't have power.

479
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,160
Consorts and concubines

480
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
of emperors and princes

481
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,319
are chosen from women of good families.

482
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,599
In the palace, they can't rely

483
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
on their families.

484
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,400
They can only depend on

485
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,479
the emperors' affection.

486
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,719
Hongwu Emperor's Empress Xiaocigao
of the Ma family

487
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
and the Late Emperor's Empress Xiaochengren
of the Xu family

488
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,400
accompanied their husbands to war

489
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,599
and made indelible contributions.

490
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
An emperor

491
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,079
loves his first wife

492
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,560
more than

493
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,959
any beauty in the world.

494
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
Your Highness,

495
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,560
answer this question.

496
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,959
How is your relationship with the Crown Prince?

497
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
He is surrounded by beauties,

498
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
but he has never despised me, his wife.

499
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,239
He's not that kind of man.

500
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,719
Wife?

501
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,119
Don't forget

502
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,439
that because of your own grief,

503
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,640
you nearly injured him.

504
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
So how come you're loving husband and wife?

505
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,119
Think about it.

506
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,160
After finding out Sun's
misfortune and sacrifices,

507
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,520
he will surely feel guilty and pitiful.

508
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,319
Thankfully, you were here first.

509
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,239
You have the title.

510
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,079
Otherwise, with Sun here,

511
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,040
you won't gain a foothold.

512
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Stop.

513
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Things are changeable in the imperial harem.

514
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You're not safe even if you have merits.

515
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,400
The incumbent Empress Zhang

516
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,959
stayed with her husband

517
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,280
from when he was the Prince of Yan to now.

518
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,560
She saved him from dangers several times.

519
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,680
Now, Lady Guo

520
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
is in the imperial harem.

521
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,920
She is from a founding statesman's family.

522
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,439
Young and beautiful, she is favored
by His Majesty.

523
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,119
She gave birth to three princes.

524
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,959
She became a noble consort
after he took the throne.

525
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
Empress Zhang is not a simple person.

526
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,079
Yet, she gives in to the noble consort.

527
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,520
Can you compare yourself to Empress Zhang?

528
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,239
Crown Princess, it's time you wake up.

529
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,599
You were ordered to monitor the Eastern Palace,

530
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,000
but only recorded my good deeds.

531
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:19,160
Weren't you afraid that the Late Emperor
would hold you accountable?

532
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,599
Your Majesty,

533
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,479
when you stayed there,

534
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,119
troublemakers asked if you

535
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,719
knew someone slandered you.

536
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,920
Your Majesty said,

537
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,040
I don't know,

538
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,880
but I know how to be a son.

539
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
Your Majesty knew the Late Emperor
heard slanders

540
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
to alienate your relationship.

541
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Your Majesty was gracious

542
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,880
and only cared about filial piety.

543
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,160
I

544
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,239
only did my duty as an officer.

545
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,280
Were you

546
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,760
loyal to the Late Emperor

547
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
or me?

548
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,640
Your Majesty,

549
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,280
he trusted you

550
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,680
during the five northern expeditions.

551
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,160
You loved the people and your subordinates.

552
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,880
Officials hold you in high regard.

553
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
I won't let villains frame

554
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,199
and topple you.

555
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,880
As an imperial bodyguard,

556
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
I monitored

557
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
and only recorded

558
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
what I heard and saw.

559
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,479
I'll accept punishment

560
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,839
for any inaccuracies.

561
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,280
I almost wronged a loyal officer.

562
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,359
Rise.

563
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes.

564
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,400
Wang Jie resigned due to illness.

565
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
I name you

566
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,160
the commander of the imperial bodyguard.

567
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,040
Don't let me down.

568
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

569
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,920
I will readily die

570
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,280
to repay your kindness.

571
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:53,959
Your Majesty.

572
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
It's mealtime.

573
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:56,920
You can leave now.

574
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,719
Yes.

575
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Miss Yao won't accept it.

576
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,879
She said

577
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,959
that the pendant doesn't belong to her.

578
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,159
From now on,

579
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,399
you oversee the meals

580
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,360
at the Eastern Palace.

581
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,800
Matron Hu.

582
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,919
The Crown Prince and the Crown Princess

583
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:12,679
had earlier assigned their meals...

584
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,439
Zijin.

585
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,879
Directress of the Banquets Office begged me

586
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,399
and I agreed.

587
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,360
Do your job well

588
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,719
and uphold my reputation.

589
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,120
Yes.

590
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,719
The Banquets Office manages

591
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,120
minor items like grain and charcoal.

592
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Why was Zijin transferred there?

593
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,120
Who is being transferred to the Banquets Office?

594
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,520
His Majesty ordered

595
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,040
Matron Meng

596
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,479
to assume her former position

597
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,360
with immediate effect.

598
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,399
Official Jing,

599
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,760
are there

600
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,679
two matrons

601
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,919
here?

602
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,959
The Imperial Food Service
oversees four offices.

603
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,600
The Foods Office, Medicines Office,
Wines Office, and the Banquets Office.

604
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:11,639
It has heavy responsibilities.

605
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,520
Since Hongwu Emperor,

606
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
there were two matrons.

607
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,600
Now,

608
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
we are reverting to the old rule.

609
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,080
Any issue?

610
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,719
Congratulations, Matron Meng.

611
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,000
Congratulations, Matron Meng.

612
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,120
Official Jing,

613
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,199
I admire Yao Zijin's cooking skills.

614
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,239
Let her stay in the Imperial Food Service.

615
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,399
Alright?

616
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,399
Matron Meng

617
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,439
is in charge here.

618
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,520
You have control over the staff.

619
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,159
Alright.

620
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,560
Get busy.

621
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,760
Yes.

622
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,879
That's great.

623
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,000
Zijin,

624
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,719
with Matron Meng in charge,

625
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,159
we don't have to worry now.

626
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:16,239
[Foods Office]

627
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:16,800
Official Jing,

628
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,159
you

629
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,159
promised

630
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
that I'll be in charge.

631
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Meng is domineering.

632
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,120
She even looks down on me.

633
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,320
I won't side with her.

634
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
This is His Majesty's order.

635
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,439
I'm just doing my job.

636
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,040
Even Her Majesty hates her.

637
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,479
She couldn't have met His Majesty.

638
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,520
Was it Noble Consort Guo?

639
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,760
I don't know.

640
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,879
Official Jing,

641
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,399
I'm afraid

642
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:47,679
you have to get involved.

643
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,840
After I took over the Imperial Food Service,

644
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,439
I've handled many accounts.

645
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,800
If Meng regains power

646
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,439
and conducts a check,

647
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,479
you will be implicated too.

648
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,959
Are you threatening me?

649
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,479
I don't dare to.

650
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,800
Take care of yourself.

651
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,800
I already told you.

652
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,959
Jing Quan is a greedy man.

653
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,840
You shouldn't get too close to him.

654
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,199
I was only temporarily in charge.

655
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,080
Had I not bribed him,

656
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,320
I wouldn't be

657
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,679
promoted to matron so quickly.

658
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,439
Meals are eaten.

659
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,320
You must not make mistakes.

660
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,439
A cook

661
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
will no longer be a cook

662
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
if she indulges in crime

663
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,159
for her own selfish gains.

664
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,080
Wei,

665
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,560
you've changed.

666
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
I remember that you once said

667
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,080
we could fight and compete.

668
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,320
But as a human,

669
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
we have a bottom line.

670
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,919
Do you

671
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,479
still remember

672
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,520
what you said before?

673
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,159
Bottom line?

674
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
Once I take the first step,

675
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,399
I will cross the bottom line

676
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,320
sooner or later.

677
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,040
Don't worry.

678
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,800
If something happens,

679
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
I'll take all the blame

680
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,639
and won't implicate you.

681
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
This is the mourning period.

682
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,080
Meals should be simple.

683
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,560
Your Highness, forgive me.

684
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,439
Grandfather always

685
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,080
sneered at

686
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,000
elaborate formalities,

687
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,199
but

688
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,679
if he knew

689
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,840
that my father is only eating
vegetables and tofu,

690
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,040
he'd be very happy.

691
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,080
You're quiet.

692
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,679
Looks like

693
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
you do hate me.

694
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,719
If someone

695
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,639
dictated my fate

696
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,719
and caused me a lifetime of pain,

697
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,080
I would kill him.

698
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,000
Your Highness,

699
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
I won't.

700
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,000
You won't

701
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,439
or don't hate me?

702
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,199
Even if I have a special power,

703
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
I cannot bring your mother

704
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,760
back.

705
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,879
Can I

706
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,159
do anything for you?

707
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,399
Your Highness,

708
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
things have changed.

709
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,159
I have no regrets.

710
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,280
I think...

711
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,800
A woman who is betrothed to the imperial family

712
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
cannot get married.

713
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,840
I can be a nun

714
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,840
or die.

715
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,760
I have no complaints.

716
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,280
Let me tell you.

717
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,080
No way.

718
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,840
I won't let you go.

719
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't care if you are Yao Zijin

720
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,719
or Sun.

721
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,760
I'll never let you go.

722
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,439
Yuan Qi.

723
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:36,800
Yuan Qi.

724
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,159
Your Highness,

725
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,159
take Yantai away.

726
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,040
Yes.

727
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:10,800
Stop placing the dishes.

728
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,679
I'm not eating.

729
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,199
You said you wouldn't dare

730
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,800
and wouldn't complain.

731
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:17,199
They are all excuses.

732
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,840
Why

733
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,879
are you so timid now?

734
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:22,719
Can't you say something sincere?

735
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,080
Yes.

736
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,600
What?

737
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,959
They're all lies.

738
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:33,120
I hate Your Highness, the palace,

739
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,399
and everyone who brought me

740
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,000
the misfortune.

741
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,639
Your Highness,

742
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,479
I hate you.

743
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,479
If you won't behead me,

744
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
may I leave now?

745
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,239
Yantai,

746
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,320
I am sorry.

747
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,959
I scared you.

748
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,639
Eat some more.

749
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,199
Are you angry?

750
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,199
Alright.

751
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,239
What a coincidence, Miss Yao.

752
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,399
We meet again.

753
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
We're in mourning.

754
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,399
Even His Majesty is eating vegetarian food.

755
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,919
This cat must be punished too.

756
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,159
This is the Crown Prince's Yantai.

757
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
How can you punish it at will?

758
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,919
Even the Emperor is mourning.

759
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:48,879
So should the Crown Prince.

760
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:50,800
Give it to me.

761
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:53,080
Officer You,

762
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,320
birds fly in the sky and fish swim in the water.

763
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,520
This is common sense.

764
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:01,080
Why don't you go to
the Directorate of Imperial Parks

765
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,360
and force the tigers and leopards
to go vegetarian?

766
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,280
You helped Consort Zhuang

767
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,040
and you used the Crown Prince

768
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,280
to get through a crisis.

769
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:16,879
You're indeed something.

770
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
You had a deliberate plan

771
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,760
to seize the Eastern Palace,

772
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:24,280
but when you gained a full victory,

773
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
you admitted everything

774
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,239
and ruined your own efforts.

775
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,399
Are you aware that by doing that,

776
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,840
you've pushed

777
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,239
the Crown Prince back to Hu?

778
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,800
Sir, you're even keeping a watch
on the Eastern Palace.

779
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,360
I wonder who authorized you to do so.

780
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,000
His Majesty?

781
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,320
This is not keeping a watch.

782
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,479
To be promoted,

783
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,639
I must please the Crown Prince.

784
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:47,520
I must know his actions.

785
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
You have more secrets

786
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,840
than me.

787
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:56,840
Can two people with secrets

788
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,800
cooperate?

789
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,639
Sir, you're joking.

790
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,520
I can't do an imperial bodyguard's

791
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,879
job.

792
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Your enemy is nasty.

793
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,360
You might die

794
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,439
before you can gain a footing.

795
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,360
Think it through.

796
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,959
I'll wait for your answer.

797
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,479
You only laugh when you want to cry.

798
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,280
How stupid.
