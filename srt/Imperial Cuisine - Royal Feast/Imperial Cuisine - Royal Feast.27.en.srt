00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,400
[Royal Feast]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,620
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,760
Do not worry.

4
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,800
My mother won't blame you.

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,080
Her Majesty is merciful

6
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,599
and won't blame me,

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
but I cannot let gossips

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,199
ruin Your Highness' illustrious name.

9
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,279
After all,

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,879
when Your Highness recovers

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
from your injury,

12
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,319
His Majesty will surely urge Your Highness

13
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,680
to depart for Nanjing.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,559
You know a lot.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,279
I worry about Your Highness

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,600
with all my heart and soul.

17
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,479
Is Your Highness angry?

18
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,360
Alright then.

19
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,000
Jin,

20
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:25,720
inform everyone.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,639
His Highness will spend the night here.

22
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,880
Stop.

24
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,320
Crown Prince's Concubine,

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,399
have a nice bath.

26
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,600
I'll go back first.

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
Your Majesty,

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,559
Noble Consort Guo waited
outside Qianqing Palace

29
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,440
for three days.

30
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,360
His Majesty

31
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,320
finally relented.

32
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,800
As expected.

33
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,119
Your Majesty canceled

34
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,440
this year's birthday feast

35
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,119
because His Majesty is ill.

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,399
Noble Consort Guo offered

37
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,080
to hold a feast for Your Majesty.

38
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,200
What's her intention?

39
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,079
What happened in the past two days?

40
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,000
All the buildings were empty.

41
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,559
Were they admiring flowers
in the Qiongyuan Court?

42
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,880
There was not even a soul around.

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,959
Your Highness,

44
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
I sent people to keep an eye on them

45
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,359
and discovered...

46
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,559
Here.

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,799
Here.

48
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,399
Lady of Talents Wu.

49
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,920
The Crown Princess' hall is big

50
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,119
but unadorned except for medical books

51
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,959
and tea tables.

52
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,559
Your place is exquisite and rich.

53
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
It's clear that His Highness

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,359
lavishes you with deep adoration.

55
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,000
Greetings to the Crown Prince's Concubine.

56
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,880
We decorate halls

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
according to our preferences.

58
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,040
The Crown Princess

59
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,279
prefers peace and quiet.

60
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,760
I love fun.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,799
No one can say which preference is better.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,079
We'll do what makes us feel free.

63
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,519
I think this is wrong.

64
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,559
Crown Prince's Concubine,

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,760
can you please take a look?

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Don't be polite. Sit wherever you want.

67
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,320
Lady of Talents Zhao.

68
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,559
Let me see.

69
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,799
This thread...

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,519
Try this.

71
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,559
In here.

72
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
Stitch less over here.

73
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Lady of Talents Wu.

74
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,839
Anything wrong?

75
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,119
The Crown Prince's Concubine does not know

76
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,040
that everyone says

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,480
Lady of Talents Wu is a fragrant doll.

78
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,839
She is crazy about incense.

79
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:08,959
Come here.

80
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,239
Come.

81
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,679
Come a little closer.

82
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,519
It is the scent of citrus.

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I often make it,

84
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
but the scent is too sweet

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
and not as fresh.

86
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,279
Smell it.

87
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,559
It's like freshly plucked

88
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,720
fresh citrus from a tree.

89
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,000
Lady of Talents Wu,

90
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,399
I heard it from your lips

91
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,959
that you'll ignore the Crown Prince's Concubine.

92
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,160
The words still ring in my ears.

93
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,359
Have you forgotten that?

94
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,000
Am I that kind of person?

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
I can't be bribed

96
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
with a citrus-flavored bracelet.

97
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,519
The vixen lives in the fox hole

98
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,839
and smiles so sweetly at me.

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
She noticed that I liked the scent

100
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
and will try to win me over next time.

101
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,599
I won't fall into her trap easily.

102
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,799
Let's go.

103
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,400
You mean

104
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,000
Noble Consort Guo will organize

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
a birthday feast for Mother?

106
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,280
Yes.

107
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,159
Isn't that strange?

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,719
Noble Consort Guo has always

109
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:48,880
looked down on Her Majesty

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,359
because she is favored by His Majesty.

111
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,359
Now, she has become courteous.

112
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,239
It's too late.

113
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,159
A river won't freeze three feet overnight.

114
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,599
She wants to restore the old relationship
at the last moment.

115
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
She will fail.

116
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,200
Besides, Yongning Palace and Kunning Palace

117
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,479
never had any old relationship.

118
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,039
Some people are doomed

119
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,320
not to be friends.

120
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,799
Your Highness,

121
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,880
Her Majesty asked us to forgo birthday wishes.

122
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,080
You can't just

123
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,520
attend the feast empty-handed.

124
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,840
What birthday gift would you give?

125
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,200
What do you think

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,119
she will give?

127
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll ask around.

128
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
No need.

129
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,479
Someone will do it.

130
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,760
Your Highness, Lady of Talents Wu is here.

131
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,119
Bring her in.

132
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,200
Crown Prince's Concubine.

133
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,679
Be careful.

134
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,479
So clumsy.

135
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,359
Crown Prince's Concubine,

136
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,280
what are you doing?

137
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,400
She likes yesterday's citrus scent.

138
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,919
I'm teaching her how to mix it.

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
Don't blame me, Crown Prince's Concubine.

140
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm kindly reminding you

141
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,760
that His Highness

142
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,039
dislikes strong aroma.

143
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,320
If a girl

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
smells of too much rouge, powder, and perfume,

145
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,119
he will be displeased.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
However, I like it.

147
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
A concubine or consort of the Eastern Palace

148
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
should put His Highness's preferences first.

149
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,799
This is where I live.

150
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,080
Naturally, I will burn my favorite incense.

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,919
If His Highness

152
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
dislikes it,

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,400
he can return to his study.

154
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,400
Jin.

155
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,000
Try doing it yourself.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,919
I'll be over there.

157
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,799
Why are you here also?

158
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,960
I...

159
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,960
What is this?

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Her Majesty's birthday

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
is around the corner.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,799
Although she doesn't want birthday wishes,

163
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,599
we still want to show our regards.

164
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,960
So, you are here to please her.

165
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,679
Are you presenting this peony painting?

166
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,080
Grind the ink.

167
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,280
Your Highness,

168
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,599
the imperial physician advised you

169
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,200
not to strain your hand

170
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,640
before it heals.

171
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,799
It'll be done soon.

172
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,080
Don't forget

173
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,039
what you said

174
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,799
in front of the Crown Princess.

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,799
You fawn upon the powerful

176
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,239
in the blink of an eye.

177
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,400
I feel ashamed for you all.

178
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,960
Guqin, weiqi,

179
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
poetry, and painting

180
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,559
are for entertaining His Highness

181
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,159
when he is in a good mood.

182
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:46,520
Most of the time,

183
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,039
we stay in our palace and feel bored.

184
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,000
Even the best painting

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,919
and beautiful songs are useless...

186
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,400
Sister.

187
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
when you don't have bosom friends

188
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,679
to appreciate them.

189
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,799
As for me,

190
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,559
I go where the fun is.

191
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,679
Sitting in the Xinuan Pavilion

192
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,799
and listening to them chatting
and playing the guqin

193
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
is fun.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,640
I might get lucky

195
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,559
and have a chance to meet His Highness.

196
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,799
You're hopeless.

197
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,679
By the way,

198
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,479
the Crown Prince's Concubine
is proficient in fragrances.

199
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,039
You can ask her to teach you.

200
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,280
You're all traitors.

201
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,039
His Highness likes flowers,
birds, and landscapes.

202
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,599
We all adorn

203
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,479
our walls with such paintings.

204
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,159
Has she done that?

205
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
To please His Highness,

206
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,119
I even set up a pitch-pot.

207
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
His Highness dislikes noise

208
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,119
and strong fragrances.

209
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,799
He said that women who bow their heads
when doing needlework

210
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,679
have bad postures.

211
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,679
In particular, he dislikes

212
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,679
women gathering together

213
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,039
and making noise and gossiping.

214
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,280
She does everything

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
she pleases even if

216
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,679
it displeases His Highness.

217
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,239
Let's wait and see.

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,559
She'll regret it.

219
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,239
Lady of Talents Wu.

220
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,239
Lady of Talents Wu.

221
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,119
She ignored me

222
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,960
but wanted to ask me to go back now?

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,599
No need.

224
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,159
Lady of Talents Wu,

225
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,280
don't you like the citrus scent?

226
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
It's just citrus scent.

227
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,559
I have it in my place also.

228
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,440
The Crown Prince's Concubine
doesn't have to bother.

229
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,080
Lady of Talents He noticed that you like it

230
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,799
and took some of the citrus fragrance

231
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,679
given by the Crown Prince's Concubine.

232
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
She asked me to give it to you.

233
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,239
You!

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,840
Permit me to leave.

235
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:28,719
Your Highness,

236
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,520
where are you going?

237
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,599
They are presenting a peony painting

238
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,280
on Her Majesty's birthday.

239
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,479
I won't let them have their way.

240
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,400
Let's visit the Crown Princess.

241
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,719
His Highness' injury is slow to heal,

242
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,919
I'm worried.

243
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,479
I remember my mother's ancestral medicine

244
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,599
for stopping bleeding
and regenerating tissues.

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
I prepared it for you to try.

246
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,479
Eunuch Chen,

247
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,559
the Crown Princess

248
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,400
stayed up three nights

249
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
to prepare this medicine.

250
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,719
The special formula

251
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,280
required it to be pressed down
with ice blocks for a long time.

252
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,799
The medicine is ineffective

253
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,200
when the ice melts.

254
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you.

255
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Apply it once in the morning and evening
for seven consecutive days.

256
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,320
I can send more over.

257
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,640
That's not necessary.

258
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,200
The medicine that Sheng Yin gave me is fine.

259
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,559
Imperial Physician Sheng is highly skilled,

260
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,159
but each physician has his specialty.

261
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,799
My maternal grandfather

262
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,200
specializes in external wounds.

263
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,479
He can heal ordinary sword wounds

264
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,280
in less than a month.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
You won't have

266
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,440
relapses like now.

267
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,640
I heard that Your Highness
was feverish yesterday.

268
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,080
I couldn't sit still

269
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,159
and kept going out.

270
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,559
I caught a cold in the wind.

271
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
I feel better now.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Yes.

273
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,599
Is there anything else?

274
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,840
Next month is Mother's birthday,

275
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,000
but she is worried about Father's illness.

276
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
She doesn't want a big celebration.

277
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,719
She strictly forbids gifts
from the palace consorts

278
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,719
and concubines or court ladies.

279
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,640
Originally, I thought of

280
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,080
asking everyone to embroider

281
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,320
or copy Buddhist scriptures.

282
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,280
This conforms with her wish

283
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,799
and is not extravagant.

284
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
However...

285
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,760
Because of what happened in the past,

286
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,760
I know Your Highness misunderstood me.

287
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,440
Now, Sister Sun has been given a title,

288
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,359
and those unpleasant matters

289
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,359
have been forgotten.

290
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,679
Now, she's preparing a birthday gift

291
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,159
for Mother with much fanfare.

292
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,840
She might go against Mother's wish

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,640
with her eagerness to show filial piety.

294
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,960
Why don't you dissuade her?

295
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,440
Let her do

296
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,640
what she wants.

297
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,479
Judging from your expression,

298
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,679
is Sister Sun still blaming you?

299
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,960
Well,

300
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,960
after what she went through,

301
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,719
it's hard to get rid of the resentment.

302
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,159
Your Highness, don't worry.

303
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,760
The human heart is made of flesh.

304
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,000
She will slowly

305
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
warm up to you.

306
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,479
You should be considerate

307
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,559
and give her more time.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,599
Your Highness.

309
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,320
If you want to meet the Crown Prince's Concubine,

310
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,559
I can invite her over.

311
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
You don't have to go.

312
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,440
She never told me the truth.

313
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,840
Your Highness,

314
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,640
that's Lady of Talents Cao.

315
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,159
She probably didn't see you.

316
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,119
If she sees you,

317
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
she would earnestly greet you.

318
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,400
Let's go.

319
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,960
The Luoyang Red Peony is nice.

320
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,159
No.

321
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,679
It is because you drew it well,
Crown Prince's Concubine.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,799
Rich and elegant with vivid details.

323
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,880
It is a wonderful painting.

324
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,199
The leaves are too colorful.

325
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
The whole painting seems too sweet and vulgar.

326
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
It's all your fault.

327
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,719
You insisted on using this color

328
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,040
and ruined a good painting.

329
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
What's the matter today?

330
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,560
Your Highness is standing here,

331
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,760
but they pretend not to see you.

332
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,400
Let's take a look.

333
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,520
Lady of Talents Wu.

334
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,040
Don't.

335
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,079
Lady of Talents Wu.

336
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,800
I said stop.

337
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,000
Did you see that?

338
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,959
After the Crown Prince's Concubine
entered the Eastern Palace,

339
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,400
they're at her place all the time,

340
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,560
playing music, singing, sewing, and painting.

341
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,520
They're so noisy

342
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,479
and don't have manners.

343
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,119
Look.

344
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,400
They are secretly fighting.

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
Didn't you revolve around her too?

346
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:02,760
I...

347
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
I just want to see

348
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,560
if they do anything unruly.

349
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,680
Your Highness, you should keep them in check.

350
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,760
Your Highness.

351
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:19,839
Your Highness,

352
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,040
His Highness seems annoyed.

353
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,079
What should we do?

354
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,680
That's good.

355
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,760
She's always doing things
that His Highness hates.

356
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,160
His Highness will reprimand her
when he goes back.

357
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,400
Yantai,

358
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,959
why are you here?

359
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,439
Come in.

360
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,839
Your Highness.

361
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,479
Your Highness!

362
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
Your Highness!

363
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,839
Your Highness!

364
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,280
Your injury!

365
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm fine.

366
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,479
Close your eyes.

367
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,680
Quickly.

368
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,680
Close your eyes.

369
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,599
I give this to you with my own hands.

370
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,880
In this lifetime, you must never return it to me.

371
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,920
I...

372
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I don't know how sincere your love is,

373
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,640
but I know my heart is sincere.

374
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,040
I don't expect you to reciprocate,

375
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,719
but I hope one day

376
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,400
you will open up and be honest.

377
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,160
Sir,

378
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,280
where were you?

379
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,680
I was searching everywhere for you.

380
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,760
There is an urgent report from Nanjing.

381
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,640
Why didn't you report such an important matter
to the Eastern Palace?

382
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,359
Now?

383
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:03,719
Yes.

384
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,079
Now.

385
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,359
Your Highness.

386
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,520
I have something

387
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,839
to tell you.

388
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Do you need my help?

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,079
I'm helping you.

390
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:56,880
Your Highness!

391
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,439

392
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,800

393
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,280
Come in.

394
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,640
Your Highness!

395
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,880
We just received an emergency report
about an earthquake in Nanjing.

396
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,319
His Majesty has convened his ministers
for an urgent meeting.

397
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,280
Let's go to Qianqing Palace.

398
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
But your injury...

399
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,839
It doesn't matter.

400
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,439
Your Highness,

401
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,319
go now.

402
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,319
Zijin,

403
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,439
I'll give instructions based on what you said.

404
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,839
Go ahead and do it.

405
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,680
Let's go.

406
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,520
After His Highness leaves,

407
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
he won't be coming back tonight.

408
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,439
Please rest early.

409
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,640
Mistress.

410
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,839
His Highness must have dropped it.

411

412
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,280
Go and rest.

413
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,400
Yes.

414
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,400
(On the fourth month of the first year of Hongxi,)

415
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,400
(Nanjing was repeatedly rocked by earthquakes.)

416
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,199
(The Crown Prince, Zhu Zhanji, paid homage
to the Xiaoling Mausoleum as ordered)

417
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,079

[Reed Leave-Wrapped Rice]

419
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,359
I wonder if His Highness has reached Nanjing.

420
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,119
Fang,

421
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,719
are you concerned about the safety
of His Highness

422
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,520
or Mr. Chen's?

423
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,800
Don't talk nonsense.

424
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,920
The Court of Imperial Entertainments
will distribute reed leave-wrapped rice

425
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,959
to officials, including His Majesty's
favorite ministers,

426
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,839
and specially ordered
the Imperial Food Service to prepare it.

427
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,599
Is everything ready?

428
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
We've verified

429
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,959
and sent it.

430
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,719
Come.

431
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,959
You two go and cook the new ears of wheat.

432
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,239
One more.

433
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,800
Is the birthday feast for Her Majesty

434
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
ready?

435
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,319
Yes.

436
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,800
It's done.

437
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,160
It's worthwhile putting in the hard work
to make draft copies

438
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,560
and repeatedly revising and finalizing them.

439
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,119
I was so tired that my vision became blurry.

440
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,400
Come on.

441
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,000
From the draft copies you submitted,

442
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,839
we could not even

443
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,959
choose two good copies.

444
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
Wu, you are here.

445
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,199
No wonder people said that nature is our teacher,
but an artist's spirit is the source of creation.

446
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,119
The same garden of beautiful peonies

447
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,760
can look very different

448
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,680
in the hands of different painters.

449
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,719
Someone has improved

450
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,239
her skill to flatter.

451
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,719
Alright, I was wrong.

452
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,640
Don't joke around. Look.

453
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,599
There are three pearl drops in this white peony.

454
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,719
They are glossy,

455
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
bright, and prominent.

456
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,760
I contributed to that.

457
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,520
Careful.

458
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,560
This is my birthday gift to Her Majesty.

459
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,359
How can you?

460
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,640
Let's go.

461
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,959
Let's go and see the Crown Princess

462
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:13,839
and let her be the judge.

463
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,839
Let go.

464
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,160
Pushing and pulling are highly improper.

465
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,800
You were busy talking

466
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,880
and caused the disaster.

467
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,839
If someone is to be held responsible,

468
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,439
we both will be.

469
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,239
Why am I the only one to blame?

470
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,079
Crown Prince's Concubine.

471
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,280
Look.

472
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,199
This is the pipa song you wanted.

473
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,359
I finished compiling the sheet music last night.

474
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,680
I cannot be bothered about this now.

475
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
The peony painting is damaged.

476
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,479
Tomorrow is Her Majesty's birthday.

477
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
What about the birthday gift?

478
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,199
Crown Prince's Concubine,

479
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,520
it happened because I was reckless.

480
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,599
You are kind and generous.

481
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,040
You won't fuss about it, will you?

482
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,359
You can take whatever curiosities

483
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,439
you like in my place

484
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800

the peony painting was painstakingly done
by the Crown Prince's Concubine.

517
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
It was my fault.

That's Paeonia suffruticosa Er Qiao.

568
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,959
It's clearly Yinfen Jinling.

569
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,159
There is no such flower
in Qiongyuan Court this year.

570
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,360
It must be Paeonia suffruticosa Er Qiao.

571
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,600
This is an imitation
of Zhang Yuezhai's peony festival

572
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,520
that used peonies in praises.

573
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,879
Why don't we look at poems?

574
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,280
(Mother's favorite flower is the peony.)

575
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,879
(Unfortunately, peonies will wither soon.)

576
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,959
(I took a lot of trouble to keep them
until her birthday,)

577
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,639
(but there were only a few pots)

578
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,719
(for the occasion.)

579
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,679
(The Crown Prince's Concubine is smart.)

580
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,399
(This is her actual birthday present.)

581
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,679
The Crown Prince's Concubine is so mean.

582
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,199
You keep the birthday gift hidden until today.

583
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,800
Had I known about
the meticulous preparations you made,

584
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,560
I wouldn't feel guilty to this day.

585
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,479
I gave instructions

586
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,639
not to make a fuss about my birthday.

587
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,399
Moreover, the dancers
of the Music Office were used.

588
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,159
Your Majesty,

589
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,120
I won't dare make such a decision.

590
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,679
His Highness went to Nanjing

591
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,239
and couldn't wish you a happy birthday in person.

592
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,600
He ordered us to present the gift.

593
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,479
Your Majesty,

594
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:27,600
the Crown Prince instructed the Music Office
to prepare for the peony festival

595
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,919
to wish Your Majesty health

596
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,479
and eternal blessings.

597
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,760
The Crown Prince remembers
Your Majesty's birthday

598
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,959
and shows his filial piety from far away.

599
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,840
His sincerity is indeed exceptional.

600
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,639
Please do not blame them, Your Majesty.

601
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,360
Reward them.

602
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,879
Thank you, Your Majesty.

603
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,639
Your Majesty,

604
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,199
after learning that His Highness
wishes to host a peony festival,

605
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,199
the people in the Eastern Palace

606
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,520
took the initiative to take samples
from the Qiongyuan Court for drafting.

607
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,560
The original intention was to present
the peony painting at the peony festival

608
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,479
to wish Your Majesty a happy birthday.

609
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,159
Although you can't see the peony painting,

610
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,760
the peony silk flowers that the dancers wore

611
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,479
were made based on the peony painting
that everyone drew.

612
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Your Majesty,

613
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,679
the Crown Prince's Concubine is an honest person.

614
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,320
She doesn't take any credit for herself.

615
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,439
So,

616
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:47,120
the peony painting is everyone's hard work?

617
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:57,479
We wish Her Majesty a happy birthday.

618
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,199
Sit.

619
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,239
Your Majesty,

620
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,280
those are the female family members
of convicted officials.

621
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,520
They have not been released
because of their natural endowments.

622
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,959
His Majesty has already pardoned them,

623
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,360
but the Ministry of Rites is so perfunctory.

624
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,239
Verify this personally.

625
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,560
Those who are outwardly compliant
but inwardly unsubmissive

626
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,280
will be severely punished.

627
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:24,959
Yes.

628
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
(Zijin, I'll give instructions)

629
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,760
(based on what you said. Go ahead and do it.)

630
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,879
Noble Consort, why do you

631
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,560
invite me here?

632
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,959
Leave us.

633
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,159
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

634
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,280
What's this about?

635
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm young and ignorant

636
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,159
and was impolite.

637
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,719
I repeatedly offended Your Majesty.

638
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:15,879
Please forgive me.

639
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,040
Noble Consort Guo,

640
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,000
please get up.

641
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,520
Your Majesty,

642
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,639
I regret day and night.

643
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,159
If Your Majesty forgive me,

644
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:35,919
I'll shut the palace doors forever

645
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,679
and pray for Your Majesty all day long.

646
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,320
Why are you doing this?

647
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,320
Your Majesty.

648
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,919
I know

649
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,719
I am guilty.

650
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,520
I dare not hope for your forgiveness.

651
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,520
Yesterday, His Majesty admonished me

652
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,239
to beg you for your forgiveness

653
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,919
for my past arrogance.

654
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,000
Your Majesty,

655
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:06,080
please forgive me.

656
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:10,520
Help your mistress up quickly.

657
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:20,479
Your Majesty.

658
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,280
You are generous

659
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:26,280
and will not punish past wrongdoings.

660
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,879
Today is your birthday.

661
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,320
I would like to offer a glass of wine

662
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,679
to wish Your Majesty a happy birthday.

663
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,360
Your Majesty,

664
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,479
I'll drink first as a sign of respect.

665
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,520
Congratulations Your Majesty on your birthday.

666
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,399
This is annoying! Annoying!

667
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:24,560
Your Majesty.

668
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,120
Why is Your Majesty so angry?

669
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,239
That darn Li Shimian

670
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,120
insulted me ​​in public.

671
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,879
I'm so mad.

672
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,560
It's just a glass of wine

673
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,679
that she offered with goodwill.

674
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:42,479
You're overthinking this.

675
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,199
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

676
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:57,058
[Guang'an Gate]

677
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,000
Your Highness, what happened?

678
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,360
Those are imperial bodyguards.

679
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,879
Quick.

680
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,600
Quick, Imperial Physician Sheng.

681
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:30,800
Is grass growing out of your finger folds?

682
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,520
What's there to panic?

683
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,439
Imperial Physician Sheng, this way, please.

684
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:40,120
Eunuch Liu.

685
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,080
His Majesty woke up in good spirits

686
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,239
and handled major imperial court affairs.

687
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,280
Why did he suddenly fall sick

688
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,080
after going to Yongning Palace?

689
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,320
His Majesty requires rest
for his chronic illness.

690
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,800
No one should upset him.

691
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,120
At noon he was angered by Censor-in-Chief Li

692
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,560
and suffered from chest pain
and shortness of breath.

693
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,120
His complexion looks bad.

694
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,679
Let's not mention it anymore.

695
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,439
I have to hurry in and attend to him.

696
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,040
Go ahead.

697
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,719
Sir.
