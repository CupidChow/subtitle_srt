= Mr. Honesty =

19
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,100
= Episode 8 =

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,360
Sit.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
I prefer to stand.

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,920
Why?

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Lumbar...

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Lumbar disc herniation.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,280
Why did you call me Thanos?

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
I...

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,640
Because...

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
you’re

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
outstanding

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
but lonely.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
You’re handsome and capable.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
But will end up badly like Thanos?

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,920
Hmm.

34
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
Now I’m starting to

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
question your aesthetic judgment.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
Oh, right.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,480
I need you to...

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,520
Don’t come over.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,400
I need you to go out with me later.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I’m going to a modeling company.

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Xu Yiren,

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,120
are you alright?

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,760
I...

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
I really don’t feel very well.

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,000
Did you catch a cold?

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
You didn’t.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
I have a low-grade fever.

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,280
I...

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Wait a sec.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
I’m done for.

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,200
Forget about the rumors.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
I’ll probably lose my job as well.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,640
I’d better leave here.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Xu Yiren.

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Mr. Fang, I really...

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Go back to rest if you’re ill.

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
What am I scared of?

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
I have to check this anyway.

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
In the worst scenario,

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
I can pretend I’ve seen nothing.

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,920
The character can never tell a lie?

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,400
What a clever idea!

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
This is so funny!

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,560
The last story is boring.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,920
I stopped reading it halfway through.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,200
But this story is such a surprise!

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,380
= Little Witch =

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,640
Hello?

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Hello, Xia Di.

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,520
Did you see that?

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
See what?

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,440
I was sleeping just now.

74
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,800
Stop pretending.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,680
You know what?

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Your new comic strip

77
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,720
has received a very positive response.

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,800
The click-through rate and
the subscription rate are record-breaking.

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,640
Really?

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,800
It’s not bad.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
Not bad?

82
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,640
It’s marvelous.

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Honey,

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
listen to me.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
You should continue drawing it.

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,760
I’m waiting for more.

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,640
Don’t exceed the deadline, alright?

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,720
Ok.

89
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Great.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Hello, Xia Di.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
Hello, Yiren.

92
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
See you in the old place in 30 minutes.

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,520
Let’s eat hot pot and sing karaoke.

94
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,040
I have good news for you.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,800
I’m ill.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,480
I have to stay at home.

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
You’re ill?

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
What’s going on?

99
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
Thank you for making time to meet us.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,760
It was nice talking to you.

101
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,160
Don’t flatter me.

102
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Mr. Fang had to come here personally.

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I feel sorry.

104
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
We should’ve gone to visit you instead.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,200
Mr. Fang is well known for his talent.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,840
Hope we’ll have a good time working together.

107
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Of course.

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
That’s for sure.

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,880
Please stop here.

110
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,640
We’ll get going.

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,680
Ok.

112
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,440
Good bye.

113
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,080
Good bye.

114
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,640
How was it?

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
This is my first time meeting a client.

116
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,640
How was my performance?

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Didn’t I tell you

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,400
you are too noisy?

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,120
That’s because you barely

120
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,080
said anything.

121
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
We had awkward silences.

122
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,400
You know what?

123
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
If I didn’t talk that much,

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
they’d think we actually came here

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,320
to grieve for the dead.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,920
The Moon Bay Resort Project

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,880
is very avant-garde.

128
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
It embraces the idea of eco-environment,

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,800
which is a general trend in the industry.

130
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
I’m playing for keeps.

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,840
So, we have to

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,480
find the best modeling company.

133
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Chengxi Modeling

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,400
apparently doesn’t meet our requirements.

135
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
After we go back,

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,080
search the top 10 modeling companies in our city.

137
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,080
Take a look at their recent projects,

138
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,760
and make appointments with them asap.

139
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,920
Yes, sir.

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
Why is Yiren not here?

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,760
You always took her with you, didn’t you?

142
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
She’s ill.

143
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
I let her go back.

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
She’s ill?

145
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,160
Really?

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,200
She looked great when I saw her the morning.

147
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
She saw a ghost?

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
She didn’t.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
But it’s more horrible than seeing a ghost.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,080
Don’t you know rumors are fiercer than tigers?

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
What are you saying?

152
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
Don’t worry.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,120
I’m not ill actually.

154
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,680
That’s just an excuse.

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,000
I don’t understand.

156
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
I didn’t want to go out

157
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,520
with Fang Zhiyou,

158
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
so, I said I’m ill.

159
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,880
Now I can’t do anything

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,280
but stay at home.

161
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
I can’t go anywhere.

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,360
Are you kidding me?

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
He won’t know

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
even if you go out, alright?

165
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240
It’s not that simple.

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
Fang Zhiyou is not a fool.

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,320
I felt guilty every time I lied to him.

168
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,000
He saw through

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
my lies

170
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
every time.

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
So now,

172
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
I’d better stay at home.

173
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,600
I can feel a bit more at ease this way.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Have you heard about this idiom?

175
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Bury one’s head in the sand?

176
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,360
Alright.

177
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Then continue your act at home.

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
I’ll find someone else.

179
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,200
Bye-bye.

180
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,920
I’m sorry.

181
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,560
Bye-bye.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,360
You mean there’re rumors

183
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,560
about Xu Yiren and I in the company?

184
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Seriously?

185
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,400
You don’t know this?

186
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
I thought you were just playing it cool.

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,320
They said Xu Yiren

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,800
is here to seduce you.

189
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,000
They also said

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you and Ms. He quarreled with each other

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
because of Xu Yiren.

192
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Oh, right.

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
Some said

194
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
you bought a house for her,

195
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
and named it “love house”.

196
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,280
When did I buy a house for her?

197
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,720
These are rumors.

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,280
That’s what they said.

199
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,960
Do you know how hurtful

200
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,160
these rumors can be to Yiren?

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Trust me.

202
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
I didn’t say anything.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,840
I also told them

204
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,120
not to spread the rumors.

205
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,720
You know what?

206
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
Now in their eyes,

207
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,760
Xu Yiren has become

208
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,040
a calculating girl who can do anything

209
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,200
to move up.

210
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,480
Goddess?

211
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
What are you doing?

212
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,320
I’m

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
waiting for your command.

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,880
I’ll treat you to a big meal.

215
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,960
I’ll text you the address.

216
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Show up in 20 minutes,

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,160
or I’ll leave.

218
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,480
Ok.

219
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,640
No prob. No prob.

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,680
Brother,

221
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
I have an emergency.

222
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
I have to go.

223
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
We’re still working.

224
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
You should go back to the company

225
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
and collect info about the modeling companies.

226
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,680
Brother,

227
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
I saw Xu Yiren earlier this afternoon.

228
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,080
She looked very pale.

229
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,400
She was totally out of her mind..

230
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,680
Think about it.

231
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
She’s a weak girl.

232
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,280
But now everyone is saying

233
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,880
she’s a shameless gold digger.

234
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,840
Just imagine how sad

235
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
and helpless will she feel?

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
She needs someone to

237
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000
keep her company at a time like this.

238
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,520
And you, as the key figure in this story,

239
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,240
are you really willing to

240
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
let her suffer all this?

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Besides,

242
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,520
she took a sick leave today.

243
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Now she’s

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,040
all alone at home,

245
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,320
she’s very likely to overthink things

246
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,560
and become depressed.

247
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
It’d be really bad

248
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
if something happened to her.

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
Brother…

250
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
Shut up. Just leave.

251
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,040
Ok.

252
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
Be careful on the road.

253
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
Xu Yiren,

254
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,320
what are you thinking about?

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,920
You really want to

256
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,840
disappear from this world?

257
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,560
Xu Yiren.

258
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,920
No! No!

259
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
How come he came here suddenly?

260
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
Did he discover I was lying?

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Coming.

262
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,920
Wait a sec.

263
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,880
Coming.

264
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Mr. Fang?

265
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
What brings you here?

266
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I came to check on you.

267
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,920
Oh.

268
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,400
Are you feeling any better?

269
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
I’m slightly better.

270
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
I bought some medicines for you.

271
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,080
Black Chicken White Phoenix Pills,

272
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,960
Bezoar Detox Pills,

273
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
band-aids,

274
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,680
and eye drops?

275
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,960
Mr. Fang,

276
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
what’s the meaning of this?

277
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
I don't know what I should buy,

278
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
so, I bought several types of medicine.

279
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,720
Take the medicine first.

280
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,120
You’ve got hot water?

281
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
Mr. Fang,

282
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,760
actually...

283
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,880
actually...

284
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
I’m not ill.

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,280
That’s good.

286
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
You’re not angry?

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,040
I’m just disappointed.

288
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,320
Xia Di,

289
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,720
didn’t I tell you to go inside?

290
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,800
It’s so cold outside.

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
Then why were you so slow?

292
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,440
And why are you wearing a business suit?

293
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,200
It doesn’t look good on you.

294
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Let’s go inside first.

295
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,560
Ok.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,520
I said 20 minutes.

297
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,600
I’ve done my best.

298
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,480
I hurried here right after the call.

299
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,000
That’s how it is.

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

301
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,680
It’s just I don’t know

302
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
how to face others in the company.

303
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,200
And I don’t dare to walk with you.

304
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,200
I feel like others will gossip about me.

305
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,240
I...

306
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,800
Xu Yiren,

307
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
why do you care about

308
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,960
what others think of you so much?

309
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
No one can ignore that completely.

310
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
I can.

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
You’re not a human being.

312
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,880
What?

313
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,840
Nothing.

314
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I mean

315
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,480
I can’t live my life

316
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
the way I want to.

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,640
I can’t ignore

318
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
what others think of me.

319
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,200
Why can’t you?

320
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,400
Actually, this is also unfair to you.

321
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,960
Because of me,

322
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,400
you’re also being gossiped about.

323
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,640
So in order to stop the spread of rumors,

324
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,560
and prove there’s nothing between us,

325
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,760
we should keep a safe distance.

326
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
What’s safe distance?

327
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,800
So that

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,360
they won’t have chances to gossip about us.

329
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
What?

330
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
What feelings do you have?

331
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,360
What feelings?

332
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,240
Do you think there’s something between us?

333
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,720
Anyway,

334
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
as long as we’re innocent,

335
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,880
you can ignore what others would think.

336
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,760
Alright.

337
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
Don’t slack off again.

338
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,840
You want to quit?

339
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,520
Or you want to be fired?

340
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,400
I’ve got to go.

341
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,600
By the way,

342
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,760
don’t be late tomorrow.

343
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,200
How come it’s so hot?

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you insane?

345
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,240
It’s so cold.

346
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,280
That was scary!

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,720
I think that

348
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,320
you’re acting weird today.

349
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Why did you suddenly ask me to lunch?

350
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,880
Let me be frank,

351
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
a lot of people like my new comic strip.

352
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,840
The editor made a special call
to praise me today

353
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,000
and paid me for the first issue.

354
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,800
So,

355
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,760
all costs will be on me today.

356
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
Because I’m happy, you know?

357
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,520
Really?

358
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,920
Hmm.

359
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,760
What did I say?

360
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,920
Any comic strip you draw

361
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,240
will become a masterpiece!

362
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,640
Still not right.

363
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
Scientifically speaking,

364
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
I came to celebrate your success,

365
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,080
so, the costs should be on me.

366
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,880
How annoying you are!

367
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Money is meant to be spent.

368
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,760
Besides,

369
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,600
you’re an intern,

370
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,080
you can’t earn much.

371
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,880
No matter what,

372
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,400
I can earn more money than you.

373
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
I didn’t expect you to be so naggy.

374
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,080
You can go back now.

375
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,800
Don’t.

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,520
I’ll follow all your instructions.

377
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
That’s more like it.

378
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
But I really

379
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,040
don’t like your outfit.

380
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,640
How about this?

381
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I’ll buy you a new set of clothes.

382
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,680
Let’s go.

383
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,400
Come. Turn around.

384
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,720
Great.

385
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
It looks good on you.

386
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I’m a man.

387
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,600
Isn’t this color

388
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,120
too feminine?

389
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,080
This color looks great.

390
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,040
Who says men can’t wear pink clothes?

391
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,840
Clothes of highly saturated colors

392
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,600
are very popular this year.

393
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
By the way, your skin is light.

394
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
It won’t stand out on people with darker skin.

395
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
Are you sure?

396
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
Are you questioning my taste?

397
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,080
No. No.

398
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,920
I’m not.

399
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,840
That’s good.

400
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
This set then.

401
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
I’ll buy it for you.

402
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,120
Wait.

403
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Is this appropriate?

404
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,280
How can I

405
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
let you buy clothes for me?

406
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,960
Who said he will

407
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,760
follow my instructions today?

408
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,320
Besides,

409
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,200
I asked you out during your work hours.

410
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,720
Consider this my compensation for you.

411
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,200
Check out.

412
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,320
Hello,

413
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,280
that set of clothes.

414
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,760
Ok. Let me calculate the price.

415
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,360
Hmm..

416
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,760
1990 yuan in total.

417
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,600
I didn’t expect I can get a gift

418
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
from my goddess so quickly.

419
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,920
I’ll use my card.

420
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
But it seems she really thinks

421
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,200
I’m a poor guy.

422
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,680
What should I do?

423
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,440
I can’t cheat her like this.

424
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
No.

425
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,040
I have to find a chance to tell her.

426
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,160
Qiming!

427
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
Qiming, are you alright?

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,520
I told you

429
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
not to come.

430
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
Be careful.

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
You never practiced boxing.

432
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,040
You shouldn’t have come.

433
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
Thank you.

434
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
I don’t

435
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,360
have a talent for sports.

436
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,280
But my skin is thick.

437
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,480
It’s nothing.

438
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,040
Let me take a break.

439
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,520
I can do two more rounds.

440
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,440
Are you crazy?

441
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,960
Is this because of Fang Zhiyou again?

442
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,600
Don’t speak like you know me very well.

443
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
Besides Fang Zhiyou,

444
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,360
who else in this world

445
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,480
can disturb your mind like this?

446
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,960
Are there any persons

447
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,320
that are irreplaceable in this world?

448
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,720
Yes!

449
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,360
Really?

450
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,120
At least it’s true

451
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,080
to me.

452
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,880
I used to think so too.

453
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,560
I thought I’m irreplaceable

454
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,480
in Fang Zhiyou’s heart.

455
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,040
But now

456
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
I’m not sure about that.

457
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,520
What?

458
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
He fell in love with someone else?

459
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
Probably they’re not in love.

460
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,960
But there’s such a girl

461
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,880
who can always make Fang Zhiyou

462
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
break his principles.

463
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
I was never able to do so.

464
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
You weren’t able to,

465
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
or you never wanted to

466
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,760
break his principles?

467
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,280
In your eyes,

468
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,480
everything about Fang Zhiyou

469
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,680
is perfect.

470
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,400
So, you never wanted to change him.

471
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,080
You know what?

472
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
I used to make handicraft items when I was a kid.

473
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,160
No matter how nice it was,

474
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,720
my father would trample on it

475
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,880
and ask me to make a better one.

476
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,480
Since that time,

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I’ve known that

478
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,440
no matter what I do,

479
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,360
I’ll have to be the best one.

480
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,520
The person I like

481
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,320
also needs to be the best.

482
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
You’re too competitive.

483
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,800
I really feel bad

484
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,800
to see you like this.

485
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Feel bad?

486
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,920
You mean, for me?

487
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,920
I don’t need anyone’s sympathy.

488
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,880
If it’s something I want to do,

489
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
I’ll do my best to accomplish it.

490
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,240
No one can replace my place at Square & Circle,

491
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,640
or change the man that I love.

492
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,760
Do you like to visit resorts?

493
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,320
No.

494
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,680
I like to stay at home.

495
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,480
Is your company’s price

496
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,200
more competitive than other companies?

497
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,920
No.

498
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
We never sought to achieve a price advantage.

499
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,480
What do you think of this project?

500
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
I’m very attracted to

501
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,080
the concept of eco-environment.

502
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,520
So, we can’t bamboozle people with this concept.

503
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,440
We have to build an eco-resort

504
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
in the true sense.

505
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,520
Mr. Fang,

506
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,760
I want to remind you of one thing.

507
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,000
We’re simulating a conversation with the client.

508
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,160
If you talk like this,

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,960
there’s no way we’ll get the project.

510
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,760
Can’t you be a little more serious?

511
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,920
We’ve been practicing this entire morning.

512
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,120
No.

513
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
I mean

514
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
can you not be that serious?

515
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,160
You can gloss over some questions.

516
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,360
Xu Yiren,

517
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
am I being too nice to you?

518
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
Now you even dare to raise demands on me?

519
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,240
Then how about this?

520
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,400
You don’t have to talk

521
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,520
when you don’t want to.

522
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
You can just wink at me

523
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,480
and let me talk, ok?

524
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,800
I’ll try.

525
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,560
But that’s not a promise.

526
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,120
Ok.

527
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
Let’s move to the next session.

528
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,520
There’s more?

529
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
It’s the last session.

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
I’ll ask you some questions

531
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,600
of trivial importance.

532
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,720
You should give me

533
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,240
an opposite answer for each question.

534
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Let’s start then.

535
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,480
What color do you like?

536
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,240
Blue.

537
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,520
Whose songs do you like?

538
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,640
Any song that’s pleasant to hear.

539
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,160
Do you like to play games?

540
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
Give me an opposite answer.

541
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,960
Sometimes.

542
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
Do you think I’m pretty?

543
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,120
Yes.

544
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
You actually know the rule.

545
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,520
You’re indeed pretty today.

546
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
I think

547
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,320
you look

548
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
much prettier than before.

549
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
What’s this?

550
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,560
Do you know you’re actually hitting on me?

551
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,440
Hello?

552
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,800
It’s me,

553
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Li Zhe.

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,640
What’s the matter?

555
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,920
If I don’t call you,

556
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
I’m afraid you’ll forget your promise.

557
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, right,

558
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,600
I still owe you a meal.

559
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,400
Do you have time this evening?

560
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,760
Ok, this evening then.

561
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,600
Ok.

562
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,000
It’s decided then.

563
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,840
I’ll find a restaurant.

564
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,520
Ok. Ok.

565
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,080
See you this evening.

566
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,720
Bye-bye.

567
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,520
That’s it for today.

568
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,600
I’ll go back to work.

569
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,520
Ok.

570
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,880
Am I the only one

571
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,080
who thinks Xia Di is at her wit’s end?

572
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
Yes, you’re right.

573
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,080
You’re indeed the only one.

574
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,360
These trolls

575
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,160
are crazy.

576
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,840
They say I’m a paid poster?

577
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,760
Then I’ll show you the power of paid posters.

578
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Click the link I sent you,

579
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,000
and battle with those trolls!

580
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Log in to your account if you have one,

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
register one if you don't have.

582
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh, right.

583
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,200
Don’t forget

584
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,440
to leave a 5-star review for the comic.

585
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
I’ll treat you to a meal later.

586
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,480
Over.

587
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
Can’t you understand?

588
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,760
Suppress those negative reviews.

589
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,360
Understand?

590
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Don’t ask who drew it.

591
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,960
Just do it

592
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,560
if you’re my buddy.

593
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,320
Ok. Bye.

594
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
It’s great.

595
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,920
The meeting went very well.

596
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
You almost

597
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,520
lost control several times.

598
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Fortunately, we carried it off well.

599
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,120
The client is very happy.

600
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
Seems our minds

601
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,760
are more and more in sync now.

602
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,160
I couldn’t say what I wanted to say.

603
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,840
Instead, I had to say those empty words.

604
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,160
It’s really boring.

605
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,120
You’re right.

606
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,480
But that’s the reality.

607
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,040
Only by making the client happy

608
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
with those empty talks

609
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,360
can we get the project.

610
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,840
If there’s something

611
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,480
you didn’t get to say,

612
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,720
you can say it to me,

613
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,440
so that you can feel better.

614
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,120
The expression of a girl when she’s

615
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,600
talking over the phone can give her away.

616
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,000
Her face will be pale and bland

617
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,560
if she’s not interested in the other person.

618
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,040
But

619
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,080
if she’s beaming with joy,

620
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,040
it must be someone she’s interested.

621
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,440
Ok. Ok.

622
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,080
See you this evening.

623
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,760
Bye-bye.

624
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,080
Mr. Fang, be careful.

625
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,200
Are you alright?

626
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,080
What about you?

627
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,280
I’m fine.

628
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,440
Sorry.

629
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
I was distracted.

630
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,960
Mr. Fang, are you too tired?

631
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,920
No.

632
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,560
It’s just my mind wasn’t clear.

633
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,920
You must be tired then.

634
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,720
It’s my fault.

635
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
You told me to get a driving license long ago,

636
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,240
but I didn’t do it.

637
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,600
Otherwise, I can drive when you’re tired.

638
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,280
Don’t worry.

639
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,120
I’ll sign up for

640
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,240
the driving courses this weekend.

641
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,880
We’re here.

642
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

643
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,020
I’m leaving then.

644
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,740
Bye-bye.

645
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,460
Wait.

646
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,980
It’s all right.

647
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,520
Oh.

648
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Xu Yiren,

649
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
seems it’s going to rain today.

650
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,560
The... The weather forecast said that.

651
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,600
You...

652
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,840
Seems it’s true.

653
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,320
Did you bring...

654
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
Luckily, I’ve brought an umbrella.

655
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,720
Mr. Fang, drive safely.

656
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,320
Hmm.

657
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,280
Bye-bye.

658
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,160
Wait.

659
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,160
They said in the news that...

660
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
that...

661
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
a girl...

662
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,520
was robbed when taking an unlicensed taxi.

663
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,440
Don’t take an unlicensed taxi.

664
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Don’t worry.

665
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
I seldom took taxis.

666
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
I usually take a bus or the subway.

667
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh.

668
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,200
It’s ok then.

669
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,440
Ok.

670
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
Drive carefully.

671
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Sorry to

672
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,680
keep you waiting.

673
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,200
It’s fine. I just arrived.

674
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,240
Waitress.

675
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,640
Please take our order.

676
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,600
Here you are.

677
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,600
My god.

678
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,240
The food here is so expensive.

679
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,800
And the portions are so small.

680
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,080
I won’t be able to eat my fill today.

681
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,160
Seems I’ll spend a lot of money today.

682
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
My purse will become empty again.

683
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,440
Do you have any recommendations?

684
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Our lobsters are transported here

685
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,560
every morning by air.

686
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,360
They’re very fresh.

687
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,640
It’s our signature dish.

688
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,320
This dish

689
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
will cost me nearly half-month’s rent.

690
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,880
Please take a look.

691
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
I don’t want to eat seafood.

692
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
Ok.

693
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,880
Any other recommendations?

694
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,080
Then you can try this dish.

695
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,080
Right.

696
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
Smoked eel and foie gras.

697
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,760
How do you like this one?

698
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,240
Can’t she recommend some cheaper dishes?

699
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,000
I don’t eat animal organs.

700
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, ok.

701
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,720
I’ll order this one.

702
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,760
Truffle mushrooms pasta.

703
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,480
Ok.

704
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,480
The lobsters,

705
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,480
and wagyu beef.

706
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh no, no.

707
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,760
And this one.

708
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
Truffle mashed potatoes,

709
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,040
caviar.

710
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,760
Still not enough?

711
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,600
For the desserts,

712
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,840
a mousse cake.

713
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,760
Ok.

714
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,400
Also,

715
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
a bottle of your restaurant’s signature wine.

716
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,880
Ok.

717
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,520
Please wait.

718
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
This is daylight robbery.

719
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,320
All the money in my purse and cards

720
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,800
are not enough for this meal.

721
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,600
This meal is on me.

722
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
No, no, no.

723
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,240
We agreed that it’s my treat.

724
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,280
I chose this restaurant.

725
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,600
And I ordered my favorite dishes.

726
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
So, it should be on me.

727
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
If you want to treat me to a meal,

728
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,280
you should show some sincerity

729
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,680
and take me to a restaurant you like.

730
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,520
I know

731
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,320
you don’t want me to spend money.

732
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,800
Actually, I just want to find someone

733
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,680
to have a meal with me.

734
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,920
Thank you.

735
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,840
Does it have anything to do with me?

736
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,360
Why am I so curious?

737
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,880
Mr. Fang,

738
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,840
you said there’s a brake problem.

739
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,960
I just checked.

740
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,640
Probably the brake pads need to be changed.

741
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,840
But I need to disassemble the wheels first.

742
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,320
Besides,

743
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,040
there’s also a problem with the safety belt.

744
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
It’s no use guessing

745
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,680
what it is.

746
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,720
I have to ask her personally.

747
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,040
Do it.

748
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
In this case,

749
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
it’ll take us some time.

750
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,360
It’s fine.

751
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,440
I’ll come get it tomorrow.

752
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Don’t just eat.

753
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
Drink some wine.

754
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,680
This is Cabernet Sauvignon

755
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
made in a first-class winery.

756
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,320
Actually,

757
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,240
I don’t know whether it’s good or not.

758
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
You know a lot about wine?

759
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
Not really.

760
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
But I drank a lot.

761
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So, I know something about it.

762
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,560
I also

763
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
know something about bags.

764
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,400
That bag of yours

765
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
goes well with you.

766
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,360
You like this brand?

767
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,280
Actually, I don’t know much

768
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
about luxury brands.

769
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,760
It’s good enough as long as it’s handy.

770
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,960
It’s mainly because I can’t afford it.

771
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,360
If I can afford it,

772
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
probably I’ll also buy a lot.

773
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,600
Then this bag…?

774
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,840
My boss gave it to me.

775
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,600
Fang Zhiyou?

776
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,320
Hmm.

777
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
Fang Zhiyou

778
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
gave a purse to his assistant?

779
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,320
This is

780
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,480
a very rare scene.

781
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
You’re close friends?

782
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
No, no.

783
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,760
I’m just an employee in his company.

784
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
But it seems

785
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,320
you’re very familiar with him.

786
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,520
I’d never become familiar with him.

787
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,400
I haven’t chatted so happily in quite a while.

788
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,840
Me, too.

789
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,160
I’m very happy today.

790
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,000
Next time,

791
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,800
can I take you on a date?

792
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
On a date?

793
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,040
You mean having a meal with me?

794
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,280
I’m sorry.

795
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,120
I almost got it wrong.

796
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,280
No, you didn’t.

797
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
I mean date.

798
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,800
I like you.

799
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,240
I was in a hurry today.

800
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,480
Can I date you

801
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,600
in a more formal manner

802
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,320
next time?

803
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,960
There’s no need to feel pressure.

804
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,840
I’m a straightforward person.

805
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,520
We didn’t watch the movie last time,

806
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,160
can we watch a movie together next time?

807
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,720
If you don’t say no,

808
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,800
I’ll take it as a yes.

809
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,160
Mr. Fang?

810
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Mr. Fang,

811
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,720
how come you’re here?

812
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,800
He…

813
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,120
He…

814
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
It’s past office hours.

815
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,680
What?

816
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,280
Mr. Fang will even

817
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,760
interfere with your employee’s private life?

818
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
You know each other?

819
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes.

820
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,800
No.

821
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,920
I wish I’d never known him.

822
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,680
You’re dating?

823
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,320
Right.

824
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,120
No.

825
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Here’s the thing.

826
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,360
He picked up my purse last time.

827
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,400
So, I wanted to treat him to a meal to thank him.

828
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,880
You called me away last time.

829
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,760
So, this time...

830
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Does it have anything to do with you?

831
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,560
Aren’t you being a little too bossy?

832
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,480
I already told you.

833
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Come at me if you want to vent your anger.

834
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,160
Don’t target people who’re close to me.

835
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,680
What if I insist on doing this?

836
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,320
I’ll return it to you.

837
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,280
Mr. Fang?

838
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,360
Yiren,

839
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
let me send you home.

840
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,680
There’s no need.

841
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,600
I still have things to do.

842
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,640
You can go first.

843
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Good bye.

844
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,400
Mr. Fang, it’s raining.

845
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,640
Mr. Fang, it’s raining.

846
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,120
You shouldn’t have come with me.

847
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,680
My car is still in the repair shop.

848
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,200
I can’t send you home.

849
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
There’s no need.

850
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,960
But...

851
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,400
we need to find a place

852
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,240
to shelter from the rain first.

853
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Mr. Fang, are you alright?

854
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,760
No.

855
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
I’m very sad.

856
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
Because of Li Zhe?

857
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,640
He’s the son of Uncle Li

858
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,240
whom you met in the hospital.

859
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,240
He used to be my best friend.

860
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,200
We still need one more person.

861
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,000
I didn’t have many friends when I was a kid.

862
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,440
No classmates wanted to play with me.

863
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,920
Tales on 49 Paper Boats and 49 Paper Kites?

864
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,720
Give it back to me.

865
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
This is my book.

866
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
I’ll give it to you

867
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,120
if you tell me the stories in it.

868
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
You won't tell me?

869
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,240
Then let me tell you.

870
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,920
Tales on 49 Paper Boats and 49 Paper Kites.

871
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
Hey, look!

872
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,040
There’s a picture on Fang Zhiyou’s back.

873
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,600
Really?

874
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,720
Isn’t this a portrait of himself?

875
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
A little turtle.

876
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,920
Now see who’s the turtle!

877
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,880
Don’t fight. Don’t fight.

878
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,440
Take it.

879
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,080
Thank you.

880
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
Does it hurt?

881
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,720
It doesn’t.

882
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,240
Our teacher will have a talk with their parents.

883
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,640
Thank you.

884
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,800
You’re welcome.

885
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,880
You were so close before.

886
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,920
How come you became like this?

887
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,200
I remember that you once told me

888
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,600
Li Zhe’s family was ruined

889
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,960
because of a lie.

890
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,160
Did this lie

891
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,240
have anything to do with you?

892
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,200
I’m the reason

893
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,440
why he came back to China.

894
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,520
Oh, right,

895
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,160
How did you know each other?

896
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,520
It was a coincidence.

897
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,680
He picked up my purse.

898
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,000
No wonder.

899
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
He’s the son of Uncle Li.

900
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,480
So

901
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,600
he saw my purse in the hospital.

902
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you like him?

903
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,800
How could he change the topic

904
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
so sharply?

905
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,920
It’s so straightforward.

906
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
How am I supposed to answer it?

907
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,080
Judging from the way you look,

908
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,440
you like him.

909
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,080
I don’t.

910
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
I’ve known him for a very short time.

911
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,320
I’ve seen him

912
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,120
no more than...

913
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,280
As long as you don’t like him.

914
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
Mr. Fang,

915
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,600
do you mind very much if I like him?

916
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,360
Yes.

917
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
Why?

918
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,960
I don’t know.

919
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,240
I’m afraid you may get cheated.

920
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
Xu Yiren,

921
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,960
what are you expecting?

922
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,040
What?

923
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
I gave this to you.

924
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,520
It’s yours.

925
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,160
Do you still feel cold?

926
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,720
Not anymore.

927
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
When I was in college,

928
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I already knew that

929
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,080
a scarf is a great item to lift the mood.

930
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,320
No matter how cold it is,

931
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,520
how upset you feel,

932
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,960
as long as you put a scarf around your neck,

933
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,600
you’ll immediately become

934
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,640
full of energy.

935
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,240
What nonsense.

936
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,480
Let’s leave.

937
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
It’s still raining.

938
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,040
You have a scarf around your neck, alright?

939
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,760
But it’s raining heavily.

940
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,000
How about this?

941
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,360
Let’s rush out

942
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,680
on the count of three.

943
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,720
Hmm.

944
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,160
One,

945
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,680
two.

946
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,200
