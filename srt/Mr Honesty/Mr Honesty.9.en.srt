20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Mr. Li,

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
you were just caught in the rain.

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,880
Have a cup of ginger tea.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Or you may get a cold.

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Thank you.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
I’m wondering

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
why Fang Zhiyou

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
gave this key to you.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
I don’t know why either.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,920
It’s me.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
That private detective from Qingshan

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
said he has news for us.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,600
Tell him

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,320
we’ll go there

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,240
tomorrow morning.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Ok.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
We’ll go there tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
I checked the files in Qingshan Police Station.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
There’re no reports about missing girls

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,880
during that period 13 years ago.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Maybe

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,960
the parents found the girl

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,920
so they didn’t report the case.

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,760
Or maybe they reported the case,

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
but the data was not

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
entered into the computer.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,240
What about the officers who handled the case?

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I’ve asked.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,080
But it’s been so many years.

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
They couldn’t remember anything about it.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,160
Two officers handling the case back then

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,520
have been transferred to another city.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,160
I’m trying to get in touch with them.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,440
I’ll let you know immediately

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
if I find something.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,520
Why did you ask us here

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
since you didn’t find anything?

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,280
I’m not finished.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
Take a look at this.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
I researched all the elementary schools

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,400
within a 20 km radius of Qingshan.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Only three classes

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,480
of fifth graders once

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
went on an outing to Qingshan.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
These are their graduation photos.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,800
You can take a look

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
and see if you can find that girl.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
These children all look the same.

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
How can I recognize her?

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,080
I’ll take a closer look when I’m back.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
Please continue the investigation.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
As long as you can find her,

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
money won’t be a problem.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
Sure.

74
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
Don’t worry.

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,960
Let me know

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,880
if you recognize her in the photos.

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,760
Thank you.

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
The scenery in Qingshan is nice.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Now since you’re here,

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
do you want me to

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
show you around?

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
No need.

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
I can find this place

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,680
with my eyes closed.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Alright.

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
I’ll get going then.

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,240
I’ll let you know

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,120
if I have any news.

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,560
Brother,

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
you met that girl

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
in this place, right?

92
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,400
Hmm.

93
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,760
Help!

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,160
Help!

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Help!

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,240
I want Mom!

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
Teacher, where are you?

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Where are you?

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,040
I want Mom!

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Help!

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,680
Hey, little sister.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
What happened?

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,080
I can’t find the way home.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,200
I want Mom.

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
Don’t cry.

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
I’ll give this bird to you.

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
Stop crying, ok?

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
Stop crying.

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Didn’t you

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,480
ask her name back then?

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,320
I didn’t even expect

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,200
to see the sun of the next day.

113
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Seems this place

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
is full of unpleasant memories.

115
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,400
I think now I know

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
where this key belongs.

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,320
Brother,

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
whose house is this?

119
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,520
Wait for me here.

120
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,880
Dad!

121
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Mom!

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I’m back.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Today...

124
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,840
Dad!

125
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Mom!

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Mom, what happened?

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,080
Wake up!

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Dad!

129
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,280
Dad!

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
Dad, wake up!

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Dad!

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,920
Mom!

133
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,120
Dad!

134
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Mom!

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
I’m back!

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
I’m back!

137
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,040
Brother,

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
are you alright?

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,960
Mr. Fang.

140
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
I told you to make a coffee.

141
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,680
You were caught in the rain last night.

142
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
Probably you’ll get a cold.

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
It’s better to drink hot milk.

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
You didn’t look very well recently.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
You must be very tired.

146
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
No important matters are to be discussed

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,200
at the regular meeting later.

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
So I postponed it.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
No need.

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Um...

151
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,560
I’ll go swimming.

152
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,040
Call me in about one hour.

153
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,480
Ok.

154
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,360
Mr. Fang,

155
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,200
the milk...

156
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Didn’t I just drink it?

157
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
I’ll go back to work then.

158
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
Is it so funny?

159
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,100
= Square & Circle =

160
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,800
Wait for me here.

161
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,880
Where is Fang Zhiyou?

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,680
Why are you here?

163
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,640
He…

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
is...

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
What are you doing?

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,360
Mr. Fang,

167
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,320
I’m sorry.

168
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,640
Don’t move.

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,360
What are you doing?

170
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Mr. Fang,

171
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
I’m sorry.

172
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
I couldn’t stop him.

173
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,040
It’s fine.

174
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,840
You can leave now.

175
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,120
Ok.

176
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,800
Showing off your body?

177
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
Tell me,

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
how much is it?

179
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,040
I checked.

180
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,560
That villa

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,000
can sell for 4 million.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,160
Here’s 5 million!

183
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
I don’t want to owe you anything.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,360
Like you said,

185
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,840
I owe you a lot.

186
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,640
So I’m returning it to you.

187
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,600
But you owe me

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
more than a villa is worth.

189
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,080
Can you make it up to me?

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,800
You bought my family’s house,

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
and kept you and I’s

192
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,560
secret base,

193
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,320
so you think you can pretend

194
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
nothing has happened?

195
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,240
I never thought like that.

196
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,400
It’s just I didn’t know

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,480
what to do.

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
You didn’t know what to do?

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040
Let me tell you.

200
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,400
I’ll take away what you cherish most.

201
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,840
Square & Circle,

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,720
and Xu Yiren.

203
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,640
I told you

204
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,200
to stay away from her.

205
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,960
Starting today,

206
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
I’ll chase Xu Yiren officially.

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,920
I like her

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
more than you do.

209
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
I don’t like her.

210
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Yiren is back.

211
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Now,

212
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,160
tell us about it.

213
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
Tell us, Yiren.

214
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,240
Who is that man?

215
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Who is he?

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
He…

217
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,160
He’s Mr. Fang’s friend.

218
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,360
How’s that possible?

219
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Since when did Mr. Fang

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,160
have such a handsome friend?

221
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,280
No.

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,480
Mr. Fang never had a friend.

223
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,360
Right.

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
Don’t say that.

225
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,520
Mr. Fang is actually a very nice person.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,360
He’s not like what you said.

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,920
- A very nice person? - Right. Right.

228
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,080
He’s not like what we said.

229
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,400
You know what?

230
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Sha Sha, let me take a look

231
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,960
at the report

232
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,760
after you finish it.

233
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,360
Ok.

234
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,600
What do you want?

235
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,800
Will you believe it

236
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
if I say I came to see you,

237
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
and then I went to see Fang Zhiyou

238
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,320
since he’s here?

239
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,920
I was just kidding.

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,520
Let’s watch a move together tomorrow.

241
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,360
I’ll come pick you up after you finish work.

242
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:29,960
But tomorrow...

243
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,880
It’s decided then.

244
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,320
Bye-bye.

245
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,880
You!

246
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
Yiren,

247
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,000
the way I see it,

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,520
he’s not Mr. Fang’s friend.

249
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,520
He’s actually your friend, right?

250
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Go back to work.

251
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,520
Look into the Moon Bay Resort Project.

252
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
I need all the information about it.

253
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,320
The sooner, the better.

254
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Ok.

255
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,900
= Square & Circle =

256
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,820
= Cash cheque =

257
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,620
= Materials for the driving license exam =

258
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,240
Mr. Fang,

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,920
when I get the driving license,

260
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,080
I’ll drive you to a very faraway place.

261
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,040
And then,

262
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,040
I’ll get in the car and lock the doors

263
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,200
before you notice it,

264
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,200
so that you will be locked outside.

265
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,880
You’ll ask me to open the door,

266
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,640
but I won’t open it.

267
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,000
Then you’ll be like a cat on hot bricks.

268
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,000
Xu Yiren,

269
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
stop playing around.

270
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,520
Open the door,

271
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,280
or I’ll fire you.

272
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,560
Now we’re in the middle of nowhere.

273
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
If I leave you behind,

274
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,400
no one will help you no matter how loud you shout.

275
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,080
Don’t you know

276
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,840
there’s a thing called cellphone

277
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
in this world?

278
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,760
You can’t think clearly even when you’re dreaming.

279
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
I really pity you.

280
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,000
So I’ll open the door

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
for you

282
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,520
on one condition.

283
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,960
What condition?

284
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,400
You can’t dig at me anymore.

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
I’m also a woman.

286
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
I also have dignity.

287
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,800
I also care about face.

288
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,200
Ok.

289
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
I’ll consider it.

290
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,660
= Stinky tofu =

291
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,280
So stinky!

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
Mr. Fang.

293
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,840
Did you fart?

294
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,880
Who farted?

295
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
Mr. Fang?

296
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,600
Why are you still here?

297
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,560
You’re still here,

298
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,960
I wouldn’t dare leave.

299
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
Then leave now.

300
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,280
Finally I can get off work.

301
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Thank you for driving me home.

302
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
Don’t keep looking at me.

303
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,680
How do you know that when your eyes are closed?

304
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,360
That means

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
I guessed right.

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,160
How cunning!

307
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
Are you

308
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
still

309
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,280
in a bad mood?

310
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,640
I was just now.

311
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,280
Now I feel much better.

312
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,640
That means you’re still not very happy.

313
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
What are you trying to say?

314
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Are you hungry?

315
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,640
I’m hungry.

316
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,160
Let me treat you to a meal.

317
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,560
Come.

318
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,120
This is the place.

319
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Let’s sit here.

320
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,080
Sit down.

321
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,280
Take a look at the menu.

322
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,200
What do you want to eat?

323
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,040
This is the meal

324
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,400
you talked about?

325
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
What’s wrong with it?

326
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,360
Please take our order.

327
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,160
Coming.

328
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,320
What would you like to order?

329
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,960
10 lamb kebabs, 10 lamb tendon kebabs,

330
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,040
10 beef kebabs...

331
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
That’s all.

332
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,080
And a coke.

333
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,560
Ok.

334
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
Please wait.

335
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,760
Enjoy.

336
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you.

337
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,560
Can you eat so many kebabs?

338
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
It’s not that many.

339
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,680
Xia Di and I usually ordered more.

340
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,880
Eat up.

341
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,960
Try it.

342
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,120
Yum!

343
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,320
Come on, eat.

344
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,440
Try this.

345
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,560
This is my favorite.

346
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,480
Give it a try.

347
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
It’s very delicious.

348
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,520
What are these?

349
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
They’re soft bones.

350
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,920
The knees

351
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,960
of the chickens.

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,800
This part.

353
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,400
So tasty.

354
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,400
And these are...

355
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,360
Alright, enough.

356
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,400
I don’t want to know.

357
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,840
You can eat yourself.

358
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,560
Why are you laughing?

359
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,320
So you have never

360
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
eaten kebabs in these places before?

361
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,120
My mom said these kebabs are dirty.

362
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,800
She never let Shiyu and I eat any.

363
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,360
But I ate a lot.

364
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,240
There was a food street

365
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,800
near my school.

366
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,480
Every day after the school was over,

367
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,680
I’d go there and stay there

368
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,520
till very late.

369
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,240
Seems you’ve liked eating since young.

370
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
Right.

371
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
But,

372
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,240
I didn’t just go there for food.

373
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,200
I also wanted to be around people.

374
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,120
I didn’t want to go home.

375
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,400
You didn’t want to go home?

376
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,080
Hmm.

377
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,680
Your uncle and aunt didn’t treat you well?

378
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Not that.

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,720
They treated me well.

380
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
Eat some.

381
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,240
I told you

382
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,800
not to lie to me.

383
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,440
Then do you know

384
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
why I lied to you?

385
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Do you want to tell me?

386
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,280
If you want to tell me,

387
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I’ll listen to it.

388
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,600
Yiren,

389
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,720
guess what I’ve bought for you.

390
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,560
A teddy bear!

391
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,040
Do you like it?

392
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,720
Yes.

393
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,400
This is mine.

394
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,280
I’ll play with it myself.

395
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,080
Qing,

396
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
I bought it for Yiren.

397
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
You already have many toys.

398
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Give it to me.

399
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,440
This is the one I like most.

400
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,760
Be good, Qing.

401
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
I’ll tell Mom.

402
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,600
How can you be like this?

403
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
Yiren,

404
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,240
let your sister get her way.

405
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,480
I’ll buy you

406
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
a new one another day.

407
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,520
Uncle,

408
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
I really don’t like teddy bears.

409
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,120
Let my sister have it.

410
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,000
You’re so good, Yiren.

411
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,280
Tell me,

412
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,560
who broke

413
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,760
the glass?

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,080
It’s Xu Yiren.

415
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,080
It’s not me.

416
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,000
Yiren,

417
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,760
it’s fine you broke the glass,

418
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,600
but you can’t lie to me.

419
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Qing, come to me.

420
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,800
Look at you.

421
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,800
Sine you broke it,

422
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
why don’t you just admit it?

423
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,440
Aunt,

424
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,840
it really wasn’t me.

425
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,080
Where did you learn these bad habits?

426
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,360
Will your sister lie to me?

427
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,080
She’s a good girl.

428
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,080
Sorry, Aunt.

429
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,400
It wasn’t on purpose.

430
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,480
Look at you.

431
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
If I didn’t get mad at you,

432
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,400
you still wouldn’t admit it, right?

433
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,040
This concerns your morality.

434
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,360
So,

435
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,680
no one likes to lie.

436
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,640
It’s just it can be hard to accept the result.

437
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,840
I’m not trying to defend myself.

438
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,920
You’re actually right.

439
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,520
No excuses can change the fact that

440
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,480
a lie is a lie.

441
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,160
Let me help you.

442
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,720
Help me with what?

443
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,440
We can’t change

444
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
what already happened.

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,240
But we can change the future,

446
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,160
as long as this is what you want.

447
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,360
You can say it out

448
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,920
if you don’t like something,

449
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,120
you can cry if you want to cry,

450
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,400
you can laugh

451
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840
if you want to laugh,

452
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,120
you don’t have to pretend to be someone else

453
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
to please others.

454
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,120
You’re who you are.

455
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,400
You’re the only one you can be.

456
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
I’m supposed to comfort you, right?

457
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,880
How come you’re comforting me now?

458
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
I never knew how to comfort others.

459
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
I really hope

460
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
you can be yourself.

461
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,520
I don’t know if I can do it.

462
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,640
But I’m willing to try.

463
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,600
Can you give it a try, too?

464
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,600
Take it yourself.

465
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,680
Xu Yiren,

466
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,080
we can’t change

467
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
what already happened.

468
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,760
But we can change the future,

469
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
as long as this is what you want.

470
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,280
You can cry if you want to cry,

471
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,600
you can laugh if you want to laugh,

472
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
you can say it out

473
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,520
if you don’t like something,

474
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,360
you don’t need to pretend

475
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,680
to be someone else to please others.

476
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,320
You’re who you are.

477
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,440

just say what you want to say.

484
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
What are you afraid of?

485
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,760
Does it really matter

486
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,320
whether they like you or not?

487
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,600

you don’t want to buy breakfast for her every day,

503
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,840
What is he busy with?

504
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
How about

505
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,160
I give him a call to ask for instructions?

506
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,480
Why isn’t he picking up?

507
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,520
Xu Yiren.

508
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,280
Why are you here?

509
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,200
I’ve been waiting for you.

510
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,360
I thought you forgot it.

511
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,920
Forgot what?

512
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,400
We’ll watch a movie together.

513
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,080
Sorry, I really forgot.

514
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Alright.

515
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
Then do you

516
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,360
have time today?

517
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,800
I...

518
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,280
I’ve already bought the tickets.

519
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
I still have work to do.

520
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
How about

521
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,400
we go there next time?

522
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,160
Is it because Fang Zhiyou

523
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,440
forbids you to see me?

524
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,440
What are you talking about?

525
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
He’s not such a person.

526
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,000
Then is it because you like him,

527
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,320
you don’t want him to see us together?

528
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,440
Not that.

529
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,440
Fine.

530
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,440
Since you’ve bought the tickets,

531
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,040
let’s get going then.

532
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,640
Ok.

533
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,480
Get in.

534
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,560
Let me buy you something to drink.

535
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,840
Miss, two cups of Sprite.

536
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,560
Ok.

537
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
Did you watch the movie

538
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
just now?

539
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
My eyes were basically closed

540
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,120
throughout the movie.

541
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
You must’ve been

542
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,920
very busy recently.

543
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
It’s all right.

544
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,400
You’re working on the resort project.

545
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,840
You must’ve been very busy.

546
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,040
How is the project going?

547
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,080
You’re very well-informed.

548
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,720
This project is still kept confidential.

549
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,800
But you already got wind of it.

550
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,160
It’s a small circle, you know.

551
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,400
How about this?

552
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,040
After this period,

553
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,560
let me take you to a ski resort.

554
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,520
My friend runs it.

555
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,760
I’m sure you’ll like it very much.

556
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,960
So,

557
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,360
when will you

558
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,600
finish this project?

559
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
You said

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,080
I am

561
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,320
your type of girl.

562
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Is it true?

563
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,920
Hmm.

564
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,760
Maybe you won’t believe it.

565
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,440
Actually, I tend to

566
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,920
tell small lies sometimes.

567
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,880
So I can tell it directly

568
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
when others lie to me.

569
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,640
I know

570
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,960
I’m average-looking.

571
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,240
So I didn’t really take it seriously

572
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,160
when you said you like me.

573
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,680
I don’t know

574
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,920
what personal vendetta you have against Mr. Fang.

575
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,000
And I’m not going to ask you to let it go.

576
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,760
Most importantly,

577
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,920
I don’t want to get involved in this.

578
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
So I won’t tell you anything

579
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,240
about the resort project.

580
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,040
There’s one more thing.

581
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,960
I can be very unreasonable sometimes.

582
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,760
Even if I learn

583
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,600
what happened

584
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,840
between you two,

585
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,720
even if I know it’s Fang Zhiyou’s fault,

586
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
I’ll take his side

587
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
without any hesitation.

588
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,400
I don’t like to owe others anything.

589
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,360
Thank you for the movie ticket.

590
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,760
The drink is on me.

591
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,760
She saw through me so quickly?

592
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
This is so nerve-wracking.

593
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,560
I spoke so straightforwardly,

594
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,440
will he get angry?

595
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,120
Fine, whatever.

596
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,840
He’s such a scheming guy!

597
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
I forgot to ask for the change.

598
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,280
But acting cool is more important.

599
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,420
= Thanos Fang =

600
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,880
Hello, Mr. Fang?

601
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,480
Xu Yiren.

602
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,520
Mr. Fang,

603
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,960
what’s the matter?

604
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
What do you need?

605
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh, right.

606
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
I called you just now.

607
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,040
Mr. Fang, are you ok?

608
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,920
Mr. Fang,

609
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,760
where are you now?

610
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Home.

611
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,800
Wait for me.

612
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,880
I’ll be right there.

613
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Mr. Fang.

614
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Mr. Fang.

615
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
What took you so long?

616
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
Mr. Fang,

617
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,320
are you alright?

618
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
Your voice didn’t sound right just now.

619
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,000
Did you get a cold?

620
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you having a fever?

621
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,400
Look at you.

622
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
You didn’t look very well yesterday.

623
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
But you said you’re fine.

624
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
And now you’re having a fever.

625
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,720
Have you got antipyretics at home?

626
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,720
I’ll have a look around.

627
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,440
No, wait.

628
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,480
It’s cold and comfortable.

629
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Mr. Fang,

630
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,560
my...

631
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,600
my arm is getting numb.

632
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,000
Then…

633
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,600
use the other hand.

634
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,080
Oh.

635
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,600
I don’t know

636
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,480
what personal vendetta you have against Mr. Fang.

637
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,000
And I’m not going to ask you to let it go.

638
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,840
Even if I learn

639
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,880
what happened

640
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
between you two,

641
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,960
even if I know it’s Fang Zhiyou’s fault,

642
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
I’ll take his side

643
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,680
without any hesitation.

644
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,660
= Xu Yiren’s profile =

645
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,800
It’s too bad that

646
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,320
you met Fang Zhiyou ahead of me.

647
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,960
Where are you?

648
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,840
Hmm.

649
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,880
Based on my experience,

650
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
when you get a cold, you can recover in a week

651
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,640
if you take medicine.

652
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
But if you don’t,

653
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,600
you’ll recover in a week, too.

654
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,840
So why bother taking medicine?

655
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,040
What nonsense.

656
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,240
Just take the medicine.

657
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,560
Have some water.

658
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,560
You should have a rest.

659
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,240
Maybe you’ll get a lot better after you wake up.

660
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,600
Where are you going?

661
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,600
I’ll go check if I can find anything

662
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,480
in the refrigerator,

663
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
so that I can cook something for you.

664
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
Have you eaten anything today?

665
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,440
You need to eat, or you’ll lose your strength.

666
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,600
Li Zhe,

667
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,280
is it you?

668
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Fang Zhiyou,

669
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,160
from now on,

670
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,720
we’re no longer friends.

671
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,200
I hate you.

672
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,680
Li Zhe, wait for me!

673
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,920
Wait for me, Li Zhe!

674
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,480
Wait for me!

675
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,720
You’re awake?

676
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,120
Do you feel any better?

677
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,560
Why...

678
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
are you looking at me?

679
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,360
You reminded me

680
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,680
of my mom just now.

681
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,320
Mr. Fang,

682
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,920
can you...

683
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,840
promise me one thing?

684
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,560
You don’t have to praise me

685
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
if you don’t know how to.

686
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,800
Never mind.

687
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,600
Forget it.

688
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,360
Ok.

689
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,160
I promise you.

690
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,720
I think the fever has gone down.

691
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,640
You sweat a lot just now.

692
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
You can take a shower and get changed.

693
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,840
The porridge is almost done.

694
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
I’ll ladle out some for you.

695
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,240
You’ve been here all the time?
