What brings you here?

21
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,800
After Fang Zhiyou hurt you,

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
you’re here drinking and watching Chaplin.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
Who said he hurt me?

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,360
Everyone could tell that.

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,520
He’s all you see and care about.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
All these years,

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,240
you’ve been helping him behind his back.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
You support

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,640
all his decisions.

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
How noble!

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,520
And what did I get?

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
Even you,

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,200
his former best friend, know that,

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
but he doesn’t.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
You fell out with your father

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
in order to work with him independently.

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,880
Everyone in this circle witnessed your sacrifice.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
I guess

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
he must be blind.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Otherwise,

41
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
how could he not see that?

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
He’s...

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
leaving you hanging on purpose.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
He’s using your feelings

45
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
to his advantage.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,560
Your youth and sacrifice

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
mean less to him

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,720
than that new girl Xu Yiren.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
Is that fair to you?

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,800
You failed to win Xu Yiren over, didn’t you?

51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,520
What’s your point?

52
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,280
This is just a piece of advice.

53
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,440
We can work together

54
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,920
to show Fang Zhiyou

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,960
that some people can’t be messed with.

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Sorry.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,360
You’re barking up the wrong tree.

58
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
You’ll come back to me.

59
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Am I really seeing this?

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,920
The latest Yamaha R6?

61
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,960
I heard they’d produce

62
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,840
two low-emission retro bikes

63
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,560
but I didn’t expect they’d be out so soon.

64
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,360
I even dreamed of sitting on one.

65
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,640
Your dream has come true.

66
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,440
Go

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,160
put on your helmet.

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
Let’s go for a spin.

69
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Really?

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Give me a minute.

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
Xia Di, slow down.

72
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,000
Easy.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
It’s too fast!

74
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,840
Hold me tight.

75
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,760
Ride slowly!

76
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Slow down.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Be careful.

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Xia Di,

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
I have something to tell you.

80
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
I owe you an apology.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
I’m sorry.

82
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,880
I lied to you.

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,040
Well,

84
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,760
I didn’t mean to

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,640
and I never thought I’d come clean

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,440
at this moment,

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
but...

88
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,800
I can’t go on with it.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
I’m not a poor student.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
I’m rich,

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,520
super rich,

92
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,840
super-duper rich.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,080
I know I’m not strong.

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
I’m younger than you

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,280
and immature,

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,440
but my pocket is deep.

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,200
I can make full use of that sole advantage

98
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
to meet all your needs.

99
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,240
To prove my sincerity,

100
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,320
look,

101
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,080
that bike is yours.

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,040
Don’t worry.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I have more at home.

104
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,120
You can take that

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
if you like.

106
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
Why did you hit me?

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,800
You brat!

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Liar!

109
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,600
I confessed

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,520
and said I’m sorry.

111
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
You’re good, Gu Bo!

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,200
How much is the daily rental?

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
I can take it?

114
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,840
You’re a lousy actor.

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,040
Just drop it.

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes.

117
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
Last time,

118
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,280
I did raise

119
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,840
tons of absurd requirements,

120
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
but that was to make you quit.

121
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Who’d know

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,400
you’d pretend to be rich?

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,880
No,

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
Xia Di, I’m not pretending.

125
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,800
I’m serious.

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
I am rich.

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Fine.

128
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
If so,

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
then everything you said and did before

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,120
was all a lie.

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,960
I hate liars the most.

132
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,600
Lie to me once,

133
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
unfriend you on WeChat.

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Lie to me twice,

135
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
unfriend you forever.

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,960
Farewell.

137
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes, yes, yes.

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,200
You’re right, princess.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,640
I’m not rich.

140
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,400
I acted like it.

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
Don’t unfriend me.

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,440
I don’t want you to reject me.

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
Xia Di,

144
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,520
I really like you

145
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,400
whether I have money or not

146
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,320
or you love money or not.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
I’m sorry.

148
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Why?

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,680
Love isn’t about money.

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,840
It’s not your problem.

151
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,160
It’s mine.

152
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,160
I don’t want to date

153
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,960
someone younger than me.

154
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,240
If it’s OK,

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,280
I’ll still treat you as my younger brother.

00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,120
only acts

177
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,560
like a child

178
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,840
in front of his mother.

179
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Good to see you, Mrs. Fang.

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
I’m Xu Yiren.

181
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
I work with your son

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,280
as his assistant.

183
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Fang Zhiyou is sweet

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,480
and talented.

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,240
Don’t worry.

186
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
I’ll take good care of him.

187
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,640
What are you doing?

188
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
You’ve gone too far.

189
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,600
You don’t want to talk to your sister, either?

190
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,520
I did the best I could.

191
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,240
I was busy this morning,

192
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,920
so I came at this hour.

193
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,280
What now?

194
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
You don’t want

195
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,040
to see your father?

196
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,840
Hello, Mr. Fang.

197
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,360
Is that

198
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
small workshop of yours still open?

199
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,560
Back then,

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
He Yuliang appreciated you so much

201
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
that he’d appoint you

202
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Director of Design,

203
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
but you turned it down.

204
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,520
Look at his company.

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,800
It’s huge.

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,360
And look at yours.

207
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,040
My company

208
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
is none of your business.

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,760
Don’t say that.

210
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,400
I ran into the head of Huanyu.

211
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,240
He said you can join his company

212
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,800
whenever you want.

213
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,680
I won’t.

214
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,400
Why are you wasting time on that small business?

215
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Mr. Fang,

216
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,680
Square & Circle is like Fang Zhiyou’s child.

217
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,840
Our projects

218
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,080
have gained recognition in the industry.

219
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,080
Also, we’re taking on

220
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
major ones like the Moon Bay Resort.

221
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
You can come by our office some day.

222
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
I’m talking to my son.

223
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,360
You’re a stranger.

224
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,720
Stay out of it.

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,880
She’s not a stranger.

226
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
She’s my girlfriend.

227
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Girlfriend?

228
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,680
She’s nothing but an assistant.

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,560
What do you know about her?

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,560
You know me the least

231
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,320
in the world.

232
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,760
How come a person has zero sense of shame

233
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,480
after telling so many lies?

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,560
Come here.

235
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,040
Mom,

236
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
we’re here to visit you.

237
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,880
Look at me.

238
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,440
Am I taller and prettier?

239
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,760
Zhiyou used to call me shortie.

240
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,360
He’s wrong.

241
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,000
I’m your daughter.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
You were an angel.

243
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
And so am I.

244
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,520
Well, mom,

245
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,920
something is troubling me lately.

246
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
Your husband

247
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,400
still means not what he says

248
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,760
even at this age.

249
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
You know

250
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,760
he said

251
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,080
he couldn’t come until now because he was busy.

252
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,560
But actually, he meant to catch up with your son.

253
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,480
When they met,

254
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
he gave your son attitude

255
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,800
and pissed him off.

256
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,280
I don’t know what he was thinking.

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,440
Kiddo,

258
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
what are you saying?

259
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,800
Dad,

260
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,120
next time, when you see my brother,

261
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,040
can you

262
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,480
be nice to him.

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,800
We’re a family.

264
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Don’t create tension.

265
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,120
You know how hard is it to be stuck in the middle?

266
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,240
You brat!

267
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,520
You always take his side.

268
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,440
Didn’t you see

269
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
how bad he was to me?

270
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,600
I’m his father.

271
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,960
He...

272
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,640
He hates liars

273
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,400
and poseurs the most, doesn’t he?

274
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
Alright. Fine.

275
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
Do whatever you want.

276
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
I’m out of it.

277
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,880
Bow.

278
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,280
Look how beautiful this place is!

279
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,360
Cheer up, will you?

280
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
I’m sorry

281
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,560
you had to take that.

282
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,800
No worries.

283
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
It’s nothing.

284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,440
I just feel bad for you.

285
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,960
You’re his son.

286
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
That will never change.

287
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,800
I mean,

288
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,360
that incident was a long time ago.

289
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,080
But I can’t forgive him.

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,960
Whenever I think of Li Zhe,

291
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,480
his deceased mother

292
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,920
and sick father,

293
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,000
and all that

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,960
was caused by his lies,

295
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
how could I face him?

296
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,040
He’s never changed.

297
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,960
Since I was little,

298
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,200
he’s never kept his promise.

299
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,840
To be honest,

300
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
I hate myself even more

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
for believing his lies.

302
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,680
He destroyed our family.

303
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
What’s gone is gone.

304
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
I can tell

305
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,560
that you’re longing for a home.

306
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Have you ever considered

307
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,000
burying the hatchet?

308
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,280
Of course.

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,840
I’m dying

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
to get my best friend back

311
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,800
but I know it’ll never happen.

312
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,720
Why?

313
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,480
Li Zhe

314
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,520
wants to bring justice to his parents.

315
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
If my father

316
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
apologizes to him and his family,

317
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,200
maybe they’ll forgive him.

318
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,280
But he values

319
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
his pride the most.

320
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,440
It’s impossible

321
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,920
for him to apologize.

322
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,760
When I was little,

323
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,920
I thought losing my favorite toy

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
was bad enough.

325
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
But now, I’ve realized

326
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,040
in the adult world,

327
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,440
life could be so much worse.

328
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,600
Being caught between your best friend

329
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,960
and your father

330
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
must be tough.

331
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,080
Hey,

332
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,840
you said you want to give me a gift, right?

333
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I want it now.

334
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Is that so?

335
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,240
Yiren that I know doesn’t like gifts.

336
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,480
You’re asking for one right now?

337
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,280
Will you give it to me or not?

338
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,520
You name it

339
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
and I’ll get it for you.

340
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,040
Promise?

341
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,720
Let’s go.

342
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,400
This place is fantastic!

343
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Having a meal here

344
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
brightens up my day.

345
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,280
Didn’t you say your boss yelled at you?

346
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,880
So

347
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
do you feel better now?

348
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,200
Thank you, Li Zhe,

349
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
for doing this.

350
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,040
No worries.

351
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,840
I need to eat, too.

352
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,840
Since I came here,

353
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,720
this is the first time

354
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,000
that others have asked me out.

355
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,160
Whenever I’m free,

356
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,800
we can go out like this again.

357
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,320
Sure.

358
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,760
Hey,

359
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,320
about that bird you mentioned last time,

360
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,440
I remember it.

361
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,520
Back then,

362
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,120
in the fifth grade,

363
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,720
we had a spring outing in the Qing Mountain.

364
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,240
I got lost.

365
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,960
Luckily, a boy found me

366
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,760
and took me to the police station.

367
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
He gave me that bird.

368
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,600
Didn’t you say

369
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,560
you forgot

370
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,680
and didn’t remember it?

371
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
I didn’t,

372
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,120
so I asked my mom

373
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,320
and she told me that.

374
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
Her words

375
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,760
reminded me of a few fragments

376
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,360
but they’re vague.

377
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I wish

378
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I knew

379
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,120
where that boy was

380
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,480
so that I could

381
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,600
thank him in person.

382
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,720
Without him,

383
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
I wouldn’t be able to sit here

384
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,640
and dine with you.

385
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,880
What’s wrong, Li Zhe?

386
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
Why aren’t you eating?

387
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
All good?

388
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,160
Let me see.

389
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
Nice!

390
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,120
I...

391
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,320
I look ridiculous.

392
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,360
No, you’re not.

393
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
You’re adorable.

394
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
When Fang Shiyu was handing out fliers,

395
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I was picturing you

396
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,960
in this kind of PJ’s.

397
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
You’re cuter than I thought.

398
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
So back in that time,

399
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,080
you started to fantasize about me in PJ’s.

400
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,680
Xu Yiren,

401
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,840
you’re a bad girl.

402
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,800
Knock it off.

403
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,360
If I was fantasizing about anything,

404
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,920
it was you in Speedos

405
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,440
showing off your eight-pack.

406
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
What could I see under this thick suit?

407
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,200
What do you want to see?

408
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,680
Tell me.

409
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,960
Nothing.

410
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,680
Tell me about it.

411
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
Maybe I can satisfy you.

412
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
Stop it.

413
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,680
You asked me

414
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,600
to buy you a birthday gift,

415
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,560
and this is what you want?

416
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,840
Pajamas?

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,680
What are you implying,

418
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,520
Xu Yiren?

419
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,360
What are you thinking?

420
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,560
Like any healthy man would think.

421
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,160
You’re feeling blue,

422
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,120
so I’m cheering you up.

423
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
Now, you’re teasing me.

424
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,080
I know

425
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,520
you want me to be happy.

426
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,400
It’s simple.

427
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,520
There’s an easy way.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Just let me hold you like this.

429
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,320
Let me ask you something.

430
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,440
What will a male dinosaur and a female dinosaur

431
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,840
give birth to?

432
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,880
A baby dinosaur.

433
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Wrong!

434
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
It’s an egg.

435
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,440
Dinosaurs lay eggs.

436
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
Egg?

437
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
Shouldn’t it be a baby?

438
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,600
What do you want to eat for dinner?

439
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,560
Anything will do.

440
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
What’s this?

441
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
My treasure.

442
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,800
It was at my uncle’s.

443
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,640
Yu Qing gave it to me earlier.

444
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,600
Let me see.

445
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
This bird

446
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,040
looks familiar.

447
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Really?

448
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
How come?

449
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,560
My savior gave it to me.

450
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,800
Your savior?

451
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,480
Yeah.

452
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,960
Wake up.

453
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,880
Wake up.

454
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
Don’t sleep.

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
The police station is right ahead.

456
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,400
Go there yourself

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
and tell the policeman

458
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,840
that you got lost

459
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,000
and you’re looking for your parents.

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,640
Got it?

461
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,240
Yeah.

462
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,280
Go ahead.

463
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
Who brought you here?

464
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
A boy older than me.

465
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,320
Where is he?

466
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,640
He was right here.

467
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
What’s your name?

468
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,120
Xu Yiren.

469
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Alright.

470
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,120
Come inside with me.

471
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,840
What’s wrong?

472
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,160
Something just came to me.

473
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,360
When Li Zhe was little,

474
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,040
he loved using paper and wicker

475
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,320
to weave animals.

476
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,720
Almost all of them.

477
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
I dared him

478
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
to weave anything

479
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,240
I drew.

480
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,960
I think

481
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,680
I drew this one.

482
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
What?

483
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,880
Are you saying

484
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,360
Li Zhe is that boy?

485
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
How could it be?

486
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,440
Your description

487
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
fits Li Zhe.

488
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
You said you got lost in the Qing Mountain.

489
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
He has

490
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,040
a villa there.

491
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
I went there when I was little.

492
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,520
And you were in the fifth grade then?

493
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,400
Yes.

494
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,840
That was

495
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,560
when his family was in trouble.

496
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,560
Do you remember any details?

497
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,560
For example, what he was wearing,

498
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,200
or what he said to you?

499
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,000
What he said?

500
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,280
He...

501
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh, right,

502
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,720
when I was on his back,

503
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,680
he told me a fairy tale.

504
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,360
About...

505
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
kites and boats and whatnot.

506
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
A squirrel and a bear are best friends.

507
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,520
The squirrel lives in the mountain

508
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,080
while the bear lives at the foot.

509
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,400
How did you know that?

510
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,280
49 Kites and 49 Boats.

511
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,200
That’s our favorite story.

512
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
Was that really Li Zhe?

513
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,360
Should I ask him about it?

514
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,200
Will Fang Zhiyou be unhappy?

515
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Where are you going?

516
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Instead of staying here and guessing around,

517
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
let’s go ask him.

518
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,760
Thanks for driving me back.

519
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,560
We can have dinner at my place.

520
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,800
No, thanks.

521
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,280
I don’t want to trouble your parents.

522
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,960
No trouble at all.

523
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
I told my mom about it before leaving.

524
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,640
She must be

525
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,120
cooking a big meal as we speak.

526
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,160
If you don’t come,

527
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
it’ll go to waste.

528
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
Eat with us, OK?

529
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,760
Don’t disappoint my mom.

530
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,920
Fine.

531
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,520
Your parents are too kind.

532
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,320
Yes?

533
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,600
Li Zhe, it’s me.

534
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,480
You got a minute?

535
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Can we meet now?

536
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,560
I’m going to your aunt’s.

537
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,520
We can meet there.

538
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,200
Xu Yiren called you?

539
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,880
What was it about?

540
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
She didn’t say

541
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
and only asked to see me.

542
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,600
Go ahead.

543
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
I’m waiting for you inside.

544
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,720
You aren’t going with me?

545
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,080
My presence

546
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,120
will probably annoy him.

547
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,800
Alright.

548
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,840
I’ll be right back.

549
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Just come back

550
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
after you have the answer.

551
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,640
Don’t say too much about the childhood

552
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,560
in case he gets upset.

553
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,320
Sure.

554
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,440
Got it.

555
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,960
Will you...

556
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,400
get jealous?

557
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,240
A little bit.

558
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,920
Only a little bit?

559
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Well, I won’t be back in a few hours.

560
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,520
No.

561
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,360
You only have one hour.

562
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Because...

563
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,160
I haven’t had dinner.

564
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
I’ll be quick.

565
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,520
Then we can go grab a bite.

566
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,320
Your treat.

567
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,880
Fine.

568
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,240
Bye.

569
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,960
Make it quick.

570
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,240
Cuz.

571
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,720
Li Zhe.

572
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,920
Yiren,

573
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,360
why did you take my stuff again

574
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,560
before checking with me?

575
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,280
Li Zhe,

576
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,480
you can go upstairs.

577
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,400
I’d like to have a word with Yiren.

578
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,560
What’s up?

579
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,520
What’s wrong?

580
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
I like Li Zhe.

581
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,440
What?

582
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
I said I like him.

583
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,200
I already know

584
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
what happened when you two were little.

585
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,240
Now, Li Zhe believes

586
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,000
I’m that girl he met.

587
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,000
I hope

588
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
you won’t tell him the truth.

589
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,880
He’s really that boy?

590
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,160
Cuz,

591
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,520
I’ve always let you have your way,

592
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,400
but

593
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
not this time.

594
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,240
Why?

595
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,320
You already have a boyfriend.

596
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,160
Why are you still clinging on to Li Zhe?

597
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,400
How did you know that?

598
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,760
I saw you guys when working in the mall.

599
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,360
I didn’t tell my parents, though.

600
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,600
You know,

601
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,360
if they find out that you lie to them,

602
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,000
especially to my mom,

603
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,600
they’ll be furious.

604
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,680
I didn’t mean to hide it from them.

605
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,080
It’s just I’m not ready

606
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,040
to tell them yet.

607
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Whatever.

608
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,560
Anyway,

609
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,640
I kept your secret.

610
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,280
Shouldn’t you do this for me in return?

611
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,200
They aren’t the same thing.

612
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
How are they not?

613
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
People lie

614
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
for all sorts of reasons

615
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,880
but still,

616
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
a lie is a lie.

617
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,760
No one is better than others.

618
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,160
You lied to your family

619
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
for love.

620
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
Why can’t I?

621
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
But that experience

622
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
is special to me.

623
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,680
I can give you anything else.

624
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,880
But...

625
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I got it.

626
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,880
In your eyes,

627
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,880
my parents and I

628
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,360
are never your family, right?

629
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,160
You’ve never seen me as your cousin.

630
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,480
That’s alright.

631
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,760
My life is never easy.

632
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to support my family.

633
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,080
How do I deserve

634
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
a man like Li Zhe?

635
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,240
I didn’t mean that.

636
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,880
There, there.

637
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
How do I deserve to love anyone?

638
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,720
If Li Zhe finds out that I lied to him,

639
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,320
he’ll despise me even more.

640
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,280
Please, Yiren,

641
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,240
just do me one more favor,

642
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
Yiren!

643
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,080
Cuz,

644
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,920
I...

645
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,720
What’s wrong?

646
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,360
Nothing.

647
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,680
I thought I lost it.

648
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,160
Turns out, Yiren took it.

649
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
Thank god, it’s back.

650
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,920
Yiren,

651
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
I can give you anything

652
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
but not this.

653
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
It means a lot to me.

654
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Yiren,

655
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,440
you asked to see me earlier.

656
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,520
Is everything OK?

657
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,560
I...

658
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
I came

659
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,080
to ask you to forgive Fang Zhiyou’s father.

660
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,760
Is that why you’re here?

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Yes.

662
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
I want him and his father

663
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
to make peace.

664
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,400
At least,

665
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,360
you should forgive Fang Zhiyou.

666
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,200
He doesn’t get along well with his father.

667
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,080
Why should I help him?

668
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
You know

669
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,040
it’s not his fault.

670
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
You said

671
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,040
what happened between you two isn’t my concern.

672
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,360
What happened between me and him

673
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
isn’t your concern, either.

674
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,240
I understand.

675
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,760
I’m sorry.

676
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
I shouldn’t have come.

677
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,600
Let’s go.

678
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,520
All done?

679
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Is it him?

680
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
- No. - No?

681
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,040
How come?

682
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,720
Let me go ask him.

683
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,080
Don’t.

684
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Why?

685
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
Let’s call it a day.

686
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,320
I got it wrong.

687
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
Don’t bring it up again.

688
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
Did you tell another lie?

689
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
How am I supposed to believe you?

690
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,920
I have to ask him myself.

691
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,200
Forget about it.

692
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Let’s go home.

693
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,720
Don’t go.

694
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,040
Let her go!

695
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,200
Uncle?

696
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Who are you?

697
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
What are you doing here?

698
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Why are you

699
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
harassing my niece?

700
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Is he harassing you?

701
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,120
No.

702
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,440
Uncle, you mistook it.

703
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,720
I’m her boyfriend.

704
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,120
Who’s your uncle?

705
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,920
Don’t I know my niece

706
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
is seeing someone or not?

707
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,240
Un...

708
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
I...

709
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,200
Yiren,

710
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,000
what’s happening?

711
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,200
You said you’re single.

712
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,600
You...

713
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Uncle,

714
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,720
I...

715
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
I...

716
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,200
So

717
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,320
you didn’t tell them?

718
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,200
I...

719
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,280
I thought

720
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,240
we could change for each other.

721
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,880
Guess I was wrong.

722
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
Fang Zhiyou.

723
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
Fang Zhiyou.

724
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,160
Yiren,

725
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
who is that?

726
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,520
Did I...

727
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,040
Hey,

728
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
you’re here already.

729
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Li Zhe has come.

730
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,320
I just went to buy wine.

731
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Let’s go upstairs.

732
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
No, thanks.

733
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,840
I’m needed elsewhere.

734
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,080
See you.

735
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,120
You...

736
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,040
Gu Bo,

737
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,440
pour me a glass of water.

738
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
Oh, right,

739
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,080
it’s just me alone at home.

740
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,520
Gu Bo?

741
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,160
What brings you here?

742
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,840
Why ask?

743
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
You don’t want to see me?

744
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,360
You thought it was Gu Bo?

745
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,640
No.

746
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,000
Come.

747
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,720
Come on in.

748
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
She likes me.

749
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,840
She likes me not.

750
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,920
She likes me.

751
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
She likes me not.

752
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,680
Yes.

753
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,080
No.

754
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,400
Yes.

755
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,720
No.

756
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,080
Yes.

757
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,400
No.

758
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,760
Yes.

759
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,040
No.

760
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,720
Yes.

761
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:51,580
= Why my girlfriend refused to
introduce me to her family =

762
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,300
= She’s also seeing someone else.
She’s ashamed of you. You aren’t her match. =

763
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,640
I don’t think so.

764
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,320
I can’t help you this time.

765
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,400
Were I Fang Zhiyou,

766
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,600
I’d be mad too.

767
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,000
Look at you two.

768
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,880
I understand that you keep it from your coworkers.

769
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,240
But he’s taken you to see his family.

770
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,320
How could you hide him from yours?

771
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,920
I know

772
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
I made a mistake

773
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,960
but I just can’t.

774
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
I... I always

775
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,760
feel inferior to him.

776
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,280
To be honest,

777
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
he’s so much better than me

778
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,760
in many ways.

779
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,960
I have no idea

780
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,760
how long we’ll be together.

781
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,360
I’m not even sure

782
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,240
if he’ll still like me tomorrow.

783
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,000
I guess

784
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,640
Li Zhe is right.

785
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
I dare not tell others

786
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,720
we’re in a relationship

787
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
because

788
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,000
we may break up someday.

789
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,040
Why is it so hard

790
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,840
to start a relationship in reality?

791
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,560
You don’t like the one who likes you.

792
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,880
The one you like doesn’t like you.

793
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,800
Finally, when the feelings are mutual,

794
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,480
either your backgrounds don’t match

795
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,040
or it’s your age.

796
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,800
It’s so much easier in comics.

797
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,320
I can do whatever I want.

798
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,080
Fang Zhiyou aside,

799
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,040
what about Yu Qing?

800
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,080
Xi Yiren,

801
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,440
you could give her what money can buy,

802
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,360
but experience and memories too?

803
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,280
You gave her your life!

804
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
How can you prove who you are?

805
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,040
With your ID?

806
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,000
But she cried.

807
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,000
She had never cried in front of me.

808
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,840
To achieve her goal,

809
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,040
a few drops of tears are nothing.

810
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,600
Think it over.

811
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,920
Soon after she came,

812
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,600
she’s been so close to Li Zhe.

813
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,480
She must have laid eyes on him long ago.

814
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,680
I didn’t tell the truth

815
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,320
not just because of her.

816
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,520
Then what else?

817
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,800
On my way to see Li Zhe,

818
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,040
I was torn.

819
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,040
If he really

820
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,680
was that boy,

821
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,280
then the relationship among the three of us

822
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,480
would be a complete mess.

823
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,320
Gosh!

824
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,440
You must have Stockholm Syndrome.

825
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,000
You’ve been bullied by Yu Qing for so long

826
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
that you can’t fight back.

827
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Aren’t we avengers?

828
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,400
There’s just me alone.

829
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,160
I know

830
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,920
you’re the best.

831
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,600
I don’t need an ID

832
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,120
because I have you.

833
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,600
I must have owed you in my previous life.

834
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,480
What happened to Mr. Fang?

835
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
He always wears a long face,

836
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,960
but today, it’s longer.

837
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,160
Oh my,

838
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,760
he must have woken up

839
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
on the wrong side of the bed

840
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
and he looks

841
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,320
so terrifying.

842
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
I feel

843
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,640
the temperature has dropped

844
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,800
by 10 degrees

845
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,440
since he came in.

846
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
Someone must have stepped on his nerves.

847
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,000
Right, Yiren?

848
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,960
I suppose.

849
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
What a temper!

850
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,360
Ms. He,

851
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,800
there you are.

852
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,240
Mr. Fang doesn’t seem to be in a good mood.

853
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,440
Maybe you should go check on him.

854
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,920
I’m here for the Moon Bay Project Meeting.

855
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Other things

856
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560
aren’t my concerns.

857
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,360
I see.

858
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,600
Gosh,

859
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,240
Mr. Fang and Ms. He still haven’t made up?

860
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,760
Both of them

861
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,320
are in a bad mood.

862
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,080
Fingers crossed!

863
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,040
What was that?

864
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,080
Almost scared me to death.

865
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,520
Mr. Fang,

866
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,480
the client

867
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,560
is satisfied with the first draft of Moon Bay.

868
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,680
Still, we need to make

869
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,800
a few alterations.

870
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,440
This is a summary

871
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,800
of the feedback.

872
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,280
I didn’t go home last night

873
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
because I went to Xia Di’s

874
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,880
