What do you mean fan?

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,040
A zealot isn’t a fan.

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,000
When I see him again,

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I’ll punch him and send him to jail.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Didn’t you say

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
you were a taekwondo master?

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
Why didn’t you punch him?

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,960
I was freaked out.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,680
I didn’t know

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
I could meet such a psychopath.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,440
That was a real visual shock.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Or I could have kicked him away.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Does it still hurt?

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,840
It’s no big deal.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
It’s a mark of glory.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,560
Look.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
It’s great to have a boyfriend, isn’t it?

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
When it was urgent,

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,040
I helped to get rid of junk.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
I...

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
I was just kidding.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
Don’t get angry.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
If I can’t be your boyfriend,

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
I can be your bodyguard.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Or shall I learn taekwondo from now on?

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Be a master.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
Or shall I

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
learn kickboxing?

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Or shall I

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
learn Thai boxing, too?

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
I’ll defeat more bad guys.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,040
What does that mean?

52
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,560
Nothing.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,040
You were too noisy.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
I just shut you up.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Shut me?

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
What?

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,280
You were cheating.

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
You took advantage of me.

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
No. No.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You kissed me, anyway.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
You must be responsible.

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,440
You can’t cheat on me.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
I wasn’t noticing.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
Do it again.

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
What are you laughing at?

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,320
If you don’t kiss me, I’ll keep nagging.

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,040
You have to shut me up again.

68
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,960
Otherwise,

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800

You can’t regret.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
Sorry.

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Because of me,

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
you’re aggrieved.

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,560
Why are you apologizing?

I don’t feel aggrieved.

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
It’s not until today that I know

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,600
what a life you were living when you were little.

94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,680
I can hardly imagine

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
how you lived your life.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
It’s okay.

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
I’m used to that.

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,840
Why are we

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
comforting each other?

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
Yeah.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
What’s done is done.

102
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,080
Let’s go.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,680
Yiren.

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
I want to talk with you.

105
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you have time?

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Go ahead.

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
Shouldn’t we talk privately?

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,440
Why is he coming with us?

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
Spoils the fun.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
What do you want to talk about? Go ahead.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,280
How are you doing lately?

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
Does he bully you?

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,680
I’m fine.

114
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
And we’re good, too.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Fine, then.

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
I’m done.

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
No more question.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,400
Don’t you have anything to ask me?

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,920
Are you serious with Yu Qing?

120
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,400
Why do you ask?

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Jealous?

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,320
Don’t get me wrong.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
I just want to tell you.

125
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
If you really like her,

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,000
treat her seriously.

127
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,320
If it’s only because

128
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,520
she’s the girl you looked for,

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
you’d better think more carefully about it.

130
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Don’t give her hope

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,200
and let her down.

132
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
Do you know

133
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,640
why I showed up in that place that year?

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Mom.

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Mom, what happened?

136
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,280
Dad.

137
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
Dad, wake up!

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
Help!

139
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,800
Help!

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,200
Help!

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,560
Help!

142
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Help!

143
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,000
Help!

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,200
That day,

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
if I hadn’t met Yu Qing,

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I...

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
would have died.

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,200
She said I saved her.

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
In fact,

150
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
she saved me.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Li Zhe wanted to kill himself?

152
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,440
So, the moment when I met Yu Qing

153
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,200
matters a lot to me.

154
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
I am

155
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
grateful to her.

156
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,640
Sorry, I didn’t know that.

157
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Luckily, everything is gone.

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
No one knows that.

159
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,600
I have told no one about it.

160
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
Sometimes, I force myself

161
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,080
to forget the girl.

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,320
It works a bit.

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
She’s getting blurred

164
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
in my mind.

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
When I found her,

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,480
she was a little different from

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,640
what she was in my memory.

168
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Do you think

169
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,280
she’s the girl?

170
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,640
Should I tell him the truth?

171
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,760
If he finds out

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Yu Qing isn’t the girl,

173
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
will he have a great shock?

174
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
But if I tell him,

175
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,200
Yu Qing will hate me.

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
It’s been years.

177
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
People always change.

178
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,720
But I believe.

179
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Wherever the girl is,

180
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,160
she will wish you.

181
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,040
Wish happiness and friendship

182
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,480
would always stay with you

183
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
like 49 boats

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,080
and 49 kites.

185
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,000
I have something else to say.

186
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
I know you don’t want to listen.

187
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
But I insist.

188
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
You and Fang Zhiyou

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,560
shouldn’t be getting on like this.

190
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Stop taking senseless avenge.

191
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Let 49 kites

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,360
fly in the sky.

193
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
And let 49 boats

194
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,640
float in the rivulet.

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
It will be great.

196
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,440
Done?

197
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Mm.

198
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,840
Let’s go.

199
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Little girl.

200
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,040
Let me tell you a story.

201
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,120
Once upon a time,

202
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,400
there were a little squirrel and a little bear.

203
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,080
They were good friends.

204
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,240
The squirrel lived on the top of the mountain

205
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,840
while the little bear lived at the foot.

206
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
A rivulet ran in front of the mountain,

207
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
from where the squirrel lived

208
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
to where the little bear lived.

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
Later, they quarreled

210
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
because of this.

211
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,760
In the end,

212
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,680
did they make up?

213
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
The little squirrel

214
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,960
made a paper boat.

215
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,040
It said,

216
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,040
fly a kite

217
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,840
if you want to make up.

218
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
Then the little bear

219
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
flew a kite.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
It said,

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
wish happiness and friendship

222
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
would always stay with you

223
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
like kites and boats.

224
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,500
= Quotation for Moon Bay Project =

225
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,340
= Salle De Surveillance Video =

226
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,460
= Email sent =
The quotations were sent.

227
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,400
I’ve done all I could.

228
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,720
It’s your showtime.

229
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,520
= Xu Yiren =
Hope you won’t let me down.

230
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
What did you and Li Zhe talk about?

231
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,280
I thought you didn’t care.

232
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
You looked like you didn’t care at all.

233
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
I’m regretting.

234
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,600
Do you remember

235
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,040
the half of the story book in my office?

236
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,040
What?

237
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,200
Li Zhe keeps the other half.

238
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
You each keep a half?

239
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,160
When I saw it

240
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,080
in your office,

241
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
I wondered

242
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,680
why the other half was missing.

243
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
Just now,

244
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,600
I saw the looks he had

245
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,720
when he stared at the story book.

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
You’re not going to

247
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
tear me into halves, are you?

248
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
What are you thinking of?

249
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
I told you.

250
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,720
I can give Li Zhe whatever he wants,

251
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,120
except you.

252
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
That’s more like it.

253
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,720
So,

254
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,960
what did you talk about?

255
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
I wanted to him to let go of the hatred.

256
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,800
You two

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
care for each other.

258
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,080
Why do you torture each other?

259
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
It’s too hard for him.

260
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,480
Over the years,

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
hating me is the only impetus for him.

262
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,240
Do all handsome men

263
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,280
feel so narcissistic?

264
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,960
I’ll take it as compliment.

265
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,520
What are you sighing for?

266
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
When I think about it,

267
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
the fate

268
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,120
is kind of fantastic.

269
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,080
I met Li Zhe before you.

270
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,600
But now I’m yours.

271
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,960
Well,

272
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,680
it was a good thing

273
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
when I didn’t recognize Li Zhe.

274
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,640
Otherwise, I would have been in a dilemma

275
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
between you and him.

276
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
Why?

277
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,440
Even if he met you before me,

278
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,000
you’re doomed to be my girlfriend.

279
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
So narcissistic?

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,320
Why?

281
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,640
Why?

282
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
Why do you think?

283
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,720
Why?

284
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
All right. All right.

285
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,480
I’m wrong.

286
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,840
I’m wrong. I’m wrong.

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
That’s right.

288
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Once upon a time,

289
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,680
there were a little squirrel and a little bear.

290
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,360
They were good friends.

291
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
The squirrel lived on the top of the mountain

292
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,280
while the little bear lived at the foot.

293
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
A rivulet ran in front of the mountain,

294
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,960
from where the squirrel lived

295
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,600
to where the little bear lived.

296
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,400
Later, they quarreled

297
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
because of this.

298
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
In the end,

299
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,080
did they make up?

300
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
Why did you know the story?

301
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Which one of you is the girl?

302
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,240
Well, I’m home.

303
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,000
Be careful on your way back.

304
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,400
It’s not late.

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,760
Why don’t we take another round?

306
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,200
We’ve taken three rounds already.

307
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,400
After all the trouble,

308
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,640
I’m finally your boyfriend.

309
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I don’t want to leave you.

310
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Do I find a boyfriend

311
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,360
or a clingy boy?

312
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,400
Whatever, as you wish.

313
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,840
Do you know why people break up after showing off?

314
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,880
Why?

315
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,640
Because love is as sweet as ice-cream.

316
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,360
The slower you eat it,

317
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,760
the more you’ll enjoy.

318
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,920
If you finish it with a few bites,

319
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,320
nothing will be left.

320
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,560
I see.

321
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,440
I’m leaving right away.

322
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,840
Wait.

323
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,000
You did a good job today.

324
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,680
Come up and have a rest.

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,280
I just learnt to cook biscuits.

326
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
If you aren’t scared of being poisoned,

327
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,800
have a try.

328
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,640
I’m not even scared of freaks.

329
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
Why would I fear to be poisoned?

330
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,000
Anyway, if I’m scared of death,

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,640
how can I be your boyfriend?

332
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
You’re always honey-lipped.

333
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,920
Go.

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
Are these biscuits

335
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
the chocolate flavor?

336
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,040
All right, don’t try to make me happy.

337
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,280
They’re burnt.

338
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
I’m not used to cooking.

339
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,640
Why do you still eat it?

340
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
Spit it out.

341
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,920
My girlfriend made the biscuits.

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
I love them even if they’re burnt.

343
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,680
Don’t they taste bad?

344
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh, too bitter.

345
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,480
Gu Bo, you lost your taste, didn’t you?

346
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,520
After the bitter comes the sweet.

347
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,280
Look.

348
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,040
Bitter.

349
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Sweet.

350
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Xia Di.

351
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
Since we’re in a relationship,

352
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,560
I guess

353
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
I have something to tell you.

354
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,200
What is it?

355
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,640
Wait a second.

356
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,640
Are you going to tell me you have a girlfriend

357
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,680
and I’m the other woman?

358
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,600
I swear

359
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,520
I’m loyal to you.

360
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,760
You’re my first love.

361
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,120
And that was my first kiss.

362
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,760
Tell me.

363
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,920
What is it?

364
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Well,

365
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,560
I’m not a...

366
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Excuse me.

367
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,360
I can do it.

368
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,520
Gu Bo, you can do it.

369
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
What?

370
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
Little Witch called.

371
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
Asked for manuscript?

372
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,680
Not really.

373
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
I told you.

374
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,040
The click rate of Mr. Honesty kept falling.

375
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,280
Little Witch said

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,160
the love story I wrote wasn’t sweet enough.

377
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
After all the trouble,

378
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
the click rate went up.

379
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,200
Then she said the leading man changed.

380
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,720
A man who never lies

381
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,440
is cheating the leading lady.

382
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
It’s so hard to satisfy the readers.

383
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,480
I said we should respect fans.

384
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
But we can’t always be obedient

385
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,040
and take all their advice.

386
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
The leading man starts to lie?

387
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,440
Not really.

388
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,680
White lies. They’re all right.

389
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Sure.

390
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
Personally, I don’t like man to lie.

391
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
If you realize

392
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,440
a man is lying,

393
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,400
what will you do?

394
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,320
No man

395
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,480
has managed to leave safely

396
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,640
after lying to me.

397
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,600
Oh,

398
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
what were you trying to say?

399
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
You’re not a what?

400
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,800
I...

401
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,960
I’m not...

402
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,240
I...

403
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,480
I’m not a fickle man.

404
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Since I kissed you,

405
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
I would be responsible.

406
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,440
Keep eating the biscuits.

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
Where’s Fang Zhiyou?

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,240
- Fang Zhiyou. - Sorry.

409
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,680
Where’s Fang Zhiyou?

410
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,440
- You can’t do this. - Get him out.

411
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,280
Fang Zhiyou.

412
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Get Fang Zhiyou out.

413
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,520
Hurry.

414
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,400
He must explain to me clearly.

415
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,040
Yes.

416
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,040
Or we won’t leave.

417
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Explain to us.

418
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,200
What’s happening, Dou Mi?

419
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,840
We want to see Fang Zhiyou.

420
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Dou Mi, call security.

421
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,280
Security?

422
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,240
Ms. He, aren’t you?

423
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,840
I’m with Hongtu.

424
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,120
We met at the bidding meeting.

425
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,680
Oh, Mr. Jiang?

426
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,880
What do you mean?

427
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
What do we mean?

428
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
I want to ask what you mean.

429
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,160
Yeah.

430
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,520
According to reliable Intel,

431
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,280
Jiaye has got

432
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,080
the quotations of us three companies.

433
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,680
Impossible.

434
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,920
Why not?

435
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
It’s the truth.

436
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Mr. Xie with Jiaye told us after he was drunk.

437
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
And he told us our quotations clearly.

438
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,600
Don’t waste your time on her.

439
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,800
Get Fang Zhiyou out.

440
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,760
He must explain to us.

441
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,480
Yes. Get Fang Zhiyou out.

442
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,120
Everybody.

443
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,080
Listen to me, okay?

444
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
We’re not sure

445
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,640
what has happened.

446
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,040
If there’s any problem,

447
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,480
we’ll check on it

448
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,640
and explain to you.

449
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
Calm down, will you?

450
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,000
- How can we calm down? - Well.

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
Dou Mi.

452
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
Take them to the meeting room.

453
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,640
Get Fang Zhiyou out.

454
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Yes.

455
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,560
Fang Zhiyou.

456
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,480
- Fang Zhiyou. - I’m going to get Fang Zhiyou out.

457
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:10,960
Fang Zhiyou, come out!

458
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,680
Okay?

459
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,600
Don’t bother.

460
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Fang Zhiyou.

461
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,760
We’re looking for you.

462
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,880
We think highly of

463
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,440
the reputation of your company

464
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,480
and we attended the bidding

465
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,800
for this project.

466
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Since you decided to give it to Jiaye,

467
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,880
why did you ask us to attend it?

468
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,760
Making fun of us?

469
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,400
Yeah.

470
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,160
Everybody,

471
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,560
there must be some misunderstanding.

472
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,840
I promise

473
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,120
I will explain to you

474
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,640
after we figure it out.

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
Fang Zhiyou.

476
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
We don’t mean to suspect you.

477
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
But this is very clear.

478
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,040
No one except you

479
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,960
has the quotations of three companies.

480
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,200
Who else could have done that?

481
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,840
Ms. He.

482
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,000
Look.

483
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
Still pretending?

484
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
I asked Luo Yang to check it.

485
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,000
Their quotations

486
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
were leaked from our company.

487
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
They got the IP address.

488
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
Who?

489
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,120
Xu Yiren.

490
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,320
I don’t believe she did that.

491
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,360
But only she knew

492
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,160
the quotations,

493
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
besides us.

494
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,720
All right.

495
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,600
I know.

496
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,520
Everybody,

497
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
the problem has happened.

498
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
After we figure it out,

499
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,920
we’ll take measures.

500
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,400
What do you think?

501
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Okay.

502
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
We’ll trust you

503
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,600
for this time.

504
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,120
Let’s go.

505
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,800
Okay.

506
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,400
Go.

507
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,560
Mr. Fang.

508
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,280
What happened

509
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,240
has damaged our reputation.

510
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,400
What do you think we should do?

511
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
What else can we do?

512
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,320
Xu Yiren.

513
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
You were going too far.

514
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,520
You pretended so well.

515
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,600
Come on.

516
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
I thought

517
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
you were a good woman.

518
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Liu.

519
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,480
It wasn’t me.

520
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
It was your IP address.

521
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,680
The email was sent

522
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,600
through your computer, too.

523
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,320
Ever if it was my IP address

524
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,160
and the email was sent through my computer,

525
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
did I really do that?

526
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
Am I so stupid that

527
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,040
I sent the email through my own computer?

528
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Mr. Fang.

529
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,920
If you still show partiality for Xu Yiren,

530
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,920
I can’t stay.

531
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,320
I didn’t do that.

532
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
I’m not going to show partiality for anyone.

533
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,360
But we haven’t figured it out yet.

534
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I don’t want you

535
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,840
to suspect each other.

536
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,520
Mr. Fang.

537
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,760
It had such a bad influence.

538
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,640
Anyway,

539
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
you should explain to our staffs and suppliers.

540
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,840
And I guess

541
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
Mr. Liu makes sense.

542
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,000
Xu Yiren is...

543
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,960
I said,

544
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,720
I’m not going to fire anyone

545
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,160
before we figure everything out.

546
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Fang.

547
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,800
You’re showing partiality for Xu Yiren.

548
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
Whatever.

549
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
But I’m telling you seriously.

550
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
Today,

551
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,000
even if anyone else of you is suspected

552
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,640
instead of Xu Yiren,

553
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
I won’t fire you either

554
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,800
before I figure everything out.

555
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
If you’re in my shoes,

556
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,080
do you think I’m doing right?

557
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,400
All right.

558
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
I’ll figure out

559
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,640
what has happened

560
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
and give you an explanation.

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
Dismiss.

562
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,960
Mr. Li.

563
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Mr. Xie, there you are.

564
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
Mr. Li.

565
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,480
You guessed it correctly.

566
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
This morning,

567
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,560
these guys made a scene in Square & Circle.

568
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,040
Fang Zhiyou always

569
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,920
offends more people

570
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,080
and takes care of fewer.

571
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,720
Those who went for the bidding

572
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,320
only thought

573
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,120
Moon Bay was

574
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,360
a big project.

575
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,680
When they realized they were fooled,

576
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,360
they wouldn’t let him go.

577
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,880
Mr. Li.

578
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
What should we do

579
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,320
next?

580
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Next,

581
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,240
you need to go.

582
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
They’re only suspecting.

583
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I need you to

584
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,840
confirm it.

585
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,840
A piece of cake.

586
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
But...

587
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Pity on Xu Yiren.

588
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,360
Because she’s Fang Zhiyou’s girlfriend,

589
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
she’s the best candidate

590
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,440
to take the blame.

591
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
It’s the last time.

592
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,200
When she leaves Fang Zhiyou,

593
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
she won’t be hurt again.

594
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,680
What...

595
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,760
What are you talking about?

596
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,480
Nothing.

597
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,480
Do as you’re told.

598
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,800
After it’s done,

599
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,400
I’ll pay you as promised.

600
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
Well,

601
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,040
thank you, Mr. Li.

602
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Don’t worry.

603
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,720
Fang Zhiyou is getting in big trouble

604
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,760
this time.

605
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Wish us a smooth cooperation.

606
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,080
Someone sent quotations of three companies

607
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
to Jiaye

608
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,720
through Xu Yiren’s computer.

609
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
What?

610
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,120
No. No.

611
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
Yiren would never

612
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,520
do that.

613
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,120
Fang Zhiyou.

614
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,440
Do you really suspect your girlfriend?

615
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,400
When the email was sent,

616
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,720
she was with me.

617
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,240
Do you think I’ll suspect her?

618
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
Oh, I see.

619
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,960
It’ll be easy, then.

620
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
Why don’t you just

621
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,680
vindicate her?

622
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,440
No.

623
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
People will think I’m showing partiality.

624
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,840
They’ll have

625
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,880
more misunderstanding about her.

626
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,600
Anyway, the problem doesn’t hold water.

627
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,520
Don’t worry.

628
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,760
We’ll figure it out.

629
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,000
Shall I

630
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,760
ask my father to help?

631
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,520
No.

632
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,520
You can help.

633
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
Me?

634
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,200
What can I do?

635
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, yeah.

636
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,480
We have monitors.

637
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,040
When we check them,

638
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
we’ll know who sent the email

639
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,120
through Yiren’s computer.

640
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,520
Clever, aren’t I?

641
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,840
I don’t need you to remind me.

642
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,480
That night,

643
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
someone turned off the monitors.

644
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
How was it possible?

645
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,320
Do we know

646
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
who turned them off?

647
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,800
No.

648
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,760
It’s baffling me.

649
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
Go and check

650
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,160
who was the last to leave the company

651
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,040
that night.

652
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,880
Okay.

653
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
I’ll try.

654
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,960
It doesn’t feel right.

655
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,920
Idol.

656
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Why...

657
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,920
Why do you ask me to help?

658
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,080
Because you have the least work to do.

659
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
You’re a shareholder, anyway.

660
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
This is your duty.

661
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
All right.

662
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
In our company,

663
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
I trust you the most,

664
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
except Xu Yiren.

665
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,880
I knew it!

666
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,600
I always know I’m different

667
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,960
in your heart.

668
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,360
Wait.

669
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,560
What about He Yuwen?

670
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,160
Xu Yiren.

671
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,000
I’m sleeping.

672
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
Yiren.

673
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
I’m asleep.

674
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,840
Are you going to suffocate yourself?

675
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
You’re lying more poorly.

676
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,040
Why did you ignore me?

677
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,680
I didn’t send the email.

678
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,840
I trust you.

679
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,160
Why do you trust me?

680
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,480
You haven’t checked yet.

681
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,200
If I were you,

682
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
would you trust me?

683
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,920
Mm.

684
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,920
I checked when the email was sent.

685
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,640
You were with me.

686
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,200
I knew you couldn’t do that.

687
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,640
But I failed to explain

688
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,120
in their face.

689
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
You can understand that, can’t you?

690
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,600
Sure.

691
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,480
Thank you, anyway.

692
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
Thank you for caring for me.

693
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,040
You’re welcome.

694
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,480
This problem

695
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,640
isn’t over.

696
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
What’s true is true.

697
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,920
And what’s false is false.

698
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Don’t think too much.

699
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
In the office,

700
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,040
if you can’t face others,

701
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,440
why don’t you have a rest?

702
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
No.

703
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,560
I’ve done nothing wrong.

704
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,360
Don’t force yourself if you can’t hold on.

705
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,040
Xu Yiren!

706
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Mr. Xie?

707
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,240
Xu Yiren.

708
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,960
You lied to me.

709
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,880
You said you could handle that.

710
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,120
And you said

711
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,360
your boss was your boyfriend

712
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,760
and he would listen to you.

713
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
But now...

714
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I had many loans

715
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,240
for the construction.

716
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,560
And you’re postponing the bidding.

717
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,360
What are you talking about?

718
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,560
Playing dumb, huh?

719
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
I paid you.

720
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,760
What do you mean?

721
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

722
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,520
When did you pay me?

723
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,760
If you continue, I’ll call the police.

724
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Call the police?

725
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
I’m so scared.

726
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,120
Do it!

727
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,920
Sha Sha.

728
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,600
Call security.

729
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,280
Okay.

730
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Don’t move.

731
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,720
What are you doing?

732
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,440
Don’t move.

733
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,360
Boss.

734
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Stop wasting time to argue with her.

735
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
She won’t admit it unless she’s dying.

736
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,200
Xu Yiren.

737
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,800
Since you break our promise,

738
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,880
you’ll be sorry.

739
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,800
Smash!

740
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,160
What are you doing?

741
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,040
- Stop. - What are you doing?

742
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,080
- Stop. - Stop smashing.

743
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,440
Stop smashing.

744
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,240
Stop.

745
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,360
Stop smashing.

746
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,760
What are you doing?

747
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,320
Sha Sha, call the police.

748
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
All right.

749
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,960
Hurry. Hurry.

750
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,560
This is

751
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,360
a lesson for you.

752
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,480
This isn’t

753
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,400
over.

754
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,040
Go.

755
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,040
This is calling from Squire & Circle.

756
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,840
There’s a robbery.

757
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,480
Yes.

758
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,440
Squire & Circle.

759
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Are you all right?

760
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,800
You’re hurt?

761
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,680
You design with your hands.

762
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,880
Does it hurt?

763
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,560
No.

764
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
Let’s go to hospital.

765
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,080
No need.

766
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,880
It doesn’t hurt.

767
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,080
Really?

768
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,280
Fang Zhiyou.

769
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,000
It’s not time to play cool.

770
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
When one of your hand is hurt, go to hospital.

771
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,840
Your hands are company assets.

772
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,280
You can’t be so self-willed.

773
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
I know my own health best.

774
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,400
But thank you, anyway.

775
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,600
All right.

776
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,160
Since you think you’re all right,

777
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,400
I won’t stay

778
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,880
to make you unhappy.

779
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
I’ll leave you alone.

780
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,320
The wound is deep.

781
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,560
You’re bleeding a lot.

782
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,960
Go to hospital.

783
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
I’m fine.

784
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,520
You know how to lie.

785
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,840
It must be hurting.

786
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
Why are you smiling?

787
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,000
Is your head hurt, too?

788
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,640
I’m smiling,

789
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
because you’re right.

790
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Since I was 14,

791
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,600
I swore I wouldn’t lie.

792
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,280
I don’t know why,

793
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,040
but recently,

794
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,680
I lie easily.

795
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,240
And I don’t feel too bad.

796
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,400
Should I say congratulations?

797
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
Let’s go to hospital.

798
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,040
Okay?

799
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,960
Don’t worry.

800
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,800
My bones aren’t hurt.

801
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,680
Otherwise,

802
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,840
I would have been hurting to death.

803
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,800
When I played games for a dozen hours

804
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,400
at a young age,

805
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,560
I felt the same pain.

806
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,680
You played games for a dozen hours?

807
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,840
Why not?

808
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,360
Boys of that time

809
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,720
nearly played the same games.

810
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,800
Li Zhe and I...

811
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,320
Sorry.

812
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,760
It’s not your fault.

813
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,920
They came for me.

814
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,520
Why?

815
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,560
They came for me.

816
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,760
They’re not your enemy.

817
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
Why must they frame you up?

818
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,880
I have no idea.

819
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,160
Silly girl.

820
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,080
Because you’re my girlfriend.

821
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,480
I’ll figure it out as soon as possible.

822
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,880
I won’t let it happen again.

823
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,960
I won’t, either.

824
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,840
This is what you want about Jiaye.

825
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,600
Everything about it.

826
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,560
Check it.

827
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,840
Jiaye is a bogus company.

828
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,720
They competed their qualifications

829
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,480
in the past few months.

830
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,000
They have never conducted

831
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
any real project.

832
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,360
It means,

833
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,160
they’re not qualified

834
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,000
to bid for Moon Bay project.

835
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
Why did they attend the bidding then?

836
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,360
Unless...

837
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,240
they don’t come for the project.

838
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,240
Ruining Square & Circle and Fang Zhiyou

839
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
is what they really want.

840
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,160
Think about it.

841
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
My idol

842
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,240
always offends people.

843
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
But who hates him so much?

844
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,320
Creating a company

845
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
isn’t joking.

846
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Damage are brought to both sides.

847
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Only one man

848
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,280
who could have done this.

849
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,200
Where are you going?

850
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,080
To see Li Zhe.

851
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,880
Oh.

852
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,640
Can you do it alone?

853
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,680
She’s so fast.

854
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,560
No way.

855
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,280
I must call my idol.

856
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,260
= Dasheng Model Company =

857
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,120
Miss Xu, what brings you here?

858
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,360
Miss Xu.

859
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,280
What do you want?

860
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,360
Miss Xu.

861
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,160
Miss Xu, you can’t get in.

862
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,480
Miss Xu.

863
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,560
Miss Xu.

864
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,200
You did it,

865
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,920
didn’t you?

866
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,160
Mr. Li.

867
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,880
I...

868
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,720
My company looks good,

869
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,160
doesn’t it?

870
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Answer me.

871
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,120
Be seated.

872
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
What did I do to you?

873
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Why did you frame me up?

874
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,840
In my company,

875
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,680
everyone thinks I betrayed the company

876
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
and I sold Fang Zhiyou out.

877
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
I don’t understand.

878
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
We’re alone.

879
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,600
Just tell me the truth.

880
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,800
Let me fail for a reason, all right?

881
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,240
Did you ask Xie Dongren from Jiaye

882
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,360
to frame me up

883
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,400
for selling quotations to him?

884
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,880
You have evidence?

885
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,440
Why?

886
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,760
Even if you hate Fang Zhiyou,

887
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
why do you frame me up?

888
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,480
I’m blamed for

889
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,760
betraying my company.

890
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,120
I can’t stay in Square & Circle anymore.

891
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,720
No other company wants me.

892
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,520
I’m not as rich you and Fang Zhiyou.

893
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,960
Without work, I’ll die.

894
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
You can come to my company.

895
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560
What?

896
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,240
I told you many times.

897
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,520
You’re always welcome in my company.

898
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,440
I can protect you.

899
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,560
I’ll do better than Fang Zhiyou.

900
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
No way.

901
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,000
Well,

902
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,240
since you don’t dare to admit,

903
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,960
I’ll have nothing to argue.

904
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,720
Wait.

905
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,000
I have a question for you, too.

906
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,040
If you tell me honestly,

907
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,600
I’ll tell you

908
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440

- Did you... - Yes.

946
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
I bought off Xie Dongren with Jiaye

947
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,160
to attend the bidding.

948
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,880
Then I asked someone

949
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,160
to send the quotations of the other three companies

through your computer.

952
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,840
Jiaye didn’t attend the bidding

953
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,000
to succeed,

954
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,120

Fang Zhiyou’s reputation.

Why did you pick me?

957
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,760
Because Fang Zhiyou

958
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,040
only trusts you and defends you

959
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
without hesitation.

960
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,840
If he wants to protect you,

961
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,520
he can’t save his company.

962
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,120
You...

963
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,600
