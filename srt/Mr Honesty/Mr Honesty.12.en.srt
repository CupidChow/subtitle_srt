We’re not allowed to read in the company?

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,240

Do all of you designers

have to study modeling?

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
Just my personal preference.

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,800
Actually, I’m quite interested in this too.

33

It’s just that

I haven’t learned anything about it.

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
I can only learn it all by myself.

Good.

At the meeting that day,

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
Mr. Fang asked everyone

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,440
to think of a method to replace 3D modeling.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
Do you have any ideas about that?

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
I…

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,120
You definitely have.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
Say it.

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,360
Don’t be so stingy.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
I don’t know if it will work.

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,600
If you don’t say, how can you know?

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
I don’t know either.

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,000
Say it.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,920
It’s not a shame.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
If you don’t know, why you want to know?

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Are you gonna say it or not?

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,760
Get a chair.

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
I’ll tell you only.

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,720
OK.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,440
I often make

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,280
some handmade models at home.

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,720
So I’m thinking,

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
if we can use

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
handmade models

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
instead of 3D modeling?

63
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,000
Good idea.

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
Why didn’t you say it that day?

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
Because it requires a lot of time

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,480
and energy

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
to make handmade models?

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,520
Right.

69
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,200
If you don’t mind

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
that I’m a layman,

71
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
I can do it with you.

No madam, how can you do this?

You prepare the materials first.

I got something urgent,

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
gotta go back home first.

Sister.

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
The house I recommend to you

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,400
is highly cost effective.

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,440
The sofa and TV

98
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,600
are all given away for free.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
You can check in with just a bag.

100

Come here.

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Check around.

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,400
Madam.

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,640
Even if you want to sell your house,

104
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,600
can you give me more time?

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
Only one week I…

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,120
Here.

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Your rent

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
and compensation.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Don’t bluff me this time.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
I did it all

111
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,280
by the contract.

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
No.

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
Madam,

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
can you give me more time?

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,040
Madam.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,840
How about it?

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,360
The buyer asks how long you need

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
to hand in the house

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
after signing the contract?

120
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,600
A week.

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,280
Tell them,

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
as soon as they pay,

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
I’ll give them the house.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,120
Good.

125
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,120
I want to eat something spicy.

126
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,560
No.

127
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
Only tomato.

128
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
No negotiation.

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,640
I want something spicy.

130
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
Spicy is no good for your throat.

131
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
My throat is great.

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
You are so…

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,040
Xia Di.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,760
Yiren, why are you here?

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
You…

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Did you know that we are going to eat hot pot?

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
Good for you, Yiren.

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Today’s weather is the best for hot pot.

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Come on in, don’t stand there.

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,040
Come on.

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,640
OK.

142
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
Gu Bo, hurry up.

143
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
It’s boiling.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
Right away.

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,080
Taste this.

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
What’s happening?

147
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
Why is he here?

148
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,840
He…

149
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,440
Um…

150
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
This kid is homeless,

151
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
so I take him in for a few days.

152
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
What?

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah.

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,840
Today I went to the publishing house

155
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,040
and happened to meet him with a house agent.

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,200
His community is suffering a gas explosion.

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Explosion?

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,040
Fortunately,

159
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
no one was hurt,

160
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
but the circuit was blown up,

161
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,480
and his building is out of power for renovation.

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
How can we live

163
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
without electricity?

164
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,800
So,

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,840
he is looking for a house for transition.

166
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
I thought what house he could rent

167
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
with his salary?

168
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
I happen to have a vacant room.

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,480
So I let him stay for several days.

170
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Eat this.

171
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,360
I’m coming.

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
All dishes are here.

173
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,680
Hurry up and eat.

174
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
How long does it take

175
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
to renovate your house?

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,360
About twenty days.

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,480
So long?

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,200
Yeah.

179
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,880
I’m telling you,

180
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,000
the short-term rental house is so hard to find.

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Thanks to my goddess.

182
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,840
Right, Yiren.

183
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
What brings you here?

184
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,400
Nothing.

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
It’s just,

186
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
I hunched that you’re eating hot pot,

187
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,360
so I’m here.

188
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,000
Then you got lucky.

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
You must try this.

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
What is it called, Gu Bo?

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
It’s very popular online.

192
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Egg in shrimp paste with fried gluten puff.

193
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
Right, Gu Bo’s specialty.

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Very delicious.

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
Hurry up and make one for her.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Here.

197
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,240
Gu Bo.

198
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
My Goddess.

199
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
Can you rub body lotion for me?

200
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
Sure.

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,040
I’d do anything for you.

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
My Goddess.

203
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,080
Where shall we rub first?

204
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Anywhere you want.

205
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,120
What are you doing?

206
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Vomiting?

207
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,560
My newly changed sheet,

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
you made it dirty again.

209
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Come on.

210
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Pick one.

211
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,760
How...

212
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
How is this not the same as imagined?

213
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,920
What are you talking about?

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,760
These are the peripherals of our company.

215
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
And finally come in handy.

216
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
Pretty cute, uh?

217
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,840
Very…cute.

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
If you live in my house, you have to obey my rules.

219
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Listen,

220
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
if you don’t wear pajamas,

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
don’t go to bed.

222
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,760
And,

223
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,600
the bed sheet is changed once a week.

224
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
Put it in the laundry basket,

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
the cleaner will come to collect it.

226
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,160
And,

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,720
the Iron Man figurine on the bed

228
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
is handmade,

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
very special,

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
don’t break it.

231
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,440
And that one,

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,080
you see it?

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,240
The heart it gestures,

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
something is in it.

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,960
What is in it?

236
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
Yiren.

237
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,040
Shiyu.

238
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you looking for a room to rent?

239
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,120
Why are you here?

240
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
My dad is on a business trip.

241
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
I have to

242
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,400
stay in my brother’s house.

243
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
You got no place to stay?

244
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,120
No.

245
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
I was kicked out by my landlady.

246
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,760
If I can’t find a room,

247
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,160
I’m going to live on the street.

248
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
Great!

249
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,120
What’s great?

250
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,560
Come to my brother’s house

251
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
and accompany with me,

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,040
but don’t let the others know.

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,960
Xu Yiren.

254
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Mr. Fang.

255
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,280
Why are you here?

256
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
Come to my office later.

257
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840
OK.

258
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,720
Don’t run around.

259
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Being kicked out by the landlady

260
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,520
and got no place to live?

261
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,640
As a compassionate subordinate,

262
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,800
it’s reasonable

263
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,680
to help the employee to get it through

264
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,440
and invite her to live in my house?

265
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,360
Oh my god.

266
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,280
Did he hear

267
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,800
what Shiyu said?

268
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,040
Why is he looking at me so seriously?

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,840
Your sister asked me to live at your place,

270
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
I said nothing.

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Don’t get me wrong,

272
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
that I want to find a chance to get close to you.

273
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
I was wrong yesterday,

274
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,840
I apologize for that.

275
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
I apologize for my attitude too.

276
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Sorry.

277
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,640
Anything you want,

278
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,600
just tell me,

279
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I will do my best to help you.

280
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,000
Xu Yiren,

281
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,960
as long as you behave yourself

282
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
and tell me that
you’re looking for a place to stay,

283
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,920
I will show my compassion

284
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
to help you solve this problem.

285
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
Problem?

286
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,400
What problem?

287
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
Is it a problem

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
watching Xia Di’s comics occasionally during work

289
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,720
and help her reply

290
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
the malicious comments online?

291
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,680
Is it a problem looking for a house

292
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,680
during working hours?

293
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
No, I’m fine.

294
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,480
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

295
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,720
Is it not a problem that you got no place to stay?

296
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,160
What’s that face?

297
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,240
What did I say wrong?

298
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
Or

299
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,480
you think

300
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
what problem I have?

301
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,760
No.

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
Not at all.

303
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
OK, go out if you got nothing else.

304
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,640
Two idiots!

305
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,120
How could they not see the problem?

306
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,680
Looks like I have to solve the problem for them.

307
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,480
OK.

308
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,920
Why are you here?

309
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
Yiren.

310
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,560
Didn’t you just say

311
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
you got no place to stay?

312
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,800
Poor girl.

313
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
If you have no place to stay,

314
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,080
you got no mood to work.

315
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,280
Zhiyou.

316
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
What kind of boss are you?

317
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
How can you not care about

318
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
your own employee?

319
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
Your employee got no place to live,

320
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
don’t you care?

321
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
None of your business.

322
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
OK.

323
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
You don’t care.

324
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I care.

325
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Where are you going?

326
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Shiyu.

327
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Yiren.

328
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
Go home and

329
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,400
pack your luggage.

330
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,920
I let my brother pick you up

331
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,640
and you will move over to live with us.

332
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
Don’t bother, really.

333
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Don’t say no to me.

334
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,000
Your boss has no conscience,

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,040
but I do.

336
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Most importantly,

337
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,320
every time I go to my brother’s house,

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,920
he feeds me

339
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,200
with his snacks.

340
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
I’m just a child,

341
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,000
he abuses me with junk food,

342
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,680
you need to save me from it.

343
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,000
At least if you are around,

344
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,400
I won’t starve.

345
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
I know you love me the most.

346
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
And you would definitely say yes.

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,040
Fang Zhiyou,

348
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,440
do you have a problem with it?

349
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
I…

350
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
No.

351
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,560
OK.

352
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,480
That’s it.

353
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,960
Smart girl.

354
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,120
How can I say yes?

355
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,360
We stay together long enough

356
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,080
in the company,

357
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
now we have to be together after work.

358
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
It’s 24 hours a day,

359
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,560
I don’t see

360
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
any couple who are so close

361
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,120
like us.

362
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,280
What am I talking about?

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
Is there anyone I know

364
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,920
living nearby?

365
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,560
It would be a trouble if they see me.

366
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
Can you watch the road?

367
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,880
How I walk

368
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
is none of your business.

369
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,320
Yiren,

370
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
you finally came.

371
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
I’m sorry

372
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
to trouble you.

373
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,160
No at all.

374
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Come on.

375
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,080
I will show you your room.

376
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,680
OK.

377
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,600
My suitcase.

378
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,080
Look.

379
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,200
You live here.

380
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Do you like it?

381
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
Yes.

382
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Thank you.

383
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
I’ll move out as soon as I find…

384
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,200
We will talk about it when you do.

385
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,320
Take a look around.

386
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,120
I’ll show you my brother’s room.

387
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
You…

388
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Check around.

389
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
Isn’t it nice?

390
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,600
Not bad.

391
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,400
It’s so hot here.

392
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,960
I…

393
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,520
I’m leaving.

394
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,480
What are you doing?

395
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,560
Be serious.

396
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,480
Serious?

397
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,560
About what?

398
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Take a good look at my brother’s room,

399
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,200
if you’re not satisfied,

400
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
I let him redecorate.

401
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
Why should I be dissatisfied

402
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,000
with your brother’s room?

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,920
This is going to be your room too.

404
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
How old are you,

405
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
what are you thinking about?

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,520
How old are you, how come

407
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,360
you’re not thinking about it?

408
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,480
Look.

409
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
Your stuff.

410
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Why put it

411
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,600
in your brother’s room?

412
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,120
This is not my stuff.

413
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,080
Not yours?

414
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,000
It’s your brother’s.

415
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
I didn’t know he has this hobby.

416
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
My brother sleeps

417
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,360
with Danfu every night.

418
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,160
It has a name?

419
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,960
Danfu.

420
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,040
What?

421
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
You got a problem with that?

422
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,080
No.

423
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
What should I do?

424
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,800
How can I sleep

425
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,520
knowing Fang Zhiyou is next door.

426
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Can’t you sleep?

427
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,520
I’m sorry

428
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,800
to wake you up.

429
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
Or you’re not used to sleeping here?

430
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
No.

431
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,440
I had a nightmare

432
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
and was scared up.

433
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
I’ll go back to sleep.

434
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
I’m on bed.

435
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,080
I used to have nightmares too.

436
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
So my mom

437
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,160
bought me this.

438
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,400
She said that Danfu is a knight

439
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
who guards my dreams

440
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
and drives away all terrible things.

441
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
You can have a try.

442
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
I’m counting on you, knight.

443
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Morning, Mr. Fang.

444
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,920
Mr. Fang.

445
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
Steamed buns, fried eggs,

446
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,920
toast bread, and small wantons,

447
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,800
Yiren,

448
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
are you Doraemon?

449
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
I don’t know what you like,

450
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,080
so I made all of them.

451
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,360
What time did you get up?

452
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,880
Around five o’clock.

453
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I only have porridge

454
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,240
and bread for breakfast.

455
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
Another more cup of soy milk for Shiyu.

456
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,160
That’s all we need.

457
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
Who said that?

458
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,120
Eggs, buns and wantons

459
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,680
are all my favorite.

460
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,560
If you think we’re bothering Yiren,

461
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,080
just say it.

462
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Is it good?

463
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,960
If you want to eat anything,

464
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
just tell me.

465
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,120
I decide

466
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
to cook all your breakfast

467
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,720
in the next a few days.

468
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,760
Just take it as rent.

469
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,960
I’ll looking for a place on the weekend.

470
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,040
Don’t rush.

471
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Uh?

472
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,200
I mean Shiyu will

473
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
live here for a while,

474
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,960
you can stay with her.

475
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,480
Oh.

476
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,280
OK.

477
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,440
Yiren.

478
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,600
You have some too.

479
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,000
You can send me to school with my brother.

480
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,960
You two have to go to work together anyway.

481
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,600
No need.

482
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,160
I’ll take the subway.

483
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,520
It’s OK.

484
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
Yeah.

485
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
OK.

486
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,480
Fine.

487
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
If we go to the office together

488
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
and someone sees us,

489
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,920
they will gossip.

490
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,920
Mr. Fang.

491
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,400
I ate too much.

492
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,040
and I wanna take a walk.

493
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay, me too.

494
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Let’s go.

495
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
I wanna take a walk too.

496
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,520
Mr. Fang.

497
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
Thanos.

498
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,840
I can make an emoji with this.

499
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,600
If necessary…

500
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Xu Yiren.

501
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,040
Delete it.

502
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
What are you doing?

503
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,080
You.

504
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,680
This is my privacy.

505
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,840
Mr. Fang.

506
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,120
Mr. Fang.

507
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,920
Regarding the resort,

508
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,000
I have a proposal.

509
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,600
Tell me.

510
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,600
Since the modeling company is so hard to find,

511
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,840
we can choose to replace 3D modeling

512
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,160
with handmade models.

513
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,440
Sun Ziyang is very experienced in this,

514
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,280
I can do it too,

515
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,600
I can help him with it.

516
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,200
No.

517
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
This project is different

518
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
from Huaxing.

519
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
What Huaxing wants is

520
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
the building structure.

521
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,160
So using the model

522
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,360
can achieve the effect.

523
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,320
But the Moon Bay Resort project

524
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
reflects the overall design style.

525
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,680
Using only the models

526
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,720
will be difficult to achieve it.

527
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Including the cultural,

528
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
and natural landscape.

529
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,360
So, the quality of the finished product is

530
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
also difficult to guarantee.

531
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
How do you know if you don’t have a try?

532
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
There is no need to waste time

533
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,160
since the result

534
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,440
is obvious.

535
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,200
There are many things to do,

536
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,520
the priority is to sort out the materials.

537
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,280
OK.

538
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,800
Yuwen.

539
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,560
You are here.

540
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
I ordered your favorite coffee.

541
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,240
How about it?

542
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,120
Any result?

543
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
It’s not easy,

544
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,880
but I still found

545
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,080
some information about him.

546
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Just tell me.

547
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,480
As expected, Fang Zhiyou and Li Zhe

548
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,800
knew each other before.

549
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
They were classmates in elementary school
and junior high

550
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,960
and have always been close friends.

551
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
Close friends?

552
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,080
What?

553
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,920
You’ve known Fang Zhiyou

554
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,960
for such a long time,

555
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,920
he didn’t mention anything about it?

556
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
If they were close friends,

557
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
why would Li Zhe do that to him?

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,080
Here is what I found.

559
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,840
Something happened to Li Zhe’s family

560
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
when he was in the third year of middle school.

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,720
His father was accused
of illegal private equity funds

562
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,840
and sentenced to five years.

563
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
His parents committed suicide

564
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
because they couldn’t take the blow.

565
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,600
His father,

566
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,880
who was later rescued,

567
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,200
but got dementia.

568
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,200
His mother

569
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,640
failed to be rescued.

570
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,760
Li Zhe went abroad afterwards,

571
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
and lost contact with Fang Zhiyou.

572
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
What does this have to do with Fang Zhiyou?

573
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,160
Fang Zhiyou seems to have something to do

574
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,920
with Li Zhe’s accident.

575
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,240
How would that be?

576
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,520
He was just

577
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,760
a junior high school student

578
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
at that time.

579
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,280
As the saying goes,

580
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,040
you can see a person’s future when he’s a child.

581
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,880
I have to say this, but don’t be mad.

582
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,440
Since Fang Zhiyou can do something

583
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,040
to betray Mr. He,

584
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,800
it is not surprising that he betrayed his friend.

585
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
As for what happened

586
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,080
between him and Li Zhe,

587
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,200
I don’t know.

588
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,160
You can go ask him.

589
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,720
There is no nutrition in this,

590
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,800
I’ll treat you something good.

591
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
No, I want to eat this.

592
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,240
OK, you buy this for me.

593
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
Why should I buy it for you?

594
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,600
Don’t you want to know

595
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,200
if I changed my mind

596
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,440
to continue to cooperate with Square & Circle?

597
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,720
What is your relationship with Li Zhe?

598
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,680
Why ask this?

599
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,320
I have known you for years

600
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
and you never

601
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
mentioned this name.

602
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
Why didn’t you tell me

603
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,440
you knew each other before,

604
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
and you used to be good friends?

605
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,800
Yes,

606
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,000
we used to be good friends.

607
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,200
Since you already know,

608
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,680
why ask me?

609
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,520
I asked you why you didn’t tell me before.

610
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,000
This is personal.

611
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,080
It got nothing to do with work.

612
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,880
So I don’t think it’s necessary to mention.

613
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,720
Are we

614
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
just colleagues?

615
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
Dasheng’s accident is caused by

616
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Li Zhe’s personal resentment

617
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
towards me.

618
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,040
I will take full responsibility.

619
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
Do you think this is the reason

620
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,120
why I’m here?

621
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,480
What happened between you and him?

622
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,800
Does what happened to Li Zhe’s family

623
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,000
have anything to do with you?

624
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,800
Zhiyou,

625
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,320
you still don’t want to tell me, do you?

626
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,840
As I said,

627
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,680
this is my personal affair,

628
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
I don’t have to tell anyone else.

629
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Anyone else?

630
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,360
Does it include me?

631
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,600
Yes.

632
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,200
Well.

633
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,800
Fang Zhiyou.

634
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Your personal affair

635
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
has seriously affected the company’s interests,

636
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
I hope you can do as you said

637
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,760
and take the responsibility.

638
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,040
Don’t you wanna eat?

639
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,200
Wasn’t it the restaurant you found last time?

640
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
You are not here talking about the cooperation.

641
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,760
You are…

642
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,720
I just wanna have a meal with you.

643
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,080
I’m not hungry.

644
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,680
If you got nothing to talk. I’m leaving now.

645
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,040
Don’t you want to know

646
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,280
why I hate Fang Zhiyou so much?

647
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
But after you hear me out,

648
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,400
the Fang Zhiyou you think you know

649
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,280
will no longer exist.

650
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,640
We used to be the best friends,

651
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,280
from elementary school

652
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,080
to junior high school,

653
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
as always.

654
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,360
Did you finish drawing that, Fang Zhiyou?

655
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,560
Yes, yes.

656
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,200
Look.

657
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Does it like you?

658
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,760
Look.

659
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,840
Does it like you?

660
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,360
Fang Zhiyou.

661
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,240
Li Zhe.

662
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,440
Fang Zhiyou.

663
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
Li Zhe.

664
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,680
This is totally you.

665
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,800
What’s wrong?

666
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,480
Want to fight?

667
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,400
What are you doing?

668
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,520
Why do you hit him?

669
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
So what?

670
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,040
Run.

671
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
Stop.

672
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,600
Take my car home.

673
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,400
OK.

674
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,840
Young master.

675
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
I got something to tell you.

676
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,560
Mr. Li has been detained

677
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,440
for some matters that

678
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,520
have not been dealt with properly.

679
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,520
But you don’t have to worry,

680
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,840
our lawyers already...

681
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,080
OK.

682
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,880
Don’t worry.

683
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
I’ve already known this.

684
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,360
Let them do it as soon as possible...

685
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,320
OK, OK.

686
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,040
Dad.

687
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,040
Why are you here?

688
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
Uncle Fang,

689
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
they want to sue my dad,

690
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,120
please help my dad.

691
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,840
- What are you doing? - Uncle Fang.

692
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,560
Get up first.

693
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,600
Get up and tell me.

694
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,360
Tell me

695
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
what’s going on?

696
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
They want to sue my dad.

697
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Please help him.

698
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,920
I heard about your father.

699
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,520
But I…

700
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Dad.

701
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,440
Uncle Li can’t be a fraud,

702
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,600
he is wronged.

703
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,640
Please help him,

704
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,960
I beg you.

705
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,440
Li Zhe is my best friend.

706
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,200
Fine.

707
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,800
Thanks, uncle.

708
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,360
Don’t worry.

709
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,440
My dad is the most famous lawyer here.

710
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,600
He will definitely help Uncle Li
to get rid of the crime.

711
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,560
Will you, dad?

712
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Thanks, uncle.

713
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,560
Dad.

714
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,480
Still busy?

715
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,320
You’re here.

716
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,440
Have you done your homework?

717
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,560
Yes.

718
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,080
Dad.

719
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,000
You can win,

720
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,720
can you?

721
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,320
Li Zhe said his father

722
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,880
doesn’t know about the fund raising,

723
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,920
he was also cheated by his partners.

724
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
You can help him, right?

725
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,840
I...

726
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,880
I don’t want to see Li Zhe sad.

727
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,960
Then you have to ask

728
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,360
Li Zhe’s father

729
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
if he has any evidence

730
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
to prove that

731
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
he was also deceived by his partners.

732
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,520
I…

733
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,400
I don’t know.

734
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,600
It’s OK.

735
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,360
The situation now is

736
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
it’s not convenient for me

737
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,920
to meet Li Zhe’s dad.

738
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
You can ask Li Zhe to go back

739
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,440
and investigate the ins and outs

740
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,520
of this matter.

741
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,680
Then ask his father

742
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,400
if there is any evidence in his hand.

743
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
And tell me

744
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
all of it.

745
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,320
OK.

746
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,560
I will go ask him tomorrow morning.

747
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,400
OK.

748
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,680
Do your homework first.

749
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,120
Sure.

750
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,800
Don’t stay late.

751
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,480
OK.

752
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,040
I always thought

753
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,320
we would always be the best friends.

754
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,360
Until that day…

755
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
The defendant Li Jinghong

756
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,200
is convicted.

757
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,800
According to Article 192

758
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,640
of the Criminal Law
of the People’s Republic of China…

759
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,360
Fang Zhanyang.

760
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,520
Fang Zhanyang.

761
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,200
Mom.

762
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,720
Mom.

763
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,440
Fang Zhanyang.

764
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Mom, what’s wrong?

765
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,400
Fang Zhanyang.

766
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,560
What’s wrong with you?

767
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Dad.

768
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
Dad.

769
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,440
Dad.

770
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,040
I don’t believe this.

771
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,280
There must be some misunderstanding.

772
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,080
Misunderstanding?

773
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
You’ve seen my father.

774
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
You know what he looks like now.

775
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
It’s all caused

776
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,320
by Fang Zhiyou.

777
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,080
We believed Fang Zhiyou so much

778
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,240
that didn’t even sign a commission agreement

779
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,440
with Fang Zhanyang.

780
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,680
My father gave me all the evidence

781
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,120
and let me give it to Fang Zhiyou.

782
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,080
But it turned out…

783
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Do you know what it feels like to be deceived

784
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
by the most trusted person?

785
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
I can’t believe it till now.

786
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,480
My heart still hurts.

787
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,800
I don’t believe it.

788
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,200
No?

789
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,360
If you don’t, you can ask him.

790
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
See if he can say

791
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,080
that he didn’t do it.

792
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,560
I told you this today,

793
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,560
just want you to know

794
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,000
what kind of person he is.

795
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
I also want you to know

796
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,400
he doesn’t deserve what you did for him.

797
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,320
You’re here, good.

798
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Check how are

799
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,640
these drawings.

800
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,160
We can make them into a moving picture

801
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
to present our design concept.

802
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
Unfortunately,

803
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,920
there was not much time for us.

804
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
In the following a few days,

805
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,240
everyone might have to

806
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
work overtime in the company.

807
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,680
Yeah.

808
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,040
Pretty good.

809
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,640
You got something to say?

810
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,960
Mr. Fang.

811
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I got something to ask you,

812
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,600
can you tell me the truth?

813
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,280
What is it?

814
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,960
You said before that

815
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,200
Li Zhe’s family died

816
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,040
because of a lie.

817
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,160
Does it have anything to do

818
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,680
with your father?

819
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,880
Nothing important.

820
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,200
I just heard a story

821
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,200
that a barrister

822
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,080
had promised to help

823
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,360
his son’s friend’s family,

824
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,160
but in the end,

825
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,280
he became the defense lawyer of the other party.

826
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
And he helped the other party

827
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,160
win the lawsuit.

828
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,560
How is it possible?

829
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,640
Did you see Li Zhe?

830
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,240
He told you this?

831
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,800
Mr. Fang,

832
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,960
there must be something wrong between you,

833
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,640
right?

834
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,520
Although Li Zhe’s experience is pitiful,

835
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,080
he can’t blame

836
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,840
everything on you.

837
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
He also said that

838
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,160
you and your father cheated him together.

839
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
This is impossible.

840
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,120
What he said

841
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,480
is true.

842
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
My dad had promised Uncle Li

843
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,440
to be his defense lawyer

844
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,440
and asked me to get evidence from Li Zhe.

845
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,960
But on the day of the court,

846
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
my dad stood in the plaintiff’s court.

847
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,640
All the evidence

848
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,640
turned into a weapon he used

849
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,840
to send Uncle Li to jail.

850
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
Li Zhe is right.

851
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
I’m sorry to Uncle Li.

852
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,120
Finished?

853
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
You can go back now.

854
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,480
It’s finally weekends.

855
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,720
I can eat your food again.

856
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,600
Yiren.

857
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
The soup is coming out.

858
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,200
What happened to you?

859
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
Nothing.

860
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
Just got something that

861
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,600
I can’t figure it out.

862
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,240
What is it?

863
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,040
Tell me,

864
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,120
let me help you.

865
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
Do you know

866
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
that your brother

867
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,320
had a good friend

868
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,240
named Li Zhe?

869
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,000
I know.

870
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,040
What do you know about what happened that year?

871
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,200
You want to ask me that

872
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,520
my dad hurt Li Zhe and his dad, right?

873
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
Is it true?

874
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,520
How can it be true?

875
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,600
It’s impossible.

876
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,920
I was too young and

877
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,400
I don’t remember anything.

878
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I only know

879
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,560
my brother hasn’t spoken with my dad

880
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,600
since then.

881
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,360
Later my mother passed away.

882
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,040
He moved out

883
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,480
and never returned home.

884
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,080
What happened between him and Li Zhe

885
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
was told by my mother

886
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,720
when she was alive.

887
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,200
You don’t know

888
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
how difficult it is for me

889
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
at home.

890
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
I feel sorry for you.

891
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,040
Do you think

892
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,600
that it wasn’t your brother

893
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,400
who lied to Li Zhe,

894
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,760
but…

895
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,400
You can just say that it was all my father’s fault.

896
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
I think it is.

897
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,560
Although my brother won’t let me mention it.

898
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,160
he still blames my father for this.

899
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
In this case,

900
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,800
why didn’t he explain it to Li Zhe?

901
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,280
Do they have to be

902
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,640
like this?

903
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,560
My brother is so proud.

904
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,160
Moreover,

905
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,080
my dad’s fault is his fault.

906
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,000
Li Zhe doesn’t care that much.

907
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Later, my friend’s family

908
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
broke down because of a lie.

909
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,880
His parents couldn’t accept it

910
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,240
and committed suicide.

911
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,080
His father was rescued

912
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,680
but got dementia.

913
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,680
Later on, my friend swore that

914
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,400
he would never lie again.

915
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,360
Where is your brother?

916
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,640
Why doesn’t he come out for dinner?

917
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,160
In the studying room.

918
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
Yiren.

919
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,480
I dare not disturb my brother

920
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
when he is in a bad mood.

921
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,720
Good luck to you.

922
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
