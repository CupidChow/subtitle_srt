Once he becomes successful

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,280
and marries that girl,

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
by that time,

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
will there still be your spot in his company?

24
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,600
Dad.

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,520
Here’s what you’re longing for.

26
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,720
Mr. Wei.

27
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
- Mr. Wei. - Mr. Wei.

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,520
The board has decided to

29
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,760
adopt Liangshan’s design.

30
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,920
We must have

31
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
disappointed you.

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,320
You did disappoint me.

33
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,640
I didn’t expect

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,320
you’d

35
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,000
brazenly copy Liangshan’s design.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,520
We reserve the right

37
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,840
to pursue this matter

38
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,480
through legal actions.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,640
He Yuliang.

40
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
Fang Zhiyou, what are you doing?

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
Fang Zhiyou, calm down.

42
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
Step aside!

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
What do you want?

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,960
To beat me?

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Do it.

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Anyway, you no longer take me as your teacher.

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
What did you do

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
behind my back?

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
It was you!

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
I gave your design to my father

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
and I

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,480
told Mr. Wei

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
you asked me to steal my father’s design.

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,240
So Fond firmly believes

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,160
you copied his work.

56
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
- Why? - Why?

57
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
You really don’t know?

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
You know why, don’t you?

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
To love someone

60
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
is to make him happy.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
Yours isn’t love.

62
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
It’s nothing but sheer possession.

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,920
Clearly, your love isn’t deep enough.

64
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,440
Fang Zhiyou

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
is the first

66
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,040
and the only man I’ve ever loved.

67
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,120
I left Liangshan for him.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,400
We went through thick and thin,

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,280
weal and woe together to come this far.

70
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,280
What have you done for him, Xu Yiren?

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,520
Other than

72
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
cheating and hurting him,

73
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
what else have you done?

74
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
What do you have to compare with me?

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
The old you

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
was incredible.

77
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,400
Even if I claimed

78
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
I could protect him in front of you,

79
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
deep down inside, I was scared

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
because you were a fantastic woman.

81
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Were I a man, I couldn’t resist you.

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
But I’m not scared anymore.

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
However much you’ve done for him

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,960
or however long you’ve known him,

85
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
you don’t understand him at all.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,080
Otherwise,

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,960
you wouldn’t hand his work to others.

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
Xu Yiren, let me be clear,

89
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,920
I got him this chance to bid for Zhiwu Library.

90
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
You want me to sit and watch this project

91
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,480
become your wedding gift?

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I can’t.

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
I’d rather have it destroyed

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
than let you have it.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
True love isn’t like this.

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,800
Have you ever considered

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
that you refuse to let him go

98
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,400
because you love him

99
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,240
or because you can’t stand losing to me?

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
Don’t lecture me.

101
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
What’s done is done.

102
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
You lost.

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
To me,

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,520
win or lose, it doesn’t matter.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,120
From now on,

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,360
I’m short of a friend

107
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,520
and a partner.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Yuwen,

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,440
I no longer recognize you.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,560
No wonder

111
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
this is a top school of design.

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,440
But I can’t believe it fostered

113
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,040
someone like He Yuliang.

114
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,040
He wasn’t like that before.

115
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
Ever since I entered Huaqing,

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
he was my mentor.

117
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
He valued me

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
and I worshiped him.

119
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,800
Before graduation,

120
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,320
numerous companies contacted me,

121
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,920
but eventually, I decided to join Liangshan.

122
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,560
Back then,

123
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,200
he even held my hand to draw.

124
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,840
Occasionally, He Yuwen joked

125
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
that she was jealous of me

126
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
because her father

127
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
was better to me than her.

128
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,880
At that time,

129
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
I meant to follow him for the rest of my life

130
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,040
because he wasn’t only my teacher

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
but also a beacon in my life.

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,800
I never thought

133
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
a man like him

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
would cheat me.

135
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,080
You mean that design of Tianyi Art Gallery?

136
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,560
It took me

137
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,440
over six months to draft that design.

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
I worked day and night for it.

139
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
When I showed it to him,

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
he called me a genius

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,920
and he said that didn’t seem to be

142
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
a young man’s work.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,640
I was so excited.

144
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,880
I thought

145
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,800
that design would win me a prize.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
In the end,

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,520
it was him

148
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
who brought back the trophy

149
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
with my design.

150
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,400
No wonder you know everything about that place

151
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,760
even though you’ve never been there.

152
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,200
After that incident,

153
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
we split up.

154
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
I left Liangshan

155
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
and founded my own company.

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,120
He Yuwen couldn’t stand

157
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
what her father did,

158
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
so she left with me.

159
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,520
She loved you then,

160
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
so she left her father.

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
And again, because of love,

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
she betrayed you now.

163
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,440
But what I don’t understand is

164
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
that he taught you

165
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,400
and appreciated your talents.

166
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Why did he steal your work?

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,920
What a designer fears the most

168
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
is that his inspiration dries up.

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
He was incredible when he was young.

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,720
He created tons of masterpieces.

171
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,280
Since he started teaching,

172
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,640
his works have become less and less.

173
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,520
Many have learned from him,

174
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,320
so they don’t think that’s a problem

175
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
and still put him on a pedestal.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
A man like He Yuliang

177
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,520
couldn’t allow himself to fall behind the time.

178
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
So when he had no inspiration,

179
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
he’d steal others’ works.

180
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,760
What about this time?

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,480
What’s your plan?

182
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Are you going to let him go again?

183
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,400
Can we meet?

184
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
I remember

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,040
you loved drinking my tea.

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,560
Taste it.

187
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
It wasn’t your tea I loved

188
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
but those principles

189
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,360
you told us

190
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,800
when making the tea.

191
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,800
Apparently, you didn’t learn anything from that.

192
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,360
I didn’t realize until later

193
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,800
that your principles

194
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,240
didn’t suit me.

195
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,800
The road is long.

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
How far have you gone?

197
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
It’s too soon

198
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,440
to jump to the conclusion.

199
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
You stole my design of the gallery five years ago.

200
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,560
Now,

201
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
you stole my work again.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
Have you no shame?

203
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,800
Instead of being judged behind my back,

204
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,720
saying I’m at my wits’ end.

205
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
I’d rather bear

206
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
the word you just said,

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,480
“shame”.

208
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,520
I asked to see you

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,880
to tell you something.

210
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,840
Zhiwu Library is mine.

211
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,480
You lost already.

212
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,520
Why don’t you make it graceful?

213
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,760
If you

214
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
admit to Fond

215
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,840
you copied my work,

216
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,760
I’ll find a way

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
to convince Fond to not hold your company

218
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
responsible for breaching the contract.

219
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
And I’ll keep everything a secret.

220
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,800
Not a word will get out.

221
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
You already have He Yuwen as your witness.

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,320
Why do you

223
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
still need me to confess?

224
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
Without your confession,

225
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
as per the procedure, Fond is obliged

226
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,560
to continue the investigation.

227
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
The result will still be the same

228
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,520
but it’ll slow down the project.

229
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,240
I don’t want to waste time on that.

230
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,920
So,

231
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
if you save time for me,

232
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,960
I’ll save your reputation.

233
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,720
Anyway,

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
it’s a good deal.

235
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
You know

236
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
I never lie,

237
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,200
not to mention admitting to plagiarism.

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
You didn’t lie before

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,400
because it wasn’t worth it.

240
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,320
But now, your words

241
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,920
can save your reputation

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,640
and benefit your company.

243
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,760
What choice will you make?

244
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,440
Thank about it.

245
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,960
I’m waiting for your answer.

246
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,440
What?

247
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,760
He asked you to admit to plagiarism.

248
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,600
He can dream on!

249
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,000
Listen,

250
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
if you do that,

251
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,880
you won’t be my idol anymore,

252
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,440
you know?

253
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,960
Calm down.

254
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Of course he can’t admit to that.

255
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,200
If not,

256
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,600
Square & Circle will die.

257
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
It can’t be that bad.

258
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,640
We only lost a project.

259
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,520
If we only lost that project,

260
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,080
our effort would be in vain but nothing else.

261
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,360
Once people in this circle

262
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,520
get word of his alleged plagiarism,

263
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
Fang Zhiyou’s reputation will be destroyed

264
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,320
as well as the company’s.

265
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
Bankruptcy is only a matter of time.

266
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
He Yuliang

267
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,040
is killing you!

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
Yiren,

269
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,600
you once asked me

270
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,120
a lie

271
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
could solve my problem,

272
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,760
but why I refused to tell it.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,840
I understand that.

274
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
But now, I don’t.

275
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
I hate lies,

276
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,200
but it can save this company.

277
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,280
I can lose my reputation,

278
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,880
but what about our staffs?

279
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,480
Can I decide for them?

280
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
And you, Gu Bo.

281
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,000
You’re a shareholder of this company.

282
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
I’m also responsible for you.

283
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,760
Yes.

284
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,040
I’m your shareholder.

285
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
But I can tell you right now

286
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
that you cannot give in.

287
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,920
I’ll battle him to the end.

288
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,280
I’m also a member of this company.

289
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,960
I’m telling you

290
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
I’d rather lose my job than see you lie.

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
You did nothing wrong.

292
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
I don’t work here

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,920
but whatever you want to do,

294
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,560
I’m there for you.

295
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,720
OK.

296
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,240
Either go big or go home.

297
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,960
I won’t admit to it

298
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
and I’ll tell everyone

299
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
he stole my design.

300
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Stop drinking.

301
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,800
Too much alcohol will break you,

302
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
you know?

303
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,400
I’m already broken.

304
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
Is what you said that day

305
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,440
all true?

306
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
You still don’t believe

307
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
your teacher whom you’ve worshiped for so long

308
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
is actually a thief?

309
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,840
He did that more than once.

310
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
Five years ago,

311
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,760
he stole Fang Zhiyou’s design

312
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
of Tianyi Art Gallery.

313
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,120
He did not!

314
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,920
He did.

315
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
Or why do you think Fang Zhiyou and I left?

316
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,160
And I’ve told you before

317
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,240
things aren’t always

318
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,520
what they seem to be.

319
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
Your teacher,

320
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
my dear father

321
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
is a thief!

322
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,680
Then why did you help him?

323
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,840
You could have gotten back
at Fang Zhiyou otherwise.

324
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,360
If others find out

325
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
what you did,

326
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
your career will end.

327
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
Don’t you know that?

328
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
I don’t care.

329
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
As long as I can destroy Fang Zhiyou,

330
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
other things don’t matter.

331
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
Anyway,

332
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,800
I’ve already lost everything.

333
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
If you don’t care,

334
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
you wouldn’t be so sad.

335
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,120
Yuwen,

336
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,200
you’re different from your father.

337
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,440
You can’t live

338
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,080
with a guilty conscience.

339
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Listen to me,

340
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,560
you should tell Mr. Wei

341
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,880
the truth.

342
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
Did you hear yourself?

343
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,920
If I tell him the truth,

344
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,880
your teacher will be doomed.

345
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,680
So are Liangshan

346
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
and you!

347
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,440
But what you did

348
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
is unfair to Fang Zhiyou!

349
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,040
What on earth is going on?

350
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,920
I thought you hate him.

351
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
I thought you love me.

352
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,080
I hate him because

353
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
I mistook him for betraying your father.

354
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,760
I do love you

355
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
and I’m jealous of Fang Zhiyou.

356
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
But they’re two different things.

357
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,680
You know how much effort

358
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,320
a designer invests in his work?

359
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,000
Stealing that

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,880
is like

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,080
stealing his baby.

362
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,440
Get me out of here.

363
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,400
I can’t be here anymore.

364
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
I don’t want to see those people again.

365
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
If you take me to leave,

366
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,800
I’ll marry you.

367
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,480
Can’t we think of other ways

368
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
to prove He Yuliang copied your design?

369
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,560
Theoretically speaking,

370
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
he could barely finish

371
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,920
the design overnight.

372
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
I don’t think he had time

373
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,360
to make a model.

374
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Right?

375
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,360
A model isn’t required.

376
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,480
He doesn’t need it.

377
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,720
He deleted the sails.

378
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,760
Uh...

379
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,680
well...

380
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,520
with all due respect,

381
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
I think without them...

382
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Bai, it’s me.

383
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,880
I need materials for modeling.

384
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,640
Send them to Square & Circle

385
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,240
ASAP!

386
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,840
What are you doing?

387
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,880
Can someone tell me?

388
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,000
All done!

389
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,680
Hope it’s not too late.

390
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,440
Guys, guys,

391
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,400
I just got the news.

392
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,040
Tomorrow,

393
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,680
Fond and Liangshan will sign the contract.

394
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,880
There will be a press conference, too.

395
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,280
How shameless!

396
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,480
I guess

397
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
that’s our last chance.

398
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,920
Thank you all reporters for coming.

399
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,160
= Fond & Liangshan Signing Ceremony =
Zhiwu Library

400
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,200
is our first provincial cultural tourism project

401
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,040
and the most important project

402
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,440
to Fond in the next three years.

403
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,880
We’ll be working with

404
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,160
Liangshan

405
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
and

406
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,280
Professor He

407
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,840
who’s one of the most renowned designers.

408
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,120
And we’re so glad

409
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,040
to have him lead this project.

410
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,960
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

411
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,480
This project

412
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,320
is of profound meaning.

413
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,760
I

414
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,120
and

415
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,240
everyone else of Liangshan

416
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
feel greatly honored.

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
We’ll do our utmost

418
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,480
and make Zhiwu Library

419
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,920
a local

420
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,560
and a national landmark.

421
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,640
Very well. Thank you both.

422
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,840
The signing

423
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
shall begin.

424
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,720
Mr. Wei!

425
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,000
Mr. Wei,

426
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,480
to spare yourself from regret,

427
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,840
I think

428
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,240
you should wait a few more minutes.

429
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,880
Mr. Fang,

430
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,600
what are you doing?

431
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,760
If Zhiwu Library is really that important,

432
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,400
Mr. Wei,

433
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
you should be more cautious.

434
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
If Liangshan’s design

435
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
is a work of plagiarism,

436
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,320
that will become the biggest stain

437
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,360
on the library.

438
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,480
Fang Zhiyou,

439
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,480
you’re my student.

440
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,160
I’ve always been lenient with you.

441
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,400
Yet here you are framing me.

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,400
You stole my design

443
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
to bid for this project.

444
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
How dare you show up in front of me again!

445
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Lies can be many

446
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,160
but there’s only one truth.

447
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600
I’m here today

448
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
to show you

449
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,040
who the liar is.

450
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,520
Mr. Fang,

451
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
as far as I know,

452
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,360
you were Professor He’s best student.

453
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
You left Liangshan five years ago

454
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,480
and since then

455
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,040
you’ve refused to acknowledge him as your teacher.

456
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
What happened

457
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,160
between you two?

458
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,600
I don’t think that’s relevant to this incident.

459
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,040
It certainly is.

460
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,240
Everyone in this circle knows

461
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
Professor He always

462
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,240
speaks highly of you

463
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,680
while you

464
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,480
put on a long face hearing his name.

465
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
Isn’t that disrespectful

466
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,920
to your teacher who led you into this industry?

467
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
Are you sure about this?

468
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
Are you having second thoughts?

469
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,720
We understand

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
what you’re trying to say.

471
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,880
You’re implying

472
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,760
that Mr. Fang

473
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,200
held a grudge against Professor He,

474
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,680
so he copied his design

475
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,800
and came here to make a scene.

476
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,240
Right?

477
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
I’m simply stating the fact.

478
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,360
Others are entitled

479
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,560
to form their own opinion.

480
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,200
“Fact”?

481
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
People always think they’re telling the fact,

482
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
but actually,

483
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,320
it’s only what others want to hear.

484
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,720
I know a person

485
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,640
who never cares about what others want

486
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,040
or don’t want to hear.

487
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,560
All he cares about

488
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,960
is nothing but the truth.

489
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,600
So, Mr. Wei,

490
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,680
do you want to hear the so-called fact

491
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,320
or uncover the truth yourself?

492
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,180
= Dad =

493
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,000
Fine.

494
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
I’ll give you a chance.

495
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
You only have one shot.

496
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,760
That’s enough.

497
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,840
Look,

498
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,960
this is

499
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,240
Square & Circle’s design.

500
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,400
Here we have

501
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,840
a model

502
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,240
made according to it.

503
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,360
That one

504
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,760
is Liangshan’s design

505
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,880
that Fond received.

506
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,720
They’re similar, right?

507
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,800
Even a nonprofessional

508
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
can tell

509
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,120
one must have copied the other.

510
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,680
Please look again

511
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,560
and find out

512
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
what their main difference is.

513
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
Yes. That one is short of two sails.

514
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,360
Correct.

515
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
It’s these two sails.

516
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Mr. Wei,

517
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,720
I guess

518
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,440
you think the sails

519
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,320
are unnecessary, right?

520
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,440
Let’s welcome Mr. Fang to explain to us

521
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,920
why he added

522
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,280
these two extra sails.

523
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,960
It fell!

524
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah.

525
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,280
It fell.

526
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,160
Mr. Wei,

527
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,920
I’m sure you know

528
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,360
that land of the library better than me.

529
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,920
There’s a sandy

530
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,760
and loose area

531
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,160
which isn’t fit for construction.

532
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
But that place

533
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,480
owns unique scenery.

534
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
After careful consideration,

535
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,520
I still decided

536
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,960
to build the main structure

537
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
right there.

538
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,560
The sails

539
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,440
are to

540
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,560
make the structure safe.

541
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,480
Mr. He Yuliang

542
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,120
has no idea

543
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,920
what the sails are for.

544
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,280
Mr. Wei,

545
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,040
you also thought

546
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,360
they were useless,

547
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,520
so they were deleted, right?

548
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Professor He,

549
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,760
if the library is built

550
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,280
based on your design,

551
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
I’m sure it’ll topple

552
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
within a few years.

553
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,240
What can it prove?

554
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,280
It only proves that my design is flawed.

555
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,240
You can’t prove I copied your design.

556
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I can!

557
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,560
Yuwen,

558
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
everyone is here.

559
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,600
Tell them,

560
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
who it was

561
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,440
that stole my design.

562
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,080
Dad,

563
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,800
it’s over now.

564
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,760
I’m He Yuliang’s daughter

565
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,840
He Yuwen

566
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
and also Executive Assistant at Square & Circle.

567
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,680
When bidding

568
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
for Zhiwu Library,

569
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,360
I took advantage of Fang Zhiyou’s trust

570
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
and stole his design

571
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,103
- for He Yuliang. - Is it true?

572
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,400
Then I lied to Mr. Wei

573
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,520
and accused Fang Zhiyou of plagiarism.

574
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
That’s the whole truth.

575
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,360
Yuwen,

576
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
what did he give you

577
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
that you’re speaking for him?

578
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
I’m your father!

579
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,760
That’s exactly why

580
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,440
I can’t let you sink deeper.

581
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,440
Besides,

582
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,440
five years ago,

583
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,240
He Yuliang won the award

584
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,240
for his design of Tianyi Art Gallery.

585
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:16,960
He Yuwen!

586
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
That design...

587
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
That design...

588
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,680
That design also belongs to Fang Zhiyou.

589
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,560
That’s why he and I

590
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,680
left Liangshan resolutely.

591
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,400
He did that five years ago.

592
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,280
That’s what really happened.

593
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,760
If you don’t believe my words,

594
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,760
I’ll show you the evidence in a while.

595
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,040
Professor He, is what your daughter said true?

596
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
Professor He, say something.

597
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,880
Why did you copy others’ works?

598
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,040
Professor He!

599
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,520
Sir!

600
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,800
Professor He, are you OK?

601
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,480
Sir, can you hear me?

602
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,640
How do you feel?

603
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,320
Professor He...

604
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,400
Stop asking him!

605
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,720
Sorry, please stop asking questions!

606
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,640
Professor He!

607
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
We need medical help.

608
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,520
Yes.

609
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,480
My teacher passed out.

610
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,160
Are you still going to leave?

611
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
You want me here?

612
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,240
How can Xu Yiren stand you?

613
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,120
She’s indeed better than me.

614
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,560
I apologize for what I said

615
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,520
to you earlier.

616
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,680
But I won’t apologize

617
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
for what I did.

618
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,600
You owed me that much.

619
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,400
Well, we’re even now.

620
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Guess I

621
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,840
don’t need to thank you.

622
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,800
Your father...

623
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,360
He had a stroke.

624
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,720
That will keep him in bed

625
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
for a considerably long time.

626
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,440
He had it coming.

627
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,640
I just feel sorry for my mom.

628
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,640
What’s your plan next?

629
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
My mom wants me to take over Liangshan.

630
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
It’s falling

631
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,760
but still, my father

632
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,200
devoted himself to it.

633
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,960
I haven’t made up my mind, though.

634
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Also,

635
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,040
I have something more important to do.

636
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,080
Are you leaving the city?

637
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,200
Where are you going?

638
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
I’ve promised Qiming

639
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,680
to find him.

640
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,120
I don’t want to disappoint him.

641
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,920
You and Chen Qiming...

642
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,360
I don’t like him

643
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,880
but that may not stop us

644
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
from being the best travel buddies.

645
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,240
Our plan

646
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,040
is to visit Mogao Caves first.

647
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,960
Then we’ll go see Notre Dame de Paris

648
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,560
or maybe the Northern Lights.

649
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,560
The world is big.

650
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,200
We have plenty of choices.

651
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
He’s a good man.

652
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,960
Stop right there.

653
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,680
You’re more annoying than my mom.

654
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
Well, who knows?

655
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,840
Maybe

656
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,520
as we go further and further,

657
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
I may grow fond of him

658
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,720
or during our trip,

659
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
his feeling for me may fade.

660
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,560
Anyway,

661
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,160
just let nature take its course.

662
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,280
He thinks the same.

663
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,200
Yuwen,

664
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,320
have a safe trip.

665
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,400
Goodbye.

666
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,640
Goodbye.

667
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,920
Suck it in! Suck it!

668
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,480
Come on! Xu Yiren, you can do it.

669
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
One, two, three, inhale!

670
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,440
One more time. Do it again.

671
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,573
One, two, three, inhale!

672
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:11,640
One, two, inhale!

673
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,160
Again. One more time.

674
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,880
One, two, inhale!

675
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,360
We did it!

676
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Finally!

677
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,120
I got it.

678
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,840
When I’m going to get married,

679
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,240
I’ll have to lose some weight first.

680
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,680
Are you calling me fat?

681
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,000
Xu Yiren,

682
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,880
you’re getting married

683
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,480
but I’m collapsing.

684
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,400
Gu Bo

685
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,560
won’t be easy on you.

686
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,120
I feel dizzy.

687
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,320
I can’t breathe.

688
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,880
Hang in there.

689
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,520
Yeah, right.

690
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,320
You had to

691
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,400
pick that gown.

692
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,880
There wasn’t your size,

693
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,320
and you chose a smaller one.

694
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,240
Hold it. It’ll be over soon.

695
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,400
You must show your best side.

696
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
When picking the wedding gown,

697
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,440
Fang Zhiyou loved this one the most.

698
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,360
Are you getting married or he is?

699
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,240
It’s your wedding gown.

700
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,640
You should have picked the one you like.

701
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,320
Wait,

702
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,680
isn’t Yiren

703
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,000
marrying my brother?

704
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
Exactly.

705
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Smarty-pants!

706
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,240
I like

707
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,360
whatever he likes.

708
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,040
That’s why

709
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,080
only the dumb ones get married.

710
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,640
Look at her.

711
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,480
She can’t stop mentioning her husband-to-be.

712
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
I agree.

713
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,920
You’re jealous.

714
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Wow!

715
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
Zhiyou, what are you doing here?

716
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
We’re getting married.

717
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,080
We don’t need to

718
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,080
please others.

719
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
This wedding gown...

720
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,640
I designed it for you.

721
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,320
You like it?

722
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,120
I do.

723
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,760
Why didn’t you show me earlier?

724
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
It’s a surprise.

725
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,120
Had he told you about it earlier,

726
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
we wouldn’t have had so much fun.

727
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah.

728
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,840
Excuse me.

729
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,160
You want fun?

730
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,880
There will be more later.

731
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,520
Are you interested?

732
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,120
Xu Yiren,

733
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
I have a hunch.

734
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,640
You won’t outsmart him.

735
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,320
Good luck with your marriage.

736
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,720
Today is the best day of my life.

737
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,240
Whatever you say won’t make me mad.

738
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,880
Got it.

739
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,720
You were wrong about one thing.

740
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,200
From now on,

741
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,840
every day

742
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
is the best day of your life.

743
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,640

744
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,760

As you all know,

771
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,200
I hate lies the most.

772
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,320
But someone I met

773
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,440
tells me

774
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
not all lies

775
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
are wrong.

776
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,600
I believe

777
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,080
marriage itself

778
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
is a big lie.

779
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,680
What is he talking about?

780
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,920
Is he crazy?

781
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,800
Is that a joke?

782
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,680
What’s happening?

783
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Did Xu Yiren

784
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,320
drive Fang Zhiyou mad again?

785
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,360
Is he going to cancel the wedding?

786
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
I dare he!

787
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,600
That lie tells us

788
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,400
marriage is happy and everlasting.

789
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Well, I don’t think so.

790
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,440
Sometimes,

791
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,280
we’d argue,

792
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
we’d disagree with

793
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760
or misunderstand each other.

794
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,120
But because that person

795
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,480
is Xu Yiren,

796
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,160
I’ve started to believe

797
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
all lies can come true.

798
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
In the past,

799
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,120
I had no dream

800
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,840
but I fantasized about

801
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,320
marrying a perfect man.

802
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,880
But the man I met

803
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,320
is not.

804
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,600
He’s unsophisticated,

805
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,160
stubborn and blunt.

806
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,520
You must have cheated.

807
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,840
Otherwise,

808
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,080
why do I always

809
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,960
give you full marks?

810
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,920
Gross!

811
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,400
All that I’ve learned,

812
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,360
met

813
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,720
and experienced

814
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,800
is to prepare for the day

815
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,200
that I found you.

816
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,480
Xu Yiren,

817
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
from now on,

818
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,280
I’ll always cherish you,

819
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,920
love you

820
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,360
and spend every day with you.

821
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,000
Thank you for agreeing to be my wife.

822
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,480
I’m also glad

823
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,680
that I found you.

824
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,720
Alright.

825
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

826
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,240
hold your balloons.

827
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,320
Next,

828
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,520
when the groom kisses the bride,

829
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,600
please release them.

830
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,800
Ready?

831
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Yes!

832
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,560
Alright.
