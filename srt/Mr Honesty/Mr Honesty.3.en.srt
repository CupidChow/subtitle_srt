After paying the Credit Pay, I’ve got little left.

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,380
Hello?

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,780
Hello, Xia Di?

Where are you?

27

Let me buy you dinner.

You sound so happy.

29
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,660
Win the lottery?

30
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,380
Better than that.

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,380
I’ve just received

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,300
my salary for the first month.

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,900
Well, I can’t easily

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
let you go then.

35
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,980
I’ve thought about it.

36
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,780
I want you to

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,260
cook a big meal for me.

38
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,380
Xia Di.

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,620
You don’t need to save money for me.

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,340
Who is saving money for you?

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,860
I love home dishes.

42
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,300
Tell me if you’ll cook.

43
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,300
Yes.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,660
I’ll cook whatever you want.

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,820
All right.

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,220
I’ll send the menu to you.

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,780
Bye-bye.

48
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,380
Okay. Bye-bye.

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,460
Mr. Fang?

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,140
You should always smile.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,460
What are you doing?

52
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,580
Sorry.

53
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,380
Sorry. Sorry.

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,580
Come on. What else can you do?

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,500
I was buying coffee for them,

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,060
and I got one cup for you.

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,780
When did you come in?

58
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,340
You didn’t make a sound.

59
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,060
Like a cat.

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,300
You drew it?

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,260
Hmm.

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,940
Well,

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,740
you should smile more.

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,340
Smile makes you younger.

65
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,860
By the way, when you smile,

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,620
you look cool.

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,620
As an assistant of a designer,

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,620
when you had time to buy coffee,

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,860
why didn’t you do your work well?

70
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Look at your poor drawing.

71
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,420
Out of the office,

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,020
don’t say you’re my assistant.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,660
Do you think it’s proud to be your assistant?

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,140
If it weren’t for money,

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,460
I wouldn’t have worked for you.

76
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,100
If you want to say something, say it out loud.

77
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,060
Or just shut up.

78
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,380
I want to say.

79
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,820
I’ve done the working schedule.

80
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,060
I’m getting it to you right away.

81
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,100
It’s so ugly.

82
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,340
I’m drawing better.

83
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Here is the soup.

84
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,740
What? Sneaking again?

85
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,860
Smells so good.

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,260
Sure.

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,820
I cooked them.

88
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,820
Does it taste good?

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,980
Sure.

90
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,020
Yiren, you cook super well.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,300
Seriously,

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,260
aren’t you going to run a restaurant?

93
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,620
I’ll be a shareholder.

94
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,260
Look how greatly you cook.

95
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,100
Every day,

96
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,660
your restaurant will enjoy great popularity.

97
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,940
I’ll promote it for you

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,700
and do some ads,

99
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,540
it’ll be an Internet-famous restaurant.

100
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,780
Then you’ll be Boss Xu.

101
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,540
You don’t need to serve other bosses.

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,100
How I wish the day would come!

103
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
What a pity!

104
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,300
Are you getting on well

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,780
with your Thanos boss?

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Why do you ask so?

107
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,340
You used to send me twenty messages

108
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,740
to complaint about him.

109
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,660
You obviously send fewer messages recently.

110
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,940
Do I?

111
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,820
I don’t realize it.

112
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Sorry.

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,300
You have to listen.

114
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,300
Have more to eat.

115
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
It doesn’t matter.

116
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,860
Whatever you say,

117
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,100
I won’t feel bad.

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,820
That’s why I like you.

119
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,820
If only

120
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,900
I could live as freely as you!

121
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,940
Just learn from your Thanos boss.

122
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,980
I can’t.

123
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,780
He can be really annoying sometimes.

124
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,300
But he never lies.

125
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,860
It does help.

126
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,260
At least I don’t need to

127
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,460
guess what he is thinking about every day.

128
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,740
He tells me whatever he thinks.

129
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,940
It’s great.

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,020
Though I want to kill him a hundred times.

131
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,820
In fact, I don’t believe that.

132
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,860
Who doesn’t lie in this world?

133
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,540
Just like how many men don’t cheat on girls?

134
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,900
Very few.

135
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,900
But he’s real.

136
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,700
I’m always curious.

137
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,340
Why doesn’t he ever lie?

138
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,460
Was he born to be like that

139
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,540
or was he hurt?

140
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,020
What?

141
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,980
Come on. Go on.

142
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
I’ll put it down.

143
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,100
For what?

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,940
I’m hitting the bottleneck when drawing.

145
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,860
All characters feel wrong.

146
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,980
You’re just inspiring me.

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,460
A macho CEO who never lies.

148
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,460
In comics,

149
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,820
he is

150
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,660
just like Inuyasha.

151
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,100
Wild, frank, and sharp.

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,580
A bit clumsy, too.

153
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,540
You must work hard

154
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,780
and take good care of him.

155
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,900
Collecting material for me.

156
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,820
Go on.

158

Ask designers to come for a meeting.

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,300
Okay.

160
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,300
Mr. Fang.

161
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,180
The cost sheet for commercial real estate projects

162
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,420
over the past three years.

163
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
You worked on it for two days.

164
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,780
But there are three errors.

165
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,420
What have you done?

166
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,180
Do we hire you to have fun?

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
You’ve got no time to learn it slowly.

168
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,260
Correct it and give it to me.

169
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,340
I checked it twice.

170
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,220
There shouldn’t be errors.

171
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,300
I’ll correct it right away.

172
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,900
I’ll see it tomorrow morning.

173
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,300
Tomorrow morning?

174
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,700
Sha Sha.

175
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,180
Come and do the minutes of a meeting.

176
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,460
Aye, Mr. Fang.

177
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,420
I see, Mr. Fang.

178
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,300
I’ll correct it right away.

179
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,900
What are you doing?

180
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,780
Ms. He.

181
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,260
You scared me out.

182
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,540
It’s so late and you’re still working?

183
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Go back early for some rest.

184
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,420
There’s always work to do.

185
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,460
It’s okay.

186
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,820
I’m almost done.

187
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,100
Mr. Fang wants it urgently.

188
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,820
You’re doing two sorts?

189
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,380
I’m afraid I’ll give wrong data again.

190
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,980
So, I’m doing it by two ways of sorting.

191
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,420
If the data are right,

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,580
there will be no problem.

193
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,980
Xu Yiren.

194
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
I underestimated you.

195
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,940
Don’t you remember?

196
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,180
When I hired you, I told you.

197
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
What I value the most

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,860
was your adaptability.

199
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,780
Now it seems that

200
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,380
you’re also professional.

201
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,460
Thank you, Ms. He.

202
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,260
You know,

203
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,380
I’m a bit clumsy.

204
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,860
I must work harder.

205
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,420
Are you done?

206
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,260
Almost.

207
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,420
Shall we

208
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
go for a midnight snack?

209
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:26,940
Hmm.

210
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,100
Here. Your dishes are ready.

211
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,900
- Thank you. - Enjoy yourselves.

212
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,660
So many dishes?

213
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,620
It’s not good to eat too much at night.

214
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,580
It’s okay, Ms. He.

215
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,220
Come on. Have a try.

216
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,700
It’s okay when we eat occasionally.

217
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,220
Don’t call me Ms. He when we’re off work.

218
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,940
Hmm.

219
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,740
Yuwen.

220
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,820
May I ask a question?

221
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,860
Sure, go ahead.

222
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,020
Mr. Fang.

223
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,380
Does he really never lie?

224
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,380
What? Why do you suddenly ask?

225
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,660
I’m just curious.

226
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,460
How can a man

227
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,100
never tell a lie?

228
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,980
Isn’t it tiring?

229
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,460
So, you think telling the truth

230
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,780
is more tiring than telling a lie?

231
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,540
No.

232
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,940
I don’t mean that.

233
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,140
But I think

234
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,780
sometimes we can finish something

235
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,180
with a few lies.

236
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,460
But he’s always so serious.

237
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,060
It does no good to him at all.

238
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
So,

239
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,540
it’s how Fang Zhiyou lives.

240
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,020
In my opinion,

241
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,020
you get on well with others

242
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,740
and you’re good at thinking in others’ positions.

243
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
That’s what Fang Zhiyou can’t do.

244
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,020
I hope you can help him with that.

245
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,180
Uh...

246
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
Was Mr. Fang

247
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,860
cheated or hurt?

248
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,500
Why is he so sensitive to lies?

249
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Let me tell you something.

250
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,660
In the office,

251
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
work harder,

252
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,780
gossip less.

253
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,540
Got it?

254
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,540
Yes.

255
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,300
Enjoy the food.

256
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,420
Try the chicken wing.

257
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620
It tastes great.

258
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
It’s the signature dish.

259
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,860
Mr. Fang.

260
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,180
Mr. Fang.

261
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,180
Is it okay?

262
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,180
Hmm. Okay.

263
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,900
Make a file of the duration and land price

264
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,980
for real estate projects

265
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,700
as big as Xingcheng project.

266
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,860
You have three days

267
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
to complete it.

268
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,380
You mean

269
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
the projects of other companies?

270
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes. All projects.

271
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,620
What?

272
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,060
Any problem?

273
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
No.

274
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
I’ll get back to my work, then.

275
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,580
Wait a second.

276
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,660
I’m going out in five minutes.

277
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,940
Go with me.

278
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,780
Okay.

279
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,980
Don’t you have memories?

280
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,420
You just gave me some work.

281
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,740
And now you want me to go out with you.

282
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,940
I’ve got only 24 hours a day.

283
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,380
Hello, Xia Di?

284
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,740
Hello, Yiren?

285
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,300
Emergency alert.

286
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,820
Deadline?

287
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,940
Worse than that.

288
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,100
Little Witch is guarding out there.

289
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,460
I’m dead meat.

290
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,820
Hurry. Come and save me.

291
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,460
Xia Di.

292
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,180
Why does it take you so long to get changed?

293
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,100
But I’m going out for business with Mr. Fang.

294
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,620
Wait when I finish.

295
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,060
Then I’ll go save you, all right?

296
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,780
I can’t wait.

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,500
I’ve been waiting for three hours.

298
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,100
Hurry up, Xu Yiren.

299
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,340
You can’t leave me in danger.

300
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,060
But I...

301
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,780
Xu Yiren.

302
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,580
Let’s go.

303
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,900
Okay. Be right there.

304
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,820
No! I’m afraid Little Witch will come in.

305
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,300
I’ll hang up.

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
The same old way. Hurry.

307
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,900
What? Hello?

308
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060
Xia Di?

309
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,900
Lucky Gu.

310
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,100
Could you do me a favor?

311
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,140
What’s the problem?

312
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Don’t worry. Just tell me.

313
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,460
I will...

314
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,340
Be a hero and go save a beauty.

315
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,060
A beauty is waiting to be saved.

316
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,380
Beauty?

317
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,860
Hmm.

318
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,260
Flower shop?

319
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,540
It’s not his style.

320
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,260
What do you think of this?

321
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,500
It doesn’t matter what I think of it.

322
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,660
Pick the one you like.

323
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,620
Just answer me.

324
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,420
Enthusiastic and elegant.

325
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,300
Its flower language is

326
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,180
gratitude.

327
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,180
But...

328
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,340
it’s better for your mother or elders.

329
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,020
Anyway, it looks pleasant.

330
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,380
It’s baby’s breath.

331
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,260
Its flower language is

332
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,300
waiting for love.

333
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,780
But it looks dull alone.

334
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,740
You’d better buy some other flowers.

335
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,620
How do you know

336
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,980
so many flower languages?

337
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,740
I read a lot of comics.

338
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,260
Uh...

339
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,460
What represents apology?

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,180
What?

341
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,780
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

342
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,020
I didn’t hear you.

343
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,620
Nothing.

344
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,100
Who is he buying flowers for?

345
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,540
He picks so seriously.

346
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,020
Girlfriend?

347
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
No way.

348
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,980
Who can be his girlfriend?

349
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,540
What?

350
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,220
Don’t think I don’t know what you’re wondering.

351
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,580
I don’t plan to buy flowers for you.

352
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,620
When did I say you would buy flowers for me?

353
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,660
I’m not that narcissistic.

354
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,540
Fine, then.

355
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,380
Madam.

356
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,140
Hmm?

357
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
Pack a bouquet of lilies.

358
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,100
Okay.

359
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,700
I think your girlfriend likes chrysanthemum.

360
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,180
Would you like some, too?

361
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,020
- I’m not... - I’m not blind.

362
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,500
What are you waiting for?

363
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,260
Just pay for it.

364
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,260
I’ll wait for you in the car.

365
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,860
I’m not angry.

366
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,820
I’m not angry.

367
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,620
I’m not blind, either.

368
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Come on, Xia Di.

369
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,540
Stop struggling.

370
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,620
I’m telling you. I won’t leave,

371
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,900
unless I get the manuscript.

372
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,660
Stop saying anything, all right?

373
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,300
I’m not used to having someone else around.

374
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,180
I had a bit of inspiration.

375
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,900
When you talked, I lost it.

376
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,700
All right. All right.

377
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,340
I’ll shut up.

378
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,900
I’ll see what other reason
you have to stall for time.

379
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,220
Xu Yiren.

380
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,860
Why isn’t she coming yet?

381
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,220
I’m running out of drawing paper.

382
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,780
Where are you going?

383
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,420
No drawing paper. I’ll go get some from my bedroom.

384
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:03,860
Go ahead.

385
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,500
Hmm.

386
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,900
Wait.

387
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,780
Xia Di.

388
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,340
Hmm.

389
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,460
Why do I think

390
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,500
you’re hiding something from me?

391
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
What can I hide from you?

392
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,900
My biggest job is to give you the manuscript.

393
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,460
You’re right.

394
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,260
But Xia Di, you know what?

395
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,660
You will not leave this house

396
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,380
before you give me the manuscript.

397
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,260
Hey.

398
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,380
Xia Di.

399
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,620
Why do you lock the door for getting paper?

400
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,580
Are you really hiding something from me?

401
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,660
Xia Di, I’m warning you.

402
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,340
Don’t try to jump off the building.

403
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,460
You’re on the second floor.

404
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,300
If you jump, you’ll die.

405
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Die?

406
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,260
If I die, who will give you the manuscript?

407
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,940
Are you alright?

408
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,980
- Why are you? - You?

409
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,740
Where’s Xu Yiren?

410
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,700
I didn’t know you were Yiren’s friend.

411
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,740
She asked me to save a beauty.

412
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,580
I didn’t expect to see you.

413
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,620
What do you mean saving?

414
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,540
How did you come?

415
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,140
Xia Di.

416
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,940
Stop!

417
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,060
Hurry! Take me away.

418
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,740
Hurry up.

419
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,540
Go. Go.

420
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,100
Hurry. Hurry.

421
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,060
Go. Go.

422
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,300
Xia Di, where are you going?

423
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,540
Don’t dream to run away

424
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,780
before you give me the manuscript.

425
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,620
Hold me tight.

426
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,020
Look how I ride the bike.

427
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,940
Not bad, huh?

428
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,980
Stop.

429
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,180
What? Hurry. Hold me tight.

430
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
Or she’ll catch up.

431
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,580
What?

432
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,220
Why do you jump off the bike?

433
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,900
Where are you taking me?

434
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,620
To have dinner.

435
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,060
Who is going to have dinner with you?

436
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:14,980
Come on.

437
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,140
We met for the second time.

438
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,540
We should have dinner together.

439
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,860
Besides,

440
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,660
I just got you out of that place.

441
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
Show some gratitude

442
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,900
and let me buy you dinner.

443
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,500
I’ll take your silence as a yes.

444
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,180
What’s he doing?

445
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,900
When he gives flowers to his girlfriend,

446
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,180
why does he take me as a third wheel?

447
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,540
No way.

448
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,820
How...

449
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,380
How could he have a girlfriend?

450
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,980
Oh, he wants to chase a girl.

451
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,860
He doesn’t know what to do, so he takes me.

452
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,380
What a tragedy to be his assistant!

453
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,420
I have to take care of such problem.

454
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,340
Be careful.

455
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,780
Oh.

456
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,180
- I’m fine. - I mean my flowers.

457
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,300
If you lose one leaf,

458
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,660
I’ll cut down your salary.

459
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,340
Isn’t it a bad idea, Mr. Fang?

460
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,860
If you don’t want it, okay.

461
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,420
Do me a favor.

462
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Unrelated to work.

463
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,620
Does he really want to chase a girl?

464
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,340
And I’m right about it?

465
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,300
The girl he adores

466
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
works in the nursing home.

467
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,940
She must be a kind girl.

468
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
No wonder she can bear with him.

469
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,060
Why are you staring at me?

470
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,580
I’m not.

471
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,300
I am.

472
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,220
See?

473
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,060
Room 510 over there.

474
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,060
Give the bouquet

475
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,220
to an old man in that room

476
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,300
named Li Jinghong.

477
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,820
Old man?

478
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,500
Who else do you expect?

479
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,180
No one.

480
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,860
I expect no one.

481
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,060
He is...

482
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,780
Don’t ask.

483
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,820
Just give him the bouquet.

484
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,820
Wish him well.

485
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,740
I’ll be waiting here.

486
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,020
Oh.

487
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,820
Hop to it!

488
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,820
Okay.

489
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,380
Sir.

490
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,340
I come to visit you on behalf of a friend.

491
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,620
Sir?

492
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,900
Sir?

493
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,140
Can you hear me?

494
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,620
I come to give you the bouquet.

495
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,300
Sir?

496
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,180
You must be Zhe’s teacher.

497
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,500
Did he

498
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,900
do something mischievous again?

499
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,540
Sorry to brother you.

500
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,980
No. No.

501
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,220
No.

502
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,060
I’m not...

503
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,020
I apologize for him.

504
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,220
Have an apple.

505
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,700
Take it.

506
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
Apple.

507
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,420
Thank you.

508
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,700
No. It’s not for you.

509
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,020
It’s for Zhe.

510
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,300
No way.

511
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,460
No. It’s for Zhe.

512
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,180
It’s for him.

513
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,140
What’s wrong, sir?

514
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,780
Zhe.

515
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,620
It’s for him.

516
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,500
Sir.

517
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,780
Nurse!

518
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,300
Hurry!

519
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,300
Sir.

520
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,020
Sir, are you alright?

521
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,660
Nurse.

522
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,380
Go get the doctor.

523
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,180
What’s happening?

524
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,740
I don’t know.

525
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,940
I’ve done nothing.

526
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,580
- Dr. Liu. - He suddenly passed out.

527
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,900
Patient in Room 501 passed out.

528
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,420
It’s too late. Send him to hospital.

529
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,220
Slow down.

530
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,220
Be careful.

531
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,620
You know what?

532
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,300
Soup in this shop is super delicious.

533
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,660
Especially tasty.

534
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Come on. Have a try.

535
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,580
It tastes great.

536
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,140
Goddess.

537
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,060
What’s your job?

538
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,540
Guess.

539
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,300
I found you so cool

540
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,260
when you rode the motorcycle.

541
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,460
Considering your skill,

542
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,340
you should have ridden a motorcycle

543
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,620
with an engine displacement over 1,000.

544
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,260
You know motorcycles?

545
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,500
Sure.

546
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,940
I’m a high-level player

547
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
with the collection of over 30 motorcycles.

548
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,020
But in the game only.

549
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,140
Wait. Let me show you something.

550
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,860
What do you think of this?

551
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,540
I don’t really understand the girl stuff.

552
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,780
I drew it.

553
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,660
You?

554
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,500
Look. So colorful.

555
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,500
It’s amazing.

556
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,260
Come on.

557
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,700
I think we have

558
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,340
great luck to meet each other.

559
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,300
Oh, and we’re of the same occupation.

560
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,820
You’re a cartoonist, too?

561
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,900
You can’t be.

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,300
Aren’t you Yiren’s colleague?

563
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,300
Me?

564
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,220
I’m an intern designer in Square & Circle.

565
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,020
Look.

566
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,540
We both create beautiful things with hands.

567
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,260
Generally speaking,

568
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,660
I’m a graphic designer.

569
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,780
You draw comics and I draw blueprints.

570
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,340
But I think

571
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,820
love will make us

572
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,220
get together.

573
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,980
Waitress.

574
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,980
Waitress.

575
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,860
Bill, please.

576
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,260
You only had a little.

577
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,186
- Why don’t you eat more? - Hello, how will you pay?

578
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,420
Credit card.

579
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
Here. No password.

580
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,620
Sorry, sir.

581
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,660
This card is unavailable.

582
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,020
How is it possible?

583
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Try it again.

584
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,620
It makes no sense.

585
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,180
Sorry, but it can’t be used.

586
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,420
It doesn’t matter. Use mine.

587
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,220
Here.

588
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,380
- Done. - Thank you.

589
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,180
- What are you doing? - You’re welcome.

590
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,340
I said it was my treat.

591
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,700
Come on.

592
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,780
I’m not a cruel girl.

593
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,820
I won’t let you pay.

594
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,860
Keep your money for milk tea, little boy.

595
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,620
You know what? I never owe anyone.

596
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,300
How about this? Friend me on WeChat.

597
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,260
You paid this time.

598
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,060
Next time, I’ll pay.

599
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,980
Let’s visit

600
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,860
all popular restaurants happily together.

601
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,380
What do you think?

602
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,820
It’s a deal, then.

603
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,140
We’ll see.

604
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,780
Why does my phone fail at such a critical moment?

605
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,860
Wait a moment.

606
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,100
I’m not a little boy.

607
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,620
Mr. Fang.

608
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,740
I’ve done nothing.

609
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,980
He just passed out.

610
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,620
I don’t know what happened.

611
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,660
Sorry.

612
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,260
If I responded more cleverly,

613
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,500
he might not have passed out.

614
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,140
It was not your fault.

615
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,140
Don’t worry.

616
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,020
I’m here.

617
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,780
It’ll be okay.

618
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
How is he, doctor?

619
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,500
Luckily, he was sent here in time.

620
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,740
We brought him back.

621
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,180
But he suffers from hypertension.

622
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,940
He must stay under observation for a couple of days.

623
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,260
Thank you, doctor.

624
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,860
You’re his families, aren’t you?

625
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,420
Go pay the charges.

626
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,980
I’m a friend of his family.

627
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Well, contact his family right away.

628
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Ask them to come and take care of him.

629
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,060
His family

630
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,700
might be abroad now.

631
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,900
You should tell them, anyway.

632
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,180
All right.

633
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,620
I’ll pay the expenses.

634
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,060
Xu Yiren.

635
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,380
Hmm?

636
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,140
Go pay the expenses.

637
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,860
Okay.

638
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,980
Excuse me.

639
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,300
A patient Li Jinghong was just sent here.

640
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,980
Which ward is he in?

641
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,220
Please wait.

642
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,220
Mr. Fang.

643
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,500
I’ve paid the expenses.

644
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,940
Let’s go then.

645
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,260
Ah?

646
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,860
Won’t we wait until he wakes up?

647
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,540
You contacted his family?

648
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,340
His family

649
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,740
wouldn’t like to see us.

650
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,020
Nor would the old man.

651
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,540
They hate you?

652
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,460
Yes.

653
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,580
Mr. Fang.

654
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,460
Must we stay for tonight?

655
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,380
The old man is in hospital.

656
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,300
I worry about him.

657
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,380
I’ll go check on him tomorrow.

658
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,780
We’ll go back after we confirm he’s okay.

659
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,220
We can go back

660
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,220
and come tomorrow.

661
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,980
Or shall I go back alone by coach

662
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,540
and come tomorrow?

663
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,340
But look how late it is.

664
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,540
What coach can you catch?

665
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,940
Give me your ID card.

666
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,940
Oh.

667
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,620
My purse is lost.

668
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,860
My cash, ID card

669
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,500
and other cards are in it.

670
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,540
Think about where you lost it.

671
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,340
In the hospital, I guess.

672
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,420
I used it at the hospital lobby.

673
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,820
After that,

674
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,860
I didn’t see it.

675
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,500
Make a call to report the loss.

676
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,940
Let’s look for it in the hospital tomorrow.

677
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,780
I’ve got no other option.

678
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,660
What bad luck!

679
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
We have to share one room.

680
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,100
One room?

681
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,460
Share one room with you?

682
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,300
Is it okay to share one room?

683
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,460
I’m the one to worry, aren’t I?

684
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,500
Go have a bath.

685
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,460
Bath? What bath?

686
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,260
Xu Yiren.

687
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,980
Stop imagining things.

688
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,700
Like I said, I’m not blind.

689
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,500
I’m going to the supermarket.

690
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,700
Before I come back,

691
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,900
clean yourself.

692
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,140
What are you going to the supermarket for?

693
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,260
To buy some daily necessities.

694
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,940
Buy daily necessities in the supermarket?

695
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,700
Psychopath!

696
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,540
Hello, Xia Di?

697
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,180
Xu Yiren, you’re damn good.

698
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,460
You should have come and saved me.

699
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
Why did Gu Bo come instead?

700
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,180
I was truly too busy to go.

701
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
What? Did Gu Bo help?

702
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,100
Kind of.

703
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,540
Anyway, I managed to escape.

704
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,180
What about you? Where are you?

705
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,780
I’m in a hotel.

706
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,940
Excuse me?

707
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,860
I’m in a hotel.

708
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,460
I lost my purse.

709
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,980
I can’t check in.

710
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,780
I have to share one room

711
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,980
with Fang Zhiyou.

712
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,500
But the room looks good.

713
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,060
Wait. Wait.

714
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,100
Say it again.

715
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,860
Get to the point.

716
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,460
Point?

717
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
The point is that I’ve lost my purse.

718
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,540
No. No. No.

719
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
That’s not the point.

720
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,820
I...

721
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,700
Sorry.

722
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,980
I shouldn’t be calling you

723
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,860
at this moment.

724
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,740
I’ll hang up.

725
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,220
Bye-bye.

726
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,420
Hold on.

727
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,900
Yes.

728
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,580
Where’s Fang Zhiyou?

729
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,540
He went to buy some daily necessities.

730
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,820
And he asked me to have a bath.

731
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,380
I used to think you had a funny boss.

732
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,780
Now I really admire him.

733
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,900
Why does he need to buy daily necessities?

734
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,260
The hotel provides them.

735
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,220
What a little fool you are!

736
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,980
Anyway, he’s a responsible man.

737
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,780
What are you talking about?

738
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,780
Condoms.

739
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,500
He’s buying the condoms.

740
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,460
Don’t scare me.

741
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,540
Don’t be shy.

742
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,820
He has bad temper.

743
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,980
But he’s young and rich.

744
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,140
If he wants you,

745
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,140
just embrace him and enjoy yourself.

746
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

747
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,020
I’m hanging up.

748
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,460
Bye-bye.

749
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,500
I’ll wait for good news.

750
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,900
Shut up.

751
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,660
Bye-bye.

752
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,100
She hung up?

753
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,180
What the hell!

754
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,660
Can it be true?

755
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,300
= ID Card of Xu Yiren =

756
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,420
Bai.

757
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,620
Check on this girl.

758
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,660
I want to know her relationship with Fang Zhiyou.

759
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,380
I’ll do it tomorrow.

760
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,580
By the way,

761
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,380
the girl you asked me to look for.

762
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,300
I’ve got too little information.

763
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,820
I haven’t got a clue yet.

764
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,020
I know.

765
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,860
But whatever it takes,

766
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
I must find her.

767
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,500
You’re doing a good job.

768
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,420
There’s no rush.

769
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,180
Let’s do our job first.

770
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,500
Aye.

771
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,420
Don’t fiddle with things.

772
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,220
What do I do?

773
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,780
Will I really share one room with him?

774
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,540
What are you nervous at?

775
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,700
Xu Yiren.

776
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,260
Stop flattering yourself.

777
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,420
Stop thinking of what Xia Di said.

778
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,580
Why do I feel a bit dizzy?

779
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,300
I can hardly breathe.

780
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,820
Seriously, Xu Yiren.

781
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,620
What a loser you are!

782
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,780
I can’t stand it.

783
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,940
I really feel dizzy.

784
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,820
Xu Yiren?

785
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,420
Xu Yiren?

786
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,740
Are you in?

787
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,460
Answer me, or I’ll break in.

788
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,300
Xu Yiren?

789
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,620
Mr. He.

790
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,940
As a leading authority

791
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,060
in the industry of architectural design,

792
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,860
what do you think of

793
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,700
its current development?

794
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,100
We can say that

795
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,180
we’re in a golden age

796
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,380
when there are many different styles

797
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,060
and unlimited contents.

798
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,460
For example,

799
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,300
Huaxing International Movie World

800
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,540
is a new project.

801
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,820
You’re also interested in that project?

802
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,780
Sure, we must keep up with times.

803
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,020
We’re very interested in

804
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,180
Huaxing project.

805
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,020
I believe

806
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,180
we’ll get a satisfactory result

807
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,980
in the future bidding.

808
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,220
Sounds like

809
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,540
you’re confident in getting the project.

810
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,460
Let’s wait and see.

811
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,180
As a senior in the design industry,

812
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,980
I hope

813
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,900
all excellent designers

814
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,580
will take active parts.

815
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,140
We’ll have a fair competition.

816
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,580
Xu Yiren?

817
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,380
Xu Yiren, wake up.

818
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,580
Xu Yiren?

819
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,060
How do you feel?

820
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,900
Where am I?

821
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,020
Where are you?

822
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,340
You’re sick,

823
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,700
instead of having a car crash.

824
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Don’t pretend you’ve lost your memory.

825
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,060
Condoms.

826
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,820
He’s buying the condoms.

827
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,380
Why is it a thermometer?

828
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,620
What else do you expect?

829
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,180
You don’t even know you’re sick.

830
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,980
37.9 ℃.

831
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,140
You have a slight fever.

832
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,060
I felt something wrong with you in the lobby.

833
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,220
Maybe you caught a cold in the car.

834
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,500
Come on.

835
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,300
Take the medicine.

836
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,220
How do you feel now?

837
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,540
Wow, Thanos can be so thoughtful.

838
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,540
I’ll no longer call you Thanos.

839
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,260
Ah?

840
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,220
What did you say?

841
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,420
Nothing.

842
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,780
I’m getting to sleep.

843
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,060
I’ve got a lot to do tomorrow.

844
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,980
Do you really think I’m a cruel boss?

845
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,140
Hello, Yuwen?

846
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,540
Hello, Zhiyou?

847
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Are you asleep?

848
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,020
If you’re not, come out for a drink.

849
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,580
I can’t go.

850
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,220
You can’t?

851
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,500
Where are you?

852
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,140
I’m in the hotel.

853
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,060
Alone?

854
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,580
No.

855
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,940
With Xu Yiren.

856
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,140
Why are you...

857
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,500
Why?

858
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,420
We’ve got some pending problems.

859
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,060
So, we stay in the hotel today.

860
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,580
What?

861
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,380
What do you want me for?

862
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,700
Oh.

863
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,900
I just want to

864
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,940
discuss with you

865
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,700
about Huaxing International Movie World.

866
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,140
Zhiyou.

867
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,260
We’re facing a fierce competition.

868
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,540
