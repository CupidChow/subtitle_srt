= Episode 14 =

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,280
Liars gotta pay the price.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Look.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,480
You have to eat alone,

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,960
and you can’t go home.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,840
What are you afraid of?

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,640
He won’t eat you alive.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,160
Hotpot?

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,160
Eating hotpot alone sucks.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Burger?

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
Just had it for lunch.

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,400
Chinese cuisine?

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,160
I can’t finish that many dishes.

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
It’d be a waste of food.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,520
This looks greasy.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,680
Taste it.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
So good!

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
Try one yourself.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Shiyu,

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
below it first.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Yum yum!

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,800
Cheers!

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,360
Eat my favorite foods on a stick then.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,040
I’m gonna order 50 yuan worth of them.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,120
How did I

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
end up here?

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,520
I thought you didn’t like this.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
I’m hungry.

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
- You first. - You first.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
After you.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
After you.

50
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
It’s your favorite.

51
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,280
Aren’t these

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,760
foods on a stick that we had last time?

53
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,440
You’re back too late.

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,080
I already gobbled down a Big Mac.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,800
I’m going to bed.

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,480
Let’s talk.

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
About what?

58
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
About

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,520
why you lied to me

60
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,880
and said you went to see Xia Di.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
Well,

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
a long story.

63
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
I’ve got a whole night.

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,520
What’s wrong?

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
You want to move out

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,920
or you’re sick of

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,400
cooking for me and my sister?

68
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,960
Neither.

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Then what’s your reason?

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,240
You don’t want to see me?

71
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,400
No.

72
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
I said

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
I went to Xia Di’s

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,280
not because I didn’t want to see you

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,920
but I just couldn’t.

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,520
Why?

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Why?

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
You ask me why?

79
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
Did you forget you said

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
you were jealous?

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
I know

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
you didn’t mean that.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
How could you be jealous of me and Li Zhe?

84
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Yes.

85
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
You still owe me an explanation.

86
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
Where exactly did you get hurt?

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,440
Why did Li Zhe ask you out?

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,800
You won’t let that go, will you?

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
Here’s the thing.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,760
I didn’t want to practice driving,

91
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,920
so I lied to my coach that my hand was injured.

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Somehow, Li Zhe

93
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,840
got that from my coach.

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Then he sent me flowers.

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,640
You know the rest of it.

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
That’s it.

97
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,800
In a word,

98
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,280
your lie

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
led to all that.

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,960
When you put it like that,

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
I can’t refute it.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
It’s all clear now,

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,880
isn’t it?

104
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
How did I know

105
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,960
Li Zhe would find out about that

106
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,360
or

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
he’d send me flowers?

108
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
Nor would I ever expect

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,520
that you’d be so mad about it.

110
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,640
You owe me.

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,880
What?

112
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,920
You need to ask?

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,600
Why did I say I was jealous?

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,720
Because I got bent out of shape.

115
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,640
Why did I get bent out of shape?

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,880
Because Li Zhe asked you out.

117
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
Why did Li Zhe ask you out?

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Because you lied.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
If we take out those things in the middle,

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
I only said I was jealous

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
because you lied.

122
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
I see.

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
You’re eager to prove

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,960
that you weren’t jealous.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,960
You were mad because I lied.

126
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Right?

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
I hear you.

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,840
Loud and clear.

129
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,000
100%!

130
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Anyway,

131
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
look,

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
if you want to work as my assistant,

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,520
my requirement is the same.

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,440
Do not

135
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,160
lie through your teeth.

136
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Otherwise...

137
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,920
Otherwise, you’ll fire me.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,760
Right?

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,800
I know.

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,680
I totally got that.

141
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,680
Mr. Fang,

142
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
I’ll follow your order to the word.

143
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,960
May I

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
eat now?

145
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,920
Didn’t you say you’re hungry?

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,120
Why aren’t you eating?

147
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,320
Was that a lie?

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,160
Not anymore.

149
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,680
Clearly, I thought too much.

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,640
That’s a mistake.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes.

152
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,160
That thing he said

153
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,520
is a mistake.

154
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,800
Is it a mistake?

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,760
Is it?

156
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
Princess,

157
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
give me those bags. I can carry them.

158
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,560
Why?

159
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
I’m a gentleman.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
A gentleman should carry a girl’s bags,

161
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,040
right?

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
Are you OK?

163
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,440
Forget it. Let me...

164
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,920
No, no, no.

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,880
I’m fine. No worries.

166
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,920
My idol once said

167
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
men can’t say no.

168
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I got it.

169
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,840
You know what kind of man

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,800
I dislike the most?

171
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
What?

172
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,960
Braggers.

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,640
Give me.

174
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
Princess,

175
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
do you also think I’m useless?

176
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,560
If all you can do is to carry my bags,

177
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
then you’re useless.

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
But as a young man,

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,960
a friend and eye candy,

180
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,640
you’re important to me.

181
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,840
Really?

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,920
Yeah.

183
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Whenever I’d like to have a change of taste,

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,000
you can always find

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
the perfect restaurant for me.

186
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
To me,

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,680
you’re a walking yelp.com.

188
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,560
Also,

189
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
every time I’m stuck

190
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,660
and I can’t continue drawing,

191
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,680
I’ll think of ways to bully you.

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,160
And that

193
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
will give me inspiration.

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Can’t you think of ways to be nice to me?

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,360
Pardon?

196
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,560
Good choice.

197
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,480
I’m your doormat.

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,760
I love being bullied.

199
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,240
Look, you’re doing it again.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
You say yes to everything I say.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
So whenever we’re together,

202
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,360
I can always feel relaxed.

203
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
Aren’t you sweet?

204
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Super sweet!

205
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
If you don’t stop,

206
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
I’ll assume that you like me.

207
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
You’re right.

208
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,520
I like you the most.

209
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,400
You’re so adorable!

210
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,240
Let’s go.

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Princess said she likes me.

212
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
She called me adorable.

213
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,120
I’m back on fire!

214
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,620
= Square & Circle =

215
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
You know,

216
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,040
it’s like...

217
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Where’s Xu Yiren?

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
I think she’s in the bathroom.

219
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,560
She was there an hour ago

220
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
when I came.

221
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Does she need to see a doctor?

222
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
She’s probably in a meeting.

223
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,560
What meeting?

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,920
Why didn’t I know?

225
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,080
You two stop covering for her.

226
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
Sha Sha,

227
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,520
call her now.

228
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,160
Ask her if she still wants her job.

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
She’s late for work

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,680
without a reason.

231
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
I gave her

233
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,560
more important work.

234
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
Let’s go talk in your office.

235
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
She’s in a meeting?

236
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,160
Come on. That’s a lousy excuse!

237
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,960
I tried to cover for her.

238
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
How many times have you said

239
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
she’s in the bathroom?

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
You’re no better than me.

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Enough of it!

242
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,720
What?

243
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,400
You asked her to assist Sun Ziyang

244
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,680
to make a model?

245
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes.

246
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
She’s merely an assistant.

247
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,120
How could you let her work as a designer?

248
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,520
I’ve confirmed

249
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,960
that she’s up for the job

250
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
before making such an arrangement.

251
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Sun Ziyang

252
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
has also recognized her ability.

253
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Fang Zhiyou,

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,680
our company has specific rules,

255
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,080
especially regarding promotions.

256
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,560
Even if you’re the boss,

257
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
you can’t do whatever you want.

258
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,680
You mistook it.

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
I didn’t give her a promotion.

260
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,520
It’s a one-time thing

261
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
under this special circumstance.

262
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
I think

263
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,960
we should support our staff’s passion.

264
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Are you sure she can nail it?

265
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,720
I’m not,

266
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
but I’m willing

267
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
to take a chance.

268
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,320
Take a chance?

269
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,400
You never believed in chances.

270
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,520
Neither do I now.

271
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
So,

272
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,280
Xu Yiren is an exception.

273
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,760
Why do you care so much?

274
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,680
Tell me,

275
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
why did you tell her

276
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,840
about you and Li Zhe?

277
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,600
It was an accident.

278
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,920
Is that so?

279
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,320
We’ve known each other for so long.

280
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,080
Where there isn’t such an accident

281
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
to have you share

282
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,520
your childhood stories with me?

283
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,440
Fine.

284
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
I won’t press you

285
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
if you don’t want to say it.

286
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
But Zhiyou,

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
I just want you to know

288
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,040
that I’m always there for you.

289
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Is that everything?

290
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,520
Yes.

291
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,000
All done.

292
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,880
What’s next?

293
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,800
Try it.

294
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
We did it!

What’s wrong?

303
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,200
Look at the fire climbing surface you drew.

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
It’s not wide enough

305
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
and the slope is above 2%.

306

What a howler!

307
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,680
Even a junior wouldn’t make that mistake.

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
I’m sorry.

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,000
I’ll redo it now.

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,040
Sorry? You’re sorry?

311
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,640
How many times have you done that?

312
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,360
I asked you to design a fire prevention zone

313
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
at the entrance and the exit of the garage.

314
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,960
There should be two,

315
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,480
but you only made one.

316
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,760
You didn’t even leave a door.

317
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
What were you thinking

318
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,640
when drafting it?

319
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,960
Wait,

320
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,800
Mr. Liu,

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,120
I checked it with you.

322
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
You approved it,

323
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,920
so I did it like that.

324
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Are you blaming me?

325
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,760
Really?

326
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,080
No.

327
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,600
Can’t you use your brain?

328
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,000
If anything bad happens,

329
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
you want me to take the blame,

330
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,440
or Mr. Fang?

331
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,800
Or you want to drag

332
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
the company down with you?

333
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,120
Last time, you asked me

334
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,360
to run a project

335
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,640
on your own.

336
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
Thank god, I didn’t allow it.

337
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,640
You kids

338
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,160
are always sloppy.

339
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,680
Can’t you be more responsible?

340
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,240
Mr. Liu,

341
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,360
I’m not a kid!

342
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,120
Show some respect.

343
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,160
Also,

344
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
don’t give me that age discrimination.

345
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Age discrimination?

346
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,800
Was I wrong?

347
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Did I wrong you?

348
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,960
Young graduates like you

349
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,360
always bite more than you can chew.

350
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,280
You aim too high.

351
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,280
What?

352
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,800
Calm down. Don’t be mad.

353
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
Can’t I criticize you?

354
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Huh?

355
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,400
Can you do the job or not?

356
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,520
If not,

357
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,840
just piss off!

358
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,160
Get out,

359
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,080
and don’t come back again!

360
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
What are you staring at?

361
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,840
Don’t you have work to do?

362
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
Finished!

363
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,120
Where’s Gu Bo?

364
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,760
Him?

365
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,680
I lectured him a few days ago.

366
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
He’s still mad at me.

367
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,360
He has quite a temper.

368
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,160
Alright.

369
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,040
You all worked hard over the past few days.

370
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
Just go back and rest.

371
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,160
We’ve given it

372
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
our all.

373
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,080
I’m sure it’ll pay off.

374
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,940
= Description of Design =

375
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,880
So,

376
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,360
the biggest highlight

377
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
of the Moon Bay Resort

378
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,040
is this floating villa.

379
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,840
It’s nice.

380
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,200
Fabulous indeed!

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,480
It’s promising.

382
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,520
I agree.

383
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Nicely done.

384
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,160
That’s the complete design

385
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
of the Moon Bay Resort.

386
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you.

387
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,240
Look forward to working with you.

388
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,040
Don’t know.

389
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,600
Why aren’t they out yet?

390
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,520
Soon, I guess.

391
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,520
Yiren!

392
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Yiren,

393
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,720
Ziyang,

394
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,360
tell us.

395
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,520
How did it go?

396
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,880
Say it.

397
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,960
We didn’t expect

398
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,720
it’d go so well.

399
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
After presenting the model,

400
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,640
the client

401
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,160
gave the project to us instantly.

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
All our effort paid off!

403
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,440
I’m surprised

404
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,360
that they’d approve it so soon.

405
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,080
That tells us

406
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
sometimes,

407
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,560
we can’t solely rely on experience.

408
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,160
We gotta give it a try first.

409
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Am I right, Mr. Fang?

410
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,040
Disapproving of you handcrafting the model

411
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,200
is a mistake.

412
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
You accomplished

413
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,520
an almost impossible task.

414
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,080
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

415
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,400
You’re making me blush.

416
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,920
What about me, Mr. Fang?

417
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Have I

418
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
also made progress?

419
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,120
Yes.

420
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,320
But don’t get dizzy

421
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
with one success.

422
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,480
Your model

423
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
isn’t flawless.

424
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,720
There’s still plenty of room for improvement.

425
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
Got it.

426
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,400
Yiren,

427
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,480
you know

428
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Mr. Fang says that a lot.

429
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
Don’t take it to heart.

430
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
I’m telling you,

431
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,040
I knew you’d win this time.

432
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,320
Good job!

433
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Yiren!

434
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,200
you know,

435
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,680
if you like modeling so much,

436
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I suggest

437
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
you take

438
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,880
a short design course at college.

439
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Professional training

440
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,800
will accelerate your improvement.

441
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,080
I’ve thought about it,

442
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,160
but

443
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,680
it’s really expensive.

444
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
You can’t put a price on art.

445
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,240
You should work harder

446
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,200
so that

447
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,920
you’ll be officially hired with a raise.

448
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes.

449
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,200
Mr. Fang is right.

450
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,240
We’re

451
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,760
having a great day.

452
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,040
Shouldn’t

453
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,560
Mr. Fang treat us to a fancy meal?

454
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,840
Good idea.

455
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,200
- Thank you, Mr. Fang. - Yeah!

456
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
Pick a restaurant you like.

457
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Go to the fanciest.

458
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
How about eating Cantonese cuisine in Jinquan Rd.?

459
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,280
- Is it expensive? - What do you think?

460
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,560
Do you like it?

461
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Yes or no?

462
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,760
Chill, chill.

463
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
There’s more good news.

464
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,800
Please, Mr. Fang.

465
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
More good news?

466
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
Considering the effort

467
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,360
you spent on this project,

468
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,120
all of you will be given a 20% raise.

469
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,120
Yeah!

470
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,240
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

471
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Impossible!

472
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,680
No way Fang Zhiyou

473
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,640
could find someone to do a 3D model

474
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
in such a short time.

475
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,680
Without a model,

476
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,840
the client

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,320
wouldn’t approve his design.

478
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,080
I heard

479
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,240
they used a handcraft model

480
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,520
instead of a 3D one.

481
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,520
The client spoke highly of it.

482
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Handcraft model

483
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,000
isn’t Fang Zhiyou’s strong suit.

484
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,000
It was

485
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
Xu Yiren.

486
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,160
What?

487
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
Xu Yiren and her colleague

488
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,440
crafted it.

489
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,640
It’s getting more and more interesting.

490
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,840
Fine.

491
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
If you got beaten up so easily,

492
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
that would be boring.

493
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,880
= Li Zhe =
Have you booked the restaurant?

494
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,400
I have.

495
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Let’s go.

496
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
Good.

497
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,600
Yiren!

498
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Let’s go.

499
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
See you there.

500
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
I have to take this.

501
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,240
You guys go ahead.

502
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
Where are you going?

503
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
We’re leaving.

504
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,480
Hello.

505
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,800
Hi.

506
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,760
What’s up?

507
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,600
Congratulations

508
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,120
on winning Moon Bay.

509
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,640
Let me take you to dinner

510
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,880
to celebrate.

511
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Thank you,

512
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,080
but I’m unavailable today.

513
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,920
My colleagues and I are going to celebrate.

514
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
I’d like to talk to you about Fang Zhiyou.

515
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
Maybe you’re right.

516
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
There are misunderstandings between us.

517
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,720
We should sit down and talk things out.

518
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,880
You really should.

519
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,800
I’d like to talk to you first, though.

520
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Their Curry Crab is the best.

521
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,400
So is Luck in a Bowl,

522
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,360
you know.

523
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,080
Isn’t that Yiren?

524
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,400
It is.

525
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
What a coincidence!

526
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
Let me go get her.

527
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,440
She’s on a date.

528
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,400
Don’t interrupt her.

529
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Don’t move.

530
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Here’s a little pink flower for you

531
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,560
as my apology.

532
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,600
He’s hot!

533
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,720
Super hot!

534
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,800
I’m upset

535
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
and don’t want to eat alone.

536
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Well,

537
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,120
you won the Moon Bay Project.

538
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,000
My revenge failed.

539
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,680
Li Zhe,

540
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800
I’ll let it slide this time.

541
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,280
Next time...

542
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,320
Next time, I’ll think up a better excuse.

543
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,160
I didn’t mean that.

544
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,360
Dig in.

545
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,960
Eat it while it’s hot,

546
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,840
or it’ll taste bad when it’s cold.

547
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,380
= Aunt =

548
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,520
Yes,

549
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,400
aunt.

550
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,360
Yiren,

551
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
I have good news.

552
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,640
Your uncle, Qing and I

553
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,320
are coming over in a few days.

554
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,920
You and uncle are coming?

555
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
Qing’s got a job there.

556
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,120
We can’t let her leave alone,

557
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,600
so we’re coming with her.

558
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
Can you

559
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,400
rent an apartment for us soon?

560
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,400
What?

561
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,600
I don’t...

562
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,040
We aren’t picky.

563
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,200
As long as it’s big enough for us to live

564
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,920
with a full set of appliances

565
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,120
and it’s conveniently located

566
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,160
with a safe neighborhood

567
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,720
and it’s cheap, that will do.

568
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,080
Aunt,

569
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,680
I...

570
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,560
I see.

571
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,520
I’ll see what I can do.

572
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,240
Thank you.

573
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,440
I’m entrusting it

574
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,800
to you then.

575
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,680
I went house-hunting

576
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
when I came back from abroad.

577
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,360
I’m familiar with it.

578
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,840
I can help you.

579
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,080
What?

580
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Aren’t you looking for an apartment?

581
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,120
What are your requirements?

582
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,880
No, thanks.

583
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,680
It’s my personal business.

584
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
I’ll take care of it myself.

585
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,600
Excuse me,

586
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,640
I need to go powder my nose.

587
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
Sure, OK.

588
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
Is Sha Sha here?

589
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,640
Never mind.

590
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,640
Sorry.

591
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Mr. Fang,

592
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,600
what a coincidence!

593
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Really?

594
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,040
Aren’t we supposed to meet here?

595
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,760
I...

596
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,880
Li Zhe said...

597
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,920
Say no more.

598
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,560
I know

599
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
your business isn’t my concern?

600
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,000
But we’re having a celebration together.

601
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
As the star of the day,

602
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,520
you shouldn’t bail on us.

603
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,040
My bad.

604
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,240
Li Zhe and I just finished.

605
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,880
I’ll go join them now.

606
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,560
No need.

607
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,680
We don’t need you anymore.

608
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah.

609
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,920
You don’t need me.

610
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
I’m not going either.

611
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,680
My place is right ahead.

612
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
We can part here.

613
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,280
Why?

614
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,640
Are you hiding your address from me?

615
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
I don’t mind being used.

616
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,640
At least, I’m useful to you.

617
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,800
What makes you think that?

618
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,480
Aren’t you mad

619
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
being used?

620
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
That depends.

621
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
If it’s you,

622
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,080
I’m fine with it.

623
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,600
I don’t think I know the real you.

624
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,560
What about Fang Zhiyou?

625
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,240
Do you know him?

626
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,480
I don’t need to guess

627
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
if he’s telling the truth or not.

628
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Sometimes,

629
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
the truth hurts the most.

630
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,240
Didn’t you feel that way too?

631
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,720
Yeah.

632
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
I used to think

633
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,960
a few lies could make his life easier,

634
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,600
but why he refused?

635
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,560
Now, I realize

636
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,040
instead of always guessing others’ true intention,

637
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,320
it’s better to stay with people like Fang Zhiyou.

638
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,880
Do you like him?

639
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,600
You won’t even bother to lie to me.

640
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,320
Why did you make friends with me?

641
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,360
You’re smart.

642
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
You need to ask?

643
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
Whether you want to use me to provoke him

644
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,800
or destroy him,

645
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,040
it won’t succeed.

646
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,360
I’m only his assistant.

647
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,040
I can’t change his mind.

648
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,800
And I will never ever betray him.

649
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,480
Stop wasting your time on me.

650
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,520
That’s my decision to make.

651
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
Besides,

652
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
people change.

653
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,840
Don’t you agree?

654
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
If you don’t want me to know where you live,

655
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,440
I’ll go.

656
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,080
I’m off.

657
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,280
Good night.

658
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,880
Gu Bo,

659
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
are you OK?

660
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
I’m good.

661
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,800
Are you done blowing off your steam?

662
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,800
Buckle up!

663
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,080
It’s just a job.

664
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,880
The older you get,

665
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
the fewer you have.

666
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,920
You’ll get used to it.

667
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
Look at Xu Yiren.

668
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,200
She’s fine.

669
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,920
Can you stop talking to me

670
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,480
like I’m a kid?

671
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,960
You’re younger than me.

672
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,600
Let me

673
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,240
teach you something, kiddo.

674
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,080
You made a reckless move.

675
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,080
You know what’s the first thing to do

676
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
after making a mistake?

677
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,000
Apologize immediately

678
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,320
and sincerely.

679
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,400
What did you do?

680
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
You stormed out.

681
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,160
I already apologized

682
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,400
but Liu Tianyang refused to let it go.

683
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,560
What else could I do?

684
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,800
He spewed out hurtful words

685
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,560
without considering my feelings.

686
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,440
I’ve had a hard time

687
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
at work lately.

688
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Everyone in the company

689
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,200
thinks of me as a burden.

690
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
He insulted me.

691
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,360
Who is he to you?

692
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,840
Why should he consider your feelings?

693
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
In this world,

694
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,480
other than your parents,

695
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,200
nobody gives a damn about you.

696
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,480
You know what’s to rise from setbacks?

697
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,760
Princess,

698
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,280
I’m miserable enough.

699
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,920
Can’t you comfort me?

700
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
If comfort works,

701
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
I can give you that as much as possible.

702
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,800
But right now, that’s not what you need.

703
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,760
You should ask yourself

704
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,360
why you want to work at Square & Circle.

705
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
You said

706
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
your dream is to become

707
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,240
an excellent designer like Fang Zhiyou.

708
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,680
To realize your dream,

709
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
how big a price are you willing to pay?

710
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
If you can’t take a little setback

711
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
like this,

712
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,800
better give up your dream now.

713
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,840
Yiren.

714
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Xia Di.

715
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,360
Why aren’t you home yet?

716
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,360
Gu Bo is upset.

717
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
I’m with him now.

718
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,720
What’s up?

719
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,160
We can go back.

720
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
Nothing.

721
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,280
I happen to pass by.

722
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Talk to him nicely.

723
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,960
Sure.

724
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,720
Bye.

725
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,960
We can

726
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
go a few more laps if you want.

727
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,760
Cool.

728
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,240
Get in.

729
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,400
I’ll go get changed.

730
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,040
Don’t bump into anything again.

731
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
There you are.

732
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,080
Hi.

733
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,800
Can we have a word?

734
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,120
Let’s talk inside.

735
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,920
No need.

736
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,800
I’m here to check with you

737
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
if it’s true

738
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
that you hired me as an intern

739
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
because of my dad?

740
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,160
Yes.

741
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Am I incompetent?

742
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Yes.

743
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,720
I’m not saying that

744
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,120
because you’re relying on your father.

745
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,920
You stormed out

746
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,960
in Mr. Liu’s face earlier.

747
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,640
You lost your temper

748
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,000
in the workplace.

749
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,440
You still have a lot to learn

750
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,000
but you aren’t willing to accept that.

751
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
That makes you incompetent.

752
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,800
I understand.

753
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,480
Alright.

754
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
I lost.

755
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,800
I’ll quit.

756
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,440
I’ll send you my resignation tomorrow morning.

757
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Gu Bo,

758
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
wait.

759
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,120
Think again.

760
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,480
He isn’t going to fire you.

761
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,080
Even so,

762
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
I don’t think I should stay.

763
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,360
Thank you for everything.

764
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
Gu Bo. Gu Bo!

765
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,200
You can’t let him leave.

766
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,600
Didn’t Li Zhe escort you back?

767
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,680
What’s wrong?

768
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,040
You don’t want him to know

769
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,320
that we’re living under the same roof?

770
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,320
Gu Bo may seem careless

771
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,000
but he’s diligent.

772
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,440
He studied

773
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,120
all our previous projects.

774
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,280
Can’t you give him one more chance?

775
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,720
He’s still a new graduate.

776
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
That’s too heavy a blow to him.

777
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
Young people need encouragement.

778
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
Can’t you say something nice

779
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,760
to cheer him up

780
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,000
and encourage him?

781
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,960
A better mood

782
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,800
may lead to better performance.

783
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
He’s weak.

784
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,320
If I encouraged him,

785
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,440
how could he improve?

786
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
If he can’t take

787
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,240
such a little frustration,

788
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,040
that means

789
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,680
he isn’t cut out for this industry.

790
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,440
He might as well change his career path sooner.

791
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,160
You can’t scale everyone

792
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
with your standard.

793
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
If he behaves like you,

794
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,600
then he won’t be himself.

795
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
He’ll be another you.

796
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,000
There isn’t another Fang Zhiyou in this world.

797
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Just like

798
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
there isn’t another Xu Yiren.

799
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,640
What?

800
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,960
What did Li Zhe want from you?

801
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,800
I’m not asking you as your boss,

802
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,240
but as a friend.

803
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,680
You don’t need to tell me.

804
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
He... He said

805
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,240
he wanted to talk to me about you.

806
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,800
I didn’t know that was an excuse.

807
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,000
If we didn’t bump into each other earlier,

808
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,600
how long would you keep it from me?

809
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,360
What’s that?

810
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,680
Interrogation?

811
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,120
It sounds weird.

812
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes.

813
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
I knew you’d react like this,

814
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,960
so I didn’t tell you.

815
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,800
I didn’t mean to.

816
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,320
I didn’t want you to recall the past

817
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,760
because of Li Zhe.

818
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,400
I’m trying to separate you from him

819
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
because I don’t want him to hurt you.

820
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,080
Hurt me?

821
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,120
He said

822
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,920
he’d steal what I treasure the most

823
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,600
and he said he’d woo you.

824
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
I can’t let you be used.

825
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
What you treasure the most?

826
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,400
Why is he after me?

827
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,120
You must have mistaken it.

828
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,600
Anyway,

829
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,240
you should know

830
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,760
he’s approaching you for a reason.

831
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Well,

832
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,240
it’s true

833
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
that who you’re seeing

834
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,040
isn’t my business

835
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,840
but I want you to know

836
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,920
that I can’t allow you to be hurt because of me.

837
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
No one should suffer

838
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,880
because of me.

839
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,760
It won’t happen.

840
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
It’s late.

841
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,920
Go to bed.

842
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
Treasure the most...

843
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,880
Wait!

844
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,720
Aren’t we talking about Gu Bo?

845
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,760
Can’t you give him another chance?

846
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,520
Leave that to be discussed at work.

847
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,120
Mr. Fang,

848
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
this is Gu Bo’s notebook.

849
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,000
Inside

850
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
is the summary of the positioning,

851
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
style

852
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,200
and progress of each project.

853
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,840
The red part is his thoughts.

854
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
His suggestions are in blue.

855
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
What he likes and dislikes,

856
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,680
what he did and missed

857
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
were recorded in detail.

858
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,160
Gu Bo did that every day

859
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,040
since he joined our company.

860
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,360
I know Gu Bo

861
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,680
has many shortcomings

862
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
but he’s passionate about this job.

863
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,360
He idolizes you

864
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,240
and he hopes

865
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,320
he can become

866
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,120
a top designer like you.

867
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,640
He knows

868
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,480
he isn’t as talented as you,

869
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,920
so he’s been working hard

870
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,680
without you knowing it.

871
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,240
If so,

872
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,600
he shouldn’t have given up so easily.

873
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,720
Mr. Fang,

874
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,680
not everyone is as confident as you

875
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,560
who insists on doing what you think is right.

876
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,200
Many people

877
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,360
need to be encouraged and praised,

878
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,560
especially by their close friends and role models.

879
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,360
A compliment from you

880
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,000
may change his life.

881
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It’s possible.

882
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,440
If you think

883
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,880
that’s also a lie,

884
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,600
I’d rather live in lies every day.
