= Episode 6 =

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,260
I’m sure you haven’t noticed that

21
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,820
Yiren has feelings for you.

22
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,740
Mr. Fang,

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,900
I’m sorry.

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,820
Is there anything you want to ask me?

25
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,060
My friend said the purse

26
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,260
you gave me last time is very popular.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
You really have a good taste.

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,500
Don’t be a suck-up.

29
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,620
We went to the shopping mall together

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,340
last time.

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,780
Otherwise, I wouldn’t

32
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,980
waste time on such a trivial thing.

33
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,100
Right.

34
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,700
Of course you won’t buy things

35
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,180
for your assistant.

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,500
Well...

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,540
What would you buy for the girl you like?

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,260
Why are you asking me this?

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,620
I’m just curious.

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,060
Mr. Fang,

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,500
do all men like beautiful girls

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,300
with white skin and long legs?

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,820
Not really.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,500
Then what kind of girls do you like?

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,540
Attractive ones.

46
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,540
How will you find them attractive?

47
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,140
As long as they’re beautiful.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,060
So all men are the same.

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,060
Men are indeed the same

50
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,380
in this regard.

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,180
If a man says

52
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,140
he is attracted to your personality

53
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
the first time he sees you,

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
then he must be lying.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,220
However,

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,100
that’s not gonna happen to you.

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,540
What are you doing?

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Let me ask you one thing.

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,420
You have to answer me honestly.

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,060
I’ll try.

61
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,820
Do you have a crush on me?

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,740
Ah?

63
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,033
I...

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,860
Shiyu told me

65
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,780
you’d been peeping at me all the time.

66
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,020
You asked me what kind of girls I like.

67
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,620
You were not happy when I said

68
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,500
you’re not my type.

69
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
So I can say that...

70
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,980
No.

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,780
There’s no such a thing.

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,300
You overthinked it.

73
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Really?

74
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,900
Really.

75
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,580
There’s one thing really good about me,

76
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,940
which is I understand myself.

77
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,180
I’m not stupid enough

78
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,300
to have a fantasy about you.

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,900
That’s good.

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,500
What are you scared of

81
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,460
if I really like you?

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,620
It’s not convenient.

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,260
Because I’m your assistant?

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,460
That’s right.

85
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,820
It’s too much trouble to find a new assistant.

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,780
You mean

87
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,380
you’ll fire your assistant

88
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,340
if she likes you?

89
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,020
Right.

90
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,900
This is good for her.

91
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,420
If she likes me,

92
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
but I don’t like her,

93
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,660
her work will be affected.

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,140
So the best choice

95
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,700
is to fire her,

96
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,620
so that she doesn’t have to

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,620
face a man she can’t have every day.

98
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,380
I see.

99
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,860
It makes sense.

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,180
No wonder you’re the boss.

101
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,020
You’re very thoughtful.

102
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,100
I hope you stay single all your life.

103
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,060
This is all your fault.

104
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,380
You asked me to be a spy.

105
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
Now what?

106
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
He almost got me wrong.

107
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,300
It was so embarrassing.

108
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,740
Isn’t that good?

109
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,180
You should have gone with it and said

110
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,060
you’d liked him for a long time.

111
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,940
Maybe you’ll become lovers.

112
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,660
Stop it.

113
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
I wish you had seen

114
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,300
how relieved he felt

115
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
after I clarified myself.

116
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,660
It was like he didn’t

117
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,500
want me to like him at all.

118
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,740
Then tell me.

119
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,980
Are you angry

120
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,420
because he made you feel embarrassed

121
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,540
or because

122
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,420
he said he doesn’t like you?

123
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,820
You’re hesitating.

124
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,180
Admit it, Xu Yiren.

125
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,180
You’re angry

126
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,620
because he doesn’t have feelings for you.

127
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,660
I only did that for you.

128
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,300
Stop making fun of me.

129
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,300
He also said

130
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,180
he’d fire me

131
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,700
if I had a thing for him.

132
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,100
He was going too far.

133
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,940
You’re not beautiful,

134
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,140
your legs are short

135
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,740
and you’re small-breasted,

136
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,020
but you’re considerate and obedient.

137
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,940
You’re great in kitchen and competent at work,

138
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,820
and you’re very easygoing.

139
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,620
He’d be really lucky

140
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,300
if you fall for him.

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,420
Are you really praising me?

142
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,140
Very sincerely.

143
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,460
In my eyes,

144
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,540
Fang Zhiyou is not worthy of you.

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,020
Ah?

146
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,700
Don’t be upset.

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,860
He’ll regret this sooner or later.

148
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,940
Then,

149
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,020
I don’t have to be a spy any more, right?

150
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,180
Come on.

151
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
You’re doing this for me.

152
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,340
You can’t quit because of him.

153
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,460
What you said

154
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,620
doesn’t quite make sense.

155
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,420
Of course it makes sense.

156
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,620
Don’t overthink it.

157
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,420
I’ll get changed

158
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,500
and treat you to a meal

159
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,060
to lift your mood.

160
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,020
Wait for me.

161
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,860
Just a moment.

162
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,900
No.

163
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,540
There’s no such a thing.

164
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,900
You overthinked it.

165
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,420
Really?

166
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,500
Really?

167
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,100
There’s one thing really good about me,

168
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,340
which is I understand myself.

169
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,620
I’m not stupid enough

170
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,740
to have a fantasy about you.

171
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,660
That’s good.

172
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,700
Hurry. Hurry.

173
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,380
It’s very interesting.

174
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,820
This is the interesting place you said?

175
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,500
Right.

176
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,540
= Chantong Ghost School =

177
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,340
Forget it. I’m not going inside.

178
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,220
Hey!

179
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,660
Don’t leave.

180
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,900
Don’t be afraid. I’m here.

181
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,420
Yiren said that

182
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,100
you encountered a bottleneck recently.

183
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,380
So I wanted to

184
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,020
take you out

185
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
to find inspiration.

186
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,580
By the way,

187
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,660
I want to tell you something

188
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,700
about Fang Zhiyou.

189
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,380
Are we really going inside?

190
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,060
Of course.

191
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,100
My friend strongly recommended

192
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,300
this place to me.

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,860
I heard that

194
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,420
it’s very vividly designed.

195
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,660
I’ve already bought the tickets.

196
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,540
All right then.

197
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,180
Let’s go.

198
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,660
Gu Bo!

199
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,460
Go away. Go away.

200
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,260
Don’t be scared.

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,220
Don’t be scared.

202
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,460
I’m here.

203
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,900
Gu Bo,

204
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,900
only you can make me feel secure.

205
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,220
Let’s be together.

206
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,820
Okay.

207
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,740
Let’s go.

208
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,060
Are you coming?

209
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,380
Oh.

210
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
Go, let’s go.

211
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,300
= Chantong Ghost School =

212
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,860
This one doesn’t have a face.

213
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,020
Don’t be afraid.

214
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,420
Look at this one.

215
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,460
Room 403.

216
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,660
Maybe

217
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,940
something

218
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,380
will appear in this room.

219
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,260
Stop it.

220
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,100
Ah! Ah!

221
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,460
Look at what you did.

222
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,700
You scared the hell out of him.

223
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,340
Gu Bo.

224
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,460
Don’t come over. Don’t come over.

225
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,620
I don’t want to see you.

226
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,780
What are you scared of?

227
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,260
This is so exaggerating.

228
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,740
This is the first time I’ve seen someone

229
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,540
scared like this in a haunted house.

230
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,020
Then why did you come in?

231
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,100
It’s over?

232
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,860
Are you OK?

233
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
I’ll buy you an ice cream to steady your nerves.

234
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Why were you not scared?

235
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,940
They’re all fake, alright?

236
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,660
That’s why I didn’t want to come in.

237
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,460
It’s boring.

238
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,820
Hey!

239
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,620
Hey!

240
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,660
What are you doing?

241
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,060
It’s so embarrassing.

242
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,260
I feel ashamed to see you.

243
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,060
It’s not that embarrassing, alright?

244
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,460
It’s just an absolute disgrace.

245
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,460
Alright. Alright.

246
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,980
I was just kidding.

247
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,460
But I haven’t been so happy for a long time.

248
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,940
Do you know

249
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
how scared you were just now?

250
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,980
Don’t come over. Don’t come over.

251
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Fine.

252
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,380
It doesn’t matter.

253
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,180
As long as you’re happy.

254
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,140
That’s right.

255
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,860
Let’s go.

256
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540
I’ll buy you an ice-cream.

257
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,260
Great.

258
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,980
I’ll buy you two.

259
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,740
Have you got everything?

260
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,140
The car is waiting outside.

261
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,900
You don’t have to go to the conference today.

262
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,660
He Yuliang is also there.

263
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,820
It’d be awkward.

264
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,460
OK.

265
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,220
Hello?

266
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,700
Xu Yiren,

267
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,420
come to my office.

268
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,140
Oh.

269
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,700
It’s great to be a boss.

270
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,940
You hurt me a lot with your words,

271
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,500
but I have to act as if I don’t care at all.

272
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,220
Ms. He.

273
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Mr. Fang.

274
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,100
What do you need?

275
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,260
Get changed

276
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,900
and go to today’s bidder conference with me.

277
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
The bidder conference?

278
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,300
But Ms. He should go with you, shouldn’t she?

279
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,900
I have something else to do today.

280
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,300
I’m counting on you.

281
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,140
What? You don’t want to go?

282
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,740
No.

283
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,460
Then why are you standing there?

284
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,620
Go grab your things.

285
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,180
Yes.

286
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,420
Mr. Fang,

287
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,380
I went to change my clothes.

288
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,220
Sorry,

289
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,060
I’m late.

290
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,900
Get in the car.

291
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,060
Hmm.

292
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,100
Hello?

293
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,140
Is Xu Yiren speaking?

294
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes, it’s me.

295
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,900
This is Third People’s Hospital.

296
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,260
Your friend Gao Ming had a car accident.

297
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,540
Please come here.

298
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,900
Car accident?

299
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,820
Was it serious?

300
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,660
You’d better come here.

301
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,380
OK.

302
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,500
I’m on my way.

303
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,380
Who’s injured?

304
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,180
He hates Gao Ming very much.

305
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,820
He won’t let me go.

306
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,900
My friend Xia Di.

307
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,940
She was sent to the hospital.

308
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,300
I have to go there.

309
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,340
Then just go.

310
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,100
What about the conference?

311
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,940
I’ll let He Yuwen go with me.

312
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,500
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

313
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,940
I’ll be back very soon.

314
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,740
Mr. Huang.

315
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,300
To good cooperation.

316
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,700
To good cooperation.

317
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,740
If I were you,

318
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,740
I’d turn around and leave.

319
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,540
It’s not a great feeling to

320
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,580
experience failure.

321
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,060
But maybe you’ve got used to it.

322
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,860
Dad.

323
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,020
Move aside.

324
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,420
Next,

325
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,820
Mr. Fang will introduce their plan.

326
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,460
Mr. Fang,

327
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,900
please go ahead.

328
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,900
What’s wrong?

329
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,300
The file is gone.

330
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,220
= Mr. Fang =

331
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,860
= Delete This Call =

332
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,700
Mr. Huang.

333
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,540
Mr. Huang.

334
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,820
We’re sorry.

335
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,580
Please give us a little more time.

336
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,860
We’ll take care of this.

337
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,700
No need.

338
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,620
The Movie World Project

339
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,660
is our largest project for the next 5 years.

340
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,300
Yes.

341
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,620
Huaxing attaches great importance to it.

342
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,340
But it seems that you don’t take it very seriously.

343
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
Then there’s no need to cooperate.

344
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,540
Mr. Huang, we’re going to be late.

345
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,300
What should we do?

346
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,740
Let’s go back to the company first.

347
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,940
Hmm.

348
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,700
Have one.

349
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,300
I asked the doctor.

350
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
He said it’s just a superficial wound.

351
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,620
You can leave the hospital after the treatment.

352
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,620
I’ll go through the procedures for you later.

353
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,820
I can leave the hospital,

354
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,060
but you have to keep me company

355
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,260
until my wound heals.

356
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,300
Gao Ming,

357
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,820
we’ve broken up.

358
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,780
I have no obligation to look after you.

359
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,060
Yiren,

360
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,180
I know

361
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,500
you’re still angry with me.

362
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,980
It was all my fault.

363
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,100
You see?

364
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,220
Now I’m suffering for you.

365
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,980
Please forgive me this once.

366
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,100
Yiren,

367
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,180
you’ve always been easygoing.

368
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,500
Just because I was easygoing,

369
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,020
so you thought you can hurt me again and again?

370
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
Just because you thought

371
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,820
I’ll forgive you no matter what you do,

372
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,420
so you never considered my feelings?

373
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,540
You’re so selfish.

374
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Yiren,

375
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,020
what’s wrong with you?

376
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,500
How did you become like this?

377
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,940
You never talked to me like this before.

378
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,580
That’s because I liked you.

379
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,020
But I don’t like you anymore.

380
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,460
I came here today

381
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,380
because I thought you had a serious car accident.

382
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,020
We’ve broken up,

383
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,820
but I still came as a friend.

384
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,420
I didn’t expect that you were lying.

385
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,660
That’s because I like you.

386
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,940
I want to see you.

387
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,820
I know sometimes telling a few lies

388
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,620
can make my life better,

389
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,300
but I still won’t tell lies.

390
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,180
I’m so sick of lies.

391
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,340
Now I finally know

392
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,660
how annoying lies are.

393
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,780
You can either stay or leave the hospital.

394
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,100
I’m leaving.

395
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,060
Hey!

396
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,420
Xu Yiren!

397
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,060
Hey!

398
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,620
Xu Yiren!

399
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,580
Has the bidder conference finished?

400
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,220
Did we get the project?

401
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,380
But it has nothing to do with you.

402
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,500
You just designed two toilets.

403
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,060
Don’t. Don’t.

404
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,940
Of course it has something to do with me.

405
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,260
We’re a team.

406
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,780
Every one of us is responsible

407
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,580
for Square & Circle’s development.

408
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,300
Did you hear that?

409
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,940
How eloquent he is!

410
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,820
Mr. Fang.

411
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,300
Mr. Fang.

412
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,860
You know Xia Di, right?

413
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,940
Ah?

414
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
That friend of Xu Yiren’s?

415
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,700
You even know this?

416
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,820
Xu Yiren said she’ll keep it a secret.

417
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,540
Give her a call.

418
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,020
What?

419
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,820
Don’t ask.

420
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,700
Call her.

421
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh.

422
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,180
What’s it?

423
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,980
Hello?

424
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,380
Listen...

425
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,220
Which hospital are you in?

426
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,460
Who are you?

427
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,900
Who told you I’m in a hospital?

428
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,980
Are you insane?

429
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,980
Ridiculous.

430
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,100
Speak! Who on earth are you?

431
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Sorry, Xia Di.

432
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,180
It was not me just now.

433
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,780
I didn’t say anything.

434
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Really.

435
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,540
Insane.

436
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,300
Mr. Fang.

437
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,580
Ms. He.

438
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,940
How did the bidder conference go?

439
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,380
No!

440
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,700
It seems it didn’t go well.

441
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,580
I’d better not mess with them.

442
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,260
Stop.

443
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,140
Where did you go?

444
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,060
Hadn’t I told you?

445
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,980
A good friend of mine

446
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,220
is hospitalized.

447
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,020
I’ll give you one more chance.

448
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,700
Where on earth did you go?

449
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
I indeed went to the hospital.

450
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,900
Then why didn’t you answer my call?

451
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,820
When did you call me?

452
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,540
I didn’t hear it.

453
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,420
You didn’t hear it?

454
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,540
But you hung up on me.

455
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,100
How’s that possible?

456
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,780
I didn’t even...

457
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,220
It must be Gao Ming.

458
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,100
I left my phone in the ward

459
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,820
when I went to see the doctor.

460
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,180
So you put your work aside

461
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,340
to see your ex-boyfriend?

462
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,020
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

463
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,220
I never intended to lie to you.

464
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,380
I was afraid that you won’t let me go.

465
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,540
He had a car accident.

466
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,020
The doctor said he’s seriously injured.

467
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,980
How seriously?

468
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,180
Actually...

469
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,460
It’s not serious.

470
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,060
He lied to me.

471
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,220
It’s you who lied to me.

472
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,460
Xu Yiren,

473
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
listen up,

474
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,660
you’re fired.

475
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,620
Pack your things and leave.

476
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,660
- Fang Zhiyou!
- Mr. Fang!

477
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,140
Maybe...

478
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,340
Don’t try to change my mind.

479
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,260
If you want to speak up for her,

480
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,940
you’ll leave with her.

481
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,660
Do as you please.

482
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,780
Yiren,

483
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,980
don’t be sad.

484
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,300
It’s OK.

485
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,500
It’s OK.

486
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,420
Yiren,

487
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,220
don’t be sad.

488
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,980
Mr. Fang was in a rage.

489
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,740
Think about it.

490
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,180
He lost Huaxing’s project.

491
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,780
Of course he’d feel down.

492
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,380
He might have lost his mind.

493
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,340
Just ignore him.

494
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,700
It was all my fault.

495
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
I knew he hates it when people lie to him,

496
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,620
but I still lied.

497
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,100
Also, I checked the file in the U-disk,

498
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,380
how come it disappeared?

499
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,620
Come on.

500
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,220
Don’t be sad.

501
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,540
Don’t think too much.

502
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,180
Listen to me,

503
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,620
you should go home and sleep.

504
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,140
No matter what it is,

505
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,020
just leave it till tomorrow.

506
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,380
Yiren.

507
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,740
- Sorry.
- Xia Di.

508
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,660
I’m sorry.

509
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,580
I didn’t know you told Fang Zhiyou that

510
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,500
I was sent to the hospital.

511
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,740
Otherwise,

512
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,100
I wouldn’t have answered the call.

513
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,660
This is all your fault.

514
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,460
You shouldn’t have made that call.

515
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,620
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

516
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,220
I didn’t know what he was going to ask.

517
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,300
Yiren didn’t tell me this.

518
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,260
Cut the crap.

519
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,180
Apologize to Yiren now.

520
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,660
I’m sorry.

521
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,140
Don’t give Gu Bo a hard time.

522
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,380
It had nothing to do with him,

523
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,020
or you.

524
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,180
It was all my fault.

525
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,500
Come on.

526
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,540
Who said that?

527
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,540
Honestly,

528
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,420
it was Gao Ming’s fault, that scumbag!

529
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,220
We let him get away too easily last time.

530
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,620
Now it’s useless saying all this.

531
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,860
Mr. Fang lost such a big project because of me.

532
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,020
What should I do?

533
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,860
Don’t tell me

534
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,100
he also wants you

535
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,340
to take responsibility for it?

536
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,580
He didn’t say that.

537
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,060
But that doesn’t mean

538
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,380
I’m not responsible for it.

539
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,540
Now you’re fired,

540
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,380
what can you possibly do?

541
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,660
Alright. Alright.

542
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,420
I’ll take you

543
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
to drink, eat lamb kebabs,

544
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,780
and dance later.

545
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,100
A one-stop service

546
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,940
to ward off bad luck for you.

547
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,620
Tomorrow will be a new day,

548
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,140
right?

549
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,580
Right. Right.

550
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,980
You can eat to your heart’s content today.

551
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,420
It’s on me.

552
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,780
What’s that got to do with you?

553
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,420
I...

554
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,980
Don’t argue.

555
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,460
I’m really not in the mood.

556
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,780
I want to go home.

557
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,700
OK. OK.

558
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,980
No prob. No prob.

559
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,260
I’ll always be your black knight.

560
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Don’t cry.

561
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,420
What about me?

562
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,580
Just mind your own business.

563
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,460
Let’s go.

564
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,140
Wait for me.

565
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,620
It’s time to get off work.

566
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
Why aren’t you leaving?

567
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,420
Linlin,

568
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,300
you really have some nerve.

569
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,820
We just lost Huaxing’s project.

570
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,380
Mr. Fang was so angry that he fired Xu Yiren.

571
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,180
He hasn’t come out since he went into his office.

572
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,180
And now you want to get off work early?

573
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,060
You mean

574
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,580
we can’t even get off work

575
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,260
because the company lost Huaxing’s project?

576
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,220
Actually I’m wondering

577
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,580
why people like you

578
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,540
are still not fired.

579
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,060
People like me?

580
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,940
Hey!

581
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
At least I’m very attentive at work.

582
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,220
On what grounds can they fire me?

583
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,460
I’m not like a certain someone.

584
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,020
She spent six hours gossiping

585
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,460
every day.

586
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,740
I don’t know

587
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,780
why the company wants to keep her.

588
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,580
How dare you blame Sha Sha?

589
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,380
I...

590
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,140
You can get off work now.

591
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,940
There’s nothing for you to do.

592
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,140
Ms. He,

593
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,500
I’m leaving then.

594
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,460
Then,

595
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,300
Ms. He,

596
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,140
I’m leaving, too.

597
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,180
Sha Sha,

598
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,660
you can also leave.

599
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,020
Is Xu Yiren

600
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
really fired?

601
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,900
She’s the obvious reason

602
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,700
why we lost the bid.

603
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,340
I couldn’t speak up for her.

604
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,900
But...

605
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,940
I mean,

606
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,900
I actually feel bad for her.

607
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,020
Everyone needs to take responsibility

608
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,660
for what they did.

609
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,540
I made a mistake

610
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,780
when I recruited her.

611
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,860
Ms. He...

612
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,260
Say no more.

613
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,220
Just let it go.

614
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,820
You can leave now.

615
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,980
OK.

616
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,860
OK.

617
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,180
Dad,

618
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,100
do you still remember?

619
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,380
Look at this.

620
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,820
In the old days,

621
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,140
we’d go to this villa in Qingshan

622
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,460
to celebrate my birthday

623
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,100
and you and Mom’s wedding anniversary.

624
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,580
Dad.

625
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,900
Zhe will be let out of school soon.

626
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,660
The sun is going down.

627
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,900
Where is he?

628
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,260
This kid!

629
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Where did he go again?

630
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,420
School is over.

631
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,260
Why hasn’t he returned yet?

632
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,140
The sun is setting.

633
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,860
He…

634
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,100
He should be back now.

635
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,380
Where did he go again?

636
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,540
Dad.

637
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,780
Dad.

638
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,020
This apple has gone bad.

639
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,100
I’ll get you a new one.

640
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
- Don’t take my apple away!
- Dad!

641
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,900
Dad!

642
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,460
- Don’t take my apple away!

643
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:07,780
Dad!

644
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,740
This is my son’s apple.

645
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,020
Mr. Li.

646
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,636
- Don’t be like this.
- This is my son’s.

647
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,503
Mr. Li.

648
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,860
- Nurse.
- This is my son’s.

649
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Don’t take my apple away!

650
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,140
Don’t take my apple away!

651
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,100
Mr. Li,

652
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,500
don’t be too sad.

653
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
Uncle won’t

654
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,500
recover in a short while.

655
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,900
But he’ll get better

656
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,860
as long as you come here often.

657
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,980
Anything you want to tell me?

658
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
I was just informed that

659
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,460
Fang Zhiyou lost Huaxing’s project.

660
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,860
Many places have changed,

661
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,740
except this place.

662
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,140
Right.

663
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,620
Xingcheng Real Estate wanted to

664
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,900
change this place to a music square.

665
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,980
I persuaded Mr. Xiao.

666
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,300
So he didn’t

667
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,420
do it.

668
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,660
Although it looks the same,

669
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,820
the people have changed.

670
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,900
Then,

671
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,820
why did you come here?

672
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,540
I just want to see

673
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,220
how you’d deal with frustration.

674
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,140
You’re not as good as what I thought.

675
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,820
Zhe.

676
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,620
Don’t call me that.

677
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,660
You were disqualified
13 years ago.

678
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,060
Alright.

679
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,420
Since you hate me so much,

680
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:20,860
come,

681
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,140
hit me!

682
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,500
So that you can

683
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,420
vent your anger at me.

684
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,140
Hit you?

685
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,900
You think I wouldn’t dare?

686
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,700
Come on!

687
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,180
You think I wouldn’t dare?

688
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,180
Because of you,

689
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
my mother died,

690
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,300
and my father can’t recognize me.

691
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,100
You think I wouldn’t dare?

692
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,020
Come!

693
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,900
Now do you feel a bit better?

694
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
You can continue if you’re not satisfied.

695
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,100
You owe me this.

696
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,020
I’ll take everything from you.

697
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,780
If you can feel better by hurting me,

698
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
then just come at me.

699
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,220
But I hope you can go easy on yourself.

700
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Don’t pretend you care about me.

701
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Mind your own business.

702
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,780
= Tales on 49 Paper Boats and 49 Paper Kites =
= Kiss the Sun =

703
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,540
Why didn’t you open the door for me?

704
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,660
You have the key, right?

705
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,540
I don’t want to see anyone else.

706
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,980
Oh boy.

707
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,940
It seems this has dealt a huge blow to you.

708
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,580
Good timing.

709
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,500
Now you’re here,

710
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,580
come take a look.

711
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,780
What does this look like?

712
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Can you tell?

713
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,140
These are fake Lego bricks?

714
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,220
A game to torture yourself?

715
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,180
Come on.

716
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,580
This is a model.

717
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
You really can’t tell?

718
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,860
Now I can tell.

719
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,020
Hmm.

720
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,700
I found it quite easy

721
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
when I did it with Fang Zhiyou.

722
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,220
But it’s so hard to do it by myself.

723
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,940
What’s it got to do with Fang Zhiyou?

724
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,340
He put a lot of effort

725
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,980
into this project with Huaxing.

726
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,980
He stayed up for several nights.

727
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,020
But he didn’t even get to show it to Huaxing

728
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,700
because of my mistake.

729
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
So, I thought,

730
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,940
I can replicate the main buildings

731
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,500
and go to Huaxing

732
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,100
to show it to their persons-in-charge.

733
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,660
Maybe

734
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,540
they’ll give Square & Circle a second chance.

735
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,060
Are you stupid?

736
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,780
Even Fang Zhiyou couldn’t deal with them.

737
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,700
But you want to see them

738
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,180
and change their mind?

739
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,020
You’re stupid!

740
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,380
I know it’s hard.

741
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,260
But I can’t feel at ease if I don’t give it a try.

742
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,660
You don’t know

743
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,260
how excellent Fang Zhiyou’s design is.

744
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,620
They’ll be interested in it

745
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,860
if they see it.

746
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,500
Oh no.

747
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,220
Don’t tell me

748
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,860
you’ve developed Stockholm syndrome.

749
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,940
Fang Zhiyou fired you.

750
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,380
Why are you trying to help him?

751
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,660
Here. Take a look.

752
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,060
I’ve bought so many snacks

753
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,980
for you.

754
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,220
Our task today is to eat, drink and have fun.

755
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,460
You can have fun yourself.

756
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,860
I have to finish it.

757
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,140
Let me help you.

758
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,860
What are these?

759
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,940
Skewers?

760
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,500
Let’s grill some kebabs.

761
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,940
Have you got mutton at home?

762
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,780
I’ll grill some for you.

763
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,660
Oh.

764
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,580
Come on.

765
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,060
Don’t make trouble for me.

766
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,380
You can enjoy the snacks yourself.

767
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,540
Is there a better way to do it?

768
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,620
We’re all civilized.

769
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,260
Can’t we talk it through with him?

770
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,180
That scumbag is giving Yiren a hard time.

771
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,380
There’s no need to reason with him.

772
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,500
Just tell me in advance

773
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,580
if you don’t want to do it.

774
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,940
Rest assured.

775
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,620
I’m the perfect one

776
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,900
for this task.

777
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,380
When he shows up later,

778
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,220
I’ll beat the hell out of him,

779
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,940
and let him kneel and apologize to Xu Yiren.

780
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,700
He’s coming.

781
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
It’s your show time.

782
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,340
Good luck.

783
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,420
Are you

784
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,500
scumbag Gao Ming?

785
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,020
Who are you?

786
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
Are you insane?

787
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,500
Move aside!

788
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,300
You’re such a hypocrite!

789
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,340
You’re a sanctimonious

790
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,940
notorious, cheeky,

791
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,460
despicable, and shameless

792
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,500
womanizer!

793
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,580
You’re disloyal and debauched.

794
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,460
You want to have two women at the same time?

795
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,980
Today,

796
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,460
I’ll follow Heaven’s will

797
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,940
and knock some sense into you.

798
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,100
Xia Di?

799
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,020
How come you’re here?

800
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,420
You asked this guy here?

801
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,700
Gao Ming,

802
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,700
had it not been for Xu Yiren,

803
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,460
I’d have taught you a lesson last time.

804
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,580
If you had the slightest sense of dignity,

805
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,180
you wouldn’t have come to bother her again.

806
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,700
It’s between Xu Yiren and I.

807
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,860
What’s it got to do with you?

808
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,740
You worry too much.

809
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,620
What’s more,

810
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,060
now you came to me,

811
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,700
did Xu Yiren know?

812
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,540
That’s not important.

813
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,620
You hit my friend just now,

814
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,140
I’ll have to see to this matter.

815
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,020
Fine.

816
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,620
I have to go now.

817
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,980
You’re crazy!

818
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,660
Stop!

819
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,620
Hey!

820
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,780
Stop!

821
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,660
Xia Di, are you done?

822
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,500
Hey!

823
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,860
What's wrong with you?

824
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,460
I didn’t practice kickboxing for nothing.

825
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,780
Xia Di!

826
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,820
Will you admit you’re a scumbag?

827
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,420
Xia Di!

828
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,300
Don’t do this.

829
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,580
Will you admit it?

830
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,660
OK.

831
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,140
OK. I admit. I admit.

832
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,820
This is so cruel.

833
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,420
Is it still painful?

834
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:07,940
Take it.

835
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,260
Thanks.

836
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,580
What did I tell you?

837
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,740
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.

838
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,900
You could run away

839
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,100
if you couldn’t beat him.

840
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,300
Stop laughing.

841
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,540
Goddess,

842
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,540
what other secret skills do you have?

843
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,060
I wouldn’t have taken you to Gao Ming

844
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,420
if I couldn’t fight.

845
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,580
He played in the basketball team

846
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,700
when we were at university.

847
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,220
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

848
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,700
I didn’t know you’re so weak.

849
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,060
You’re so thin.

850
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,980
You should eat more.

851
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,180
Yeah, let’s eat.

852
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,060
What do you want to eat?

853
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,140
I’m not hungry.

854
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,940
What’s wrong?

855
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,180
You just beat Gao Ming badly.

856
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,060
You’re still angry?

857
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,300
It can’t change Yiren’s situation.

858
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,180
I can tell that

859
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,020
Yiren likes that job very much,

860
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,580
and she feels guilty for what she did.

861
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,020
I really don’t know how to comfort her.

862
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,740
You know what,

863
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,340
I have a way to get Yiren back to Square & Circle.

864
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,380
How will you thank me?

865
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,780
What ideas do you have?

866
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,100
Don’t ask yet.

867
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Just tell me how you will thank me

868
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,820
if I make it happen.

869
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,060
What do you want?

870
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,380
I want to...

871
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,420
I want to eat a meal cooked by you.

872
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,620
A meal?

873
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,940
Deal.

874
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,620
Get out, get out.

875
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,820
Listen to me,

876
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,260
I just want to see Mr. Huang.

877
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,260
Can I wait for him inside?

878
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,260
Miss,

879
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,780
Mr. Huang has no time for you.

880
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,540
Please do not disturb our work.

881
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,340
I won’t disturb you.

882
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,300
I’ll wait by the elevator.

883
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,100
No.

884
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,020
Outsiders are not allowed to stay here.

885
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,980
Please leave.

886
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,460
Leave.

887
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,580
You drew this?

888
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,580
Hmm.

889
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,420
You should smile more often.

890
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,460
Smiling can make one younger.

891
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,860
You’re handsome when you smile.

892
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,460
Wait!

893
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,740
That’s my coffee!

894
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,500
That’s what happens when you just leave it here.

895
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,860
Brother.

896
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,980
Mr. Fang.

897
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,100
There’s something I want to discuss with you.

898
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,740
