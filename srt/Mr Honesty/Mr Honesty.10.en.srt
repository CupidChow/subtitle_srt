I’m really sorry for today.

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
You were right.

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,440
I actually planned everything in advance.

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,920
But I was not doing this

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,640
to get information about the project.

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
I just wanted to chase you.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,120
I’ll apologize now

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,760
if I made you unhappy.

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
It won’t happen again.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Of course,

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,920
I hope we can go out on a date again.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,840
Who’s texting you?

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Oh.

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
Just chitchat.

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,800
My aunt!

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Eat up now.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
The porridge is getting cold.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Be careful.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,040
I didn’t see him clearly last time in the company.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,840
He’s got such a nice figure.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
But I’ve never seen him go to the gym.

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,160
Why is his skin even lighter than mine?

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,080
Don’t sit on my clothes.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh!

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Sorry.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
This program is so funny.

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,080
Isn’t this a legal program?

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,360
Is it really funny?

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Mr. Fang,

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,960
it’s very late now.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,600
I should go.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
Let me drive you home.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,520
There’s no need.

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,920
I can take a taxi.

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,720
It’s too late. You can stay here.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Ah?

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,680
What do you mean?

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,760
Get me some more porridge.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,880
Em.

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
What’s this?

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
You’ve been sleeping all day long.

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
But I didn’t.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Are you unhappy

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
because I disturbed

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,640
You and Li Zhe’s date?

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Of course not!

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
I’m actually very happy.

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
I feel great to work with you

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
at midnight.

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,160
Sorry.

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,080
The date to submit the proposal

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,040
of the Moon Bay Resort Project is approaching.

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
I have to speed up.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
You’ve been working for a day.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,480
You can sleep now.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
I can do it myself.

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,120
It’s ok.

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,400
I’m not tired.

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
How can I go to sleep

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
if you don’t?

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
Then how about this?

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,760
Let’s play a game

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
to wake you up.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Ok!

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,520
Well...

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
since it’s a game,

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
there should be some punishments.

87
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,520
The one who loses

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
should either do a punishment

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,920
or

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
answer another a question.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
Lying is not allowed.

92
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,720
Whatever you want.

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
I won’t lose anyway.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
Just don’t cry later.

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,520
= Square & Circle Architecture =
What is this?

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,080
A bridge.

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
It’s your turn.

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
I was wrong again?

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
Look at your face.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,880
There’s no more room.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,920
Wait.

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
This is unfair.

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Because I’m not good at maths.

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
Then pick a game you’re good at.

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,920
Just tell me

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,680
what it is.

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Right.

108
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,840
I’m not smart as you,

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
but what if it’s a game of luck?

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
Now, take your guess.

111
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Childish!

112
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,840
How come?

113
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,600
Did I do some bad things?

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,240
I’m so unlucky.

115
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
This is not about luck.

116
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
My guess was based on statistics.

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Don’t mention statistics.

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,120
I’ve been racking my brains.

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Do you want to continue?

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Come!

121
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
I haven’t won even once.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Come!

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,360
Continue!

124
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,680
This one.

125
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You’re wrong!

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,320
Finally it’s my turn to...

127
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,080
I’ll pick “truth”.

128
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,560
How could you?

129
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
I finally won,

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
but you picked “truth”.

131
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
You set the rules first, right?

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
The loser can either answer a question

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,920
or let you draw on his face.

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
I’ll answer a question.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Alright, alright.

136
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
So boring.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Then...

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
do you hate me very much?

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,640
Why do you ask this?

140
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
Because I always lied to you.

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
You hate people who tell lies, don’t you?

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
I hate lies,

143
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
but I don’t hate you.

144
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
I used to think

145
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
a lie is just a lie.

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Liars can’t be forgiven.

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
Now I still believe so.

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
But after what you told me that day,

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
I started to think

150
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,880
maybe there’s a reason

151
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,920
when people tell a lie.

152
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,240
Maybe they mean no harm,

153
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
or maybe

154
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,920
they just don’t have a choice.

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,640
Although

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
it won’t change

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,520
the fact that I hate lies.

158
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,760
But I’m willing to see it in a different way.

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,360
So,

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
you didn’t fire me

161
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,520
even if you knew

162
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
I lied to you back then.

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,640
You pretended you don’t know

164
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,800
even if you knew it was Sha Sha’s mistake.

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,880
Em.

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,280
What about you?

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Do you hate me?

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
After all, things

169
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
didn’t go well for you

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
after you met me.

171
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,520
You lost your boyfriend and your job.

172
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
And I drove you away

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
when you came for an interview.

174
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
To be honest,

175
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,520
I hated you very much in the beginning.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
I thought

177
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,840
you were self-conceited.

178
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
You never spoke nicely

179
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
and you always pissed people off.

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
But

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
after spending some time with you,

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,720
I found you’re actually very cute

183
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
though you can be weird sometimes.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
But most importantly,

185
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
you’re a very kind person.

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,960
It’s just you don’t know how to express yourself.

187
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
So I don’t hate you.

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,200
Come.

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Let’s continue.

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,920
I’m tired.

191
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
I’m going to sleep.

192
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,720
How could you?

193
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,640
You quit right after I won.

194
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
How boring!

195
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,960
I hate lies,

196
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
but I don’t hate you.

197
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Fang Zhiyou,

198
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,000
thank you for not hating me.

199
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,560
This is the greatest thing

200
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
I heard today.

201
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Good night.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,120
Where is Xu Yiren?

203
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Why hasn’t she come yet?

204
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
She’s on leave.

205
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
On leave?

206
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,600
Who approved that?

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Me.

208
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,520
Mr. Fang,

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
I want to remind you of something.

210
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,360
Although Xu Yiren is your assistant,

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,720
she’s Administration Department’s employee.

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,920
Shouldn’t you notice me

213
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
when you let her take a leave?

214
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,240
Ok.

215
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,600
I’ll be careful next time.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,520
Thank you.

217
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,080
Yuwen,

218
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,640
are you free

219
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
later?

220
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
I need your help.

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Ok.

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
Mr. Zhang,

223
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,680
try the chocolate.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Thanks, Ms. He.

225
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
Apart from the coffee,

226
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,480
the chocolate here is also very delicious.

227
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Thank you.

228
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,640
Mr. Fang,

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,920
how do you think?

230
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,280
Mr. Zhang,

231
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,000
I’m afraid your company

232
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,000
can’t meet our requirements.

233
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,800
Mr. Fang is saying that

234
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,120
our styles are not

235
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,000
very compatible on this project.

236
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
But we can cooperate in the future.

237
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,680
Oh.

238
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,160
In fact...

239
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
The coffee tastes good, right?

240
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
The chocolate also tastes good.

241
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,160
Have a try.

242
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,920
I was afraid you’d say something inappropriate.

243
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
How many modeling companies have we offended?

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,560
We shouldn’t burn our bridges.

245
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,240
That’s why I asked you to be here.

246
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,880
I was afraid I may lose control.

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
We always went to

248
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
meet clients together, didn’t we?

249
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,520
Right.

250
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
Had it not been for you,

251
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,240
Square & Circle would’ve closed down long ago.

252
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
You really mean this?

253
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,600
Of course.

254
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,480
Then I need to prove

255
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,840
I’m worthy of your compliment.

256
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
What’s wrong with you today?

257
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,880
Why do you care about how I think of you?

258
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,000
You never knew

259
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
what I cared about.

260
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,520
I forgot myself

261
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,280
last time.

262
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,320
I apologize to you.

263
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,440
You mean you wanted to fire Xu Yiren?

264
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,960
Em.

265
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
I didn’t take it to heart at all.

266
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Because I know for certain that

267
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
no matter what you do,

268
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
you’re doing it for the company’s sake.

269
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,840
That’s for sure.

270
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
So I say

271
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,960
you and I are the best partners.

272
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,280
No one can replace us.

273
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,160
We’ve evaluated several modeling companies

274
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,040
within the industry.

275
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,120
This one

276
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,760
can’t meet our requirements.

277
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,480
We need to get in touch with the best ones.

278
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
Aside from the cost,

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
there’re just a few top modeling companies.

280
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
It’s very likely

281
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
they’ve already been fully booked.

282
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,480
Besides, the Moon Bay Resort Project

283
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,400
is small.

284
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
I’m afraid they won’t consider it seriously.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,760
I know.

286
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,280
But I want to give it a try.

287
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,800
I see.

288
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,760
Leave it to me.

289
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,160
Thank you.

290
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,320
For what?

291
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,960
It’s just my job,

292
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,600
isn’t it?

293
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,680
Hello?

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Mr. Fang! Mr. Fang!

295
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,880
Where are you?

296
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,040
I’m in the driving school.

297
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,880
I’ll talk to you later.

298
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,440
Bye-bye.

299
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,440
Back up!

300
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,160
Steer to the right!

301
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,800
Back up!

302
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,280
Steer to the right!

303
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Back up!

304
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Stop! Stop!

305
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Stop! Stop!

306
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
Stop! Stop! Stop!

307
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,040
You should

308
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,080
hit the footbrake

309
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
instead of shouting, alright?

310
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
Sorry, instructor.

311
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,240
How about

312
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
I do it again?

313
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,120
No.

314
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,920
That’s it for today.

315
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,440
You can go home now.

316
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Ah?

317
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
Instructor, I...

318
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,920
Practice hard.

319
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,680
A driver can earn more than an assistant.

320
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,560
I’ve taken a screenshot.

321
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,320
I hope you can keep your word.

322
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,840
I never go back on my word.

323
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,000
Don’t you know?

324
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Xu Yiren.

325
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,280
It’s you?

326
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,960
Why are you here?

327
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,280
Don’t give me that look.

328
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,120
I’m really here to change my driving license.

329
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,800
I got my driving license abroad.

330
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
I can’t use it in China.

331
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,400
I really didn’t stalk you.

332
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,240
You...

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
You were very bold

334
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,320
when you talked to me before,

335
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
but seems

336
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
you’re afraid of me today?

337
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,680
I’m not.

338
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
Then is it because you hate me?

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,440
You don’t want to see me?

340
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
No.

341
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,080
What then?

342
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,320
If I

343
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,040
promise you

344
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,120
I won’t ask you anything about Fang Zhiyou,

345
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,040
can we still be friends?

346
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,720
Still not ok?

347
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,440
I’m almost begging you.

348
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,200
But you...

349
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,320
You’re really not good at acting.

350
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Is it that bad?

351
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Alright.

352
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,800
Seems these tricks

353
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
really don’t work on you.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,280
Sometimes,

355
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
nothing works better than a sincere heart.

356
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,920
You really talk like Fang Zhiyou.

357
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
Actually everything I said just now

358
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,640
is from the bottom of my heart.

359
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,680
It’s true.

360
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,600
I went abroad

361
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
after I finished high school.

362
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
I didn’t make any friends there.

363
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,960
I also lost contact

364
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600
with those friends

365
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
I used to have in China.

366
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
We’ve met for just several times.

367
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,640
But we chatted happily every time.

368
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,840
I admit that part of the reason

369
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,080
why I wanted to chase you

370
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,120
is you’re Fang Zhiyou’s assistant,

371
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,520
but today,

372
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
I really mean it

373
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,600
when I say

374
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,880
I want to make friends with you.

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,000
It’s true.

376
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,040
Last time in the hospital...

377
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
I knew.

378
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,440
It must be a coincidence.

379
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
Could this mean

380
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we’re destined to meet?

381
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
We always bumped into each other, didn’t we?

382
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,000
So,

383
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,200
Miss Xu Yiren,

384
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,920
can you give me another chance

385
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,800
to let me introduce myself?

386
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,920
I’m Li Zhe.

387
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
I’m Xu Yiren.

388
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,240
Yuwen,

389
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,960
sorry to

390
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,720
keep you waiting.

391
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,160
I was in a meeting.

392
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,720
It’s fine.

393
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
It’s my bad.

394
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,280
I asked you out abruptly.

395
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Did I affect your work?

396
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,520
You didn’t.

397
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,240
Nothing is more important than you.

398
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
Yuwen,

399
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,160
you wanted to see me so urgently.

400
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,200
What can I do for you?

401
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,800
I want to ask you

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,920
to do me a favor.

403
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,840
But probably

404
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
I’ll put you in a difficult position.

405
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,360
It’s fine

406
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
if you find it inconvenient.

407
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,160
I’ll do it for you as long as

408
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,560
it doesn’t harm Liangshan’s interests.

409
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,560
You’re really loyal to my father.

410
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
I know

411
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
you don’t want to hear this,

412
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,640
but I still want to say it.

413
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,720
Mr. He taught me a lot of things.

414
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
He helped me

415
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,600
become who I am today.

416
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
So I’ll never betray him.

417
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,440
Not like someone.

418
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
Mr. He placed great expectations on him,

419
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
but he betrayed Mr. He.

420
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,600
Some things are not as simple as they appear.

421
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,600
It’s hard to say who’s wrong.

422
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,280
But I didn’t come here to argue with you.

423
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Qiming,

424
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,760
are there any

425
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,120
good modeling companies

426
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,080
that you can recommend to me?

427
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,920
You’re doing this for Fang Zhiyou?

428
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,880
Yuwen,

429
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,840
you’re really

430
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,040
making things difficult for me.

431
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,600
I understand.

432
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,680
Don’t worry.

433
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
Thank you all the same.

434
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
Thank you for making time to see me.

435
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,000
Wait a moment.

436
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Let me think.

437
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,880
There’re several modeling companies

438
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,680
that are cooperating with Liangshan regularly.

439
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,640
I’ll have to exclude them.

440
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,640
But I knew Mr. Qi

441
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
from Dasheng Modeling.

442
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
I can introduce you to him.

443
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
But Dasheng is a prestigious company.

444
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,440
I’m not sure if they will

445
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,520
take your project.

446
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,640
As long as you can put us in touch,

447
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
I’ll take care of the rest.

448
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,360
Ok.

449
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I’ll get right on it.

450
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Thank you, Qiming.

451
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
From now on,

452
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
you’ll take over

453
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,040
Dasheng.

454
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,680
Just let me know

455
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,800
if you have any questions.

456
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,720
Thank you.

457
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,320
You’ll be transferred to the headquarter.

458
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
Congratulations.

459
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,760
Mr. Qi,

460
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,040
I heard Square & Circle

461
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,360
is seeking cooperation with Dasheng.

462
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,200
Em.

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,280
They asked Chen Qiming from Liangshan

464
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,000
to introduce us.

465
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,480
But I refused him.

466
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,280
Their project is too small.

467
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,520
Besides,

468
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
Dasheng can’t take more projects

469
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
for this year.

470
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,720
Fang Zhiyou’s my friend,

471
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
please take this project

472
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
for the sake of me.

473
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,240
I’ll be transferred away very soon.

474
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
Since he’s your friend,

475
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,840
why don’t you

476
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,760
cooperate with him directly

477
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,480
after you take over Dasheng?

478
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
I actually don’t want to cooperate with him.

479
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,960
I don’t get it.

480
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,560
It’s hard to explain my relationship

481
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,640
with Fang Zhiyou.

482
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,200
Anyway,

483
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,080
I hope you can do me this favor.

484
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,120
I’ll make it worth your while.

485
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,080
Qiming,

486
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,200
it’s me.

487
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,000
I reconsidered that project

488
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
you talked about last time.

489
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,000
I’d like to meet them personally

490
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,760
and discuss it.

491
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,320
Ok.

492
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
Ok, I’ll await your news.

493
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,560
No problem.

494
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,560
Why did you choose

495
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,920
a resort in such a remote place?

496
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,200
Who will ever come here?

497
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,560
That will depend on

498
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,360
if our design is attractive enough.

499
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
Seems you’re very interested

500
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
in this project.

501
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,880
You’re even looking for the best modeling company.

502
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,840
That project of Huaxing is very big,

503
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,360
but our Design Department

504
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,840
created the 3D design ourselves.

505
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,320
The size of the project is not important.

506
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
What’s important is if it’s meaningful.

507
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
The concept of eco-resort is very meaningful.

508
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
Besides, I love to create new things.

509
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,920
If we’re just imitating,

510
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,680
no matter how well we do,

511
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
we can be no more than a shadow of others.

512
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,880
Only things with our names written on them

513
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
are things that really belong to us.

514
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,440
Things with our names written on them?

515
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,560
The only thing I’ve ever

516
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,440
written my name on is test paper.

517
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,200
We’ve got a flat tire.

518
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
What should we do?

519
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
What should we do?

520
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Let’s walk back.

521
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
60 kilometers!

522
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
How is that possible?

523
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
Hello, Yuwen?

524
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,560
Zhiyou, where are you?

525
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,560
I’m at Moon Bay.

526
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,480
Why are you still there?

527
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
Do you still remember

528
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,040
our appointment with Mr. Qi?

529
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes, I know.

530
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,160
But there’s a problem with my car.

531
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
I can’t go there now.

532
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Can you go alone?

533
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
If it’s not feasible,

534
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,960
let’s fix another date.

535
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,480
It’s not easy to get an appointment with him.

536
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,760
Fine. Let’s not change the date.

537
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,920
I’ll go there myself.

538
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,280
Ok.

539
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,600
Thank you, Yuwen.

540
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,040
No problem.

541
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,600
Be careful on the road.

542
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,360
Em.

543
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,480
Xu Yiren.

544
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,280
Em.

545
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,960
What are you doing?

546
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,000
I’m searching for the methods

547
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,760
to deal with a flat tire.

548
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,600
Have you found something?

549
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Yeah.

550
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,120
First,

551
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,800
we need to change the tire.

552
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
Do you have a spare tire in the car?

553
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,920
We’ll need some tools to do that.

554
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,920
For example, a jack.

555
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
A jack is something you use

556
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,560
to lift the car by pressing its handle.

557
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,080
Why did you get in the car?

558
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,840
Didn’t your instructor tell you?

559
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
After a car accident happens,

560
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,080
you should first move the car

561
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,280
to a location that doesn’t

562
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,200
obstruct traffic.

563
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,800
Oh, ok.

564
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,200
Eat some bread.

565
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,120
I thought we can go back

566
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,240
before dinner time,

567
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,640
so I just brought some bread.

568
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,880
You can eat yourself.

569
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,600
I’m not hungry.

570
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,720
For real?

571
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Eat yourself, will you?

572
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,880
Oh.

573
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,760
How about...

574
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,960
I give you half of it?

575
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,920
If you don’t eat,

576
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,800
I wouldn’t dare to.

577
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,280
This roadside assistance company

578
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,360
is so unreliable.

579
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,040
They said one hour.

580
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,480
Now four hours have passed,

581
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,800
they still haven’t arrived.

582
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,560
I called the Tourist Service Center.

583
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,240
The person-in-charge said

584
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
they were off duty.

585
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,160
So they can only pick us up tomorrow morning.

586
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,720
That’s why I hate liars.

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,120
If they had said they can’t make it,

588
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,160
we wouldn’t have waited for such a long time.

589
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Calm down.

590
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Don’t get angry.

591
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,880
Look at this place.

592
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,240
The scenery is very beautiful.

593
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
The air is fresh.

594
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,560
And there are mountains and rivers.

595
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,920
We can think of this as a camping trip.

596
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,040
Not bad, right?

597
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,200
You like here?

598
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes.

599
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,240
Isn’t it beautiful?

600
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,520
Look there.

601
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,800
Ms. He is really one in a million.

602
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,760
So forthright!

603
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,960
I like to work with forthright persons.

604
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,080
Mr. Qi,

605
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,840
let me drink a toast to you.

606
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
We’ve always been looking forward

607
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,600
to working with Dasheng.

608
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,400
Your assistance

609
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,960
in the future would be highly appreciated.

610
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,760
I’d love to do that.

611
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
Although Square & Circle is not a big company,

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,080
I’ve actually heard about

613
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,000
Fang Zhiyou before.

614
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,720
It’s just

615
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,320
he said

616
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,240
he’d come today.

617
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,160
Now I start to doubt his sincerity.

618
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,280
It’s not like that, Mr. Qi.

619
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Here’s the thing.

620
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,480
Mr. Fang’s car

621
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,840
broke down unexpectedly,

622
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,000
he really couldn’t make it here.

623
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But he said

624
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,880
he’ll apologize

625
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,840
to you personally next time.

626
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
There’s no time like the present.

627
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,880
How about this?

628
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,120
You can drink three cups on behalf of him.

629
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,640
How do you think?

630
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,600
Mr. Qi,

631
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,560
Ms. He is a cheap drunk.

632
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,720
Let me drink on her behalf.

633
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,040
Qiming,

634
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,040
you want to be a hero?

635
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Fine.

636
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,880
But you need to drink more.

637
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
Waitress.

638
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Get us five cups.

639
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,360
Mr. Fang,

640
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,800
have you got this feeling

641
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
that something is staring at us?

642
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,480
We’re out in the mountain.

643
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,280
It’s normal

644
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,960
to encounter wild boars and wolves.

645
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,800
Don’t make a fuss about it.

646
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,840
Really?

647
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,440
But this is a resort.

648
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,800
I don’t think there’ll be beasts.

649
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
It’s hard to say.

650
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,280
This place is well-preserved.

651
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Then...

652
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,440
Let’s make a fire.

653
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,200
Animals are afraid of fire, right?

654
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,240
Why are you lying down?

655
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,160
Are you going to sleep?

656
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,080
Look up.

657
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,080
It’s so beautiful.

658
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,640
It’s very hard

659
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,040
to see such a beautiful sky in the city.

660
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,080
So let’s not waste time

661
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,080
talking about wild boars and wolves.

662
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
When was the last time

663
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
you saw such beautiful stars?

664
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
Last year,

665
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,400
in Finland.

666
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
There were also auroras.

667
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,200
Well, alright…

668
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,520
What about you?

669
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,280
I...

670
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,760
When I was 12.

671
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,920
12?

672
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,440
Em.

673
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Also out in a mountain like this.

674
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,840
That year,

675
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,720
our teacher took us on a spring outing.

676
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,680
I wandered around

677
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
and lost my way.

678
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,480
I couldn’t find the teacher and my classmates.

679
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
So I began to cry.

680
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
I thought I was going to die there.

681
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,640
And then?

682
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,040
How did you get home?

683
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,480
Then,

684
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,680
I met a boy who’s older than me.

685
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,760
He carried me to a nearby police station.

686
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
When I was on his back,

687
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I looked up

688
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
and saw stars scattering across the sky.

689
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,120
Just like now.

690
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,480
Are you still in touch with him?

691
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,960
No.

692
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
I burst into tears

693
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,320
when we arrived the police station.

694
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
I forgot

695
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,440
to ask his name.

696
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,440
When I thought of that,

697
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,040
he had already left.

698
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,280
It’s a pity.

699
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,440
Em.

700
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,920
I’ve tried to find him.

701
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
But it’s been so many years.

702
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
I haven’t got any clues.

703
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,440
I don’t know how he’s doing now.

704
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,440
That only means that

705
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
you’re not destined to meet again.

706
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,920
Probably not.

707
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,560
I always felt that I’ll see him again.

708
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,600
If

709
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,440
I ever

710
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,160
see him again,

711
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,240
I’ll...

712
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,600
What will you do?

713
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,240
♪ Carousels and skyscrapers ♪

714
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,710
♪ Me on the other side ♪

715
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,350
♪ Who sees the weakness ♪

716
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,590
♪ Behind my optimism ♪

717
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,710
♪ Lie in the room ♪

718
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,110
♪ Feels like floating in the black hole ♪

719
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,560
Qiming,

720
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,520
why are you just standing there?

721
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,440
It’s your show time.

722
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,960
Alright.

723
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,880
Wait.

724
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
Mr. Qi,

725
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
I look forward to a smooth cooperation with you.

726
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,280
Sure.

727
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,360
Be careful. Be careful.

728
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,480
Let me help you.

729
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,880
It’s all right.

730
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,360
I can walk myself.

731
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,960
You can go back.

732
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,800
How can I leave when you’re like this?

733
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
Fang Zhiyou is so unreasonable.

734
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,440
How could he

735
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,840
let a lady meet the client alone?

736
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,320
Mr. Qi was not happy about this,

737
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,000
so he made you drink that much.

738
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,160
It’s fine.

739
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,080
No matter what,

740
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,480
he’s agreed to cooperate with us.

741
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,120
Hello,

742
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,080
you need a driver, right?

743
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Yes.

744
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,880
Ok.

745
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Thank you.

746
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,200
Please wait a sec.

747
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,760
Em.

748
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,720
Qiming,

749
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
thank you for today.

750
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,280
I’ll treat you a meal another day.

751
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,720
How about

752
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
I send you home?

753
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,520
There’s no need.

754
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,720
You should leave.

755
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,080
Mister.

756
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,520
Hi.

757
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,280
Drive safely.

758
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,480
Ok.

759
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,200
Be careful.

760
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,120
Don’t worry, Mister.

761
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,680
No.

762
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,960
I have to give Zhiyou a call

763
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
and tell him this good news.

764

Wake up.

769
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,400

Xu Yiren?

791
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,840
Xu Yiren?

792
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,760
Xu Yiren?

793
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,480
Em?

794
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,640
Mr. Fang.

795
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,960
Morning.

796
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,120
What a refreshing start!

797
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,920
Does it still hurt?

798
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,240
It doesn’t.

799
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Em.

800
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,280
Did I drool?

801
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,840
Em.

802
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,400
I didn’t.

803
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,400
Liar!

804
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,760
You said you’ll never tell a lie.

805
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
I’m not lying.

806
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,160
This is

807
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,680
a joke.

808
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
This is a joke.

809
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,000
You sound so justified.

810
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
Xu Yiren,

811
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,680
now you’re like a little pufferfish.

812
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,280
Mr. Fang,

813
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
pufferfish is poisonous.

814
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,160
Don’t mess with me.

815
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,760
Yuwen, you’re amazing.

816
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,160
I always wanted to cooperate with Dasheng.

817
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,680
But our projects were not big enough.

818
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,520
They refused every time.

819
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,840
I didn’t expect

820
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,280
you persuaded them over a meal.

821
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,960
I’m glad you know this.

822
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,640
They sent this contract early in the morning.

823
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,480
I already read it through.

824
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,760
There are a lot of articles.

825
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,160
But they’re reasonable.

826
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
Most importantly,

827
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,000
they’ll arrange things to suit our timetable.

828
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,640
I recognize

829
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,480
Dasheng’s ability.

830
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,960
With their assistance,

831
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,880
now I’m more confident

832
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,360
about the Moon Bay Resort Project.

833
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,680
Thank you.

834
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,720
What’s more,

835
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,080
I shouldn’t have

836
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,080
let you go there alone yesterday.

837
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,760
Sorry.

838
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,680
It’s all right.

839
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,520
It was better that way.

840
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,920
So you wouldn’t say anything inappropriate.

841
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,680
What’s wrong?

842
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,200
Are you feeling unwell?

843
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,000
I’m fine.

844
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,320
- Really? - Em.

845
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,440
Ok.

846
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
I’ll leave the project to you then.

847
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,160
Sign the contract,

848
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,040
and start the project asap.

849
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,480
Em.

850
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,280
I’m off.

851
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,560
Go back early.

852
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,080
Em.

853
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
Sha Sha,

854
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,200
bring me some antacids.

855
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,600
The antacids

856
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,760
are normally here.

857
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,440
How come there aren’t any?

858
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,600
Sha Sha, what are you doing?

859
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,560
Ms. He is having a stomachache.

860
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,720
But she has used up all the antacids.

861
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,600
Alas!

862
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,360
Is it serious?

863
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,280
Her face has turned pale.

864
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,040
No, I have to go out and buy some.

865
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,840
Hey, wait.

866
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,600
I think I have some.

867
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,880
I’ll have a look. Wait a sec.
