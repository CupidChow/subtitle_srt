= Mr. Honesty =

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,140
= Episode 17 =

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Mr. Fang has an important meeting.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Sorry, we have to go.

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,040
Wait a second.

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,840
Who are you?

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,920
I’m his assistant.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
My assistant and girlfriend.

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Let me thank you for helping those poor students

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,720
on behalf of

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
the Faculty of Arts of Chengji University.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
You’re too polite.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,200
My mother graduated here.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
So I set up this scholarship fund in her name

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,640
to fulfill her wish.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
This is very good.

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Who’s she?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
I don’t know.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,120
Mr. Li?

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Mr. Li?

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Please stop here.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
My assistant will see to it

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,320
if there are any problems.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,120
Okay.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Thank you.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
You angry?

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
Don’t be angry.

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
Why didn’t you tell me

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,640
you were giving a lesson today?

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
My girlfriend wouldn’t keep me company,

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
so I had to come find her.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,200
Don’t tell me

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,840
you came here because you were jealous.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
Of course I were.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,760
Do you think

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,680
they can afford

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,080
to hire me as a teacher?

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
You made me feel very honored.

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,440
But,

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,520
it’d be such an embarrassment

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,200
if they knew your girlfriend actually came here

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
to sit in on the class.

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
The tuition fees for this short-term design class

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
are so expensive.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,720
Who can afford it?

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Take it.

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,800
What’s the meaning of this?

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,760
So you can pay the tuition fees.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
I don’t need it.

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
Why?

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,920
It’s my goal to become financially independent.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,880
Besides,

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,040
in case

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
we break up in the future,

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,160
I don’t want to owe you anything.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Break up?

74
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Do you think I’ll let that happen?

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
That’s not what I meant.

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
I mean in case.

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,400
You never know what will happen.

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
I can make sure it won’t happen.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Don’t even think about it.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Okay. Okay.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
I’m wrong.

82
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,860
= Uncle =

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
Hello, uncle?

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
You’ve arrived at the train station?

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,240
Didn’t you say you’ll come at end of the month?

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,120
Alright, I see.

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,760
I’ll go pick you up now.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,080
Hmm.

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,320
I can’t stay with you anymore.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
My aunt and uncle have come.

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
I’ve to pick them up.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,040
Let me drive you there.

94
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
There’s no need.

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Why?

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,120
We just got together.

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
It’ll seem like

98
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,080
I’m taking you to meet my family.

99
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
I’m not ready yet.

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,080
I’ll come back right away

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
after I find them a place to stay.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,760
Is that okay?

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,800
Hmm.

104
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
See you later then.

105
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
Come back soon.

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,280
Okay.

107
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,560
I’m off.

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Look at you.

109
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Be careful.

110
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,880
Don’t use too much force.

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,080
Be careful.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,040
I just sprained my ankle.

113
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,400
I’m not crippled.

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Besides, I’ve rested for a few days.

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
I’ve almost recovered.

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,880
You’d better be careful.

117
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,520
You know?

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,720
Alright.

119
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,360
Let go of me.

120
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,600
See? I can walk by myself

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
I can really...

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Be careful!

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh, my tummy!

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,600
You’re all skin and bones!

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
I told you not to act tough.

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you alright?

127
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Hello?

128
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,120
Mom,

129
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,760
I’ve almost recovered.

130
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
I didn’t run around.

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,760
I...

132
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,480
I’m having a meeting in the company.

133
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,080
That’s OK.

134
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
Hello?

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Hello, mom?

136
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
The signal of my phone is bad.

137
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Hello?

138
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
Too bad.

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
My mom has arrived at my home.

140
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
Listen,

141
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,240
you can go to my home first.

142
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,800
Text me when she leaves.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
I’ll go bald

144
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,640
if she keeps nagging me.

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,160
I’m counting on you, Gu Bo.

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
Be fast.

147
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,720
See you soon.

148
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
Does this mean

149
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,160
I’m going to meet my mother-in-law?

150
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
I like how it’s progressing.

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Princess?

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,280
Princess, wait for me!

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
Slow down. Slow down.

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,400
Trust me, I’m fine.

155
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Slow down.

156
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,800
Look how dirty the floor is!

157
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Madam.

158
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,000
Why are you here?

159
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
Xia Di still has work to do.

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
So she asked me to keep you company.

161
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Oh, right.

162
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,880
My name is Gu Bo.

163
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,040
I’m a good friend of Xia Di’s.

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,200
I know.

165
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,720
But you’re a boy.

166
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,080
You can’t

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920
live in a girl’s house

168
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,320
forever, right?

169
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,200
Come.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,920
You came at the right time.

171
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,840
Help me sweep the floor.

172
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay.

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,160
You know I’m not being mean.

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
But since you live here,

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,960
you should keep the floor clean, right?

176
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,400
I know, madam.

177
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,640
Stop sweeping the floor.

178
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,120
Come.

179
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,840
Come here.

180
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Here.

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,920
Sit down.

182
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,360
Help me with this.

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,400
Which one of them

184
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
do you think is better?

185
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,140
= Blind date candidates =

186
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,960
I think

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
they all look good.

188
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,600
You think so?

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
I do have a good eye.

190
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
This one then.

191
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
I like this one.

192
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Why?

193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,080
His teeth are very even.

194
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
And he looks delightful.

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
Indeed!

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Madam,

197
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
what are these?

198
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,520
These are

199
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,480
some blind date candidates

200
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,040
I selected for Xia Di.

201
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,200
What?

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,560
This one is not good, madam.

203
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
You just said his teeth are even,

204
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,680
and he looks delightful, didn’t you?

205
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
I didn’t look at him closely just now.

206
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
Look at this guy again.

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,760
There’s a problem

208
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,960
with his hairline.

209
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Look at him.

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
He’s very likely to go bald.

211
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,360
Right, indeed.

212
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,600
And this guy.

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Look at him.

214
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,160
He’s fierce-looking,

215
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
and he loves boxing.

216
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
He’ll probably commit domestic violence.

217
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,320
You mustn’t choose him.

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,280
And this guy looks like an alcoholic.

219
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
Stop. Say no more.

220
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
You think

221
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
everyone sucks.

222
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,680
But in my eyes,

223
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
everyone is better than you.

224
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,180
= Xia Di =

225
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
It’s Xia Di, right?

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,240
Play it.

227
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
Play it already.

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Has my mom left?

229
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
I haven’t.

230
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,280
Tell her,

231
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
it’s useless trying to avoid me.

232
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Listen,

233
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,440
give these files to her,

234
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,040
and let her choose

235
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,680
two guys from them.

236
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,040
I’ll fix a date for them too meet.

237
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,560
Okay. Okay.

238
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Can you complete this task?

239
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes, I can.

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Don’t worry.

241
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,800
I’m off then.

242
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
Okay.

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,840
I’m leaving.

244
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,760
Move aside!

245
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,520
Madam,

246
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
see you.

247
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
Dayong,

248
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
why is she still not here?

249
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,440
You should

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
call her now.

251
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
Uncle,

252
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,120
aunt.

253
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,120
What took you so long?

254
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
Sorry, there was a traffic jam.

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,720
I’m sorry.

256
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,680
It’s fine. It’s fine.

257
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
It’s our fault.

258
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,920
We should have

259
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,160
told you earlier.

260
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Alright, stop talking.

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,960
Let’s leave.

262
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
- We’ve been standing here for a long time.
- Right.

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,640
Let’s go to the basement

264
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
to get a taxi.

265
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
I’ll send you to the hotel.

266
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,240
Ah?

267
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,800
Hotel?

268
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,000
It’s fine. It’s fine.

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,600
The house?

270
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,720
Let’s just go to the hotel.

271
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
Yiren,

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,840
get in.

273
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Didn’t we agree

274
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,960
to pick up your uncle and aunt together?

275
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,840
How come you came alone?

276
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Yiren,

277
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,600
who is he?

278
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,800
You’re Yiren’s aunt, right?

279
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,680
I’m Li Zhe.

280
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Get in the car first.

281
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
I can’t park my car here for too long.

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,960
Let me do it.

283
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
No need.

284
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,920
Thank you. Thank you.

285
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,840
Thank you.

286
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Why did you come here?

287
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,360
I came to pick you up.

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
Look how happy they are.

289
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
Don’t ruin their mood.

290
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
I promise

291
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
I’ll leave after I send you there.

292
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,360
Thank you.

293
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,600
Yiren,

294
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,680
when did you get such a nice boyfriend?

295
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,240
Why didn’t you tell us?

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,920
No.

297
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
I’m not her boyfriend.

298
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,000
I’m just

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,400
pursuing her.

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Let’s get in the car first.

301
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,960
OK.

302
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,680
Get in. Get in.

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,520
Get in.

304
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,080
Come.

305
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,600
Get in. Get in.

306
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,280
You can sit in the front seat.

307
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,440
Of course I’ll sit there.

308
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,280
You should let Yiren...

309
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
I’ll sit there.

310
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
What a beautiful house!

311
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
This house is so big!

312
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
The living room is so big!

313
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Oh dear!

314
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,840
This is so well-decorated!

315
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
Yiren!

316
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Dayong, come take a look!

317
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,880
There is an oven in the kitchen!

318
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,240
Really?

319
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
A big oven!

320
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,520
Look, mom!

321
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,040
There’s also a bathtub!

322
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
Qing, you can take a bath in it.

323
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,120
Whose room is this?

324
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
It’ll be our room.

325
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,720
Qing! Qing!

326
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,680
Come take a look!

327
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,400
This house is beautiful.

328
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,480
It suits you very well.

329
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Dayong, hurry!

330
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Get that big suitcase here!

331
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Let’s take our things out.

332
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,000
What’s going on?

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,640
I told you I don’t want to rent this house.

334
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,560
Did you find one then?

335
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,920
Almost.

336
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,960
So you haven’t found one yet.

337
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,640
What?

338
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,280
You want them to sleep on the street?

339
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,600
I didn’t know they’d come so quickly.

340
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Otherwise, I could rent one in advance.

341
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,040
Now they can stay in a hotel for a few days.

342
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,640
You know what?

343
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,200
Now you’re with Fang Zhiyou,

344
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
you’ve become a spendthrift.

345
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,080
Do you know

346
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,600
how much it’ll cost

347
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,160
to stay in a hotel for half a month?

348
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,320
I don’t have a choice.

349
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,360
But I can solve the problem for you.

350
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,760
Since you want to rent a house,

351
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,840
why don’t you accept my help?

352
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
You know the reason.

353
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,480
You refused my help last time

354
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,240
because you knew I was using you.

355
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,080
But this time,

356
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
I simply want to

357
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,160
help you as a friend.

358
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,200
Is it true?

359
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,240
Can I trust you?

360
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,120
To be honest,

361
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
I won’t stop taking revenge against

362
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,840
Fang Zhiyou,

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,520
but I don’t want to use you anymore.

364
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,080
There’s nothing I can say

365
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
if you don’t want to engage with me

366
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
because of my relationship with Fang Zhiyou.

367
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
But if you’re afraid that

368
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,120
I might use you again,

369
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
I can swear that I won’t.

370
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,360
Will you keep your word?

371
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,240
You won’t owe me anything.

372
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,040
I helped you rent a house.

373
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,000
But you still need to pay me back.

374
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
Thank you.

375
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,800
What did you want to tell me

376
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
the other day?

377
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Yiren,

378
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,800
where is the food market?

379
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
I’ll go buy some food.

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640
Li Zhe,

381
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,400
stay and eat with us tonight.

382
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,920
Thanks, madam.

383
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,440
But I still have things to do.

384
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,920
You can spend some time together.

385
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,080
I shouldn’t disturb you.

386
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,400
I’ve got to go.

387
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,880
Thank you.

388
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,800
The key is here.

389
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,280
Call me

390
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
- Okay. Okay. - if you need my help.

391
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
Okay.

392
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
Why are you leaving?

393
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,160
- Why not eat with us? - Thank you.

394
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
I’ve got to go.

395
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,200
Bye-bye.

396
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Thank you. Thank you.

397
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Thank you again.

398
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
Thank you.

399
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,160
Yiren.

400
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,240
This house is really nice.

401
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,480
What does Li Zhe do?

402
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,720
I like this place.

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,280
How did you know each other?

404
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
Is he really wooing you?

405
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,280
No.

406
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
He was joking.

407
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,120
Right, uncle.

408
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,040
Li Zhe paid the rent.

409
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Remember to pay him back.

410
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,520
That’s for sure.

411
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
I will

412
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,080
give the money to him.

413
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,440
But he only paid the deposit

414
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
and one month’s rent.

415
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,360
You can pay

416
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
the remaining rent to the landlady.

417
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,160
Didn’t you say you’ll pay six months’ rent?

418
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,560
How come he only paid

419
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,000
one month’s rent?

420
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,720
Your friend

421
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
is so unreliable.

422
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Why pull my clothes?

423
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,680
We can receive a rent reduction that way.

424
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Li Zhe wanted to help me,

425
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
but I didn’t let him pay too much rent.

426
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,440
I thought you might need money

427
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,800
after you come.

428
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
So I told the landlady

429
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,320
you’ll pay the rent monthly.

430
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,480
But it’s fine if you want to

431
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,360
pay every six months,

432
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
you can talk to the landlady directly.

433
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,440
Maybe you can really get a rent reduction.

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,440
Alright, alright.

435
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,200
Don’t worry.

436
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,160
We can

437
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,320
take care of it.

438
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,800
It’s so late today.

439
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,840
Stay and eat with us.

440
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,800
I’ll go buy some food with your aunt.

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,360
Seriously?

442
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,320
We traveled a long way here.

443
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,480
Aren’t you tired?

444
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,520
You want me to cook?

445
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,160
Why don’t you cook yourself?

446
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Didn’t we just say

447
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,560
we’ll go buy some food?

448
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,880
Yiren...

449
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,760
Uncle, aunt,

450
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,480
how about...

451
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,280
I treat you to a meal?

452
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
You just came,

453
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
let’s eat together.

454
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Good idea.

455
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,880
We can eat outside.

456
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
But I’m telling you,

457
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
the meal will be on me.

458
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
That’s okay, uncle.

459
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,520
It’s fine.

460
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,720
Let’s go.

461
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,280
There’s no need to buy food.

462
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
Let’s eat outside.

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
Go! Go! Go!

464
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,680
Let’s go!

465
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,080
Go! Go! Go!

466
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,800
Let’s eat outside.

467
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Take the key.

468
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,160
Dear,

469
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,240
this is not enough.

470
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
You should order some dishes.

471
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Waitress,

472
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,080
get me a bowl.

473
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
Why do you want a bowl?

474
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,360
See?

475
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,520
We can eat

476
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,680
with these pickles

477
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
and chili sauce.

478
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,320
They’re very delicious.

479
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,680
You...

480
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:53,880
Waitress,

481
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,200
get me a pair of chopsticks.

482
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,480
Aunt, you can use mine.

483
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,040
Okay.

484
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,120
Young girls nowadays

485
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,280
all want to lose weight.

486
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
I also eat very little.

487
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,440
What are you doing?

488
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,720
I can share it with you.

489
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,880
So you don’t need to eat that much.

490
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What are you doing?

491
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Here you are.

492
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Eat up.

493
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,120
Stop.

494
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,120
You don’t like to eat beef,

495
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,640
right?

496
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
You don’t want to gain weight.

497
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,200
Here.

498
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,120
Let Qing have it.

499
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,680
Qing is so skinny.

500
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,040
You should eat more.

501
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,480
Don’t waste it.

502
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,080
Your sister doesn’t like to eat it anyway.

503
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,520
Here. Here.

504
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,840
That’s enough.

505
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
I won’t eat.

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Look at you!

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,840
You’re so skinny!

508
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,520
Eat up.

509
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,720
Eat up.

510
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,400
Yiren,

511
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
um…

512
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
the pickles and chili sauce

513
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
taste good.

514
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
Have a try.

515
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,080
Okay.

516
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,000
Yiren?

517
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,800
Hmm.

518
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
Where do you live now?

519
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
You can move in and live with me.

520
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
Right. Right.

521
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,080
So we can live together.

522
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,200
My...

523
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
My lease is not over yet.

524
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
Really?

525
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,040
Are you living alone,

526
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,760
or with another person?

527
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you living with Li Zhe?

528
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,280
What?

529
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
You and Li Zhe

530
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
are living together?

531
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,360
Aunt,

532
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,480
you got me wrong.

533
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,560
There’s nothing going on between us.

534
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,680
Watch what you’re saying.

535
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,520
Is it true?

536
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,280
It’s true.

537
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
I have to pay liquidated damages

538
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
if I want to move out

539
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,440
before my lease is over.

540
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Plus, the place now I live

541
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
is close to my company.

542
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,600
It’s more convenient.

543
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,160
But I can

544
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,800
come visit you during the weekends.

545
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Okay. Okay.

546
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,040
Why so nervous?

547
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,760
I was just curious.

548
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
This phone case looks nice.

549
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
Where did you buy it?

550
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,600
It’s from Xia Di.

551
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,560
I don’t know where she bought it.

552
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,680
I like it.

553
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Let me take a look at it.

554
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,320
It’s really nice.

555
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,080
You see?

556
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
This is the most popular pattern, right?

557
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
It’s really nice.

558
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
Aunt!

559
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,520
It’s just a phone case, right?

560
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,880
Let Qing have it if she likes it.

561
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,800
But it’s from a good friend of mine.

562
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,480
You can let your friend

563
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
buy a new one for you.

564
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
You’ll get a new one.

565
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
I thought you already went to bed.

566
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,040
Didn’t you eat with your uncle and aunt?

567
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,520
How come you’re hungry now?

568
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,480
We haven’t seen each other for a long time.

569
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,880
We chatted a lot

570
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
and forgot to eat.

571
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Sorry.

572
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It’s not because we chatted a lot.

573
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,280
I actually didn’t get to eat anything.

574
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,960
Sorry for letting you get bullied.

575
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,040
I should have anticipated this.

576
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,680
It’s just I was hoping for a better result.

577
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
I thought things would change

578
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,360
since we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

579
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,440
You can’t decide

580
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,800
who you’re related to by blood.

581
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,440
You don’t need to

582
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
feel so indebted to them.

583
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,920
After my parents died,

584
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,320
they became my only family in this world.

585
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
Actually I’m very grateful to them.

586
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
Because they raised me.

587
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,680
My aunt is very calculating.

588
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,480
I know

589
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,920
they’re living a hard life.

590
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
Maybe their life

591
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,680
will be easier without me.

592
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,440
It’s all in the past.

593
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,360
I’ll always stay by your side.

594
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,800
I’ll make our home

595
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,960
a happy one.

596
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,900
= Blind date candidates =

597
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,520
7.5 in IELTS?

598
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,160
Why don’t you just go abroad?

599
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,280
I can speak perfect Mandarin, alright?

600
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,400
6'3'' tall?

601
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,320
Why don’t you become a hanger?

602
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

603
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,520
Not bad, huh?

604
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,640
You...

605
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,040
What do you mean?

606
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
I didn’t expect

607
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,840
you actually have such a muscular body.

608
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,640
You look very manly.

609
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,160
Then

610
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,680
why are you covering it?

611
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
Okay. Okay.

612
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,800
I’ll show you.

613
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,440
Look closely.

614
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,360
As you wish.

615
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,360
It’s actually

616
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,160
not as good as I thought.

617
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,720
That guard of our block is better than you.

618
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
What’s wrong?

619
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,800
You look so gloomy.

620
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,560
Tell me about it.

621
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,960
Yiren.

622
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,360
Hmm.

623
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,880
Have you ever met Xia Di’s mother?

624
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,480
You met her?

625
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Hmm.

626
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
What did she tell you?

627
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,680
She’s arranging blind dates for Xia Di.

628
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,440
Blind dates?

629
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
Oh gosh.

630
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,360
Too bad for Xia Di.

631
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
If there is a person

632
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,040
Xia Di can’t deal with,

633
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,560
it will has to be her mother.

634
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,520
Xia Di’s going on a blind date,

635
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,600
why are you crying?

636
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Won’t you cry if Fang Zhiyou

637
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,440
is going on a blind date?

638
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
But

639
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
Xia Di is older than you.

640
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
I’m taller than her, alright?

641
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,360
Xia Di is actually

642
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,720
very hot-tempered.

643
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,080
She’s just being forthright.

644
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
Do you know

645
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,360
she’ll use force to solve problems sometimes?

646
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Then I can be her sandbag.

647
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,280
I saw her fight before.

648
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,320
She was awesome.

649
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
She’s

650
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,080
sharp-tongued,

651
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
and never saves face for others.

652
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,000
I don’t know if you can live with that.

653
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,160
It doesn’t matter.

654
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
As long as I can be with her,

655
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,800
I don’t mind losing face at all.

656
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,800
Wait.

657
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,960
How can you speak ill of Xia Di?

658
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
I don’t know how Xia Di treats her other friends,

659
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
but she’s baring her soul to you.

660
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,720
How can you say such things about her?

661
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,360
Not bad, Gu Bo.

662
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,040
You have

663
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,840
gone through me.

664
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
Thank you, Yiren.

665
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,160
It’s useless thanking me.

666
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
You have to

667
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
get Xia Di to say yes.

668
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
Tell her bravely if you like her.

669
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,160
That’s what you taught me.

670
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,440
The Moon Bay Resort Project

671
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,720
is our most important project recently.

672
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,800
You should manage the human resources well.

673
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,160
No problem.

674
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,360
OK.

675
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
That’s it.

676
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,520
What’s up?

677
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,640
Nothing.

678
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,520
It’s just that

679
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,080
I heard some rumors

680
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,280
about you and Xu Yiren.

681
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
Of course.

682
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,760
I know you don’t care about

683
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
these groundless remarks.

684
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,000
But I want to remind you that

685
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,480
as the boss,

686
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,880
you should pay attention to this.

687
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,920
Otherwise, Xu Yiren may get hurt as well.

688
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,400
What you heard

689
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
is not rumors,

690
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
and it’s not groundless.

691
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,240
- So? - So,

692
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,640
since you’re my good friend,

693
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
I should have told you this earlier.

694
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,080
It’s just I haven’t found a good opportunity.

695
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,680
Right.

696
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
I’ve been dating Xu Yiren.

697
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,080
She doesn’t want others to know,

698
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
so we didn’t make it public.

699
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
Fang Zhiyou,

700
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,920
this is not a funny joke.

701
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,880
You know I never joked around.

702
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,520
Fang Zhiyou, what’s wrong with you?

703
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,680
How...

704
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
How come you fell in love

705
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,080
with such kind of a person?

706
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,120
What kind of a person?

707
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,160
Isn’t it obvious enough?

708
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,160
Who are you?

709
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,120
You’re Fang Zhiyou.

710
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,640
A very talented designer,

711
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,360
the youngest winner of the New Designer Award.

712
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,000
But what about her?

713
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
She graduated from a diploma mill.

714
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
When she just entered the company,

715
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,440
she couldn’t even read a design drawing.

716
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,200
Can you communicate with each other?

717
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,200
Do you have anything in common?

718
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,160
He Yuwen,

719
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,400
I don’t need others to tell me

720
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
how to communicate with my girlfriend.

721
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Fang Zhiyou,

722
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,320
do you really know

723
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
what kind of a person she is?

724
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,680
She’s full of lies.

725
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,320
You can never know

726
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,880
if she’s telling the truth or if she’s lying.

727
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,760
I can tell.

728
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,160
She’ll feel guilty when she tells a lie.

729
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,920
She’ll smile brightly,

730
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,440
but her eyes are dull.

731
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,760
When she’s telling the truth,

732
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,760
there will be stars in her eyes.

733
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,480
I want to be the stars in her eyes,

734
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,360
and let her be herself happily.

735
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,360
But...

736
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,720
Fang Zhiyou, I’ve had enough of you.

737
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,480
How come you became like this?

738
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,760
How could you become like other men

739
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,920
that can’t resist the temptation of women?

740
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,840
Do you really know

741
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
what kind of a person she is?

742
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,520
She’s hooking up with you

743
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,400
and Li Zhe at the same time.

744
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,120
Such kind a person

745
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,800
is not worthy of your love.

746
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,600
That’s enough!

747
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,480
He Yuwen,

748
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,400
with what you said just now,

749
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,920
I’d ask you to go out

750
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,080
if we were not old friends.

751
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
Yes.

752
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
Right.

753
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
She’s your girlfriend.

754
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,320
What about me?

755
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,360
What am I to you?

756
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,240
To you,

757
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
I’m just a friend,

758
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
a partner.

759
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
So everything we ever did

760
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
when we were together

761
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
was about work.

762
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,440
All about work.

763
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Ms. He.

764
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
Are you alright, Yiren?

765
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
I’m fine.

766
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
What’s wrong with Ms. He?

767
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,360
I don’t know.

768
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,520
Seems she quarreled with Mr. Fang again.

769
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,120
It’s fine.

770
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
They were always like this.

771
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,160
Are you alright?

772
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,280
I’m fine.

773
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,300
= Aunt =

774
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,880
Hello, aunt?

775
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,920
What?

776
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,560
I’ll be there soon.

777
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Sha Sha.

778
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,280
Hmm.

779
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
I have an emergency at home.

780
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,320
Help me tell Mr. Fang

781
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,200
if he asks later.

782
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,120
Oh.

783
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,800
Li Zhe,

784
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,280
thank you so much.

785
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,720
The house would’ve flooded

786
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,480
if you hadn’t arrived in time.

787
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Unluckily,

788
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,640
her father was not home.

789
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,680
I was really worried just now.

790
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,280
Thank you.

791
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,680
Thank you.

792
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,560
It’s nothing.

793
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,000
Why are you here?

794
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,880
You don’t know why?

795
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
I called you so many times.

796
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,320
Our house almost flooded.

797
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,640
But Li Zhe came in time

798
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
and repaired the pipes.

799
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,760
It’s solved now.

800
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
The drain pipes

801
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
were not in the right positions.

802
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,600
Just in case,

803
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,560
I’ll find someone

804
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,360
to come examine it again tomorrow.

805
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,080
Okay. Okay.

806
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,760
Thank you.

807
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
Thank you.

808
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,200
How did you find his phone number?

809
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,440
I called the agent.

810
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,960
He gave me Li Zhe’s phone number.

811
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Am I clever?

812
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,320
It’s not a big problem.

813
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,120
What’s wrong with you?

814
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,920
I’ve been waiting for more than one hour.

815
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,480
How about this?

816
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,520
I’ll go down later,

817
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,440
and clean your room up.

818
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Is that okay?

819
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Clean it up?

820
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
My house is soaked in water.

821
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
Clean it up?

822
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,160
- Sir! Sir! - What do you mean?

823
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
How about

824
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,800
I go down with you to take a look?

825
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,000
Who are you?

826
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,840
Ah?

827
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,760
What’s that got to do with you?

828
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,000
How about this?

829
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,360
I’ll go down with you now.

830
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,680
I’ll pay all the losses

831
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,400
you may suffer in full.

832
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
What are you doing?

833
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,200
OK.

834
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,040
Then go down with me.

835
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,520
Let go of me!

836
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,240
I’ll go downstairs.

837
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,280
Come. Eat up!

838
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,880
This is my signature dish,

839
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,720
braised fish in brown sauce.

840
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,440
Here. Here.

841
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
Try it. Try it.

842
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,960
OK. OK.

843
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,680
How does it taste?

844
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,800
It’s so delicious.

845
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,000
People will believe it if we say

846
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you’re a Michelin chef.

847
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,640
How sweet of him!

848
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,280
Li Zhe,

849
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,720
what do you do?

850
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I run a modeling company.

851
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,440
Um...

852
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,000
Modeling?

853
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,880
Like architectural designs.

854
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,440
Really?

855
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
I’ve liked drawing since childhood.

856
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,720
I always wanted to be a designer.

857
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,640
Really?

858
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
It’s a pity that I didn’t get to do it.

859
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,280
I’d like to go to your company to take a look

860
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,000
if it’s okay.

861
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,600
No problem.

862
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,200
Sure.

863
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
I even did your homework

864
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,720
assigned by your art teacher.

865
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,680
Since when did you want to become a designer?

866
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,080
Be careful.

867
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,240
You alright?

868
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,920
Eat slowly.

869
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
I’m fine.

870
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
I haven’t eaten these dishes for quite a while.

871
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,320
So I was eating too fast.

872
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,840
Don’t eat so fast.

873
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,440
Eat up.

874
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,480
Then you can come back more often.

875
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,480
We also need to

876
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
catch up with each other.

877
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, right,

878
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,880
let me show you a picture she drew before.

879
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,440
Her teacher said she’s very talented.

880
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,480
How do you think?

881
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,680
It’s really good.

882
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,400
That’s right!

883
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
Her teacher

884
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,280
said she’s clever

885
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
and praised her a lot.

886
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,160
She can draw pretty much everything.

887
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,120
Mom,

888
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,920
stop praising me.

889
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,480
You’re making me feel uncomfortable.

890
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,760
Don’t be shy.

891
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,240
It’s very interesting.

892
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
The lines are wobbly.

893
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
And the layout is really bad.

894
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,560
I could draw better than this

895
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,840
when I was in kindergarten.

896
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,000
You bought it from the supermarket?

897
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
The label is still here.

898
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,520
How much salt did you put to the dish?

899
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,920
These seasonings

900
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,280
can’t remove the stale smell.

901
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,960
Your cooking skills really suck.

902
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,000
This is what you ate

903
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
for so many years?

904
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,440
Yiren?

905
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
What’s with the smile?

906
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,960
Nothing, nothing.

907
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Yiren?

908
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,480
Hmm.

909
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
I heard

910
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,000
you have a boyfriend?

911
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,720
Ah?

912
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,080
Boyfriend?

913
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,840
Yiren,

914
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,280
why did you never mention this to me?

915
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
No. No.

916
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,360
Who told you that?

917
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
Don’t talk nonsense.

918
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,280
I just

919
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,640
wanted to test Yiren.

920
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,440
That’s good.

921
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,040
That means I still have a chance.

922
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,520
Yiren,

923
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,160
I envy you so much.

924
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,040
Li Zhe is wooing you.

925
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,960
He’s so much better than Gao Ming.

926
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Li Zhe,

927
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
do you know Gao Ming?

928
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,880
He is Yiren’s ex-boyfriend.

929
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,120
They...

930
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,040
They’d been together for many years.

931
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
And then they suddenly broke up.

932
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,520
Yiren,

933
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,000
why did you break up?

934
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,400
It’s been a long while.

935
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,360
Let’s not mention it.

936
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,960
Why?

937
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
Did you do anything

938
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,120
that hurt Gao Ming?

939
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,160
Or did Gao Ming...

940
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
Yiren

941
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,840
failed to choose the right man before,

942
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,280
but it’s actually a good thing.

943
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,120
So that I still have a chance.

944
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,840
Right?

945
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,640
You should thank Gao Ming on behalf of me.

946
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,400
Thank him for...

947
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
Eat up. Eat up.

948
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,280
Have a cup of tea.

949
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,160
Thank you.

950
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
Does Fang Zhiyou know this?

951
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,080
What?

952
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,560
You didn’t tell them about your relationship.

953
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,640
Why are you hiding it from them?

954
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,080
I don’t mean to.

955
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,880
It’s just I’m not ready yet.

956
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,560
Okay.

957
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
I’ll tell them now.

958
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,720
Dare you?

959
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,480
Do you know why I didn’t say it?

960
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Because I can tell that

961
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,480
you’re not confident

962
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,520
about your relationship.

963
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,280
You didn’t tell your family

964
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,920
because you think

965
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,280
you may break up at any time.

966
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,480
Right?

967
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,240
Sometimes

968
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
you’re really self-conceited.

969
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,640
Changing the topic by attacking me?

970
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,320
That means I was right.

971
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Even if there’s a problem

972
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,960
with our relationship,

973
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,560
it’s only between Fang Zhiyou and me.

974
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,000
What’s that got to do with you?

975
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,480
Of course it has something to do with me.

976
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
How can you be my girlfriend

977
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,560
if you don’t break up?

978
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,000
What?

979
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,080
You want to date two men at the same time?

980
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I don’t mind.

981
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,960
Li Zhe,

982
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,360
please don’t say things like this again.

983
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,640
Even if you don’t respect Fang Zhiyou and me,

984
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,360
you should respect yourself.

985
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,840
Okay.

986
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,960
I’m sorry.

987
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,800
The moon is so bright tonight.

988
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,320
There are too many lights in the city.

989
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,600
The moonlight doesn’t appear bright enough.

990
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
You should really go to the mountains.

991
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
The moon is the brightest

992
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,920
when you see it from there.

993
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
I’ve seen it before.

994
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,480
When?

995
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,800
When I...

996
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,320
I’m not lying, alright?

997
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,760
Xu Yiren,

998
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,240
were you ever

999
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,320
on a trip to...

1000
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
You two, don’t stay outside.

1001
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,080
It’s cold.

1002
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,080
Come in and have some fruit.

1003
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,400
What’s wrong with you?

1004
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,240
Nothing serious.

1005
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,040
I’m having a stomachache.

1006
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,520
Let me take you to the hospital.

1007
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,080
That’s not necessary.

1008
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,920
I’ll get you some medicine.

1009
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,320
Hmm.

1010
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,800
Stop pretending.

1011
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,360
You just want to hook up with Li Zhe.

1012
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,040
I’ll let you suffer a bit longer.

1013
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,320
Did you find it?

1014
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
Almost.

1015
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,600
Is this one okay?

1016
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,920
Yes.

1017
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,720
Let’s go.

1018
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,760
Sorry.

1019
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,400
It wasn’t on purpose.

1020
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
It’s nothing.

1021
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,800
It really was you.

1022
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,160
You like it?

1023
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,000
I can give it to you.

1024
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,040
It’s yours?

1025
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,080
Of course.

1026
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,240
It’s in my room, of course it’s mine.

1027
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,400
What about this one?

1028
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,760
It’s also mine.

1029
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,600
I wore it very often when I was a kid.

1030
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,200
See?

1031
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,400
No.

1032
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,880
How could it be yours?

1033
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
Are you alright?

1034
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,000
It is mine.

1035
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,680
Qing,

1036
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,920
take a look at my dress.

1037
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,840
Is it beautiful?

1038
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,520
I’m...

1039
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,960
I’m sorry.

1040
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,400
I’ll excuse myself.

1041
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,480
I’ll excuse myself.

1042
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,920
You can continue.

1043
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,720
Take your time.

1044
