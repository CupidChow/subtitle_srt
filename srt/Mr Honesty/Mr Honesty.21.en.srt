Gu Bo,

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,360
take a rest.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,280
Have the noodles first.

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,840
Eat without me. I’m not hungry.

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
There’s one screw left.

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
Just leave it there.

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Don’t worry.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,840
I can fix it.

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
Give me a few more minutes.

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,720
Alright.

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,320
Let’s see if it works.

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,960
Gu Bo!

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
Did you knock the power off?

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
Sorry, Xia Di.

63
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,800
No biggie.

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,840
I’ve called property management.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
They can

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,280
make the power back on.

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
What about your speaker box?

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
I don’t like the color anyway.

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
It’s good to have a new one.

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
No wonder you don’t like me.

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
I’m so useless.

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
You’re a nice guy.

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
I mean it.

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,840
It’s my fault.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
I’m not a passionate person.

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,040
Investing so much energy in love

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
is too risky

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
with little return.

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
You know what I’m saying?

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
I don’t.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Let me put it this way.

82
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Although I draw romantic comics for a living,

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
I know little about love.

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,640
I’ve never

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
had any real relationships.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,640
I don’t know what it’s like

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
to love someone

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,400
or,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
what should it be like?

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
Try it.

91
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,720
What?

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Didn’t you say

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
you want to know

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
what it’s like to love someone?

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
Let’s try it.

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
Take it as an experiment.

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
I’ll be your guinea pig.

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,480
Even if...

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Even if it doesn’t work out

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,320
and you still don’t love me,

101
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
that’s OK.

102
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,920
I’m not

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
forcing you to be with me.

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
It’s just that I want to show you

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,200
loving someone

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
is better than you imagined.

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
The power is back.

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,120
Yeah, it’s back.

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
Good timing.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
If there isn’t anything else,

111
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
you can go home.

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,560
I’m tired.

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
I need to sleep.

114
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,040
Good night.

115
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I... I...

116
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
Sleepyhead,

117
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,200
wake up. Stop pretending.

118
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,400
How did you know I’m awake?

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,320
You just smiled

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
and you were smiling

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
in your dream the entire night.

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,160
It’s time to get up.

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,680
Let’s not go to the office today.

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,680
I can’t.

125
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,760
- No? - What are you doing?

126
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,620
= Reminder Meeting for the Bid =

127
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,840
As your assistant, I have to remind you

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,520
that you and Ms. He

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,280
have a meeting later

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
to discuss the bid.

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
I suggest

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,720
you get up now, take a shower and get changed.

133
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,360
I’ll ask reception to get your breakfast ready.

134
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Is that

135
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,880
OK?

136
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Not exactly.

137
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Fine.

138
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,040
You stay here.

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
I’m getting out of bed.

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
Let’s cuddle

141
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,080
for a few more minutes.

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
I’ve contacted the two firms

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
you selected.

144
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,360
Hongtu says

145
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
this project is beyond their ability.

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,560
They’ve made it clear to waive the right.

147
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,560
What about Jitong?

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Their response is vague.

149
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,040
The clock is ticking.

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
We should reach out to other firms.

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,280
What do you think

152
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
about Jiaye?

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,880
Jiaye?

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

155
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Never heard of it.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,680
I know.

157
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
Jiaye was founded

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,280
last year.

159
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,000
It’s a small firm

160
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
and has never worked with you,

161
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
so you don’t know about it.

162
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
I’ve done my research.

163
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,840
As small as it is,

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
they’re responsible

165
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
and professional.

166
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
What do you think?

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
Me?

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
We’re having a discussion.

169
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,560
Feel free to speak your mind.

170
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
Yes, Yiren.

171
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,840
I worked with small engineering companies

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,400
at my last job.

173
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
Some

174
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,640
are unprofessional.

175
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,280
But there are a few

176
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,520
that can’t

177
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,040
land big projects

178
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
because of the size

179
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,040
and lack of funds.

180
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Actually,

181
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,080
they’re capable.

182
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,080
But Jiaye...

183
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Look,

184
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,400
Yiren also thinks it may work.

185
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,240
We’re calling for bids anyway.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,080
Why don’t we give them a chance?

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Let them show us

188
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
how well they can do.

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,840
OK.

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,440
Send them an invitation.

191
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Sure.

192
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,080
No problem.

193
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
I’m on it.

194
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
By the way, Yiren,

195
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
you’ll be assisting me

196
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
with the open bid.

197
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Let’s discuss the invitation later.

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
Me?

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,760
Yes.

200
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,640
What’s wrong?

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
I can’t give you orders anymore.

202
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,240
No, no.

203
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Relax.

204
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
I’ve told Mr. Fang about it.

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,520
He’s agreed.

206
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
I’m not sure

207
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
if I’m up for

208
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,960
such an important task.

209
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Be confident.

210
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
I always have faith in you.

211
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Thanks.

212
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
I’ll do my best.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
Invitations

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,920
must be sent to all bidders within a week.

215
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,880
No delay is allowed.

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,240
So you may have to

217
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,280
work overtime in the next few days.

218
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,880
Also, pay attention to the format.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,040
Make sure the details and requirements

220
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,160
are accurate.

221
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
If there’s any question,

222
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,000
you can come to me anytime.

223
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,160
Should I call you naive

224
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,800
or stupid?

225
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,160
He doesn’t need to change.

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
You don’t know him at all.

227
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Name your price.

228
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
What can make you leave Fang Zhiyou?

229
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Yiren,

230
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,920
can you meet the deadline?

231
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Is it too tight?

232
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
Or,

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
if you can’t finish it on time,

234
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
please tell me in advance.

235
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,160
I got it.

236
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,840
I’ll get it done on time.

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,960
Good.

238
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Ms. He.

239
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
What’s wrong?

240
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
I’d like to know

241
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,320
if you still think

242
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,040
I shouldn’t work here

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,760
or stay with Fang Zhiyou.

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,560
Yes.

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,280
But why...

246
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
Are you wondering

247
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
why my attitude towards you

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
has completely changed?

249
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
To tell you the truth,

250
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
previously, I targeted you

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,680
for the sake of the company

252
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
as well as

253
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
myself.

254
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
I love Fang Zhiyou.

255
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
I’ve loved him since a long time ago.

256
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,960
When I

257
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,560
first heard

258
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,040
you two are together,

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,280
I couldn’t take it.

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
As for those things I said,

261
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
I said them out of jealousy.

262
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
You love Fang Zhiyou?

263
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,520
What?

264
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
You don’t know?

265
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,920
Zhiyou didn’t tell you?

266
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,080
I thought there were no secrets

267
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
between you guys.

268
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
I probably overestimated

269
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,280
your relationship.

270
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
He didn’t tell me

271
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
but I trust him.

272
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,520
Either

273
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,840
he takes you as his friend

274
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
and respects your privacy,

275
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,440
or

276
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
he didn’t think

277
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,960
it was worth mentioning,

278
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,360
so he forgot about it.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
All that doesn’t matter.

280
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
Anyway,

281
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,800
I’ll spare no effort at work

282
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,360
and I hope

283
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,920
you won’t be biased against me

284
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,200
because of our relationship.

285
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,040
Details are nice.

286
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,360
They look real.

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
They have to be,

288
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,440
or how can they fool Fang Zhiyou?

289
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,080
Jiaye is only a shell company.

290
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
Your files look real,

291
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
but I’m not sure if Fang Zhiyou

292
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
will believe them.

293
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,640
I’m not sure

294
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,240
about that either.

295
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,120
But I trust you.

296
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,160
He believes you

297
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
more than anyone else.

298
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,800
I know what to do.

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
We’d better see each other as little as possible.

300
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,920
Ms. He,

301
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
I have to remind you

302
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
that once you take this step,

303
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,760
there’s no coming back.

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,560
The die is cast.

305
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,200
I won’t regret it.

306
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
I thought there were no secrets

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,840
between you guys.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,280
I probably overestimated your relationship.

309
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
Why didn’t Fang Zhiyou say anything to me?

310
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,240
I said I trust him

311
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,040
but I can’t stop thinking of it.

312
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Should I

313
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
ask him about it?

314
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,240
I’ve been trying

315
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,120
not to lie because of him.

316
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
Why did he hide things from me?

317
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,480
Lunch break!

318
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,280
Guys,

319
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,040
what should we have

320
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,280
for lunch today?

321
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
How about

322
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,720
going to the new noddle restaurant?

323
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,040
We can have a try.

324
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,040
Give it a rest!

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,800
The creative cuisine you picked last time

326
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,920
made me almost live in the bathroom.

327
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,560
You no longer have the right to pick restaurants.

328
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,400
Yiren,

329
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
what do you want for lunch?

330
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,880
I’m not picky.

331
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Can you be more flattering?

332
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
You start to suck up

333
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,160
to our future Mrs. Fang already?

334
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Mind your own business.

335
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,840
Enough.

336
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,480
Our lunch break

337
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,520
is only 1.5 hours.

338
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
Stop wasting time

339
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,960
on bickering.

340
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
- Let’s go. - Come on.

341
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,520
Let’s go.

342
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,040
Come, Yiren.

343
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,120
- OK. - Let’s go.

344
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,280
Mr. Fang.

345
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,320
From now on, I own Xu Yiren’s lunch break.

346
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
You can eat without her.

347
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,400
Mr. Fang.

348
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,720
Mr. Fang, you...

349
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,760
mean...

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,440
every day?

351
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,440
What’s wrong?

352
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,800
Problems?

353
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,680
- No, of course not. - Not at all.

354
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,960
Bon appétit.

355
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,800
Yiren,

357
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,200
bye.

358
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,080
Bye.

359
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,080
Bye.

360
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,080
Let’s go.

361
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,880
Hurry.

362
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
What was that?

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,120
I didn’t agree to have lunch with you every day.

364
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,800
You’ve gone too far.

365
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
They’ll laugh at me.

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Why will they do that?

367
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,240
And why...

368
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,280
can’t we have lunch together every day?

369
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
Are they more important than me?

370
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,920
Also...

371
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
Alright.

372
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
I’ll take that back.

373
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,360
Mr. Fang,

374
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,600
what do you want to eat?

375
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
Anything your pick.

376
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,480
Really?

377
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,360
This is it.

378
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,600
Isn’t this a convenience store?

379
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,880
Have a seat.

380
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,560
I’ll go pick up some food.

381
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Here’s the money.

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,760
Thank you.

383
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Are these enough?

384
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,840
I can go get more.

385
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
They are.

386
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,400
Taste it.

387
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,840
You first.

388
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,760
Try it.

389
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
Is it good?

390
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,080
Do you remember

391
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
when I went to our company for the interview,

392
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,880
you kicked me out of the conference room?

393
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,760
Are you raking up the past?

394
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
No.

395
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,200
That day, I was devastated

396
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
and desperate.

397
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
I came to this store,

398
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
ordered the same food

399
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,480
and sat over there

400
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,040
right at that spot.

401
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
I was overwhelmed.

402
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
I saw

403
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,120
no way out.

404
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,360
My future was dark.

405
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,360
Sorry.

406
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,000
I didn’t know you before

407
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,480
and I jumped to conclusions,

408
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
calling you a liar.

409
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,760
I didn’t know you either.

410
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,760
Back then, I thought

411
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
you were an emotionless dictator.

412
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
I guess we’re even.

413
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,680
True.

414
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,200
I...

415
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
want to ask you something.

416
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,680
I’ll take care of you.

417
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,560
What?

418
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,760
Don’t men

419
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,720
always have to say that

420
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,360
after what we did?

421
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
I forgot to tell you this morning.

422
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Who told you that?

423
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
Shiyu.

424
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
She asked me to watch Korean dramas.

425
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Men in the show all said that.

426
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,440
You’ll have to

427
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,640
wean off from soap operas.

428
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,040
That’s not what I meant to ask.

429
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,840
You interrupted me.

430
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,600
Sorry.

431
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,200
What else?

432
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
Is it true

433
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,920
that Ms. He has a thing for you?

434
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,520
Why didn’t you tell me?

435
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,720
I didn’t want you

436
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,000
to overthink,

437
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
so I kept it from you.

438
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Well...

439
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,960
Do you love her?

440
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,280
You tell me.

441
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,000
I know that’s a silly question,

442
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,280
but I have to hear the answer from you

443
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
to be relieved.

444
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
I didn’t love her before

445
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,520
and I won’t in the future.

446
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Good.

447
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
Am I

448
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,560
really your first love?

449
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,040
No.

450
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,200
I knew it!

451
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,000
I was joking.

452
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,440
You lied to me.

453
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Liar!

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
I thought you’d never tell lies.

455
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,040
I didn’t.

456
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,960
That was a joke.

457
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,600
You probably don’t know

458
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,960
that every time you lie,

459
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
you can’t help touching your nose.

460
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,880
Do you want to be like Pinocchio?

461
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,520
Alright.

462
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,120
Enough about that.

463
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,000
Try this.

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,920
It’s refreshing.

465
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,760
What are you doing?

466
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,400
People are watching us.

467
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,520
So what if they are?

468
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,440
It’s sweet.

469
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,200
Have some more.

470
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
We can share it.

471
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,800
Xia Di,

472
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,680
your Mr. Honesty

473
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
was off to a good start,

474
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,360
but the views

475
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,800
have plunged lately.

476
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,320
It can’t continue like that.

477
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,920
I read the comments.

478
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Viewers say the love line

479
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,320
is too cliche.

480
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
I suggest you change it.

481
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
All plays

482
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,640
adopt similar structures.

483
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Love lines are always the same.

484
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,560
Either a rich man loves you

485
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,200
or he doesn’t.

486
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,560
If he loves you, he’ll do anything for you

487
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,960
and indulge your every whim.

488
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,000
If he doesn’t,

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
make him love you

490
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
and then indulge your every whim.

491
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,800
What else is there?

492
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Besides,

493
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
fans these days

494
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,520
are into such stories.

495
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,400
Not true.

496
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,880
There are all sorts of comics

497
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
with various themes available.

498
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
Fans have become

499
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,800
much pickier.

500
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,400
If there’s a love line in your story,

501
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,040
it has to speak to readers

502
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,920
and be close to their lives.

503
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,600
Ideal love won’t work.

504
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,040
If so, they can just review their own lives.

505
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,720
Why bother reading comics?

506
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,040
Maybe

507
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,960
you should start a relationship yourself.

508
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,080
What?

509
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,480
They all say

510
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,840
experience produces feelings

511
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,640
and feelings lead to inspiration.

512
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
Look at Bai Cha

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
who has a cat and a dog.

514
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,400
Or where would King and Black come from?

515
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Creation requires imagination.

516
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,320
Does one need to catch thieves

517
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
before writing such a film?

518
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,760
No.

519
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Your imagination tank is dry,

520
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Missy!

521
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
I don’t care what you do,

522
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
but if you can’t come up with something new

523
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,920
and the views keep dropping,

524
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,480
both of us will have to live on the streets.

525
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Got it?

526
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,880
Yes,

527
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
ma’am.

528
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,920
Here’s your water.

529
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,800
Thanks.

530
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,760
May I borrow a pen?

531
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,280
Xu Yiren,

532
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,680
have you

533
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,360
forgotten something?

534
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,800
What is it?

535
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,560
That you already have a boyfriend.

536
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
It’s late.

537
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Well...

538
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
can go back without me.

539
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
I’ll be back later.

540
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,920
OK?

541
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,880
Are you kicking me out?

542
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
I’m not.

543
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,760
You keep pacing back and force.

544
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,680
I can’t focus.

545
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,840
I’m trying to finish it soon.

546
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Who’s pacing?

547
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
Yuwen is right.

548
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
I shouldn’t have my girlfriend work for me.

549
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,160
I’m not sure if I should praise you

550
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
for working tirelessly

551
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,280
or complain to you

552
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,120
that you put work before me.

553
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,040
Yuwen?

554
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,360
Yuwen who?

555
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,120
He Yuwen.

556
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
What are you doing?

557
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,360
Are you playing cute?

558
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
Will this attract your attention?

559
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Of course.

560
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,160
But

561
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,040
I have to finish drafting the invitation.

562
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,200
I’ll help you

563
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,360
with it tomorrow.

564
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,720
No.

565
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,160
I promised Ms. He to finish it today.

566
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
It must be done on time

567
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,400
to have it revised tomorrow.

568
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,160
Come on.

569
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,440
Be a good boy.

570
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,800
Sit tight.

571
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
Your boss is ordering you

572
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
to go home.

573
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Fine.

574
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,880
Let’s go home.

575
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,800
Get up

576
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,360
and help me clean the desk.

577
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,160
That’s more like it.

578
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
Working long hours

579
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
makes girls bald easily.

580
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,360
That’s so vicious

581
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,560
a curse!

582
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,960
Do you know

583
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,520
those in their 20s start to have hair implants?

584
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,080
You’re mean.

585
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,000
Just a friendly reminder.

586
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,520
Hey,

587
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,320
let’s go to your uncle’s

588
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,560
some day.

589
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,080
Our meeting last time was unpleasant.

590
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,240
Sure.

591
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,120
OK.

592
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,120
I don’t want him to be biased against you.

593
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,560
Once this bidding thing is over,

594
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
let’s go visit him.

595
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,160
OK?

596
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,720
Still, work comes before me.

597
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,840
Boss,

598
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
who am I

599
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,320
working so hard for?

600
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,840
For me.

601
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,040
Let’s go home.

602
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,880
Ms. He.

603
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,160
All done so soon?

604
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,640
I meant to send it to you last night,

605
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,760
but...

606
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,900
= Moon Bay Resort Calls for Bids =

607
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,420
= Announcement for Bidding =

608
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Well done.

609
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,160
She added and corrected details

610
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,760
even I missed.

611
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,800
Is there anything you’d like to change?

612
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,480
No.

613
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Good job.

614
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,520
You’ve become much better

615
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,760
than before when you first came.

616
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,960
Send it

617
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,560
to all four bidders.

618
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:03,960
OK.

619
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,760
I’m on it.

620
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,120
How do I look?

621
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,280
Li Zhe,

622
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I’m asking you.

623
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,840
How do I look in this?

624
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,800
Is it bad?

625
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
No, no, no.

626
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
You look fine. It’s nice.

627
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
I’ll buy it if you like it.

628
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
That’s too kind of you.

629
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
You got me a job

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,400
and you’re buying me clothes.

631
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,000
I want you to be happy.

632
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
I’ll go try another one.

633
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
Are they enough as presents?

634
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,360
Are you nervous?

635
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,760
No. Not at all.

636
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,280
Your zipper is down.

637
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,280
Xu Yiren,

638
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
you lied again!

639
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,840
You’re too nervous.

640
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,080
I’m helping you loosen up.

641
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
Is it that obvious?

642
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,480
It’s just that last time,

643
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
it ended up bad.

644
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,120
I don’t want to blow it again.

645
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320
That was an accident.

646
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
It won’t be this time.

647
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,200
What if I say things

648
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
that offend your uncle again?

649
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,520
What should I do?

650
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
What else could I do?

651
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Just like dealing with clients,

652
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,080
I’ll turn things around.

653
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,000
No. No.

654
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,720
Your uncle isn’t a client.

655
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,400
How about this?

656
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,400
If I misspeak something,

657
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,760
you must stop me.

658
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,120
If that fails,

659
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,600
just hit me.

660
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,280
Hit you?

661
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,800
Yes.

662
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,000
I promise I won’t fight back.

663
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,400
Even if my uncle and aunt don’t like you,

664
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,120
that’s not because you aren’t good enough.

665
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,160
I’m the reason.

666
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
And

667
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,760
I don’t care if they like you or not.

668
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,520
After all, I’m in a relationship with you

669
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,480
not them.

670
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,000
But...

671
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
that’s not right.

672
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
They’re your only families left.

673
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,200
I have to impress them.

674
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,560
Trust me.

675
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,680
I’ll behave well.

676
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,840
I know.

677
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,000
Let’s go.

678
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,720
Coming.

679
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,840
Uncle.

680
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,680
Yiren?

681
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,200
Welcome!

682
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,080
Come on in.

683
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,920
Darling,

684
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,840
Yiren has come.

685
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Come in.

686
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,400
Uncle, aunt,

687
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,840
- let me introduce him to you. - Hello, Mrs. Yu.

688
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,400
This is my boyfriend Fang Zhiyou,

689
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,840
also my boss.

690
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,560
Mr. Fang.

691
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,240
Pleasure to meet you.

692
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,920
Mr. and Mrs. Yu,

693
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,280
you can call me Zhiyou.

694
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,720
We had misunderstandings before.

695
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,360
This time, I’m here to apologize.

696
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,360
I hope you don’t mind.

697
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Yiren and I

698
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,520
are serious about our relationship.

699
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,280
It was my fault.

700
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,600
I didn’t make it clear

701
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,480
and I wasn’t ready to introduce him to you.

702
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,560
I’m sorry, uncle.

703
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,320
No need to apologize.

704
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,440
Well, Yiren,

705
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,520
I got it wrong last time.

706
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,760
I’m also to be blamed.

707
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,040
Let’s not stand here.

708
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,160
Have a seat.

709
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,440
This is a little something.

710
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
It’s good for your health.

711
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,040
That can’t be cheap.

712
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,840
Yiren,

713
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,800
you’re lucky.

714
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,480
We have to thank you for this.

715
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
You don’t need to

716
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,640
bring us anything.

717
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,080
Let’s go.

718
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,600
- Have a seat. - Take a seat.

719
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,640
Sit on the sofa.

720
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,280
Make yourselves at home.

721
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,640
I’ll help your aunt cook.

722
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,280
Mom,

723
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
I’m back.

724
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,120
Qing.

725
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
What are you doing here?

726
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
Let me introduce you guys.

727
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,200
This is my boyfriend,

728
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,360
Fang Zhiyou.

729
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,320
Hello.

730
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,080
Nice to meet you.

731
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,960
We’ve already met.

732
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,080
You look better in close range.

733
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,880
Yiren, you made a wise choice.

734
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,560
This is Li Zhe.

735
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,840
He’s my...

736
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
You know him.

737
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
Welcome, Li Zhe!

738
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,000
Hello, Mrs. Yu.

739
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
- So nice to see you. - Mom, look.

740
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,880
Li Zhe bought these clothes for me.

741
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,680
How do they look?

742
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
Wow!

743
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,640
That’s a lot!

744
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,480
They look fantastic!

745
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,360
Li Zhe, you have a good taste.

746
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,440
Li Zhe,

747
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,040
you bought so many things for Qing.

748
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,000
Don’t spoil her.

749
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,160
Stay and eat with us.

750
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
No, thanks, Mrs. Yu.

751
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,320
I’ve brought Qing back.

752
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,240
Don’t you have a guest?

753
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,320
I should take my leave.

754
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,440
Don’t worry.

755
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,360
You’re more important.

756
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,160
Eat with us.

757
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,080
End of discussion.

758
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
Just stay.

759
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Didn’t you speak highly of my mom’s soup?

760
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Yes.

761
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,960
That’s right.

762
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,200
Stay with us.

763
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
Zhiyou,

764
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,360
Mr. Fang, is here for the first time.

765
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
I’m sure you guys

766
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,800
have things to talk about,

767
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,240
right?

768
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
It’s better to eat with a bigger crowd,

769
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,535
isn’t it?

770
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:23,890
- Have a seat. - Sit, all of you.

771
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,760
Sit down.

772
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,600
Qing,

773
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,880
take care of Li Zhe.

774
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,800
You guys talk.

775
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,760
I’m fine.

776
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,640
I’d like to try your aunt’s cooking.

777
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,600
Paid it.

778
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,480
Thanks.

779
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,120
Have a nice day.

780
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,640
I was driving my car.

781
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,080
What do you mean I can’t drive?

782
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,920
The road is this wide.

783
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
Can’t you go right?

784
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
Or move it to the side a little bit?

785
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,760
Do you own this road?

786
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, I own it.

787
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
I won’t move. What can you do?

788
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
We’ll wait.

789
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,040
Neither of us can go.

790
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,920
You can’t scare me.

791
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,720
Bring it on.

792
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,680
Are you seeking a fight?

793
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,160
Move it to the side,

794
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
now!

795
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,320
I won’t touch you.

796
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Why? Because I’m a woman?

797
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,160
Xia Di.

798
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,960
Do I know you?

799
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,560
You’re my idol, you know?

800
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,760
Go away!

801
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,680
My idol!

802
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Stay away from me.

803
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
I have a black belt in taekwondo and karate.

804
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,280
I’m warning you!

805
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,320
Draw me.

806
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,440
Psycho! I’ve already called the police.

807
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,720
I want to be the star

808
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,120
in your new story.

809
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,120
Let’s create a better work together!

810
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,640
It’ll be perfect!

811
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,520
Go away!

812
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,000
Princess...

813
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Step back!

814
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,040
Draw me.

815
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,920
Leave me alone!

816
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,400
Draw...

817
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,200
You molested my princess!

818
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,280
You molested my princess!

819
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
What are you doing?

820
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,120
Freeze!

821
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,160
Go die!

822
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,080
You perv!

823
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,520
Break it off!

824
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,600
Don’t touch her!

825
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,560
Get up.

826
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,720
Arrest him.

827
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,640
He molested my princess!

828
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,200
Don’t move!

829
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,560
Xia Di, are you OK?

830
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,040
There, there.

831
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,600
It’s OK.

832
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
I’m here.

833
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,640
Don’t move.

834
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,920
Look at him.

835
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,960
Take him away.

836
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
He’s a molester.

837
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,560
- It’s him! - You need

838
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,240
to come with us

839
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,400
- I was trying to protect you. - for a statement.

840
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Go.

841
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,840
Can you still walk?

842
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,240
Move!

843
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,440
Let go of me.

844
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,160
Let’s go.

845
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,880
Be careful.

846
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,560
OK?

847
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,840
Welcome Li Zhe and you to join us for dinner.

848
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,840
- It’s Zhiyou. - Your presence

849
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,160
uh...you know...

850
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,360
graces our shack.

851
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,440
- Dig in. - Let’s eat.

852
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,480
Eat up.

853
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,200
That fish, Li Zhe,

854
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,320
is my signature dish.

855
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,440
I cooked it for you.

856
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Eat as much as you can.

857
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,320
Try this, Mr. Fang.

858
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,400
Thank you.

859
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,840
You’re welcome.

860
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,720
Uh...

861
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,480
Mr. Fang,

862
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
when did you and Yiren

863
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
start to date?

864
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,840
Yiren was my assistant at first.

865
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,520
After a while,

866
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,280
I wanted her to be more than that.

867
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,840
Not everything is smooth between us

868
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,160
but it turns out well.

869
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,000
What does your company do?

870
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,600
Are you busy?

871
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,800
We work on architectural design.

872
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,440
How busy we are depends on projects.

873
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,720
Is that so?

874
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,680
Li Zhe is also in design.

875
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
Our company is splendid.

876
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,600
We only take on major projects.

877
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,000
How many people are there in your family?

878
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,920
Are you the only child?

879
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
What’s your highest degree?

880
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,560
Uh...

881
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Aunt,

882
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,720
take your time.

883
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Let him answer it one by one.

884
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,240
No biggie.

885
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,640
It’s my first time being here.

886
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I should introduce myself to you

887
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,920
so that

888
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
you can be relieved.

889
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,560
Yes.

890
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,840
Mrs. Yu,

891
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,680
I have a younger sister.

892
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,240
My mother passed away

893
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,320
when I was little.

894
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,600
My father is a lawyer.

895
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,720
Lawyer?

896
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
That’s nice.

897
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,800
He can make a killing by paying lip service.

898
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
You’re right, Mrs. Yu.

899
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
They can either kill

900
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,920
or save others with their lips.

901
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
Sometimes,

902
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,240
their words can level a family to the ground.

903
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,280
They’re good.

904
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
My mom’s shrimps are a killer.

905
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,080
Eat up.

906
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,560
Yes.

907
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,800
Have some more.

908
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Li Zhe,

909
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
eat as many as you can.

910
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,760
Li Zhe,

911
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,280
you’re so nice to my daughter.

912
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,800
You helped her land a perfect job.

913
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,920
I can’t thank you enough.

914
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,720
Really.

915
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,760
She’s right.

916
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,080
Mom,

917
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,880
he saved my life.

918
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
We’re meant to be.

919
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,960
You’re being too polite.

920
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
He saved your life?

921
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,360
What happened?

922
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Back then,

923
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,520
Qing got lost

924
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,840
during the spring outing.

925
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
Li Zhe found her.

926
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,080
When did that happen?

927
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,800
Why didn’t I remember?

928
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,440
You’re a bonehead.

929
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
What can you remember?

930
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,240
You don’t even know how much the soy sauce is?

931
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,040
Guys,

932
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,280
let’s eat.

933
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,640
Li Zhe,

934
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,840
I have to

935
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,280
toast you.

936
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,360
You saved Qing’s life.

937
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
From now on,

938
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,880
this is your second home.

939
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,960
Whatever you want to eat,

940
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
just come and tell me.

941
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,800
I’ll cook it all for you.

942
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,680
Thanks.

943
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:29,960
Here.

944
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,000
Thank you.

945
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,760
Cheers.

946
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,520
That’s my glass.

947
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,280
Taking the wrong glass is a small mistake.

948
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,200
But if you mistake someone for the other,

949
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,480
it might be too late to regret.

950
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,160
Mistaking one for the other is nothing

951
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,840
but trusting the wrong one is dire,

952
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,960
especially that person

953
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,720
may just be your best friend.

954
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,720
I just don’t want my best friend

955
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,840
to be cheated.

956
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
A cheater doesn’t get to say that.

957
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,400
He just took the wrong glass.

958
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,000
What...

959
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,640
What’s that got to do with regret

960
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,520
or being cheated?

961
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,240
Hey, young man,

962
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
if you feel uncomfortable coming here

963
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
to visit me and Yiren’s uncle,

964
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,520
you don’t need to be here.

965
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,920
Since you’re already with us,

966
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,600
just enjoy the meal.

967
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,520
You’re making us awkward.

968
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,600
Aunt,

969
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,720
he didn’t mean that.

970
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,200
Then what did he mean?

971
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Besides, what did Li Zhe do to him?

972
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
He’s our guest.

973
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
However much you dislike him,

974
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,760
that attitude is unacceptable.

975
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,920
Do you have any respect

976
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,280
for us?

977
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,240
Do you?

978
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,880
I swear he meant no disrespect.

979
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,120
What you said is uncalled for.

980
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,400
Li Zhe is a guest,

981
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,040
and so is Fang Zhiyou.

982
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,960
Not to mention, this is his first visit.

983
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
He didn’t mean to offend you and uncle.

984
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,080
If we spoil your mood

985
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,720
to enjoy the meal,

986
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,200
I think we should

987
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,600
leave you alone.
