20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
Sleep early when you have a fever.

21
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,720
I took the medicine.

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
I can’t fall asleep.

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
Why don’t we talk?

24
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,480
Maybe I’ll feel asleep when talking.

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,240
All right?

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,200
What would you like to talk about?

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,440
Tell me.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,640
Why do you never lie?

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,520
Why do you ask?

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Because I never believed

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
there was a man

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
who never lied

33
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
until I met you.

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Then I began to know some people never lied.

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,720
Let me guess.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,640
Was there a light on you

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,560
when you were born?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
And it said,

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,920
“Picked boy,

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,440
you shall never tell a lie in your life.

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,480
Or you’ll die before twenty.”

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,200
So,

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
to survive,

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
you never dare to lie.

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Or because

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
when you were in the primary school,

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
you played Truth or Dare with your classmates

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,560
and you lost.

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
They asked you

50
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,760
if you adored Lily.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
In case of losing face, you said you didn’t.

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Next week, she was in a relationship

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
with your desk mate.

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,880
From then on, you swore

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,560
you would never tell a lie

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,800
and you would never

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
miss the girl you adored.

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,880
Am I right?

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,080
I don’t like Lily.

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Then Lucy.

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
You adored Lucy, didn’t you?

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,080
Not about unrequited love?

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,760
Could it be...

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
When you were in line for buying steamed buns...

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
Did you take medicine without telling me?

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
Or is the medicine working?

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Just pretend I’m drunk.

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
Anyway, I can’t fall asleep.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
Tell me about it.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,880
Since you can’t fall asleep,

71
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,080
I’ve got a story.

72
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,360
Would you like to listen?

73
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Yes.

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,320
I have a friend.

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
When he was at school,

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
he and his good friend

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
were inseparable.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
In or out of school,

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
they stayed together.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,200
That could be the happiest time he had ever had.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
“I have a friend” story.

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,160
It means him, huh?

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,600
And then?

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,960
Then,

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
my friend’s families were ruined

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,640
because of a lie.

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,000
His parents were so sad
that they committed suicide.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
His father was rescued,

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
but suffered from dementia.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,000
His mother

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
was dead.

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
How poor!

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,080
Uh...

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,840
What about the friend himself?

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
My friend sold everything in his home.

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
After his friend went aboard, they lost contact.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,440
You...

98
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,920
I mean your friend and his friend...

99
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Did they meet again?

100
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,280
My friend swore that

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,120
he would never lie again.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,840
Oh, that’s it.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
That’s why you don’t lie.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
The old man we visited today

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,600
was the father of my friend’s friend.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh.

107
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,200
Your friend has been

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
taking care of him silently.

109
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
On the old man’s birthday every day,

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
my friend visits him.

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
In fact, he wants to see his friend.

112
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
But he’s also scared of meeting him again.

113
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,440
So, today...

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
You came...

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,320
What?

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,880
Are you showing sympathy for me?

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
I used to think

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,760
you were from a rich family,

119
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,800
grew up with great wealth,

120
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,280
and didn’t experience any hardship in life.

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
I didn’t expect you

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
to have such a sad story.

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
I am from a rich family.

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,840
But only stronger people

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,520
show sympathy for

126
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
those who are inferior.

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,080
I don’t think you’re qualified to show sympathy,

128
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
especially for me.

129
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,080
You...

130
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Fine.

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
Being nice to you is torturing myself.

132
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,680
Xu Yiren.

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,360
I told you the story today.

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,760
But you mustn’t tell anyone else.

135
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you hear me?

136
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,720
Hmm.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Go to bed.

138
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,800
Okay.

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
Mr. Fang?

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,520
It’s not me.

141
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,760
Good, then.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
It feels so good.

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
Feels like sleeping in the clouds.

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
Since when was my bed so comfortable?

145
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
Doomed.

146
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,520
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

147
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
Is he leaving me alone?

148
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Mr. Fang?

149
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,040
Mr. Fang?

150
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,320
I’m going out.

151
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
Have breakfast when you wake up.

152
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,360
Wait until I’m back.

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,880
Don’t run about.

154
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,680
I was freaked out.

155
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
Where did he go in the early morning?

156
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
Mr. Li is medically stable.

157
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,120
He can check out this afternoon.

158
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,920
By the way,

159
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
his son came. Didn’t you see him?

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,280
Hmm.

161
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,720
Fang Zhiyou.

162
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
You come to see my father,

163
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,080
because you want to see me, don’t you?

164
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
The box of pencils.

165
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
I knew it was you.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,760
It’s been a long time.

167
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,160
I think

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,880
you have something more important to ask me.

169
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Do you like the gift I gave you?

170
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,880
You persuaded Liu Tianyang

171
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,080
to leave with Xingcheng project?

172
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
Is this what you come back for?

173
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,760
This is just the beginning.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,720
Are you ready to lose everything?

175
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,140
Are you sure you’ll do that?

176
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,580
What did you do to me thirteen years ago?

177
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,320
Don’t you remember?

178
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,220
♪ We’ll meet again ♪

179
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,653
♪ Who expected my stubbornness ♪

180
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
When you made a choice like that,

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,040
this is the ending we’re doomed to have.

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
You’ll regret meeting me again.

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,960
Still having a fever?

184
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Is she dead?

185
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,720
What are you doing?

186
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,000
You scared me!

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
Come on. What were you doing?

188
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
You slept on the sofa with clothes on.

189
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,640
I thought you passed out again.

190
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,520
You asked me to wait for you, didn’t you?

191
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
When I waited, I fell asleep.

192
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,320
But...

193
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,640
Get up.

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,360
Hurry.

195
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,320
Get up. Get up.

196
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,280
Close your mouth,
look up and stand still for 30 seconds.

197
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
I can hardly breathe.

198
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
I didn’t ask you to hold your breath.

199
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,400
Didn’t you ask me to stand still?

200
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
What are you laughing at?

201
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,040
Hurry up.

202
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,320
Look up and you’ll be fine.

203
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,800
Look up.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,280
What are you laughing at?

205
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Can I breathe or not?

206
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,260
= Square & Circle =

207
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,840
I think you’ve read the files

208
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
about Huaxing International Movie World.

209
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
It targets young people.

210
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
And it seeks for

211
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,240
classic and diverse fashions.

212
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Such are the most important points.

213
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,160
Besides the design,

214
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,080
we should also understand our competitors.

215
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,400
Among those companies,

216
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,440
some have applied for the bidding.

217
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Some are interested.

218
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,000
I picked some cases

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
- to show you. - Thank you.

220
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,840
They’re not for reference,

221
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,520
but for exclusion.

222
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
This is a big project.

223
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,800
I’ll design the main structure myself.

224
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,000
I still need assistants

225
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
in analyzing cases and making proposals.

226
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
Any volunteers?

227
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,320
No?

228
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,280
Me...

229
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I can do the proposals.

230
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,480
I want a try.

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,040
You can’t do it.

232
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,800
Why?

233
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
An intern isn’t qualified.

234
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,160
Sit down. Sit down.

235
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Xiang Wei. Sun Ziyang.

236
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
You’ll do it.

237
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,120
Hmm.

238
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,880
Hmm.

239
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,640
There must be something fishy.

240
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,960
A girl shared one room with a man

241
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
for the whole night.

242
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,080
And they only chatted? Who would believe that?

243
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
I don’t believe, either.

244
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,480
Wait and see.

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,440
They two

246
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
will be in a relationship soon.

247
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,480
The day is finally coming.

248
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,080
Disgusting.

249
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,240
Do I hire you

250
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,720
to gossip about others,

251
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,280
especially unconfirmed rumors?

252
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
- Ms. He. - Ms. He.

253
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,120
Don’t let me hear you

254
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,520
talking about groundless rumors again.

255
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,000
Got it?

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
- Yes, Ms. He. - Yes, Ms. He.

257
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,040
We’re going to work right away.

258
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,480
Wait a minute.

259
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,120
What you were talking about...

260
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,800
Who told you?

261
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,040
Ms. He.

262
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,280
The actor said that...

263
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,160
TV show?

264
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,800
Yes.

265
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
- So... - Yeah.

266
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,200
You were watching TV?

267
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,240
Yeah.

268
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,760
Uh...

269
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,880
What else did you think we were doing?

270
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
It’s all right. You can leave.

271
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
Okay.

272
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,360
Watch fewer TV shows.

273
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,400
They’re useless.

274
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,160
Okay, Ms. He.

275
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
Okay. Okay.

276
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,520
Ms. He.

277
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,800
A cup of coffee?

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,240
No.

279
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
Fine. I’ll make a cup for Mr. Fang.

280
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,760
Yesterday,

281
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,360
you were with Fang Zhiyou?

282
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,720
Hmm.

283
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,960
For business?

284
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,400
I told you the story today.

285
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,600
But you mustn’t tell anyone else.

286
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,840
Do you hear me?

287
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,520
Hmm.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,560
Sure.

289
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,600
We were visiting a client.

290
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,440
But the car broke down on our way back.

291
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,760
It was too late.

292
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,720
We had to stay there for the night.

293
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
But we weren’t sleeping together.

294
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
Aren’t I giving myself away?

295
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Xu Yiren.

296
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,160
I hired you.

297
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,240
So, I must remind you.

298
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,040
Do you know the worst thing

299
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,320
that an assistant should do?

300
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Have insufficient capacity?

301
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Fall in love with her boss.

302
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,840
Ms. He.

303
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
You get me wrong.

304
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,760
How would I fall in love...

305
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Don’t be nervous.

306
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,560
I’m just reminding you.

307
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
Oh, fine.

308
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
Ms. He.

309
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,880
I know.

310
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,040
What happened last night
would easily mislead others.

311
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
But we didn’t have another option.

312
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
Don’t worry.

313
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
I won’t have a crush on him.

314
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
He’s my boss.

315
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
And that’s already torturing me.

316
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,680
I won’t try to get him.

317
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,720
All right.

318
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,680
I believe you.

319
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,120
Really?

320
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,520
I hired you.

321
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,440
If I don’t believe you,

322
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,480
I’m suspecting myself, too.

323
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,640
Anyway,

324
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,520
I hope you can be an excellent assistant.

325
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,760
But that’s all.

326
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,080
Got it?

327
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,480
Yes.

328
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
Fang Zhiyou is to be blamed.

329
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,800
He shouldn’t have told me the story.

330
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,960
He told me, but didn’t allow me to tell others.

331
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,320
Sorry, Ms. He.

332
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,200
In the company,

333
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,880
you’re the last one I want to lie to.

334
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,680
What took you so long?

335
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,200
Hmm?

336
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,320
I thought you were Xu Yiren.

337
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,440
The coffee kept me waiting for half an hour.

338
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Zhiyou.

339
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,880
You mentioned our competitors at the meeting.

340
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,280
But seems like you forgot the most important one.

341
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,040
I know.

342
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,240
He Yuliang.

343
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,080
You...

344
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
You know he’s also bidding.

345
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,120
It’s such a big project.

346
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,560
How will he be absent?

347
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
I watched his interview.

348
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,320
He sounded like Huaxing would certainly pick him.

349
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,080
It’s been years

350
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,840
and that’s how he always behaves.

351
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
You should be used to that.

352
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,400
I know.

353
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,120
I’m just worrying.

354
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
All these years,

355
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,600
you never defeated him even once.

356
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
If we lose again this time...

357
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,120
Instead of worrying all the time,

358
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,360
why don’t we think of

359
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,000
how to win this time?

360
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,000
But...

361
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,920
Hello?

362
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,320
Hmm, it’s me.

363
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,720
What?

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Okay. I’ll be right there.

365
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,880
What happened?

366
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Shiyu made trouble again.

367
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,240
I must go.

368
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
Do you need any help?

369
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,480
No.

370
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,960
There’s a lot to do in the office.

371
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,640
Xu Yiren.

372
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,880
Go with me right away.

373
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Now!

374
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,520
Can we only

375
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,280
talk about business now?

376
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,680
Mr. Fang, you’ve got a younger sister?

377
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,800
What? I can’t have one?

378
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,760
Don’t be anxious.

379
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
Her parent is coming.

380
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,600
Let’s see how to settle the problem.

381
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,480
Don’t worry.

382
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,280
Hello, miss.

383
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,000
There you are, finally.

384
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,200
Look.

385
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Look how badly

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
your sister bullied her classmate.

387
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,800
You did that?

388
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
She wanted to jump off the building.

389
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,720
When the teacher and students pulled her down,

390
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,440
she was hurt.

391
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
I didn’t touch her at all.

392
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,680
That’s fine, then.

393
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,480
Fine?

394
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,800
What do you mean fine?

395
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,640
If it weren’t for your sister,

396
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
would my daughter want to jump off the building?

397
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,000
You know what?

398
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
My daughter is always an obedient girl.

399
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,640
She has never been aggrieved like this before.

400
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
If she has any mental problem

401
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
because of this,

402
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,840
I won’t let you go.

403
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,000
Why did you do that?

404
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,840
Because Jiang Doudou
always shows off her appearance.

405
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,040
And she says she was born to be beautiful.

406
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,120
She often laughs at Linlin

407
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,680
because Linlin has small eyes.

408
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
She gave Linlin a nickname Narrow Sky.

409
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,280
Yesterday, she painted Linlin’s glasses black

410
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
and said she only needed one narrow line.

411
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,400
Fang Shiyu.

412
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,880
We’re talking about you.

413
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,160
You posted her photo

414
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
on the school’s bulletin board.

415
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,480
Stick to the point.

416
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,800
Just because

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,920
she always bullies others based on
her beautiful face,

418
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,280
I posted her photo on the bulletin board

419
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,600
before she had her teeth fixed.

420
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,240
I just want every student to see.

421
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,640
She,

422
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,560
Jiang Doudou,

423
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
has been lying.

424
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,840
She was ugly.

425
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,040
Enough.

426
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,080
Since we’re here,

427
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
let’s see how to settle the problem.

428
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,280
What do you want?

429
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,840
Director, you saw that.

430
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,960
What was that?

431
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,280
Campus violence.

432
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,160
It’s dangerous to keep a girl like her
staying at school.

433
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
I think

434
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,560
she should be expelled.

435
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
Mrs. Jiang.

436
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
Well,

437
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,520
we should educate the children.

438
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,880
But you’re

439
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
going too far.

440
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,000
I know, director.

441
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,880
I didn’t insist on expelling her.

442
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,960
But,

443
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
my daughter was badly upset.

444
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,720
She must go see a psychologist.

445
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,160
Besides,

446
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,080
they two

447
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
mustn’t be in the same class.

448
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,960
Fine, we can keep her.

449
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,880
Well,

450
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,920
ask Fang Shiyu to go to another class.

451
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,800
Why me?

452
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,240
If you don’t want to see me, go to another class.

453
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,320
Director, look.

454
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,960
Is this the way she apologizes?

455
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
You can go see a psychologist.

456
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,960
I can recommend you the best one.

457
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
But you must pay for it.

458
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,480
And my sister isn’t going to another class.

459
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,120
I don’t care if your daughter is.

460
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
What’s your attitude?

461
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,920
What did the lawyer say?

462
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,440
Tell her.

463
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,640
Oh.

464
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,720
According to the lawyer,

465
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
only the following actions

466
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
can be invasion of privacy.

467
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,080
First,

468
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,360
threatening others’ personal safety

469
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,000
by sending threatening letters or other forms.

470
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:49,920
Second,

471
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
humiliating others in public

472
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,280
or making up stories to slander others.

473
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,640
Third...

474
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,360
Enough. Stop.

475
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
What do you mean?

476
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,880
You think I don’t have a lawyer?

477
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,840
Fine. I’ll get one right away.

478
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Mrs. Jiang.

479
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,840
- As you wish. - Calm down. Calm down.

480
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,680
I just want to tell you.

481
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,880
My sister hasn’t broken any law.

482
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,640
And I believe

483
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
no school rule prohibits students

484
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,080
from posting photos on the bulletin board.

485
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Uh...

486
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,120
There is no such rule.

487
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,760
- But... - Fine, then.

488
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,120
Now, I’m confused.

489
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,600
What has my sister done wrong?

490
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,920
Did she forge the photo?

491
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
Or did she get the photo illegally?

492
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,640
That photo

493
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,960
was posted on the wall of the kindergarten

494
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,800
where Jiang Doudou went to.

495
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,000
I found it easily.

496
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,760
Since it was posted on the wall
of the kindergarten,

497
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,480
why can’t it

498
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
be posted on the school’s bulletin board?

499
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Besides, this girl wanted to jump off the building.

500
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,720
My sister couldn’t control that.

501
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,160
So, it wasn’t her fault.

502
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,560
She didn’t plan to jump at all.

503
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,920
She was just scaring others.

504
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
Who sat on the window of the first floor to jump?

505
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,920
It’s your fault, Fang Shiyu.

506
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,000
Or I wouldn’t have tried to jump off the building.

507
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,080
Why are you blaming me? You wanted to jump.

508
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,960
It is your fault.

509
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,920
No.

510
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,440
Stop arguing.

511
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,200
You wanted to jump.

512
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Stop it.

513
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,140
= Little Witch =

514
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,840
Hello?

515
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,200
Xia Di?

516
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,720
Xia Di?

517
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Sorry.

518
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,760
The subscriber you dial is powered off.

519
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,600
The number you dialed is...

520
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,000
Is out of service.

521
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,520
Xia Di, I know you’re listening.

522
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,440
Don’t be scared.

523
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,840
I’m just calling to tell you that

524
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
the new comic strip you applied for

525
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
was approved of by the chief editor.

526
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Really?

527
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,680
Why do I lie to you?

528
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,000
But let’s make a deal.

529
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,600
You must complete the last comic.

530
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,040
You promised me.

531
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,320
I...

532
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,080
Hello?

533
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,960
Goddess.

534
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,680
Popular lava multilayer ice cream cake.

535
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,240
Shall we go enjoy it?

536
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,400
Go.

537
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,580
= Go. =

538
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,560
Director.

539
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
What do you think we should do?

540
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,000
You can’t just let him bully us

541
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,080
only because he’s rich.

542
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,840
Look.

543
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,360
Look what my daughter is suffering.

544
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,840
If you fail

545
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
to explain to me well,

546
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,800
I’ll complain to the Bureau of Education.

547
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,720
I’ll... I’ll post on Weibo

548
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,760
to condemn them.

549
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,960
Mrs. Jiang.

550
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,800
Don’t be anxious.

551
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,840
Calm down. Calm down.

552
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,040
Mr. Fang.

553
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,280
I understand.

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
You want to protect your sister.

555
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,160
But what you’re doing

556
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,120
does no good

557
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,280
to her growth.

558
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,920
Director.

559
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,320
Mr. Jiang.

560
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
Don’t be anxious.

561
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,280
Mr. Fang didn’t mean that.

562
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
He just expressed it poorly.

563
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Who are you?

564
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,280
I’m Mr. Fang’s assistant.

565
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,360
I’m Xu Yiren.

566
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
Is it amazing to have an assistant?

567
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,800
You can’t bully others, either.

568
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,520
Mrs. Jiang.

569
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
May I say something?

570
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,720
In this case,

571
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
Fang Shiyu did something wrong.

572
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
But,

573
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
just like what she said,

574
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,960
your daughter

575
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,640
bullied another student before.

576
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
They were both wrong.

577
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
Director, do you think I make sense?

578
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,760
We should also listen to

579
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,880
what Linlin explains.

580
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Sure.

581
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,680
How about this?

582
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,680
As long as

583
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,320
Jiang Doudou apologizes to Linlin first,

584
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,280
we’ll ask Fang Shiyu

585
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,720
to apologize to her, too.

586
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
It’s fair, then.

587
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:27,960
No way.

588
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,640
I agree.

589
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,320
When she apologizes to Linlin,

590
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,640
I’ll say sorry to her.

591
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,400
Yiren.

592
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
Do you like my brother?

593
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,520
No.

594
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,480
Then why did you always peep at him?

595
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,160
I... I didn’t.

596
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,280
When you lie, your nose gets longer.

597
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,280
My brother never lies.

598
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,560
How can I compare myself to him?

599
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,720
I’m serious.

600
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
My brother never lies.

601
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,200
So, if any girl marries him,

602
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,920
she doesn’t need to worry he will cheat on her.

603
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,120
Would you like to consider marrying him?

604
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,040
Shiyu, sit still.

605
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,400
I’m home.

606
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,560
Drive straight and you can leave.

607
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,880
By the way,

608
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,080
Ms. He asked

609
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
why we were staying together last night.

610
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I told her the car broke down
after visiting the client.

611
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
So...

612
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Why did you lie again?

613
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,480
Here it goes again.

614
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
I’m afraid Ms. He would get us wrong.

615
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,560
What do you mean?

616
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
We stayed alone

617
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,200
in a hotel.

618
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,120
And we even shared one room.

619
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,840
Why do you think she would get us wrong?

620
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,920
I’m not scared. Why are you scared?

621
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,480
Sure.

622
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
Why would you be scared, boss?

623
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,440
Fine, I won’t be scared, either.

624
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Anyway, I lied to her.

625
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,040
Decide what you’ll explain.

626
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,280
Don’t blow my cover.

627
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Xu Yiren.

628
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,520
Are you asking me to patch up your lie?

629
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
Yiren.

630
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Let’s go have dinner.

631
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
She’s not free.

632
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,760
She has to patch up her own lie.

633
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
Or if she makes a slip someday,

634
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,960
she can’t handle that.

635
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,040
If you didn’t ask me not to tell others

636
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,600
the story you told me,

637
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,880
I wouldn’t have lied to Ms. He.

638
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,360
Do you know how guilty I feel to lie to her?

639
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,400
I did it for you own good.

640
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
How ungrateful you are!

641
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,920
Zhiyou.

642
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,320
What does she mean hotel?

643
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,720
Don’t ask about adults’ stuff.

644
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,440
You adore that girl, don’t you?

645
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,840
Do you know what adore means?

646
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,040
I know it better than you.

647
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,720
If you don’t know, ask me.

648
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,480
I won’t charge you.

649
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Fang Shiyu.

650
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,600
What took you so long?

651
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:05,880
Hurry.

652
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
Try the cake.

653
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,960
It’s delicious!

654
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,680
I couldn’t help trying some before you came back.

655
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,920
Why didn’t you wait for me?

656
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
It’s amazing.

657
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,720
Yiren.

658
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Let’s go have dinner.

659
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
She’s not free.

660
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,560
She has to patch up her own lie.

661
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,440
Or if she makes a slip someday,

662
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
she can’t handle that.

663
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,600
What?

664
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,320
You didn’t feel satisfied?

665
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,400
What?

666
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720
Don’t play dumb.

667
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
Last night,

668
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,240
you and your Thanos boss...

669
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,120
Come on. It’s your fault.

670
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,240
What you said totally scared me.

671
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,720
What happened?

672
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,800
Anyway,

673
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,480
nothing happened.

674
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Don’t bring it up again.

675
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,960
All right, then.

676
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
I won’t bring it up again.

677
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,720
I had thought you could provide

678
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,000
some exciting stories.

679
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,840
Exciting?

680
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
With whom?

681
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
Fang Zhiyou?

682
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,520
I’m glad when he doesn’t piss me off.

683
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
I’ve never met a man like him.

684
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
Whenever I have

685
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,600
a bit crush on him,

686
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,320
he totally destroys it.

687
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,760
No way.

688
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,240
I must ask for a pay rise.

689
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,880
I’m paid as an assistant,

690
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,240
but I serve as a nursemaid

691
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,080
who works 24 hours a day.

692
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,480
You know what?

693
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,760
He took me

694
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,720
to see his sister’s headmaster.

695
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,560
He has a sister?

696
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Yes.

697
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,440
A mini Fang Zhiyou.

698
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
Why did you buy so many desserts?

699
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,640
Gu Bo bought them.

700
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
He said desserts in this shop were delicious.

701
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,360
He took me there.

702
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,000
After I finished,

703
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,080
I packed so many desserts for you.

704
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,520
Generous, aren’t I?

705
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
Don’t show off.

706
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,920
Gu Bo is a mere intern.

707
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,040
He doesn’t have a very high salary.

708
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,800
Don’t always blackmail him.

709
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,280
I don’t.

710
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,520
He insisted on treating me.

711
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,560
Well, he’s a poor man.

712
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,600
With a salary less than 2,000 a month,

713
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
he’s been busy all the time.

714
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
Fang Zhiyou even ignores him.

715
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
Is he really that miserable?

716
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah.

717
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
All interns do like that.

718
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,600
When I was an intern,

719
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,320
I didn’t do much better.

720
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Before you do anything stupid again,

721
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,440
remember to call me.

722
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
I won’t call you.

723
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,320
= Xu Yiren =
I’ll call Yiren.

724
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,560
You like her?

725
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
Yes, I do.

726
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
I had so many assistants.

727
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
You liked none of them.

728
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,760
You only met Xu Yiren for once,

729
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,600
and you like her?

730
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
Because she’s totally different from you.

731
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,640
Of course.

732
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,720
We’re certainly different.

733
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,680
You don’t understand.

734
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,760
I just met her.

735
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,520
But we feel like old friends. She understands me.

736
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,360
Don’t use the wrong idiom.

737
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,360
By the way,

738
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,080
when you were at school,

739
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,360
why did you listen to her?

740
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
When I asked you to apologize before,

741
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,800
you always refused.

742
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
I told you, she understands me.

743
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Well, you’re my brother.

744
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,880
Let me teach you.

745
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
Why did I do that?

746
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,720
To avenge Linlin.

747
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
Since I succeeded

748
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,200
and Jiang Doudou apologized to Linlin,

749
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,640
why couldn’t I apologize, too?

750
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,080
Yiren knew what I was thinking of.

751
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
If I still refused to apologize
like you always did,

752
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,560
I would have lost more.

753
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,800
I didn’t break any law.

754
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,800
Must I apologize for what I did?

755
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,880
Well, my words were wasted again.

756
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,160
You’re a super male chauvinist.

757
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,400
Which is what?

758
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,400
It’s...

759
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,000
When people kindly helped you,

760
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
you should have said thank you.

761
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Instead,

762
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,680
you said, you want me to patch up your lie?

763
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,040
And what you mean I can’t turn back?

764
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
You’re a male chauvinist.

765
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,880
You’re so impersonal.

766
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
If teachers keep teaching you such confusing words,

767
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,720
I’ll send you to another school.

768
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,960
The nursemaid made braised fish
in brown sauce for dinner.

769
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,160
Would you like to come and enjoy it?

770
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,960
No.

771
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,080
I’ll work overtime.

772
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,840
Go back home.

773
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,440
Bye-bye.

774
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,880
You’re a male chauvinist.

775
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,840
You’re so impersonal.

776

= Male Chauvinist Baidu Baike =

777
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,160
A poor taste.

778
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
A low EQ in love.

779
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,040
Feels like a fate

780
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,560
to be all alone.

781
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,080
You’re my own brother.

782
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,800
I’ll see how you can keep arrogant.

783
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,200
Naughty girl.

784
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,580

Sorry.

786
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,520
Do I have money in my WeChat?

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,300
= Balance 0 =

788
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,160
What are you doing?

789

Yiren.

790
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,400
What’s the nasty smile for?

791
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
You’ll have this for dinner?

792
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,600
It’s unhealthy.

793
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,000
It’s meal time.

794
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,800
Let me buy you dinner.

795
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,280
Go. I’ll buy you dinner.

796
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,560
Go. Go. Go.

797
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Hurry. Hurry.

798
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,040
We eat alone.

799
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,320
Why do you order so many dishes?

800
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,160
Not many.

801
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,960
I wanted to say thank you long ago.

802
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,800
Why?

803
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,880
For giving me a chance to save the beauty,

804
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,000
so that I met my goddess again.

805
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,240
Goddess?

806
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,400
She’s your bestie,

807
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Xia Di.

808
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,280
What a coincidence, isn’t it?

809
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,600
Okay. Thank you.

810
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Have some more.

811
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,120
What I’m going to tell you

812
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,640
is related to my happiness all my life.

813
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,600
You must answer me seriously.

814
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
So dramatic?

815
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,080
What does Xia Di like to eat?

816
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,640
What films does she like to watch?

817
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,160
And...

818
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
Does she have any special hobby?

819
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,920
Will the answers help?

820
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,720
Sure.

821
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,160
Think about it.

822
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,240
For example,

823
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,480
if Xia Di likes playing games,

824
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,760
I can be a high-level player

825
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,080
in the game

826
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,920
and meet her by accident.

827
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,520
And,

828
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,040
I’ll buy her the most expensive items.

829
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Then she couldn’t wait to marry me.

830
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Aren’t you cheating?

831
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,760
Don’t be so naive.

832
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,760
It’s the joy of life.

833
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,880
Joy?

834
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,080
You know what?

835
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,960
You’re not my only helper.

836
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,640
A couple of days ago,

837
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
I finally friended Xia Di on WeChat.

838
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,480
I spent the whole night

839
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,800
viewing her moment posts.

840
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,360
She loves to post.

841
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,800
You viewed them all?

842
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah.

843
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,880
Sure.

844
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
Well...

845
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,840
Let me tell you something.

846
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,640
Okay.

847
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
She’s hitting the bottleneck lately.

848
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,760
She fails to continue the comic strip.

849
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,140
= Bottleneck for comics =

850
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,800
So, you’d better

851
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,120
not piss her off lately.

852
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,200
No way.

853
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,720
You know what?

854
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,920
The more upset she feels,

855
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
the more she needs me.

856
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Totally no!

857
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,680
You want me to go to the bidding with this?

858
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,760
Do it again.

859
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,840
Okay, Mr. Fang.

860
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Okay, Mr. Fang.

861
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,080
Mr. Liu.

862
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,560
Mm.

863
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,600
Mr. Liu.

864
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,200
Our proposals are banned again.

865
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,960
Or why don’t we quit?

866
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,320
Mr. Liu.

867
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,760
Have some rest.

868
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,240
Leave it to me.

869
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
White flat without sugar, right?

870
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,080
Have some rest.

871
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,400
Mr. Liu.

872
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,200
Thank you.

873
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,520
You’re welcome.

874
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,160
Why don’t you

875
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,560
apply for this project?

876
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,120
Don’t get me in trouble.

877
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,200
I’m quite embarrassed in the company.

878
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,840
I’d better behave myself.

879
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,040
After all,

880
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,440
I don’t even know

881
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,520
if he wants to

882
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,840
let me take care of the project.

883
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,440
So,

884
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,240
I won’t go make him unhappy.

885
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,360
You’re thinking too much.

886
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,400
In our company,

887
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,120
you’re the most senior designer

888
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,880
with the richest experience.

889
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,080
For this project,

890
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,360
you’re the best candidate.

891
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,960
No.

892
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,280
Mr. Fang is

893
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
the best designer.

894
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,640
I don’t dare to compare to him.

895
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,440
Mr. Fang asked me

896
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,880
to invite you.

897
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,280
Mr. Fang?

898
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,080
I’m serious.

899
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,640
You know what?

900
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,160
When he began to strive for the bidding,

901
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
you were the first candidate he thought of.

902
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,560
But you know,

903
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,960
he doesn’t talk sweetly.

904
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
He doesn’t want to invite you willingly.

905
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,920
So,

906
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,640
he asked me to sound you out.

907
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,600
Really?

908
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,360
You cheated me once.

909
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
I’m telling the truth this time.

910
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,560
After all,

911
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,880
he’s the boss.

912
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,560
We work for him.

913
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,080
Why don’t you

914
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,000
make a concession

915
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,800
and ask to help him?

916
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,840
Give him an out.

917
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,000
Will you?

918
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,440
Fine, then.

919
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,960
I’ll trust you this time.

920
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,680
