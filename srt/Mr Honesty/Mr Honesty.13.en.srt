Yiren,

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,840
there’s the space in my brother’s study

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,200
that’s off-limits.

Why didn’t you knock?

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
I didn’t mean to disturb you.

28
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
I’m off.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,040
I thought...

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,440
you’d never speak to me again.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,680
That was the plan

Here

in this place,

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
I can be myself for a while.

41

Let’s go.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,400
You didn’t come down for dinner,

43
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
so I brought food for you.

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Have some.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
You know,

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,520
you don’t need to do everything yourself.

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
It’s too much.

48
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
You’re so reticent

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
that you can’t explain yourself clearly.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
What’s there to explain?

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,600
If...

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,080
you hadn’t lied to Li Zhe...

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
If...

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,800
it had been your father’s fault...

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,640
If...

56
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,080
No ifs.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Nothing

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,080
could bring Li Zhe’s parents

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,760
and his family back.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
It’s not your fault.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
You really believe

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
I didn’t lie to Li Zhe.

63
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,480
People have to make tough choices sometimes.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,360
You taught me

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
how to be a good person.

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
I know you’d never do such things.

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,200
I also know

68
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,920
that incident pains you the most.

69
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
But the past is the past.

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Future is more important.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
As your friend

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
and assistant,

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
I’m always on your side

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
to be with you.

75
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,560
Thank you.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
If you want to thank me,

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
just eat your food.

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,440
You can’t do anything with an empty stomach.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,400
A bigger fight is ahead of us.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Guys,

81
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,320
attention, please.

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
I know you’ve been

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
working hard lately.

84
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
All of you

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,400
are working tirelessly

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
on the Moon Bay Project,

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,760
but,

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,960
I mean,

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
we can’t put all our eggs

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,000
in one basket.

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,480
If anything happens,

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
we won’t be in a complete shutdown.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,760
So

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,360
we can land a few small projects.

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Yes.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,680
Here’s the arrangement.

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
What’s up?

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
Mr. Liu,

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,160
if you’re shorthanded,

100
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,440
I can take one project.

101
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
That’s unnecessary.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Just do your job well as an intern.

Aren’t they all busy?

106
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,680
I can help them.

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Wait till you’re officially hired.

108
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,960
Xiang Wei,

109
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,920
Sun Ziyang,

110
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,160
you each take a project.

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,360
Familiar yourself with the basics.

112
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Yes.

113
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Get it done.

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440

Sure. Bye.

It’ll arrive in five minutes.

take a leave tonight?

130
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,160

Yes.

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
What’s with the secrecy?

178
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,040
You vetoed the idea

179
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
during the meeting.

180
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,360
We dare not bring it up again.

181
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Besides,

182
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
I’m not sure

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,400
if it’ll turn out better than the one for Huaxing.

184
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
So we’ve been keeping it low.

185
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
The scenery

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,640
looks OK.

187
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,800
Really?

188
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Yes.

189
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
Mr. Fang,

190
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
Sun Ziyang made it.

191
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
He’s meticulous.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,960
I’m not half as good.

193
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Sometimes,

194
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
I can’t believe

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,880
a man can be so thorough.

196
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
You’re flattering me.

197
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
Without Xu Yiren’s help,

198
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,400
I couldn’t have done this myself.

199
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,120
Don’t be modest.

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,640
Move. Step aside.

201
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,160
Xu Yiren is hardworking.

202
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,600
She should get the credit.

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,960
Your work is good

204
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,960
but it’s not perfect.

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
What’s wrong?

206
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,520
Your resort

207
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,240
has enough green space

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
and beautiful scenery.

209
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
The buildings

210
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
are avant-garde.

211
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,520
But you missed

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,920
a fundamental element.

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Why isn’t there a single bench?

214
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,840
Tourists come to the resort

215
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
to relax, not to take part in a walking race.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,680
Where do you want them to sit and rest?

217
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Yes, that’s right.

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
I knew

219
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,760
something is missing

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,280
but I didn’t know what it is.

221
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
You’re good, Mr. Fang.

222
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
You spotted it at a glance.

223
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,520
Of course.

224
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,200
Spot on, Mr. Fang.

225
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,400
I’m making it now.

226
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,160
Give me a minute.

227
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,040
Go ahead.

228
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Mr. Fang,

229
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
you’re amazing!

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Mr. Fang,

231
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,840
I made it in haste.

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
What do you think?

233
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,880
It’s glued on me.

234
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
I can tell.

235
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,760
Just stop.

236
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,680
OK.

237
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Where are you going?

238
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
To sit in the back.

239
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
Sit tight.

240
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,200
Look how miserable I am!

241
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
How could you laugh at me?

242
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Xu Yiren.

243
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,240
Do you really want to learn modeling?

244
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Of course.

245
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,920
It started as a hobby,

246
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,040
but

247
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,760
Huaxing Project

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,080
made me realize

249
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,360
that I love it more than I imagined.

250
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,000
The finished model

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,720
gave me a sense of achievement.

252
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,800
Too bad,

253
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
I had no professional training

254
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,840
and could only rely on my instinct.

255
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,000
I’ll take back what I said

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,960
that handcraft can’t replace 3D modeling.

257
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
If you and Sun Ziyang

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
want to have a try,

259
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
then go for it.

260
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,560
Really?

261
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
You’ll give us a chance?

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,280
Aren’t you afraid it’s a waste of time?

263
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,560
Pursuing your passion

264
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,200
is never a waste of time.

265
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
It may not turn out well,

266
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
but at least, you’d enjoy

267
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
that process.

268
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,560
I feel the same way.

269
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,760
Not all my designs

270
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,480
satisfied our clients,

271
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,720
but I had fun

272
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,040
drafting them.

273
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,840
Architecture

274
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,040
is my passion.

275
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,880
Nothing else

276
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,640
means more to me.

277
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

278
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,920
Ow! Ow! Ow!

279
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,760
Really, Yiren?

280
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,080
It’s literally glued on you.

281
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,040
Ow!

282
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Stop!

283
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,040
Yiren,

284
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
you’re really something!

285
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,280
Statue of Liberty is holding a torch.

286
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
What are you holding?

287
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,720
I wish I could glue a stick on my hand

288
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,280
in a relay so that I wouldn’t drop it.

289
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
Stop laughing!

290
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,200
If it couldn’t be removed,

291
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
the doctor had to cut it off.

292
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,960
There would be a huge scar on my hand.

293
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Then I couldn’t cook for you.

294
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,600
What are you doing?

295
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,840
Giving her a foot bath?

296
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
What do you know?

297
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,160
Put your hand in it

298
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,280
and then it’ll fall.

299
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,200
Will it work?

300
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,520
Just do as I said.

301
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,440
The laundry detergent

302
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,680
reacts with the glue

303
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
and can soften it.

304
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,120
It can be stripped off soon.

305
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Glue these days is environmentally friendly.

306
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
Just wait a few minutes.

307
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,480
What are you thinking?

308
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,080
Seriously?

309
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,560
Teaching her science now?

310
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,400
You should say,

311
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,040
“Don’t worry.

312
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
Even if it leaves a scar,

313
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
I’ll take care of you”.

314
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,640
Come on.

315
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Don’t tell me you’re considering that!

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,560
I think it’s falling.

317
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
It’s working!

318
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
It’s gone.

319
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,720
Finally!

320
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,440
Great!

321
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,360
Yiren,

322
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,720
I’m starving.

323
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
You are?

324
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,840
So,

325
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
what would you like to eat? I’ll cook.

326
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,740
= Square & Circle =

327
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,120
Here’s your coffee.

328
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,880
Thanks.

329
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,080
Put it here.

330
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,760
A piece is missing here.

331
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
Let me glue it.

332
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,680
No need, thanks.

333
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,280
I can do it.

334
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,160
Go play with others.

335
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
I can take care of this.

336
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,080
Go.

337
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,080
What is this?

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
I’m sorry. My bad.

339
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,080
Hey,

340
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
don’t be a troublemaker.

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Go somewhere else, OK?

342
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,320
I’ll catch you later.

343
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
I’m not a troublemaker.

344
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
You’re putting a model together, aren’t you?

345
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Listen,

346
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,760
when I was a kid,

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,480
I won LEGO competitions.

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,360
- Really? - You don’t believe me?

349
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I can show you.

350
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,080
No, no, no.

351
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,480
Please,

352
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,040
just give me a break, OK?

353
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
I’m sorry.

354
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,280
It’s OK. No worries.

355
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,600
Put this away.

356
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Is it OK?

357
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Yeah. Sure.

358
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,880
I can clean it.

359
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,680
Let me do it.

360
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,440
No, no, no.

361
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,200
Go somewhere else,

362
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,720
OK?

363
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
See you later.

364
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
Go ahead. Go.

365
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,360
Yes, coach.

366
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
Are you coming to practice driving or not?

367
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,280
Don’t you want your driver’s license?

368
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,920
I... I’m coming.

369
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
I want it.

370
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
But

371
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
I’m a bit busy.

372
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
Who isn’t?

373
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Look,

374
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
if you don’t come

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
to take the test,

376
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,200
you’ll have to wait till next time.

377
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,880
Coach,

379
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,320
here’s the thing,

380
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
my hand is injured.

381
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
So

382
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,880
I can’t drive for a week.

383
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,960
How about this?

384
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,480
Please sign me up for the test.

385
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
I’ll come to practice next week.

386
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,440
OK?

387
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
Fine,

388
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,760
I’ll move your appointment to next week.

389
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
Don’t skip it again.

390
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,840
I won’t.

391
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,600
Thank you, coach.

392
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,800
See you next week.

393
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
She’s injured?

394
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,360
Is it bad?

395
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,880
She didn’t say.

396
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,040
I think she’s fine.

397
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
She can’t come this week.

398
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,840
The appointment is moved to next week.

399
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,720
I see.

400
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,800
Thank you.

401
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,840
No problem.

402
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,280
Alright, back!

403
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,800
Sha Sha.

404
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Yes.

405
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,600
Make a few copies, please.

406
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,120
Sure.

407
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
Got it.

408
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Let me do it.

409
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
- Give it to me. - I can do it.

410
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
Please!

411
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,440
Just have a rest.

412
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I don’t want you to break the printer.

413
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,960
Chu Lin,

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,400
do you need help?

415
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,280
Is there no work at the Design Department

416
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
that you’re wandering here and there?

417
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,920
They all work on their projects.

418
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
They don’t need me.

419
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh.

420
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
Pour me a cup of water then.

421
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,520
Thank you.

422
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Sure.

423
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,160
Stand still.

424
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Don’t get in the way.

425
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,280
So annoying!

426
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,400
You’re a college student.

427
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
Even Admin is working their tails off.

428
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,760
Why are you the only idler?

429
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,360
Hey,

430
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,840
I’d like to help.

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,680
Here you are.

432
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,160
Thanks.

433
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,200
You’ve been quite helpful.

434
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,040
No,

435
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,200
I mean I want to

436
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
work on the Moon Bay Project, too.

437
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,440
But they don’t seem to need me.

438
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
They don’t.

439
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,760
Well,

440
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,520
I can join your discussion.

441
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,440
Although my proposals are always rejected,

442
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
I take that well

443
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
and I’m open to advice.

444
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
Now, it’s not the time to train you.

445
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,520
What do you mean?

446
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,200
Moon Bay is the top priority.

447
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
The deadline is approaching.

448
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
Your knowledge

449
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,000
is little

450
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,280
and your experience is lacking.

451
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Right now,

452
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
doing nothing is being helpful.

453
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
Did you take me in

454
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,600
simply because

455
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,080
my father is on the board of this company?

456
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
What do you think?

457
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
Dou Mi,

458
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,720
is there a letter for me?

459
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,520
Mr. Fang,

460
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,600
here it is.

461
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Who is the bouquet for?

462
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,360
Xu Yiren.

463
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,760
I’ve told her to pick it up.

464
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,380
= Miss Xu Yiren,
I hope you’ll recover soon. Li Zhe =

465
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,560
Is Xu Yiren sick?

466
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,320
She is?

467
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,840
Mr. Fang.

468
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
Ms. He.

469
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,280
Are you OK?

470
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,560
Do you feel unwell?

471
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,080
I’m fine.

472
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,600
All good.

473
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
“Miss Xu Yiren,
I hope you’ll recover soon.

474
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
Sincerely,

475
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,920
Li Zhe”.

476
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,720
I don’t know what happened.

477
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
I swear I don’t.

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,080
Mr. Fang...

479
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,360
What’s going on?

480
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,800
Ms. He.

481
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
You asked to see me?

482
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,120
Look,

483
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,280
dating

484
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,040
isn’t prohibited in our company,

485
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,240
but making it high-profile

486
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,640
isn’t good for you.

487
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,720
Tell your boyfriend not to send flowers

488
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
to the company again.

489
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
Boyfriend?

490
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,880
Yes.

491
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,960
Ms. He,

492
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
we aren’t in a relationship.

493
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
You mistook it.

494
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
You aren’t,

495
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
but he sent you flowers?

496
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,960
What a nice balance

497
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,040
between work and love!

498
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,320
You’re so close

499
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,800
to the new GM of Dasheng.

500
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,160
I guess

501
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I underestimated you.

502
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
No,

503
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,160
Ms. He,

504
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
it’s not like that.

505
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
Actually,

506
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
we met each other a long time ago.

507
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
A long time ago?

508
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,400
Like how long?

509
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
I promised Mr. Fang

510
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
that I wouldn’t tell others

511
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,720
about him

512
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
visiting Li Zhe’s father at the nursing home.

513
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,960
What should I say?

514
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,320
Answer my question.

515
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,320
We met

516
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,960
about three months ago

517
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,160
by accident.

518
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
So

519
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,240
do you know

520
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,240
Mr. Fang and Li Zhe

521
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,440
go way back?

522
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,600
Yes.

523
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,320
Li Zhe told you that?

524
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,000
No,

525
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,360
it was Mr. Fang.

526
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,400
Fang Zhiyou?

527
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,400
When did he tell you that?

528
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,720
And what else did he say?

529
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Well,

530
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,320
he...

531
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,200
I don’t remember

532
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,880
the details.

533
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
You...

534
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,520
don’t remember

535
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,320
or don’t want to tell me?

536
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,120
There isn’t

537
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,520
much to say.

538
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,800
He said

539
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,680
they used to be close friends

540
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,160
but fell out with each other over certain things.

541
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,520
So Li Zhe is targeting him right now.

542
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,240
Alright.

543
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,360
I see.

544
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,640
You may leave.

545
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

546
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
Good day.

547
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
I said

548
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
it’s personal.

549
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,360
I don’t need to explain it to anyone.

550
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,400
Anyone?

551
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,480
Including me?

552
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,640
Yes.

553
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,200
Did I blow it?

554
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,560
I can’t lie

555
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,640
or tell the truth.

556
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,000
I’m stuck!

557
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,960
Your table is holed.

558
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,920
Get up!

559
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
You have a visitor.

560
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,400
Who is it now?

561
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,800
Don’t know.

562
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,320
Nice flowers.

563
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,520
Go ahead.

564
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,760
Pretty.

565
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,480
Let’s talk outside.

566
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,920
Mr. Fang.

567
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,640
Where is she?

568
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
Someone is waiting for her outside.

569
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
She just left.

570
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,360
It seems to be the one who sent her flowers.

571
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,320
Oh no!

572
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,560
What’s wrong with boss now?

573
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,360
You almost got me killed earlier,

574
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,280
you know?

575
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,560
Why did you send flowers to my office?

576
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,000
What’s wrong with your hand?

577
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,560
Is it bad?

578
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,560
What... What’s wrong with it?

579
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
How did you know that?

580
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Coach!

581
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
I asked him to call you.

582
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
You lied again.

583
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,760
Yeah.

584
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,000
I don’t want to practice driving,

585
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,560
so I lied.

586
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,440
Why are you laughing?

587
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,720
I’m glad

588
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,880
your hand is fine.

589
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
Even if I was injured,

590
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
why did you send me flowers

591
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,680
and have them delivered to my workplace?

592
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
It’s just a little something for a friend.

593
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
What’s with the fuss?

594
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
I’m surprised, though.

595
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,800
I thought Fang Zhiyou

596
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,120
can’t stand liars.

597
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,040
How could he

598
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,360
tolerate you?

599
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,400
Have you

600
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,800
asked me about that thing?

601
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
Now, you believe

602
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,960
I didn’t lie to you, right?

603
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
I believe you

604
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
just as I believe

605
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,320
Fang Zhiyou didn’t lie to you.

606
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,520
I can’t prove it now

607
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,000
but you grew up with him.

608
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
You know him better than I do.

609
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,360
Do you really think

610
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
he’d betray you?

611
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,160
I didn’t want to

612
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,040
but it did happen.

613
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,480
What you see

614
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,000
isn’t necessarily the truth.

615
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,640
You guys should sit down

616
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,680
and talk things out.

617
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,640
Perhaps...

618
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,680
What I said last time means nothing to you.

619
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,720
In the end,

620
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,040
you still believe Fang Zhiyou.

621
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
No,

622
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,560
I...

623
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,480
I know how you feel.

624
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,520
Forget it.

625
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
I never believe

626
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,160
that empathy nonsense.

627
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,880
Only I know how I got through

628
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,680
the past 13 years.

629
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
Fang Zhiyou

630
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,400
must pay back his debts.

631
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,920
I don’t want you

632
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,440
to be implicated.

633
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,680
Hey,

634
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,520
forget about

635
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,880
other people.

636
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,720
Hello. A cappuccino, please.

637
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
If you don’t like my flowers,

638
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,520
then

639
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,120
I can ask you out

640
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,200
next time.

641
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,240
What do you think?

642
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,640
Are you sober?

643
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
What time is it?

644
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,760
A little over 3 p.m.

645
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,080
3:03 p.m.

646
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,320
It’s work time.

647
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,400
Why are you here?

648
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,080
Excuse me.

649
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,160
We’re in the middle of a conversation.

650
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Sorry,

651
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
I’m talking to my assistant.

652
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Mr. Fang,

653
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,600
I’m sorry.

654
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,240
I...

655
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,000
Xu Yiren,

656
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,360
don’t be afraid.

657
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,240
You can quit if you want.

658
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,840
I’ve told you

659
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Dasheng always welcomes you.

660
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,160
Say no more.

661
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,560
Shouldn’t you check with me

662
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
before poaching my people?

663
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,240
Mr... Mr. Fang.

664
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,040
Slow down.

665
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,200
You’re hurting me!

666
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,240
Fang Zhiyou...

667
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
- Why... - I can explain.

668
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,120
- Did you forget... - I didn’t mean to.

669
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,080
- Do you know... - I know.

670
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,080
I know.

671
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
I shouldn’t have lied

672
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,680
but I had no idea

673
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,600
he’d send me flowers.

674
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,200
I promise it won’t happen again.

675
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,240
Again?

676
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,760
No.

677
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,920
Not anymore.

678
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,760
I’m going to tell him now.

679
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,080
I told you

680
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,520
not to see Li Zhe again.

681
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
Why didn’t you listen?

682
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,040
You dated him right outside the company.

683
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,240
Date?

684
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
It wasn’t a date.

685
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,560
I couldn’t avoid seeing him.

686
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Why not?

687
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
Do you like...

688
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,760
his flowers?

689
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,440
And where exactly did you get hurt?

690
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,640
How did he know that?

691
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,680
Why didn’t you tell me?

692
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
You... You asked me too many questions.

693
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
Which one should I answer first?

694
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,120
All of them.

695
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,040
Why should I?

696
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,160
Even if

697
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,600
you’re my boss,

698
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,200
you don’t

699
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
own me.

700
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,640
Who I met

701
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
and whose flowers I took are not your concerns.

702
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
They certainly are.

703
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,440

All newbies

735
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
have to go through that.

736
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,160
Running errands,

737
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,480
waiting for orders.

738
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,760
Princess,

739
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,120
you did such things, too?

740
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Not exactly.

741
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
Others take orders from me.

742
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Look at me.

743
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,560
I’m studying at one of the top design schools.

744
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,360
It’s OK to run errands for a few days.

745
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,920
But it’s been a while

746
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
and I’m still doing legwork for others.

747
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,360
I haven’t gotten my hands on one major project.

748
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,240
It’s a waste of talent.

749
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,440
Ridiculous!

750
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,680
If you’re upset,

751
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,080
just quit.

752
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Honestly,

753
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,120
I’m doing this job

754
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,600
solely because of my idol.

755
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,200
When I first saw his work,

756
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
gosh,

757
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
it was mind-blowing!

758
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,240
He topped I.M. Pei

759
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,480
and surpassed Le Corbusier.

760
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,960
I was completely overwhelmed.

761
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,160
In order to get close to him,

762
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,600
I majored in design.

763
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,360
Enough.

764
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,040
You’ve said that a million times.

765
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,920
Because of him,

766
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,160
you studied hard.

767
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,880
Because of him,

768
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
you tried so hard to get into Square & Circle.

769
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,200
I remember every word you said.

770
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,280
Yeah.

771
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
But every time I feel

772
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,200
our gap is narrowed,

773
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,600
turns out,

774
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,080
it only gets widened.

775
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,840
Take this.

776
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,320
Let’s go for a ride.

777
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,920
That will cheer you up.

778
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,040
No, it won’t.

779
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,960
I have no mood for that at all.

780
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
Man up.

781
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,600

Yeah!

788
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,800
I told you

789
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
nothing can’t be fixed by drag-racing.

790
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,680
If there is,

791
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,280
just go one more lap.

- We’re off. -We’re off!

799
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
What’s going on?

800
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,840
She’s leaving so soon.

801
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,800
She even beat me.

802
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,960
- Mr. Fang. - Mr. Fang.

803
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,440
Where is she?

804
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,680
Where is she?

805
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,800
She just left.

806
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,960
She didn’t leave early.

807
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,600
Yes.

808
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Mr. Fang, you need her?

809
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,920
Let me call her to come back.

810
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,640
No need.

811
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,080
What’s happening?

812
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,660

What do you want to eat for dinner?

816
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,640
Sorry, Mr. Fang,

817
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,040
I gotta swing by Xia Di’s later.

818
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,340
= Xu Yiren When will you finish?
I’ll pick you up. =

819
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,360
When will you finish?

820
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,400
I’ll pick you up.

821
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
What to do?

822
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,920
Lying sucks.

823
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,600
No, thanks.

824
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,120
It’ll probably be late.

825
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,680
I won’t be home for dinner.

826
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,480
You and Shiyu just eat without me.

827
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Sorry, Mr. Fang,

828
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,000
but I can’t be in the same room with you now.

829
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,120
Nice!

830
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,200
How do you feel?

831
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,120
Super cool! Awesome!

832
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,200
Good?

833
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,280
Hell, yeah!

834
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,640
You like it?

835
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,520
Of course.

836
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,480
What did I say?

837
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,720
No big deal.

838
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,600
Don’t waste your time

839
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
on unnecessary worries.

840
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
You can be down at the bottom

841
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,680
and over the moon in seconds.

842
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
You’re the master of your mood.

843
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Just chill.

844
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,240
There are more solutions than problems.

845
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,560
Thank you, Xia Di.

846
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,200
Whenever I’m with you,

847
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
my worries are all gone.

848
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
You’re welcome.

849
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,160
You’re like my younger brother.

850
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,520
It’s my job to take care of you.

851
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,120
I need to take this.

852
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
Yiren?

853
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,320
Yiren.

854
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,440
Xia Di,

855
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,880
is there anything I can do for you?

856
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,800
Why are you suddenly playing customer service?

857
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Don’t ask.

858
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
You haven’t finished your drawing, right?

859
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,800
I can be your model.

860
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,920
I’m on my way.

861
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,720
I’ve turned it in yesterday.

862
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,200
Let’s have dinner together.

863
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,640
I’ll bring you fried chicken.

864
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,360
Sorry.

865
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,680
My evening is taken.

866
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,080
You should have asked me earlier.

867
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,440
It’s taken?

868
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
By whom?

869
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,920
Who’s more important than me?

870
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,920
Gu Bo.

871
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,360
He had a tough day at work.

872
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,520
I’m with him now.

873
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,360
Hey,

874
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,960
why don’t you join us for dinner?

875
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
