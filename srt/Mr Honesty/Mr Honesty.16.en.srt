00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,280
I have something very important to ask her.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Ask in my face, then.

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,880
Why?

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
Because she’s my girlfriend.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Another slip, huh?

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,600
I knew it.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
But I nearly

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
trusted you.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Mr. Fang.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,600
You’d better not have such a slip again.

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
I can’t stand it.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,880
I apologize.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,920
For telling him you’re my girlfriend

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,280
without your permission.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,920
And...

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,440
sorry.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
For kissing you again before telling you.

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,360
I adore you,

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,280
Xu Yiren.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
This is what I should have said.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,120
Didn’t you ask me

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,440
not to fall in love with you?

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
And you also said

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
what happened was a slip.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,280
But...

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
I’ve fallen in love with you.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,400
I said something confusing.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
The so-called settings

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
and slips...

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Just because

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,520
I didn’t know how to tell you.

52
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,880
I adore you.

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
Xu Yiren.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh, I suddenly remember

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
I have some work to do.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,080
When can you change your habit of

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
running away?

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,960
Do you still

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
miss Gao Ming?

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Or you like Li Zhe?

61
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,160
You hate me?

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,600
So, would you like to

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
be my girlfriend?

64
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
But Mr. Fang,

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,720
I just felt very unrealistic.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
How come you like me?

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
Why can’t I?

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
I had breakfast this morning.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,000
My car didn’t break down on my way to work.

70
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Shiyu didn’t make trouble

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
at school.

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
All projects are going smoothly.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,280
And when I see you

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,520
staying with Li Zhe,

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
I feel angry.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,440
I can’t deny

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
all these facts.

78
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,800
It proves that

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,480
I adore you.

80
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,720
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
But you’re my boss.

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,280
How can we be in a relationship?

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,920
Which law of our country

84
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,280
forbids a boss to like his assistant?

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
Office romance is prohibited.

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,320
Is there a company rule

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,240
prohibiting office romance?

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes.

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
Rule No. 26.

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Is it?

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,600
Hmm.

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
From today on,

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440
it is allowed.

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
But...

95
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,680
I work for you.

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,320
I’m your subordinate.

97
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,280
I don’t think

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,680
we should be in love.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,120
Then I’ll fire you right away.

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,400
You don’t have to.

101

But...

102
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Who kissed before confessing his love?

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,480

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,480
don’t they?

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
explained this to you.

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120

you hated lies.

we’re in a relationship for the moment?

Why?

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,920
You’re the boss.

176
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
But people will gossip.

177
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
I don’t want unexpected problems.

178
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,160
I know you’re my boyfriend.

179
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
And that makes me happy.

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,440
Besides,

181
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,280
my uncle and aunt are coming.

182
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,680
Anyway,

183
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,800
let’s make it a little secret for the moment,

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,160
all right?

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,840
I’ll think about it.

186
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
It’s not a very lucky thing

187
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
to be my boyfriend.

188
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
Get prepared for that.

189
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,120
Let’s go.

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Okay.

191
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
What?

192
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Let me hug you for a bit longer.

193
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
Why did you approach me?

194
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,520
Why do we always cheat each other

195
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
when we meet?

196
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
If there isn’t a reason,

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
we’d better not meet again.

198
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
I don’t know what exactly the trouble is

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,920
between you and Mr. Fang.

200
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,800
I don’t want to persuade you to let go of it.

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,680
But I’d rather not

202
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,560
get involved in your problem.

203
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,160
By the way,

204
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I don’t have decent opinions.

205
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
Even if I know

206
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,880
what happened between you

207
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,760
and even if Fang Zhiyou is wrong,

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I will choose to be on his side

209
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
without the least hesitation.

210
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,400
I don’t come for trouble today.

211
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
I have something very important to ask her.

212
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,520
Ask in my face, then.

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,200
Why?

214
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
Because she’s my girlfriend.

215
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Hello.

216
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
I just got a call.

217
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,560
My friend had a car crash.

218
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
Name, please.

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,120
Xia Di.

220
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
She didn’t tell me clearly on the phone.

221
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,320
Could you check

222
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,280
which ward she is in?

223
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Gu Bo.

224
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,480
You’re coming so fast.

225
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
I thought you...

226
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
Where’s the ward?

227
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Over there.

228
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,147
♪ My love for you is like marshmallow ♪

229
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,970
♪ Bite it and it feels sweet ♪

230
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,356
♪ You’re like the warm sunlight
outside the window ♪

231
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:49,526
♪ I can’t resist it ♪

232
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,640
It’s lucky to be young.

233
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,840
With a wounded leg,

234
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
you can still be romantic.

235
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,000
What happened to your leg?

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,920
Why is it wounded?

237
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
I...

238
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
I caught a thief.

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,440
Caught a thief?

240
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
You caught a thief?

241
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Who do you think you are?

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Don’t be anxious.

243
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,640
Let me explain.

244
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,480
A girl’s bag was robbed.

245
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,280
I was waiting for the traffic light on my motor.

246
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,520
An upstanding girl like me

247
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
would certainly go after him.

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,880
I had planned to stop him with a drifting.

249
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,000
Unexpectedly,

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,720
I fell on the ground.

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,240
Luckily,

252
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
the traffic police caught the thief

253
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
and gave the bag back to the girl.

254
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,920
What did the doctor say?

255
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,080
He said I was okay.

256
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
No fracture.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Don’t worry.

258
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,440
No fracture?

259
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,800
Hmm.

260
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
I always call you my princess.

261
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,760
Do you really think you’re strong?

262
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,160
You’re a girl.

263
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
And I always tell you

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
to drive safe.

265
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,160
You never listen.

266
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,120
You always ignore that.

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,720
How many times are you hurt?

268
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,040
More than one or two times.

269
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
Do you think you’re a heroine?

270
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
You want to be a ghost rider?

271
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,600
What?

272
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,760
Why are you so agitated?

273
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,200
I’m scared.

274
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,400
When I knew you had a car crash,

275
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,520
I thought you...

276
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
You thought I was dead?

277
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
It’s okay.

278
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
The doctor said I was fine.

279
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,160
I need only a good rest.

280
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,880
Why are you angry?

281
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,200
All right.

282
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,280
I’ll listen to you.

283
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,480
Look, when I was in hospital,

284
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,400
I told you

285
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,240
before Yiren.

286
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
Look how important you are

287
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
in my heart!

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
Stop talking, could you?

289
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,840
Oh.

290
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,320
Have a good rest.

291
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,960
I’m hungry.

292
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,280
What would you like to eat?

293
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,360
A bowl of rice-flour noodles.

294
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,200
Okay.

295
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I’m buying it right away.

296
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,720
Course for architectural design software.

297
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Taught by a leading figure

298
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,040
in architecture design.

299
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,260
= 23,000 yuan =

300
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
23,000?

301
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
Gosh.

302
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,160
So expensive.

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,720
It’s my house rent for a year.

304
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,480
How can I save so much money?

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,680
How about

306
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,160
applying for an advance pay

307
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,960
from my boss?

308
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,560
He’s my boyfriend, anyway.

309
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
= From Aunt =
Yiren.

310
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
Qing begins to work next month.

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
Have you found us an apartment?

312
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,920
We’re coming at the end of this month.

313
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,280
What a chill!

314
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,680
I’m still looking for one.

315
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,160
I’ll handle it before the end of this month.

316
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,480
I remember

317
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,800
when we had elective courses,

318
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,480
it was like fighting a war.

319
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,120
When there was a class of a famous teacher,

320
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,120
we would be awesome

321
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,760
if we managed to apply for the class.

322
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,880
But when we went to the class,

323
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
the classroom was crowded.

324
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,760
Sometimes, there were more than 50 students.

325
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,120
Because in nearly every class,

326
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
some auditors showed up

327
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
out of nowhere.

328
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,280
So annoying.

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,440
Come on. They audited classes.

330
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,040
And they even

331
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
took good seats

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
in the front.

333
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,800
They took more classes than us.

334
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,480
What the hell!

335
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
No teachers controlled them?

336
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,120
How could they?

337
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
There were so many students.

338
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,240
No teacher could stand at the door

339
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,800
and check their student ID.

340
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
Well,

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
as long as you don’t come late, leave early,

342
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
or interfere with other students,

343
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,360
no one would care

344
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
if you are really one of the class.

345
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,280
Besides,

346
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
some teachers

347
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,280
even feel proud

348
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,080
when they have a lot of students in his class.

349
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,400
See you.

350
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

351
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,440
She just came to remind me

352
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,600
I could audit, I guess.

353
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,160
She always looks cold.

354
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,280
But turns out she’s helpful.

355
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,320
Audit?

356
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,400
Then I can

357
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,120
save a lot of money.

358
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Everybody,

359
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
time to get off work.

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
I’m leaving.

361
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,960
Hmm.

362
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,120
Bye-bye.

363
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,360
Bye-bye, I’m leaving, too.

364
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,120
See you.

365
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,462
Bye-bye.

366
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:38,918
Bye-bye.

367
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,960
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

368
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
You’re still here, Yiren?

369
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,960
I’m leaving then.

370
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Okay. See you tomorrow.

371
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,400
Bye-bye.

372
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,440
Bye-bye.

373
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
Have you left?

374
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,160
Yes.

375
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
You use such a cute sticker?

376
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,520
This is how I feel now.

377
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,400
All right.

378
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,520
Wait a second.

379
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
I’ll get in after they all leave.

380
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,600
Okay.

381
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,320
A second is gone.

382
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,080
How soon will you come?

383
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,760
Watch where you’re going.

384
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,360
Mr. Liu.

385
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,360
Sorry.

386
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,880
Where are you going?

387
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Home.

388
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,640
Home?

389
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,400
Hmm.

390
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,040
Do we have a back door?

391
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,920
The door is over there.

392
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Where’s the file I want?

393
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,680
I’ll go for it.

394
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Right away.

395
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,600
What...what?

396
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,680
I was freaked out.

397
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,320
What are you doing?

398
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
We’re in the office.

399
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Calm down.

400
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,080
I’m calm.

401
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,800
Be calmer, then.

402
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,720
You...

403
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you know you just lied?

404
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,600
For whom?

405
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,200
For yourself.

406
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,320
I don’t think

407
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
I’m used to secret love.

408
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,320
Why not?

409
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,200
Please.

410
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,680
Just do it for me.

411
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,040
Get used to it.

412
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,840
All right?

413
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
I’m begging you.

414
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,760
I’m begging you.

415
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,360
Fine, then.

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,440
Hmm, let’s go.

417
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
I was freaked out.

418
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
Just like a James Bond movie.

419
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,640
Are you getting in love

420
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,680
or stealing things?

421
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,640
The excitement is the same.

422
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Anyway, no one shall know about it.

423
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Really?

424
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,840
Tomorrow,

425
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
I’ll make it public.

426
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,480
No way.

427
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,920
In this case,

428
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,480
I’ll be enemy number one in the office.

429
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
Do you know

430
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,160
how much female colleagues adore you?

431
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,280
If they know

432
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,600
their prince becomes my boyfriend,

433
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
they’ll put dishwater

434
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,560
in my cup.

435
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,640
What are you scared of?

436
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,600
At tomorrow’s meeting,

437
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
I’ll tell them about it.

438
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,560
From then on,

439
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,240
everyone will

440
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
call you My Lady,

441
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,360
when they see you.

442
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
They wait when you come it through a door

443
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
and when you go out through it.

444
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,200
When the lift is overloaded,

445
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,640
everyone else will get out.

446
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,400
What do you think?

447
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,600
Nothing!

448
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,520
Come on.

449
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,200
Leave it to me.

450
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,360
What?

451
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,200
It’s your favorite, isn’t it?

452
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,280
How does it taste?

453
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,920
Sweet?

454
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,040
Yes.

455
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,480
My turn.

456
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,400
What?

457
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,760
I don’t like such fruit.

458
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
But I hear,

459
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,120
if your girlfriend feeds you,

460
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
you’ll like it better.

461
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,560
So, I want a try.

462
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
It is sweet.

463
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
I’m freaked out.

464
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840
She nearly found us.

465
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,720
So what?

466
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
She knew it.

467
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,960
How is it possible?

468
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,840
Only you think

469
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,000
you could hide it from others.

470
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,160
We don’t need to keep it from her.

471
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,840
She’s my only family.

472
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you really not

473
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,680
going to contact your father?

474
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,640
I can’t forgive

475
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
what he has done.

476
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,960
We’ll cooperate more.

477
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,480
We will.

478
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,520
Thank you.

479
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,120
See you.

480
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,680
See you.

481
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,920
Why did you do that?

482
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
You promised me.

483
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
Why did you lie to me?

484
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,520
Fang Zhiyou.

485
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,040
Calm down.

486
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
You’re a liar.

487
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
You promised me to help Li Zhe and his dad.

488
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
It was your fault.

489
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,360
Your fault.

490
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,560
Stop it!

491
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,680
I did promise to be his lawyer.

492
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
But before the court starts,

493
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
I have the right to choose.

494
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040
He was too stupid.

495
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,080
He gave me the evidence

496
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
even without an entrustment agreement.

497
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,280
You used me.

498
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,480
You lied to me

499
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
so that I hurt Li Zhe and his dad.

500
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,920
I hate you!

501
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,680
Shut up!

502
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,160
I’m telling you.

503
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Living in this world

504
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
is just like going to court.

505
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,320
There are tricks and frauds.

506
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,000
You must distinguish them

507
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,920
by yourself.

508
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
Understand?

509
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,400
I’m teaching you a lesson,

510
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,400
so that you’ll be cheated less

511
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,440
in your life.

512
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,680
Remember that.

513
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,520
Liar!

514
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,680
I watched him

515
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
ruin the family of

516
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,840
my best friend.

517
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,640
That’s why

518
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,520
I hate lies.

519
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,160
I understand it when Li Zhe doesn’t forgive me.

520
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,040
But your father did that.

521
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,440
You didn’t.

522
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
What he does makes no sense.

523
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
In his mind,

524
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,920
I promised him that

525
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
my dad would help.

526
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,920
And I asked him

527
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,680
to get the evidence

528
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
from his father

529
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
and give it to me

530
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,960
before I gave it to my dad.

531
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,200
In this way,

532
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,480
I shouldn’t say

533
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
I was completely innocent.

534
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
All these years,

535
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,800
I’ve been looking for him

536
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,120
so that I can compensate for him.

537
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,880
I wrote a lot of letters to him.

538
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,720
But he didn’t accept them.

539
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,120
When he turned up again,

540
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,400
he didn’t need any of these.

541
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
He only wanted me to experience

542
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,680
what he suffered.

543
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,480
Anyway,

544
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,680
I trusted my father’s lie.

545
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,400
I was wrong.

546
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,840
What are you laughing at?

547
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,480
Nothing.

548
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,720
I just find you a bit cute.

549
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,360
You used to be

550
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,480
very serious.

551
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,800
And you seldom smiled.

552
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,800
Even when you were wrong,

553
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,240
you didn’t admit that.

554
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,640
Now you say you’re wrong.

555
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,040
I find that cute.

556
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,000
Why?

557
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,040
I feel you’re also an ordinary guy

558
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,760
and we’re closer.

559
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Hmm.

560
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,400
Shiyu.

561
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,560
It’s late and why aren’t you sleeping?

562
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,240
Yiren.

563
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,600
Hmm?

564
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,640
This is for you.

565
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,840
It’s your favorite Mr. Bunny,

566
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
isn’t it?

567
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
Why do you give it to me?

568
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,440
I’m going back home tomorrow.

569
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,800
I’ll leave the bunny to you.

570
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,880
Home?

571
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,320
You live a good life here.

572
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Why are you going home?

573
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,600
Because my dad is back.

574
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,000
Yiren.

575
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,840
I know what you want to say.

576
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,240
My father

577
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,600
is always busy.

578
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,960
He spends little time with me.

579
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,920
And he’s serious.

580
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
But in general,

581
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,920
he’s a good father.

582
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,520
Don’t worry about meeting him.

583
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,600
My brother doesn’t meet him.

584
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,000
You don’t need to meet him, either.

585
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
Clever girl.

586
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,680
I’m just curious

587
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,360
what a man your father is.

588
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,280
Why did he say that

589
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,320
to his own son?

590
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,760
I don’t interfere with

591
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
their problem.

592
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,120
You’d better

593
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
not interfere either.

594
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,840
Remember.

595
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,480
It’s my brother’s bane.

596
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,960
It can’t be easily brought up.

597
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,720
Yiren.

598
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,520
Promise me one thing, will you?

599
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,920
What is it?

600
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,000
Take good care of my brother.

601
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,200
I’m entrusting him to you.

602
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,480
He’s an adult.

603
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
Why do you entrust him to me?

604
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,720
He’ll take care of himself.

605
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,240
Stop pretending.

606
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,760
I know you’re in a relationship with my brother.

607
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,080
You’re a little girl.

608
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,760
Don’t always bother about adults.

609
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,960
Is that so easy to see us through?

610
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,520
You...

611
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You should have pretended a bit better.

612
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,600
My brother

613
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,480
is just like an idiot.

614
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,440
He looks obviously that he has a girlfriend.

615
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,800
Be good to him.

616
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,360
It’s hard for him

617
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
to have a girlfriend.

618
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,720
I’m done.

619
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,680
Get to sleep early.

620
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,680
Hmm.

621
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,600
- Good night. - Good night.

622
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,640
Cool man.

623
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,880
Alone?

624
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,040
Give her the same drink.

625
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Sounds cold.

626
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,240
Thanks.

627
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,080
Go away.

628
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,440
I buy you a drink to shut you up

629
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,320
and kick you away.

630
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,200
You!

631
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,720
Psychopath.

632
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,240
A same drink like his.

633
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,320
Mr. Li.

634
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,800
Why are you drinking alone?

635
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,360
Thanks.

636
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
What?

637
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,920
Doesn’t like that girl?

638
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,640
It makes sense.

639
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,720
She isn’t

640
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
the type of Xu Yiren.

641
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,960
What do you want to say?

642
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,240
Don’t get me wrong.

643
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,160
In person or business,

644
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,840
I’m glad to see

645
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,520
you getting together with Xu Yiren.

646
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
I can even help.

647
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,520
You...

648
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,040
You like Fang Zhiyou?

649
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
So what?

650
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,480
Am I not good enough to like him?

651
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
You are.

652
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,360
Speaking of family background,

653
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,320
experience

654
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,520
and ability,

655
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,520
you make a perfect match with him.

656
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,600
But unfortunately,

657
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,800
he’s in a relationship with Xu Yiren.

658
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,080
You and I have no chance.

659
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,800
What did you say?

660
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
You don’t know yet?

661
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
I have no reason to lie to you.

662
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,680
I’m drowning my sorrows, aren’t I?

663
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,040
Take your time.

664
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,960
Don’t get choked.

665
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,440
I slept late.

666
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,200
If I don’t hurry,

667
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,520
I can’t get a good seat.

668
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,280
Where are you going?

669
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,960
Have you heard of Guo Xudong?

670
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Yes.

671
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,560
He’s a famous designer.

672
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,160
He’s my junior.

673
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,080
Junior?

674
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,560
Hmm.

675
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,480
Xiang Wei taught me

676
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,600
to audit in his class.

677
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
He gives a lecture in Chengji
on classic practical cases

678
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,240
and architectural works in the past twenty years.

679
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,480
He’s a top student from Chengji University.

680
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,680
He won Red Star Design Award three times.

681
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,360
- Awesome, isn’t he? - Xu Yiren.

682
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,200
Aren’t you wasting your time?

683
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,680
What?

684
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,880
When you learn the design,

685
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
you don’t ask your boyfriend

686
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,640
who is an excellent designer.

687
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,960
Instead, you go far away for lectures.

688
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,280
You’re wasting time, energy, and ability.

689
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,320
A teacher is different from a designer.

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,480
How?

691
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,680
A designer is talented to

692
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,640
design large buildings.

693
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,080
But he may not manage to

694
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,960
express his knowledge systematically.

695
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,920
Besides,

696
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,360
you’re always busy.

697
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,360
I can stop being so busy.

698
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Are you jealous?

699
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,840
I’m not.

700
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,200
Uh...

701
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,760
Let me drive you after the breakfast.

702
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,480
No. No.

703
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,640
I’m full.

704
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,480
I have to go.

705
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,400
See you at night.

706
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,200
Humph.

707
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,933
The class is supposed to start at half past nine.

708
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:14,984
What’s the time now?

709
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,128
= Lecturer Guo Xudong =
Oh, dear.

710
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Today is Guo Xudong’s...

711
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,360
Mr. Guo Xudong.

712
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
He’s not Mr. Guo.

713
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,520
Wow.

714
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
He’s so cool.

715
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,800
Yeah.

716
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
And he’s young.

717
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Hello, class.

718
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,320
I’m today’s guest lecturer Fang Zhiyou.

719
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,160
Mr. Guo has some problem to deal with.

720
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,120
So, he can’t come today.

721
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,400
He asked me to give a class for him.

722
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,640
Hope you won’t be disappointed.

723
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,280
We won’t.

724
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,000
Let me introduce myself.

725
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,400
I graduated from Huaqing College.

726
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,400
After graduation, I had

727
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
some representative designs.

728
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,160
This building is one of them.

729
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,960
A good building

730
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
isn’t a simple idea

731
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,960
from a designer

732
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,560
or a simple design from workers.

733
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,880
Cool.

734
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,000
A good building

735
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
is designed by a real craftsman

736
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,360
with his inspirations.

737
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,520
I’m getting bald when studying architecture.

738
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,280
Why does Mr. Fang still have thick hair

739
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
and why does it look so cool?

740
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,680
Any question?

741
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,760
Mr. Fang.

742
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,680
Why are you so handsome?

743
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,080
Sorry.

744
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,000
This isn’t

745
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
a teaching problem.

746
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,480
All right.

747
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,120
The building I just explained

748
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,840
was a Chinese traditional wooden architecture.

749
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,080
Who can tell me

750
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,960
what other material is used,

751
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,640
besides bricks and stones?

752
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,840
The one in yellow in the first row.

753
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
Could you?

754
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
Wooden architecture

755
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,760
in China

756
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,160
has obvious geographic differences.

757
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,520
They can stand strong earthquakes.

758
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,120
When there’s an opportunity,

759
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,560
you can visit them in Shanxi.

760
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,760
Good!

761
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,200
Good point.

762
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,840
Wooden architecture is beautiful and practical.

763
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,800
And it gives birth to

764
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
a world view that

765
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
people get in harmony with nature.

766
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,800
These are features of mortise-tenon.

767
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
It is also the soul of wooden architecture.

768
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,720
She has just

769
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,840
made a very good point.

770
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,000
Let’s go on.

771
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,640
Excuse me.

772
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,720
What’s your name?

773
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
I’m Xu Yiren.

774
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,000
Xu Yiren?

775
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,240
Friend me on WeChat.

776
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,840
Mr. Fang.

777
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,640
May I friend you on WeChat?

778
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,160
I can ask you

779
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,480
if I have confusion about architecture.

780
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,520
I knew it.

781
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
When he gives a class,

782
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,720
who can focus on the study?

783
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,480
He’s bringing harm to students.

784
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,520
You want my WeChat ID?

785
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
Ask her for permission.

786
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,480
What does he mean?

787
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Who is she?

788
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,360
Should I tell her?

789
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,320
Who is she?

790
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,120
Sorry.

791
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Mr. Fang has

792
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,440
an important meeting to attend.

793
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Sorry, but we have to go.

794
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,640
Wait a second.

795
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,800
Who are you?

796
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
I’m his assistant.
