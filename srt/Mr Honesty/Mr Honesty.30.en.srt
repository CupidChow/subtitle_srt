20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,680
Mr. Fang, he’s awake.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
Zhiyou.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
Zhiyou,

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
I’m here.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
If there’s nothing else, I’m off.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
Hold on.

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Have you got a minute?

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
I know you hate me.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,960
And I don’t want to defend myself

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,400
for everything I did.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,320
I want you

31
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
to listen carefully to what I’m about to say

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,840
before making your decision.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,640
I can apologize to your father publicly.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Don’t get me wrong.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,480
It’s not that I suddenly feel remorse.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
I’m only doing this

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
for my son.

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,560
Are you aware

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,200
of the consequence?

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
I want way more than

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
an apology.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I know.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
I will

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,720
tell the whole truth

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,960
and then

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,320
my career will be ended

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
and I’ll probably be punished by law.

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
If your father wishes to appeal,

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
I can give my testimony in court.

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,600
I know you don’t believe me

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,360
and you don’t have to.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
I’m doing this

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
of my own free will.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
And

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,760
there will be

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,240
a condition.

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,760
Just as I expected.

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
A lawyer like you

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,320
would never do anything for free.

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,480
I want you to forgive Fang Zhiyou.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,560
He truly meant to help you,

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,320
so he gave

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
all the evidence to me.

64
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
I lied to him.

65
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Fang Zhiyou

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,400
was on your side the whole time.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
What if I say no?

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Then scratch everything

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
I just said.

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
You know

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
I have Alzheimer’s.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
If wait a few more years,

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
even if I want to do this,

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
I won’t remember anything.

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
If Fang Zhiyou finds out

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
you still bargain with me at this stage,

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,480
even after you apologize to my father,

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
do you think he’ll forgive you?

79
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,960
Forgive me or not,

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,720
I’m always his father.

81
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,680
I’m old.

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
I can’t be with him forever

83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
but you can, Li Zhe.

84
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,160
Fang Zhiyou always regards you

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
as his only true friend.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,880
Why did you do that?

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Must you win that case?

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
Back then, you were too young.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,480
Neither of you

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
knew the truth.

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,200
The one behind that case

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,200
was Jintai Group.

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,600
Their CEO, Mr. Han, reached out to me.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
He said

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,720
as long as your father took the blame,

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,440
he’d

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
entrust all their legal affairs

98
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,800
to me.

99
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
That was too big a temptation

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,040
to resist.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,040
Your greediness

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,640
put my father behind bars for five years

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
and killed my mother.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
I almost became an orphan.

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
You won.

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,680
Are you satisfied?

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
I know, I know.

108
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Li Zhe,

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,280
whatever I say and do

110
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,880
can’t make up for all your losses.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
When I think of Fang Zhiyou

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
lying in bed,

113
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
bleeding, and still begging me,

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
I realize

115
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
nothing else matters.

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
To be honest,

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,520
I’m not a good father

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,480
and I may not be one

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
even until I die.

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,120
But this is

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
the only thing

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,360
I can do for Fang Zhiyou.

123
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,400
I’m leaving.

124
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,440
What’s wrong?

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
Is it your head?

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
Where does it hurt?

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
Can you describe it?

128
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,120
I’m sorry.

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
Why?

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,200
I don’t know

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
why I said that.

132
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,200
It just felt right to do so.

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,240
I shouldn’t have been mad at you

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,680
or made you worry.

135
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
And I should have stepped up

136
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,040
when you were bullied.

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,480
I thought you’d never talk to me again.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
That was the plan.

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
But when I was unconscious,

140
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
I could only think of you.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
Liar!

142
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,760
You couldn’t think of anything at that time.

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
I never lie.

144
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,400
Fang Zhiyou,

145
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,080
I swear

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,440
no matter what happens,

147
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,600
I’ll never lie to you again.

148
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,920
I mean it.

149
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
Lately,

150
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
I’ve been thinking

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
if loving someone

152
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,960
means only accepting her strengths

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,760
but not weaknesses,

154
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,680
isn’t that love

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
too shallow?

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,040
What’s your point?

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
My point is

158
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
if I have to accept your weaknesses, too,

159
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
to gain a full mark in love,

160
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,600
then starting from today,

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,160
I’ll do my best

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,960
to make it up to you

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
Let’s not argue again.

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Even if we do,

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
you can’t turn your back on me.

166
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
I’m scared.

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,080
I’m afraid of losing you.

168
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,920
You won’t.

169
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
We’ll always be together.

170
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,400
Yes, Ms. He.

171
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,400
Why didn’t you tell me

172
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
right after Fang Zhiyou was injured?

173
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,040
Was he?

174
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
When did that happen?

175
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,160
What are you doing?

176
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,040
Yu Qing,

177
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
if you can’t do your job,

178
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,400
just get the hell out!

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
You yelled at me?

180
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,360
Ms. He,

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,160
was Mr. Fang really injured?

182
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,960
Is it bad?

183
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Let’s go check on him.

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Which hospital is he in?

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,360
No wonder Xu Yiren

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
didn’t want you here.

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,960
You’re such an idiot!

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,320
Even Xu Yiren’s toe

189
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,280
is smarter than you.

190
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,960
Ms. He,

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
that’s insulting!

192
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
No one has ever insulted me.

193
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Xu Yiren and Fang Zhiyou are back together.

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Once she comes back,

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
you’ll be out for sure.

196
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
How come?

197
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,560
They’re back together?

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,160
What about me?

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If I can’t win,

200
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,200
neither can you.

201
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Fang Zhanyang,

202
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,520
according to the Law of the PRC on Lawyers,

203
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,600
from now on,

204
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
you’re officially

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
disbarred.

206
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
This is the court document

207
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
for you.

208
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Check everything carefully.

209
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,060
= Fang Zhanyang Reveals Truth Late for 13 Years
Investigation Reopens =

210
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,920
Jinghong.

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,520
Jinghong.

212
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,120
I’m sorry.

213
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,480
Jinghong,

214
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,320
I apologize to you

215
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,680
for my mistake 13 years ago.

216
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,560
I don’t expect you

217
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,080
to forgive me

218
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
because I know

219
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
I’ll live in remorse

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,320
for the rest of my life.

221
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,720
I only hope

222
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,040
what happened between us

223
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
ends between us.

224
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,240
Don’t let our children

225
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
suffer more.

226
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Dad,

227
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,920
did you hear that?

228
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,080
Fang Zhanyang apologized.

229
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,000
You’re innocent.

230
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,600
They wronged you.

231
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Look,

232
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,440
everyone knows the truth.

233
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
They were wrong.

234
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
You didn’t deceive

235
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,560
or scam others.

236
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,320
You aren’t to blame

237
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,800
but they are.

238
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Dad,

239
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,840
all that I’ve done

240
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,840
is for this day.

241
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,040
Did you hear that?

242
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
If you did,

243
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
just say something, OK?

244
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
One word is fine.

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,400
Please, dad!

246
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,800
Just say a word!

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
I’m begging you.

248
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,600
Dad!

249
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Dad, did you hear that?

250
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,040
Did you, dad?

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
Son.

252
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,520
Zhe.

253
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,720
Son.

254
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,560
Son.

255
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,320
Dad!

256
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,680
Dad, you remember me?

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Son!

258
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,360
Dad!

No.

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
I don’t want my dad to relive the whole thing.

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Besides,

274
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,160
your father has been given

275
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
enough punishment.

276
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,200
Just let it go.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,560
I just want to spend more time with my dad.

278
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,360
Thank you.

279
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,760
I know

280
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,480
it’s not easy for you

281
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,360
to make that decision.

282
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,360
You’re right.

283
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,920
Now,

284
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
our fathers’ debts are even.

285
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
It’s time to settle ours.

286
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
Like I said,

287
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,280
you can take anything from me,

288
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,440
but Xu Yiren

289
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,760
is mine.

290
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
You’re such an ingrate.

291
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,040
Hadn’t I showed interest in her,

292
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,720
would you have come round so soon

293
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,440
and made up with her?

294
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,840
Besides,

295
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,840
if I really want her,

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
won’t I win her over?

297
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,920
You won’t.

298
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,520
Fine.

299
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,480
I won’t.

300
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
I’m giving Xu Yiren to you.

301
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
She didn’t belong to you in the first place.

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,040
How could you give her to me?

303
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,200
What’s your problem?

304
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Can’t you lose to me for once?

305
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
I almost lost my arm.

306
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,520
What more do you want?

307
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,080
You no longer

308
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
owe me anything.

309
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,040
I owe you.

310
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
Xu Yiren is right.

311
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,520
I’m not cut out for revenge.

312
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
I made tons of mistakes.

313
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
It’s time

314
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,920
to pay the price.

315
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,960
I’ll quit my job at Dasheng.

316
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
Are you still going to leave?

317
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,240
This is my home.

318
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,560
I’m going to start over right here.

319
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,800
You said you owe me.

320
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,400
Shouldn’t you ask me

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
what I want?

322
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,200
What do you want?

323
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,520
A kite.

324
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,800
Bear wanted to give

325
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,720
the little squirrel

326
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
a paper boat,

327
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
but it couldn’t climb up the mountain.

328
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
Then he

329
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
made a little kite.

330
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,440
The kite flew to squirrel’s house.

331
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,200
Squirrel and bear had a fight.

332
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Bear said,

333
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,040
“if you want to make up,

334
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,920
then fold another paper boat”.

335
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,480
Squirrel put it in the river,

336
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
but he didn’t know

337
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
if the boat could reach bear’s house.

338
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,700
= Square & Circle =

339
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
Has Fang Zhiyou been discharged?

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes.

341
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,520
He still needs to rest, though.

342
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,280
He asked me to tell you

343
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
to manage the company

344
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,560
while he’s absent.

345
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,560
You must be happy

346
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,000
that you two are back together.

347
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Ms. He...

348
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,680
I won’t give up.

349
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,640
As long as you aren’t married,

350
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
I will not quit.

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Xu Yiren,

352
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,720
I won’t lose him to you.

353
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
Yiren, Yiren, look.

354
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,480
What is this?

355
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,160
Yu Qing is spewing nonsense!

356
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,680
She said...

357
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,120
that...

358
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
that you’re unmarried yet pregnant

359
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,600
and Mr. Fang fought for you

360
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
and ended up in hospital.

361
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,120
What is this crap?

362
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,960
Yiren!

363
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,320
Are you going to whack her?

364
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
I can help you!

365
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,720
Gu Bo,

366
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
get me Yu Qing’s address right now!

367
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,360
You don’t know? Go ask around!

368
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,920
I don’t care.

369
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,680
I want it this minute!

370
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,160
Yiren went to great lengths to get you this job.

371
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,840
How could you quit so easily?

372
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
Why couldn’t she?

373
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
They were so mean to her.

374
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,600
I’ve never even

375
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
raised my voice to her.

376
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,560
He Yuwen said

377
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,440
even Xu Yiren’s toe is smarter than me.

378
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,240
Let me show them

379
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,040
her true color.

380
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,160
That day,

381
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,400
I apologized to her so humbly,

382
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
yet they used her to run errands.

383
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,600
What...

384
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,800
Who are you?

385
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,120
Are you nuts?

386
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,200
How do you feel others

387
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,840
throwing mud at you?

388
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,560
Is it good?

389
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,440
She’s bullying your wife and daughter, Dayong!

390
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,400
You...

391
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,280
You must be Xu Yiren’s uncle.

392
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
You know what those two fools did?

393
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,240
Listen,

394
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,200
post on Weibo immediately

395
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,240
and admit what you said before

396
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
is a lie. You’re jealous of Xu Yiren.

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,720
Otherwise,

398
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
I’ll shower you

399
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,960
with ink every day.

400
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
Your mom won’t even recognize you.

401
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Try me if you don’t believe it.

402
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,240
Xu Yiren

403
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
is tolerant towards you

404
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,280
because you’re her cousin,

405
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,240
but I

406
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,320
can’t stand scum like you.

407
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,040
Hey, what did...did you do?

408
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
Who the hell are you

409
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
that you’re lecturing me?

410
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,320
All of you

411
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,720
think Xu Yiren is good.

412
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,600
You’re a bunch of idiots!

413
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Especially you, a leftover virgin psycho!

414
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
No one wants you!

415
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,120
Apologize!

416
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,400
Apologize to my friend!

417
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Why?

418
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,520
I get it.

419
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
It’s your idea, isn’t it?

420
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,360
You’re so ungrateful.

421
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,200
We raised an ingrate!

422
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,560
What are you doing?

423
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
It’s my fault.

424
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,720
I thought you’d change.

425
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,000
That even if you wouldn’t

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
take me as your family,

427
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,960
at least, we’d be in peace.

428
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
I begged Fang Zhiyou to give you a job.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,320
But ever since you joined the company,

430
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,280
you’ve been trying to kick me out.

431
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,320
You thought you could drive a wedge between us

432
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,040
by getting close to Fang Zhiyou?

433
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,160
In your dreams!

434
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,600
You’re pathetic!

435
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
You could have lived your own life

436
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
but you had to follow me around

437
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
and wasted your youth.

438
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
Is it worth it?

439
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,520
Yiren,

440
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,400
what on earth happened?

441
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,280
If your aunt and Qing did something wrong,

442
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,400
I apologize to you for them.

443
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Stop it!

444
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
Look what she did!

445
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,600
Are you blind?

446
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,560
Enough!

447
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,200
Uncle,

448
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,840
you’re a good man

449
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,800
and you’re always my uncle.

450
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
As for them,

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
from now on,

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,560
they’re strangers to me.

453
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,080
- Let’s go. - You...

454
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,520
You... Stop!

455
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,400
Yiren... Yi...

456
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
You can’t give me that!

457
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,200
- Come off it! - Stop there!

458
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
What did I do?

459
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,400
Why are you yelling at me?

460
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,040
Didn’t you see what she did to us?

461
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,280
Gu Fenfang,

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
if you still want us to be a family,

463
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
then be nice to Yiren.

464
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,440
Or, we can divorce.

465
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,800
Fine. Do it!

466
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
Divorce me.

467
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,840
I’m not afraid.

468
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,640
Let’s go.

469
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,720
We’re done!

470
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,040
Did you see

471
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,480
the look on Yu Qing’s face?

472
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
She was pissed!

473
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,720
I’ll draw it.

474
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
You’re bad.

475
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
That ink is hard to wash off.

476
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,000
I know.

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
I picked the lasting one on purpose.

478
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
It’ll take a few days to get rid of it.

479
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
Just now,

480
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
you were surprisingly fierce.

481
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,200
She called you names.

482
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,400
Xia Di...

483
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Alright.

484
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Save your apology.

485
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
I’ve heard enough.

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,920
I know.

487
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,720
I’ve done it over and over.

488
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
I meant to

489
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,280
thank you.

490
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,680
For what?

491
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,960
For sticking up for me,

492
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,520
always tolerating me,

493
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
helping me

494
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
and...

495
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,080
Stop.

496
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
You’re more sentimental than Gu Bo.

497
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,120
Oh, crap!

498
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,960
My bike is still there.

499
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,440
Will they do anything to it?

500
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
You can stay.

501
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,520
Tonight, I want to eat

502
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,720
sweet and sour ribs and steamed eggs.

503
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,200
You got it.

504
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,880
Be careful.

505
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,720
Have some water.

506
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
You can’t go to work,

507
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,680
so you’re working from home?

508
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,960
How is this resting?

509
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,240
I’m almost recovered.

510
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
It’s just that my right hand

511
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,040
still can’t move.

512
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,480
Deadline of Zhiwu Library is approaching.

513
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,880
There’s no time to waste.

514
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I meant to tell you this long ago.

515
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I know you want to win that project,

516
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
but your hand

517
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,920
can’t draw.

518
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Don’t

519
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
push yourself too hard.

520
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,240
You still have plenty of chances.

521
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,720
I can’t draw

522
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
but someone else can.

523
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,880
Do you mean me?

524
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,720
I can’t draw.

525
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,560
Let me get it.

526
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,840
What brings you here?

527
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,720
Where’s Fang Zhiyou?

528
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,600
Today is your lucky day.

529
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,240
I brought this wine back from abroad.

530
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
This is the only bottle left.

531
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,640
You mean him?

532
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,480
What?

533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Are you speaking ill of me behind my back again?

534
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
Fang Zhiyou would never speak ill of others.

535
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
He isn’t you.

536
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,240
Stop being partial.

537
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,680
She’s my girlfriend.

538
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
Of course she’s partial towards me.

539
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,120
If I remember correctly,

540
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,720
you invited me over for help.

541
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,160
For cooperation, to be precise.

542
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Dasheng will also benefit from it.

543
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,120
Fine.

544
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,960
I quit.

545
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,080
Don’t worry.

546
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
He won’t leave.

547
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,720
What did I say? He’s back.

548
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,200
Alright.

549
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,240
Let me see

550
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,120
what you’ve done so far.

551
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,440
Mom.

552
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,360
Yuwen!

553
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,800
There you are.

554
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,160
I thought you wouldn’t come back.

555
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
I said

556
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
I’d have a meal with you every month.

557
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,880
I wouldn’t miss it.

558
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,080
Sit.

559
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,160
I made your favorite steamed fish.

560
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,200
Once

561
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
your father and Qiming finish their meeting,

562
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,600
we can eat.

563
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,960
They’re in the study?

564
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,160
For over two hours.

565
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,760
Your father

566
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,960
isn’t in a good mood lately.

567
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,600
If he

568
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,680
says something unpleasant

569
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,840
later,

570
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,160
just ignore it.

571
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,200
I’m not in the mood to argue with him.

572
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,800
This is embarrassing!

573
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,840
Sorry, sir.

574
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,840
I’ll revise it.

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,560
Qiming.

576
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,040
Mrs. He.

577
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
I’m leaving.

578
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
I thought you’d eat with us.

579
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,480
I’m needed elsewhere.

580
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,240
Maybe next time.

581
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
Uh...

582
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,880
What do you think?

583
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,600
Those three pillars are unnecessary.

584
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,680
That problem has been troubling me.

585
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,760
The land in the northeast corner

586
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
is too sandy

587
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,680
and loose.

588
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,520
We’re building a three-story

589
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
all-wood structure.

590
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,800
It’s too heavy.

591
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,600
The whole structure

592
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,560
will be sloping in a few years.

593
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,440
So you add three pillars

594
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
to share the weight,

595
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,720
right?

596
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,840
They can also support the main structure.

597
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,360
I like your idea

598
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,120
but...they aren’t aesthetic.

599
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,360
What if we make the pillars

600
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,960
into some kind of shape?

601
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,560
That way, their original functions

602
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,760
will remain

603
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
and they’ll look more harmonious.

604
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,720
In terms of shapes,

605
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
they can be symmetric.

606
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,200
- Sails. - Sails.

607
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,040
You two are like-minded.

608
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,120
Are you jealous?

609
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,800
I am.

610
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,160
I’ve put your dinner in the oven

611
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,360
and preset it.

612
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,560
Just click the button to start.

613
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,680
It’ll be ready in 20 minutes.

614
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,280
Aren’t you going to eat with us?

615
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,240
I’ve promised Xia Di to cook dinner for her.

616
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,520
Have you two made up?

617
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,040
We’ve never split up,

618
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,440
unlike you guys.

619
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,680
By the way,

620
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,800
just sip the wine yourself.

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Don’t let Fang Zhiyou drink it.

622
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,040
Why?

623
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,720
Although his arm is broken,

624
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,560
he can still drink.

625
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
That’s not the problem.

626
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
Anyway, just keep him away from the wine.

627
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,000
Or the consequence will be dire.

628
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,040
Got it?

629
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,760
Will there be dire consequences?

630
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,800
How would I know?

631
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,880
Here.

632
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
Have some tea to refresh yourself.

633
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,600
Don’t always leave right after the meal.

634
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:13,920
Here you are.

635
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,680
Thank you, mom.

636
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,520
I’ll make some dumplings.

637
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,120
You two

638
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,800
take your time.

639
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,760
Once the dumplings are done,

640
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,200
take some with you.

641
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
I should go.

642
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,800
Sit down.

643
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,760
I want to have a word with you.

644
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,640
I heard Fang Zhiyou

645
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
and his assistant are together.

646
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,720
His taste is poor.

647
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
If there isn't anything else,

648
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
I’m leaving.

649
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,920
What’s Fang Zhiyou’s design

650
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
of Zhiwu Library?

651
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,360
Dad,

652
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,680
you know I can’t tell you.

653
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
You can’t tell others

654
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
but I’m your dad.

655
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,440
Dad,

656
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
you can’t come up with a design

657
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,720
so you want Fang Zhiyou’s?

658
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Are you going to do

659
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
what you did five years ago?

660
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,560
How could you?

661
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,040
Why couldn’t I?

662
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,720
Fang Zhiyou is my student.

663
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
I taught him everything.

664
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,440
Why can’t I take it back?

665
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,240
You’re twisting the fact!

666
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
I’m not twisting anything.

667
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,400
Sweetie,

668
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
I’m too old

669
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,400
to continue to draw

670
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,920
but I can’t quit.

671
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,840
The company needs me.

672
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,480
You need me.

673
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,040
Although you refuse to come back,

674
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,000
I have to keep it for you.

675
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,600
As long as

676
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,320
I’m still in this industry,

677
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
you can always rely on me.

678
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,520
I don’t need you.

679
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,280
All

680
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,720
parents in the world

681
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,280
plan ahead for their children.

682
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,160
You may not understand that completely,

683
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,800
but you will someday.

684
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,120
You were always on Fang Zhiyou’s side

685
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,160
and I didn’t say anything about it.

686
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,000
But he abandoned your years

687
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,040
of relationship

688
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,200
for his assistant.

689
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,440
Are you still going to help him?

690
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,960
That’s my call to make.

691
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,520
Wake up, silly!

692
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,000
Once he becomes successful

693
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,280
and marries that girl,

694
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,760
by that time,

695
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,520
will there still be your spot in his company?

696
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
I won’t press you

697
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,680
but I want you to think it over.

698
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
In this world,

699
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,960
only your mother and I

700
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,600
are the closest to you.

701
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,880
We will never

702
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,960
betray you

703
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,400
or hurt you.

704
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,360
What do you think? Take a look.

705
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,160
Is this what you want?

706
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,520
You should ask

707
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,720
if this is what we want.

708
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,480
I think

709
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,080
it is.

710
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,320
It’s settled then.

711
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,080
Sure. Let’s celebrate.

712
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,680
Have some wine.

713
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,040
I’d better not.

714
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,600
Why?

715
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,680
You can’t?

716
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,440
Are you afraid?

717
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,360
Afraid of Xu Yiren?

718
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,040
No, I...

719
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
get drunk easily.

720
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,560
I know.

721
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,760
That’s OK. You’re at home.

722
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,560
If you’re drunk,

723
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,960
just go straight to your room and sleep.

724
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,040
Nah. Pass.

725
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,120
I...

726
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
Drinking too much is bad.

727
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Chug it. I’ll drink with you.

728
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,920
Why didn’t you finish it?

729
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,160
I don’t have to.

730
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,240
I’m a flower.

731
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,480
Why can’t I lift it?

732
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,000
I’m a flower.

733
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,960
Are you going to water me, Yiren?

734
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,160
Fang Zhiyou,

735
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,720
you just had one glass.

736
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,080
Calm down. Be good.

737
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,760
I’m going to water you.

738
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
I’m coming.

739
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,320
Yiren,

740
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,080
your legs are longer!

741
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
You’re taller, too.

742
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,800
Don’t touch me.

743
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,840
Yiren...

744
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,720
What are you doing?

745
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Get up, Fang Zhiyou!

746
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
I’m not Xu Yiren.

747
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,680
I’m not Xu...

748
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,560
Yiren,

749
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,480
I’m so happy!

750
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I’m not.

751
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,840
I have you

752
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
and Li Zhe.

753
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,320
He’s forgiven me.

754
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
I’m so excited!

755
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,280
I want strawberries.

756
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
Go get them yourself. Go ahead.

757
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Ow! It hurts!

758
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,240
You’re nuts!

759
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,440
Great! Brilliant!

760
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
I’m overwhelmed.

761
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,520
Look at this design.

762
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
Fond will definitely pick ours

763
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,280
unless they’re blind.

764
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,360
This design

765
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,200
incorporates Li Zhe’s ideas, too.

766
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,720
This time,

767
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
we’ll bid for it

768
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,640
with Dasheng.

769
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Don’t Look at me.

770
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,280
If I want to sabotage it,

771
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
you can’t stop me.

772
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,280
Your fear

773
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,240
won’t come to fruition.

774
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,760
The bid is around the corner.

775
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,960
Next, Li Zhe and I

776
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
will finalize all the details.

777
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,280
Mr. Liu,

778
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Ms. He,

779
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,920
I want you to work on the proposal.

780
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,920
No problem.

781
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,120
This project

782
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,640
can’t go beyond the five of us.

783
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,960
No one else can interfere.

784
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,920
This is the top secret.

785
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,340
= Dad =

786
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,280
Good.

787
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,120
Perfect.

788
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,040
I’ll send it to Fond first thing tomorrow morning.

789
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,520
Great! I’m so excited!

790
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,840
I’m glad the design is done

791
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
before I am.

792
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,440
Thank you all for your help.

793
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,600
Get some rest.

794
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
My job is done

795
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,960
before the result comes out.

796
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,600
I miss my bed.

797
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
See you.

798
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,520
I’ll leave you alone.

799
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,720
Bye.

800
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,960
I’m off.

801
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,640
Let’s take a rest.

802
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,040
Xu Yiren.

803
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,840
Don’t you think you forgot something?

804
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
What have you promised me?

805
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,600
There are a lot.

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,720
Really?

807
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,360
Do you remember one of them is

808
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,640
once the feud between Li Zhe and me was over,

809
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,560
you’d marry me?

810
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
I remember I also said

811
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,000
your proposal was too sloppy.

812
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,720
Look what Gu Bo did.

813
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,200
You like that style?

814
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,840
Not exactly.

815
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,680
Be honest.

816
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,000
I’m a little bit envious.

817
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,280
A little bit?

818
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,400
Like this, this

819
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,120
or this?

820
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,200
Just a little bit.

821
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
Like this or this?

822
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
This little bit.

823
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,400
It’s too late to hold a grand ceremony

824
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,320
but my proposal gift

825
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
is one of a kind.

826
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,680
Alright.

827
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,720
Once you win that Zhiwu Library Project,

828
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,760
