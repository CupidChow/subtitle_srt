20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Ms. He.

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,560
Here is your medicine.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,720
Come on, take it.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
This is not the medicine I used to take.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,160
What you used to take is used up.

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,680
Yiren brought you this.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Ms. He, take this.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
This is less stimulating.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Keep it down.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Do you want everyone to know about this?

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Come on.

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,120
Please take it.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,760
Come.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Come.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Ms. He.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Let’s go to the hospital.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
You won’t make it through.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Yiren is right.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,480
You should go to the hospital.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,720
Just in case.

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
No need.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,200
I’m fine.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
Leave me.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Ms. He.

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
OK, we leave.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
Have a good rest.

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
If you still feel uncomfortable,

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
call us at any time.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,840
Ms. He.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
Let’s go to the hospital.

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
I can’t leave you like this.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
Leave alone.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,440
Sha Sha,

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,680
call the ambulance.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
What?

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,920
Did you hear what I said, Xu Yiren?

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,880
Ms. He.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
You don’t know,

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
I got a friend

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
who had a stomachache.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
He thought some pills would do,

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,560
but when he was sent to the hospital,

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
he was diagnosed of stomach perforation.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
He had half of his stomach cut

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
and couldn’t eat anything.

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
The doctor said

67
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
he was lucky,

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,480
if it got worse,

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,040
the whole stomach would be cut.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
And they would use a section of his intestines

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
to make another stomach.

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
How scary it is.

73
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Ms. He.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
Let’s go,

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
please.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
Fine.

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,880
It’s too late to call an ambulance now.

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Can you drive?

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Yeah.

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
I can.

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,600
Let’s go.

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,800
It would be too late

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
if it deteriorates.

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah, let’s go, Ms. He.

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,120
Go.

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
Don’t touch me.

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
I can walk.

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
Don’t freak out the others.

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
Young girl,

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
you’d better cut down drinking,

91
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
you almost

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
got a stomach perforation.

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,800
OK.

94
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Ring the bell if it’s running out.

95
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
You got another bottle.

96
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,720
Thanks.

97
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Ms. He.

98
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,160
How are you feeling?

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Better?

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Does it still hurt?

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,480
Where is Sha Sha?

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
She’s out for procedures.

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,800
Would you like some water?

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,880
I’ll go buy some.

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
Don’t bother.

106
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Sha Sha is here.

107
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,680
You can leave now.

108
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
It’s OK.

109
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,360
Nothing important in work.

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
I have Chulin watch over for me.

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
My job today is

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
to be with you.

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,400
Xu Yiren,

114
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
you’re getting more and more

115
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,760
undisciplined.

116
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,160
Since when can an assistant

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
permit her own leave?

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
No,

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,080
I’m not.

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,200
Keep it in mind,

121
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,880
you’re Fang Zhiyou’s assistant but,

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
you’re also an employee of the admin department.

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
You got it?

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Yeah.

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Moreover,

126
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
whatever you do to the others,

127
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
don’t use it to trick with me.

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,400
What?

129
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,360
Your friend got a stomach perforation

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
and got it cut off?

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,920
Is that Xia Di you’re talking about?

132
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,280
I was just bluffing.

133
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,960
Anyway,

134
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,680
you should come to the hospital
when you’re sick.

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
That’s reassuring.

136
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Ms. He.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
The doctor said

138
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,080
your stomach was burnt for excessive drinking.

139
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,640
Is it because last night with Dasheng?

140
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
If you don’t show your sincerity,

141
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
how would they

142
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
want to cooperate with you?

143
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
You think I wanted to do that?

144
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
Fang Zhiyou was with you

145
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
last night?

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,560
Yes.

147
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,360
We visited the resort yesterday,

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,000
and the car broke down.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
Flat tire.

150
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,560
And then?

151
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,600
Then we were screwed.

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
We called

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,360
the road rescue

154
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,400
and then waited.

155
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
We waited and waited.

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,760
They didn’t come until dark.

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,200
The staff were off work after dark

158
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
so, no one came to repair our car.

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,560
We had to sit on the roadside

160
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,520
and sleep in the wild.

161
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
- I also heard…
- OK, get out.

162
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,320
OK.

163
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,040
I’m outside.

164
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,160
Call me if you need anything.

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,560
OK.

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,640
For the project Moon Bay,

167
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
we’ve decided

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,680
to work with Dasheng Modeling.

169
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,440
Since it’s a very difficult project

170
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,680
and we can’t complete it

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
independently,

172
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,200
we will cooperate with an external company.

173
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Great.

174
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
The level of the modeling companies

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
we have worked with before is not high.

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,520
This time we can cooperate with Dasheng.

177
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
Along with Mr. Fang’s plans,

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
I think we can make it.

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
I heard

181
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
Dasheng has a high level of modeling

182
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,640
and they’re picky about their partners.

183
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
It’s great

184
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
that we can work with them

185
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,120
this time.

186
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,240
This project is very important,

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
I’ll design personally.

188
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,520
Liu,

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,920
work with me.

190
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,480
No problem.

191
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
Xiang Wei, Ziyang, Gu Bo,

192
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
organize the frame of

193
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
the overall plan

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,320
and thoughts.

195
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,360
- OK.
- OK.

196
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,400
Gu Bo,

197
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
we have to take it seriously

198
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,200
this time,

199
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
don’t slack off.

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
= Xu Yiren =
So later we have to

201
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
go to the field to inspect.

202
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,880
Don’t let the modeling company think
we are not professional enough.

203
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,160
Sure.

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,920
Mr. Fang.

205
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,080
Ms. He drank too much with Dasheng last night

206
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,360
and she’s in the hospital now.

207
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,880
Yuwen,

208
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,640
are you all right?

209
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
Sorry, I’m late.

210
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240
I just knew you’re sick.

211
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,120
I’m here to check on you.

212
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,160
How are you feeling?

213
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,680
I’m fine.

214
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
You can just come,

215
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,480
no need to bring flowers.

216
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
I can leave

217
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
when this bottle is up.

218
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
I never thought Dasheng is

219
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
such an unreasonable company.

220
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,600
We don’t have to

221
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
work with them.

222
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
Don’t you dare

223
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,960
not sign that contract.

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,240
I’m sick like this,

225
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
if you don’t sign it,

226
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,120
all my efforts are in vain.

227
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
You don’t have to do this.

228
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn’t do it for you.

229
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,240
I did it for the company.

230
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,800
Don’t you forget,

231
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
I hold shares in this company.

232
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
My dowry

233
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
is counting on you.

234
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,760
I know you always put work first,

235
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
but you can’t do something like this anymore.

236
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,720
Don’t harm your body

237
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
for just a contract.

238
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,200
It’s not worth it.

239
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,680
I’m the one to decide

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
it’s worth or not.

241
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
You’re too competitive.

242
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
Of course I am.

243
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
You think what makes me

244
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
your executive secretary, great designer?

245
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,680
So you have to take a good rest

246
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,720
and keep a good body,

247
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,960
you got many things to do in the company.

248
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,920
Later, I’ll wash the grapes.

249
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,440
Grapes are rich in tartaric acid,

250
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
which can dispel alcohol.

251
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Have more of them.

252
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,560
Thanks.

253
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,680
Ms. He.

254
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Have some water.

255
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,960
Mr. Fang.

256
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Give it to me.

257
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Be careful.

258
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,600
It’s hot.

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,320
Be careful.

260
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
I’m leaving.

261
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,760
Mr. Li.

262
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,520
He’s here.

263
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,520
I checked on that elementary school.

264
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
The head teacher of the class

265
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
has retired.

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
I went to her house,

267
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,280
but she wasn’t there.

268
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Her family said that she is on a trip to Thailand,

269
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
and won’t be back in two weeks.

270
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,360
Book me a ticket to Thailand

271
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
immediately.

272
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,520
The company is already urging you to work.

273
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,760
It’s inappropriate

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,960
to leave now.

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,320
And,

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
about Square & Circle.

277
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,320
You have been waiting for so many years,

278
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
you can wait too more weeks.

279
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
Let me know

280
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
as soon as she’s back.

281
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,000
OK, no problem.

282
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,520
I’m leaving now.

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,640
Wake up.

284
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,440
Wake up.

285
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
Wake up.

286
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
The police station is over there.

287
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,000
Go in and tell the police

288
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
you are lost,

289
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
want to find your parents, remember?

290
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

291
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,720
Go.

292
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,440
Here.

293
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,960
OK.

294
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
Give me that.

295
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,520
Lunch is ready.

296
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,440
- Thanks.
- Here.

297
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
Thanks.

298
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
Take it.

299
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Fellas,

300
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
sorry,

301
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,960
emergency meeting.

302
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,320
- OK.
- OK.

303
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
I can’t be too late today.

304
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,000
I’m going to Dasheng with Mr. Fang tomorrow.

305
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,480
We can finally start

306
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,960
the formal modeling work,

307
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,560
one step closer to Moon Bay project.

308
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,480
Anyone who doesn’t know who you are might

309
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,320
think you’re Square & Circle boss’s girlfriend.

310
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Look at you.

311
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah.

312
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,800
We seldom have time to relax.

313
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,360
I’m telling you,

314
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
order anything you want.

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
It’s on me today.

316
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,240
He said he got paid today

317
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
and couldn’t help showing off.

318
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,160
Just satisfy

319
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,080
his humble wish.

320
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,880
You’ve gone way too far.

321
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
You must have paid a lot to rent this car?

322
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,440
I borrowed.

323
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Borrowed.

324
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,440
I didn’t see that

325
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
you got rich friends.

326
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,480
We met from online games.

327
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,080
I’m telling you,

328
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,480
he’s a gold player.

329
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,600
I can introduce him to you.

330
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
No need.

331
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,920
I got no interest in silver-spoon kids.

332
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
I’m hostile to the rich.

333
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,000
Why?

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
Because there are only two results for rich men,

335
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
one is becoming a jerk,

336
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,200
the other is becoming a cake-eater.

337
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,520
You’re being biased.

338
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,400
Not all rich men are like this.

339
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
Like Fang Zhiyou.

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
He’s rich and talented.

341
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
And immune to girls.

342
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Gu Bo,

343
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,120
I got a question for you.

344
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,080
If Fang Zhiyou and I drop into water,

345
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
who will you save first?

346
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,560
This is a hard question.

347
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
You’re making me hard.

348
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Why are you looking at me?

349
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,520
I feel sorry for you.

350
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,200
You’re not only stealing boys

351
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,280
from girls, also from boys.

352
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
Nonsense.

353
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I hate you.

354
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
I know the answer.

355
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,600
I’ll save you first.

356
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Because Fang Zhiyou is a swimming champion.

357
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,440
Drive faster.

358
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,680
Or there will be no room for us.

359
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,680
Kung Pao Chicken.

360
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,240
Why eat here?

361
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,560
Mapo Tofu.

362
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
Fried potato slices.

363
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
Bei, come on.

364
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Go check the guests at that table.

365
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,880
One more.

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
That’s enough

367
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,200
for three of us.

368
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Don’t waste.

369
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,160
Hey,

370
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
look what you ordered.

371
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,200
If you want to eat potato slices,

372
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,840
we don’t have to come here.

373
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,520
Waiter,

374
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,800
A poached fish.

375
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,240
And fried crab.

376
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,200
Have you lost your mind?

377
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,160
Forget what he just ordered.

378
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,080
Why?

379
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,160
Let’s have a good meal.

380
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Oh, my goodness.

381
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,840
Please don’t see me.

382
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,240
What’s wrong?

383
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
Are you feeling unwell?

384
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,360
Stomachache.

385
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
Stomachache?

386
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
We haven’t started eating yet.

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,720
How about next time?

388
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,640
Let’s go home first.

389
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,400
No, no.

390
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,200
No need.

391
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,160
Some water will do.

392
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
You got no water in the cup.

393
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,160
Waiter.

394
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
Got him some hot water.

395
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,080
How about the dishes?

396
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
Add one poached fish.

397
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,160
Nothing more.

398
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,680
Thanks.

399
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,400
OK.

400
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,680
Cheers.

401
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,160
OK.

402
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Thank Gu Bo for his treat.

403
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,120
- You’re welcome.
- Thanks.

404
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Thanks.

405
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Cheers.

406
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
We didn’t order this.

407
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,080
It’s a gift from us.

408
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,400
Hello,

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
this is our featured dish.

410
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
Every time,

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,720
as long as…

412
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
the customers come in…

413
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,280
Right.

414
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,600
I remember.

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,840
They got a lucky draw

416
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,160
of their featured dishes

417
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,280
on weekends

418
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,680
when it’s fully booked.

419
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
Am I right?

420
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,360
We are lucky.

421
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,800
Thanks.

422
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,000
I sincerely hope your business flourishes.

423
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,400
Right.

424
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,920
Yeah.

425
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,360
Congratulations.

426
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,240
You’re the lucky customers tonight.

427
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,320
Really?

428
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
We can go buy

429
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,120
lottery after dinner.

430
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,800
We’re so lucky.

431
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
Except this gift

432
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
for lucky customers,

433
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,960
we got another special offer today.

434
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,400
What is it?

435
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,760
If the guests are a couple,

436
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
and take a picture of them

437
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,040
dinning in our restaurant,

438
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,120
and post it in their WeChat moment,

439
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
they can get

440
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,040
50% discount of dishes

441
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,720
and free drinks.

442
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
But we got no couple here.

443
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
Who said so?

444
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,080
You can take a picture with Gu Bo.

445
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,440
So, we can get a free dinner.

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
What do you think?

447
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,560
If you want to eat free dinner,

448
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
why don’t you take the picture with him?

449
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,160
I can, but we have to ask Gu Bo

450
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,800
who he wants to take the picture with.

451
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,760
Miss Xia Di,

452
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,880
please, do this for us.

453
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,320
I’m poor.

454
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,600
Come on.

455
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Here.

456
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
I’ll help you.

457
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Hi.

458
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,440
The couple must be close in the photo.

459
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,040
Or it doesn’t count.

460
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,160
This doesn’t count.

461
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,360
Closer.

462
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,520
Closer.

463
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,080
Goddess,

464
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
make this gesture with me,

465
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,680
it’s popular recently.

466
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,360
Seriously?

467
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,040
If I knew this,

468
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,360
I’d rather you not to treat us today.

469
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,760
- Come on. - Come.

470
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,040
One.

471
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,840
Two.

472
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,600
Three.

473
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,000
What’s your problem?

474
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,960
One more time.

475
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,040
One.

476
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Two.

477
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,240
Three.

478
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,720
Where is our tacit?

479
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,720
The last time.

480
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Last time.

481
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,280
OK.

482
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
Come.

483
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,760
Is that a portrait of the dead?

484
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,520
Can you make it uglier?

485
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
Come, have some fruit.

486
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,240
Do you think it’s good?

487
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
I’m good, but you…

488
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,160
What about me?

489
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,120
What?

490
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
Are you jealous of this picture?

491
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,640
Stop it.

492
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,280
I’m thinking.

493
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,320
What do you think

494
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,760
makes people a perfect couple?

495
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
Speak Chinese.

496
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,760
Do you think,

497
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,440
Mr. Fang and Ms. He make a perfect couple?

498
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,080
What?

499
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,680
I don’t know perfect or not,

500
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,600
but I don’t think they two will make a couple.

501
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,960
Why?

502
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Why won’t they?

503
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
Because our Ms. He is in unrequited love.

504
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
Mr. Fang got no interest in her.

505
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,680
How do you know?

506
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
How don’t I know?

507
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
He Yuwen abandoned

508
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,600
her own company for Fang Zhiyou.

509
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,160
Everyone knows

510
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
she likes Fang Zhiyou

511
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,960
except Fang Zhiyou himself.

512
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
He is a prenatal undergraduate

513
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
in this.

514
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,600
What’s a prenatal undergraduate?

515
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
A prenatal education undergraduate.

516
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,520
Means he knows nothing about love.

517
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,920
How do you know

518
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,760
Mr. Fang got no interest in Ms. He?

519
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,880
If Fang Zhiyou is a prenatal undergraduate,

520
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,360
then you are…

521
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,440
A primary undergraduate.

522
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,680
A primary school undergraduate.

523
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
Think about it.

524
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,360
If Fang Zhiyou likes He Yuwen,

525
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,960
how could they not be with each other

526
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,560
after so many years?

527
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
Do you know awakening of love?

528
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,560
Men only

529
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,480
get to know love

530
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,120
when they meet

531
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,720
the women they like.

532
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,560
Look at Fang Zhiyou,

533
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,160
I bet he got no interest in He Yuwen.

534
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,800
Now you got nothing to worry.

535
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,520
What do I have to worry?

536
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,240
Besides,

537
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,280
if he doesn’t like a woman like Ms. He,

538
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
how can he be interested

539
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,320
in other women?

540
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,720
Worry or not,

541
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,800
you know it yourself.

542
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
But one thing I have to remind you,

543
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,440
you can’t cheat yourself.

544
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
And you,

545
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,240
go home.

546
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
Let me stay a while.

547
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,960
Three.

548
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,920
Two.

549
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,520
- OK, I’ll leave.
- One.

550
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
We’ve been waiting for half an hour,

551
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
is there a meeting or not?

552
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,640
Go ask his assistant.

553
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,920
OK.

554
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
Hello,

555
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,280
sorry for the waiting.

556
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,120
My boss asked me

557
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,560
to tell you that

558
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
we can’t continue to work with you

559
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
in the Moon Bay project.

560
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,680
So there is no necessity

561
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
to hold the meeting today.

562
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,000
Sorry guys,

563
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,000
please go back.

564
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
Are you kidding me?

565
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,880
We’ve signed a contract.

566
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,280
We’ve terminated the contract unilaterally,

567
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,720
we’re willing to pay the default fee.

568
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
Please understand.

569
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,080
Who are you?

570
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
Where is Mr. Qi?

571
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,360
Ask him to explain it to us.

572
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
Mr. Qi has been transferred.

573
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
Dasheng is now

574
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
under charge of Mr. Li.

575
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,840
I’m his assistant.

576
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,080
What I just said is what he told me.

577
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
I don’t care who you are,

578
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,280
but you have to make it clear.

579
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,680
You terminated the contract at this time.

580
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,840
Where can we find a new modeling company?

581
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
I want to see Mr. Li.

582
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,400
Li Zhe.

583
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
It’s you again.

584
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,560
You should have thought of it.

585
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,000
How could Dasheng want to cooperate with you,

586
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,280
you’re over confident about your design.

587
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,440
Mr. Fang,

588
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,720
how do you feel being betrayed?

589
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,920
Is it good?

590
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,160
No.

591
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,120
But I can accept that.

592
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
I’ve been working in this industry for years,

593
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,560
this is the first time I see someone unilaterally

594
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,400
terminate the contract so unreasonably.

595
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,560
Dasheng has crossed the line.

596
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
We’ve been played like a fool.

597
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,760
The last manager left the company

598
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
after signing the contract with us.

599
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,440
The new one doesn’t approve of it.

600
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
He terminated the contract by himself.

601
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,760
We’ve screwed by him.

602
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,160
If we knew this,

603
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,560
we should have raised the penalty

604
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,480
when signing the contract.

605
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,800
Ms. He.

606
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,680
I wonder

607
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,240
what’s the background of Li Zhe?

608
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,000
He…

609
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,760
Can we get someone to check on him?

610
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,120
See if there is any chance to save this project.

611
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,320
Invite him for a dinner or what.

612
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,960
No.

613
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,440
There is no chance

614
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,880
from Dasheng.

615
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,920
We should make every possible effort.

616
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
We have no time from the formal proposal.

617
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,080
If we go find a new company now

618
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,400
to sign a contract and discuss details,

619
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,720
it would be too late.

620
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,240
I said no.

621
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,720
Give up on Dasheng.

622
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Find other ways.

623
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
What other ways do we have now?

624
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,680
That’s why I asked you to think.

625
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,720
Dismiss.

626
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,960
Mr. Fang,

627
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,480
are you all right?

628
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
I got an idea

629
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,760
to make you feel better.

630
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
Do you want to have a try?

631
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
Only if you can find

632
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
a modeling company that is better than Dasheng.

633
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I’m not

634
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,400
good at this.

635
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
But it doesn’t hurt to have a try.

636
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,720
Hey.

637
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
What are you doing?

638
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,320
Close

639
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,240
your eyes.

640
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
Have a rest.

641
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,720
I’ll give you a massage.

642
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,240
I’m venting your anger.

643
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,080
The traditional Chinese medicine says that

644
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,240
there are three acupoints

645
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,360
on the head

646
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,160
that can vent your anger.

647
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,920
Your head won’t ache after the anger is ventilated.

648
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,720
Then you will have more energy

649
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
to think what you want to do next.

650
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,960
Are you feeling better?

651
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,920
Mr. Fang?

652
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,080
It’s good.

653
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,080
You know a lot.

654
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
Skills will never be burden.

655
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,080
Mr. Fang.

656
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,080
I got something to say

657
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,440
but I don’t know should I say or not.

658
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Say it.

659
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,560
Mr. Liu and the others

660
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,160
have found several modeling companies.

661
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,840
But none of them want to work with us.

662
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,880
Their excuses are all short of time

663
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,520
or too much work at hands.

664
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,280
Not a surprise.

665
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,840
Li Zhe never does

666
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,640
anything without a plan.

667
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
Since he didn’t want me

668
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,720
to get the Moon Bay project,

669
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
he won’t just

670
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,960
talk with Dasheng.

671
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,720
If I’m right,

672
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
he must have talked with

673
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,840
the other companies too.

674
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
What’s between

675
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,040
you and Li Zhe?

676
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,280
I know,

677
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,320
it’s OK if you don’t want to tell me.

678
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,240
But,

679
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
we have to figure out

680
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
what’s his purpose this time.

681
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,600
How about you meet

682
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,280
and talk with him?

683
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
At least we will know what he is up to.

684
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
No need.

685
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,720
I know what he is up to.

686
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,960
You know?

687
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,680
Since you know,

688
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
it would be easy.

689
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,960
I won’t give him what he wants.

690
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,720
I didn’t ask you to.

691
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,040
I mean,

692
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
you can

693
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
pretend to accept his terms first.

694
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,600
What do you mean pretend?

695
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,440
Are you asking me

696
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,960
to lie to him?

697
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,040
It’s not lying.

698
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,280
It’s…

699
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,560
This is lying.

700
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,280
Xu Yiren,

701
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,560
don’t you forget

702
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,720
what’s the first rule of being my assistant?

703
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,720
I know.

704
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,000
But this is a special situation.

705
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Not to mention

706
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,680
how many nights you spent for this project.

707
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
But Ms. He,

708
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,400
she went to hospital

709
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,760
for this.

710
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,880
And Mr. Liu, Ziyang and Xiang Wei,

711
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
they worked day and night.

712
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,640
Since we lost Huaxing’s project,

713
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,520
everyone saved their energy

714
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,320
to get Moon Bay

715
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,800
and they planned to celebrate after this.

716
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,560
But now,

717
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,440
maybe their efforts won’t be in vain

718
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,840
with only your words.

719
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Xu Yiren,

720
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,760
I can pretend I didn’t hear what you just said,

721
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
but don’t you ever

722
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,960
challenge my bottom line again.

723
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,760
But Mr. Fang…

724
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Get out.

725
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,440
You’re here, Yuwen.

726
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,480
I ordered your favorite coffee.

727
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,080
You knew Mr. Qi

728
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,760
was leaving Dasheng, did you?

729
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,400
Mr. Qi was leaving?

730
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,200
I didn’t know that.

731
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,880
Are you taking me as a fool?

732
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,400
How could it be a coincidence?

733
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
You introduced me this project

734
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,040
and we’ve signed the contract,

735
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,440
then the new manager unilaterally

736
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,120
terminated the contract.

737
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,440
Did my father ask you to do this

738
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,520
so Square & Circle won’t get this project?

739
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,320
Yuwen.

740
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
I didn’t expect you to think me like this.

741
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,640
I’m not talented as Fang Zhiyou,

742
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,680
but I have my principles.

743
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Mr. Qi is my friend.

744
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
But I didn’t know about

745
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,040
his resignation.

746
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,880
Besides,

747
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,960
if I don’t want Fang Zhiyou to get this project,

748
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
I won’t introduce it to you.

749
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
Why I bother to ask you to drink with them?

750
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,800
Sorry.

751
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,120
I was irritated.

752
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
I know you won’t do this.

753
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,600
Thanks for your trust.

754
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,520
Can you do me a favor?

755
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,440
I want some information about Li Zhe.

756
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Seems he did this to Fang Zhiyou on purpose.

757
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,960
And Fang Zhiyou seems to know about

758
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,120
why he did this.

759
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
I really don’t know

760
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
what’s good to Dasheng for what he did.

761
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,040
I’ll try my best.

762
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,400
Li Zhe.

763
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
I heard that he came back from abroad

764
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,600
and got no acquaintances in this industry,

765
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,320
never thought he can be the manager in Dasheng.

766
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Thanks.

767
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,800
Yuwen,

768
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,840
I heard

769
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,320
you went to hospital.

770
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,000
How is your…

771
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I’m fine.

772
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,280
Qiming,

773
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,920
if you got any information about Li Zhe,

774
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
let me know.

775
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,560
Bye.

776
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,840
It feels bad.

777
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
But I can take that.

778
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,240
She went to hospital

779
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,680
for this case.

780
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,840
And Mr. Liu, Ziyang and Xiang Wei,

781
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,960
they worked day and night.

782
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,720
Since we lost Huaxing’s project,

783
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,600
everyone saved their energy

784
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,480
to get Moon Bay

785
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
and they planned to celebrate after this.

786
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,600
But now,

787
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,760
maybe their efforts won’t be in vain

788
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
with only your words.

789
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,600
Today’s meeting is mainly brainstorming.

790
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,480
About Moon Bay project,

791
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,240
let’s see if there any other way

792
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,720
to perfectly present our design

793
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,080
to the customers

794
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,600
without using 3D models.

795
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
Anyone got any questions

796
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,680
or ideas,

797
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,480
let me know.

798
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,800
I’ve been designing for so many years

799
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
And haven’t tried anything

800
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,200
other than modeling.

801
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,720
I…

802
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
But,

803
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
why should we use other methods?

804
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,280
The design structure is so complicated this time.

805
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
And the difficulty of presentation is so big.

806
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,160
Except for 3D modeling,

807
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,400
it is difficult to use other methods

808
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
to perfectly present

809
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
the connection mode inside a building

810
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,560
and the stress mode.

811
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,320
I think,

812
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,120
if Dasheng is unwilling to cooperate with us,

813
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,080
we can find other modeling companies.

814
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,960
I don’t believe

815
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,280
there is no modeling company

816
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
to do this for us if we pay.

817
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,160
But it’s too late to find a new company.

818
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,280
Make a design concept map.

819
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,520
I’ll present the main design style

820
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
with watercolor painting.

821
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,280
But this time,

822
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,160
we won’t focus on

823
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,440
the details and functions,

824
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,600
but the main style concept.

825
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,200
Can…

826
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:31,920
- Can it work?
- I don’t think so.

827
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
No design company

828
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,160
has done this before.

829
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,200
Without the 3D model,

830
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,040
we couldn’t show these.

831
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
In this case,

832
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,200
we will give it up

833
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,280
and only present the most special

834
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,640
and attractive parts of the design

835
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,840
to the customer.

836
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,640
After winning over some time,

837
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,920
we’ll find the company to make the 3D model.

838
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,080
Fortunately, our design feature is

839
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,560
close to nature,

840
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,880
which is in harmony with watercolor.

841
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,080
Ok, that’s it.

842
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,000
Mr. Liu,

843
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
some special functions

844
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,400
of the theme design

845
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,720
need to be displayed,

846
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
find someone to get it done.

847
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
OK,

848
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,520
leave it to me

849
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,280
In the end,

850
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,240
thank you.

851
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Dismiss.

852
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Hi,

853
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,600
all dishes have been served,

854
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
please enjoy your meal.

855
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
I never thought you would invite me for dinner.

856
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,600
Actually,

857
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
Moon Bay Resort project

858
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
is really good.

859
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,400
I have seen Fang Zhiyou’s design.

860
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,680
It is farsighted, and it retains

861
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,120
the complete ecological environment.

862
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,360
Dasheng can also benefit from it

863
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,680
if you take part in it.

864
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
I don’t understand

865
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
why you terminated the contract.

866
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,880
Is it because of

867
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,920
your personal grievances?

868
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,640
Why don’t you go ask him?

869
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,320
Why did I do this to him?

870
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,240
I asked,

871
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
he didn’t tell me.

872
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,120
How could he tell you?

873
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,080
How could he be so shameful to tell you?

874
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,440
Can you tell me

875
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,680
what’s between the two of you?

876
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,680
Are you caring about me

877
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,480
or him?

878
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,040
My company.

879
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Oh.

880
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
There are rare employees so responsible

881
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
like you.

882
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,720
Come to Dasheng.

883
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
Are you offering me a job?

884
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,800
Whether you are serious

885
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,120
or not,

886
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,800
I’m telling you,

887
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,800
I won’t leave Square & Circle.

888
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,040
I’m here to persuade you to

889
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
continue to cooperate with Square & Circle.

890
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
Because I thought you would be

891
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,040
more rational than Fang Zhiyou.

892
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
You might as well say that I am

893
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,440
more realistic than him,

894
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
and I will give up my grievances with him

895
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,840
for the benefit of the company,

896
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,600
am I right?

897
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,160
You are right.

898
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,440
That’s who I am.

899
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,240
If it was someone else,

900
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
I can definitely do as you want.

901
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,480
But for Fang Zhiyou, it’s not gonna happen.

902
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
Laugh at me as you want.

903
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
Everything I did,

904
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,800
right or wrong,

905
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,520
is to get back what I deserve.

906
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,480
Go tell him

907
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,240
to stop trying.

908
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,360
He didn’t know I’m here.

909
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,080
I’m here for…

910
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,840
I don’t think

911
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,160
we can finish this meal.

912
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,360
I hope you come to me next time

913
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,800
because of you.

914
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,600
This meal is on me.

915
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,600
Hey.

916
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,400
Fang Zhiyou,

917
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,080
I haven’t seen you in years.

918
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,080
You’re acting

919
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,160
more like a pussy.

920
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
Li Zhe.

921
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,040
You asked Xu Yiren to talk with me,

922
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,440
did you?

923
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,160
You asked a woman to speak for you.

924
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,600
What kind of man are you?

925
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,080
Such a coward.

926
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,440
Xu Yiren.

927
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,240
What did you do yesterday?

928
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,040
Had a dinner with Li Zhe.

929
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,320
Just dinner?

930
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
We chatted over dinner.

931
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,560
I also mentioned

932
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,320
the cooperation with Dasheng.

933
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,640
Xu Yiren,

934
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,840
do you remember that

935
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,880
I said the cooperation with Dasheng is done?

936
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,280
Why do you act on your own?

937
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,560
I just want to help.

938
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,120
Help?

939
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,480
Do I need your help?

940
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
You are just my assistant,

941
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
your job is to execute orders,

942
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,960
nothing else has anything to do with you.

943
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,720
From now on,

944
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,760
I forbid you to contact the staff of Dasheng,

945
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,960
especially Li Zhe.

946
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,600
But Li Zhe is also my friend,

947
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
can’t I even meet my friend?

948
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,000
No.

949
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,240
Anyway, don’t interfere in this case anymore.

950
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
OK, fine.

951
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,320
Even if you beg me to.

952
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
What did you say?

953
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
I said.

954
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,880
OK, I got it.

955
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
Do you have anything else

956
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,040
to ask me to do?

957
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,240
If there’s nothing else,

958
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,440
I’ll leave you.
