20
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,980
Mr. Fang.

21
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,260
What are you coming for?

22
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,300
Xiang Wei and Sun Ziyang
aren’t experienced enough.

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
I’d like to help.

24
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,820
I mean, Huaxing project.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,460
I can be your assistant.

26
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,980
Okay.

27
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,260
Thank you, then.

28
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,060
Oh, by the way,

29
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,060
it’s my fault.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,220
After the Xingcheng project,

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,260
I thought

32
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,060
you don’t trust me like you did before.

33
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,780
Well, we’re close.

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,620
If you have any problem,

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
you can tell me directly.

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,460
You don’t need to make Xu Yiren

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
pass the message.

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,700
Xu Yiren?

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,740
That’s all.

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,620
I should have asked him not to say that.

41
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,300
Liu Tianyang.

42
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,020
He sold me out so easily.

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,780
Xu Yiren.

44
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,780
Oh.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,100
Screwed.

46
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,500
Is he going to fire me again?

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,700
I just got one month’s salary.

48
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,620
What did I say wrong?

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,220
What are you looking at?

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,380
You don’t have work?

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,780
Oh.

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,100
Mr. Fang.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,340
I... I...

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,980
Sort out the file.

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,500
I’ll use it for the meeting this afternoon.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,860
Okay.

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,660
Leave me.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,020
Oh.

59
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,500
What happened?

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,060
Don’t ask.

61
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Mr. Liu.

62
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,220
Could you help me check this part?

63
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,140
I wonder

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,260
if we can do like this.

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
Xu Yiren.

66
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,940
This part matters

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,420
more than what you just said.

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,060
Mr. Fang.

69
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,740
I’m leaving then.

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,220
Mr. Fang.

71
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,860
I’ll work overtime tonight.

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,860
Order a takeout for me.

73
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,060
Oh.

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,340
Okay. Okay.

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,340
I’m going right away.

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,180
No way.

77
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,020
If it continues,

78
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,780
I’ll have a mental breakdown.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,060
I must get in and apologize to him.

80
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,740
Mr. Fang?

81
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,660
Mr. Fang?

82
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,220
When he’s asleep,

83
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,580
he looks cute.

84
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
But why is he so annoying

85
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,820
when he’s awake?

86
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,220
He isn’t adorable at all.

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,940
I’m fine.

88
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,500
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,220
I’ll put them back together.

90
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,140
Don’t touch them.

91
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,860
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,420
I’ll put them back together.

93
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,540
Xu Yiren.

94
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,860
Don’t fire me.

95
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,820
All right.

96
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,820
You can leave.

97
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,820
Let me put them back with you.

98
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,220
You?

99
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,380
I can help, at least.

100
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,140
We’ll do it faster.

101
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,100
I never make models with anyone else.

102
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,660
Are you sure

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,660
you won’t do a disservice?

104
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,060
I’m not confident in other things.

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,980
But this model...

106
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,460
Let me try and see.

107
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,940
Don’t break it.

108
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,020
Here is...

109
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,060
I know.

110
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,900
This is

111
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,540
a platform.

112
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,140
It should be put here.

113
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,300
You only took a look at my model

114
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,660
and you know its structure?

115
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,740
I viewed it many more times.

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I guess

117
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,460
you are

118
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,340
making a model

119
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,980
according to the castle design.

120
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,460
Well, I saw many of your designs.

121
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,140
I fail to understand some parts,

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,180
but I find them beautiful.

123
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,180
Especially this castle.

124
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,580
Fantastic.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,580
It’s different from

126
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,420
your other designs.

127
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,140
So, I took a few more looks.

128
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,020
= File of Xu Yiren =

129
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,180
Xu Yiren?

130
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,260
Fang Zhiyou’s assistant?

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,020
No. No.

132
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,700
Stubborn as Fang Zhiyou is,

133
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,820
Xu Yiren can’t be

134
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,220
a mere assistant.

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,540
But this is

136
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,500
all I can get.

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
Her life can be concluded in a piece of paper.

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,180
That’s so simple.

139
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,780
But sometimes,

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,340
it’s harder to see through a simple person.

141
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,140
Just keep an eye on

142
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,460
Qingshan project.

143
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,580
Got it.

144
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
Finally, it’s done.

145
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Work is done more easily when people cooperate.

146
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,860
It’s faster than you do it alone, isn’t it?

147
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
What?

148
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,340
Did I...

149
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,580
Did I do something wrong?

150
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,540
But I remember its shape.

151
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,940
Have you learnt to make models?

152
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,060
No.

153
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,220
Do we need to learn?

154
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,100
When I was little,

155
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,500
I didn’t have toys.

156
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,580
When my classmate had a toy,

157
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,340
I would make the same one

158
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,620
according to his.

159
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,100
I feel

160
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,900
it looks nearly the same.

161
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,980
I’m not lying.

162
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,660
Forget it.

163
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,620
A rich man like you

164
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,620
can’t experience it.

165
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
When I was little, I didn’t have a friend either.

166
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,420
Really?

167
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,980
Oh, you don’t lie.

168
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,140
That’s true?

169
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,060
I didn’t like to communicate or talk much

170
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
when I was little.

171
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,380
My classmates didn’t want to play with me, either.

172
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,940
That was why I chose to paint.

173
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,340
When I was painting,

174
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,300
I could stay alone.

175
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,340
Well,

176
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
you were poor, too.

177
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,500
Poor?

178
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,180
I don’t think so.

179
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,060
I enjoy staying alone.

180
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,100
Socializing brings only endless noise

181
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,940
and unavoidable hypocritical senses.

182
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,860
I don’t need either of them.

183
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,540
I don’t quite agree.

184
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,660
Everyone needs friends.

185
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,380
When you’re happy,

186
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,900
they share happiness with you.

187
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,380
When you’re sad,

188
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,660
they share your sorrow, too.

189
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,620
I can’t imagine

190
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
what a life I would be living

191
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,220
without Xia Di.

192
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,420
Like you said,

193
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,460
staying with your friend

194
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,500
when you were at school

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,260
was the happiest time you’ve had.

196
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,100
Well, it’s obvious.

197
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
“I have a friend” story

198
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,020
is your own story.

199
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,340
I’m not very smart.

200
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
But I’m not stupid, either.

201
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,380
Really?

202
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,580
I doubt that.

203
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,700
But...

204
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,620
I can see

205
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,740
he must be your close friend.

206
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,180
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have taken care
of his father.

207
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,940
But I remember.

208
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,700
You told me

209
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,900
you lost contact when he went abroad.

210
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,620
Why didn’t you contact each other?

211
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,300
There wasn’t a reason.

212
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,020
I suddenly feel so tired.

213
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,820
Yeah.

214
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,020
It’s a world for young men.

215
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,700
Yes.

216
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,460
I’m glad they have thoughts and views.

217
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,380
But speaking of
experience and overall perspective,

218
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,380
they still need us

219
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,740
for some advice.

220
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,180
Hmm.

221
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
Wen.

222
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,180
Why didn’t you tell me before you came back?

223
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,980
I could have made your favorite dishes.

224
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,020
Mom, I had dinner already.

225
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,380
Come and sit down.

226
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,180
Mr. Huang.

227
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
I’ll go get you the chopsticks.

228
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,060
Deal, then.

229
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,660
See you in the club at three tomorrow afternoon.

230
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,620
Let’s meet and talk.

231
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,980
See you.

232
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,580
Come. Have some of the dishes.

233
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,980
You’re back?

234
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
I’m glad you’re back.

235
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,540
Mr. Huang from Huaxing, huh?

236
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,540
Head of the movie world project?

237
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,860
So what?

238
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,500
Dad.

239
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,780
For once.

240
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,460
Just for only once.

241
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,940
Couldn’t you have a fair competition

242
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
with your own ability?

243
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,700
Why must you do such stealthy tricks?

244
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,500
For Huaxing project,

245
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,260
we’ll go for the bidding, too.

246
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,980
I hope we’ll have a fair competition.

247
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
Fair competition?

248
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,540
Tell me.

249
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,220
What is a fair competition?

250
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,940
Does a mere design

251
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,380
decide the success or failure of a project?

252
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,500
Or do you think a big company like Huaxing

253
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,860
only chooses a partner

254
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,820
according to his talent?

255
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,620
Yes.

256
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,620
Fang Zhiyou is talented.

257
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,300
He’s the best student

258
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,460
I’ve taught over the past ten years.

259
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,220
But how does that help?

260
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,220
You know his problem best.

261
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,260
His attitude of living

262
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,500
will never help him succeed

263
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,500
in this industry.

264
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Talk to our daughter gently.

265
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Why are you yelling?

266
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,860
I just want to wake her up.

267
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,380
Or her life will be ruined.

268
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,100
It seems I shouldn’t have come back.

269
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,460
Wen.

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,500
Even if my life is ruined,

271
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,060
I ruin it myself.

272
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,660
It’s better than

273
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,420
being your puppet all my life.

274
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,340
Wen.

275
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,900
Let her go.

276
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:20,940
You...

277
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,860
She’s grown up, but still unreasonable.

278
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,660
She’ll regret it sooner or later.

279
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,500
It’s late.

280
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,980
Go back home for some rest.

281
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,620
Mr. Fang.

282
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,980
I’ve atoned for my mistake.

283
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,420
Give me another chance and don’t fire me, okay?

284
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,580
So, you felt uneasy

285
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,740
the whole day

286
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,740
and helped me make the model

287
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,140
because you feared to be fired
because of Liu Tianyang?

288
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,780
You have the last chance.

289
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,060
If you lie again,

290
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,260
I’ll fire you.

291
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,780
Okay.

292
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,980
You lied to Liu Tianyang that

293
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,340
I asked you

294
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,580
to tell him to help me willingly?

295
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,620
Yes.

296
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,020
It was your own decision, wasn’t it?

297
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,580
Yes.

298
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,820
You know I hate lies most.

299
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,220
Why did you do that?

300
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,060
I know

301
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,380
you might be angry.

302
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,580
But you wanted to give him a chance.

303
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,300
And he wanted this chance, too.

304
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,940
But you both are face-saving.

305
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,140
So, I thought

306
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,780
if I sacrificed a little

307
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,500
and gave you a happy ending

308
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,060
where no one was hurt,

309
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,300
it would be

310
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,820
worthwhile

311
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,340
and quite necessary.

312
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,220
What do you think?

313
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,980
Sure.

314
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,380
No one will be hurt.

315
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,580
I mean,

316
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,420
no one will be fired,

317
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,740
or something like that.

318
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,580
Just for this once.

319
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,900
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

320
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,460
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

321
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,180
I didn’t see him when I woke up.

322
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh, he’s at the back of his office.

323
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,820
He quite enjoys his life.

324
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,620
When I take a closer look,

325
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
he’s handsome

326
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,180
with fine features.

327
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,820
Dare you come closer?

328
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,300
Mr. Fang, I...

329
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,900
Hush.

330
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,020
What’s the time now?

331
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,140
Dock your pay if you’re late.

332
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,780
Oh.

333
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,060
The hand cream works so well.

334
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,180
What happened?

335
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,660
What did I do to my boss?

336
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,460
I’m screwed.

337
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,020
= Unknown Number =

338
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,140
Hello?

339
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,980
Hello?

340
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,620
Is that Miss Xu Yiren?

341
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,500
I don’t have money.

342
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,140
I don’t want gym cards or loans.

343
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,900
Did you lose something?

344
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,100
I lost face.

345
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,380
Did you pick it up?

346
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,020
Xu Yiren, 25 years old.

347
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,980
You work in Square & Circle.

348
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,540
Do I need to continue?

349
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,940
Here is the thing.

350
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
I picked up your purse.

351
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,140
Your ID card and bank cards are in it.

352
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,660
That’s why I’m calling you.

353
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,580
Yeah, I lost my purse.

354
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,060
Shall we meet?

355
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,700
I’ll give back your purse.

356
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,620
Okay.

357
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,900
Thank you.

358
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,340
I’ll wait for you in the Japanese restaurant.

359
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,060
All right?

360
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,580
Hmm, okay.

361
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,100
See if there’s anything missing.

362
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,020
No need.

363
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Let me introduce myself.

364
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,060
I’m Li Zhe.

365
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,380
I’m Xu Yiren.

366
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,420
I know.

367
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,380
You work in a design company,

368
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,900
don’t you?

369
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,660
Hmm.

370
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,780
But I don’t think

371
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,220
you look like a girl working on architecture.

372
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,380
Are you looking down on me?

373
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,060
No. No.

374
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,540
Because few beautiful girls

375
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,740
work in our industry.

376
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
I haven’t met a girl

377
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,060
as beautiful as you before.

378
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,260
There’re many beautiful girls in our company.

379
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,100
If you say so,

380
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,860
I really want to work in your company.

381
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,580
Come, then.

382
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,380
My boss has bad temper.

383
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,820
But he’s very capable.

384
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
You will have a bright career
if you come to our company.

385
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,460
Your boss is Fang Zhiyou,

386
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
isn’t he?

387
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,460
Do you know him?

388
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,380
This is not a very big industry.

389
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,820
It’s not weird to know him.

390
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,620
But I heard he has bad temper.

391
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,100
It must be tiring to be his subordinate.

392
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,060
Not really.

393
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,380
It’s just a rumor.

394
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,100
It seems it’s a wrong rumor.

395
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,580
I can see that

396
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,060
you’re a very loyal subordinate.

397
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
With you around,

398
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,020
he’ll feel happy.

399
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,820
In fact,

400
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,100
my boss

401
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,540
isn’t an excellent superior.

402
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,180
But he’s an honest man.

403
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,660
And he’s affectionate.

404
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,940
Oh.

405
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:12,940
Come on.

406
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,540
Why do you take me here?

407
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,100
It’s been long since you last did sports.

408
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,140
You always stay in the office.

409
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
You’ll go bad.

410
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,700
However important work is,

411
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,340
you must alternate work with rest, got it?

412
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Didn’t you watch the news?

413
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,020
Another employee had a sudden death lately.

414
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,900
So, for your health,

415
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,860
get your mind off things.

416
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,100
One hour only.

417
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,340
I have a meeting this afternoon.

418
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,420
Enough. Let’s go.

419
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,540
Mr. Huang?

420
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,500
What a coincidence!

421
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,340
You?

422
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,540
You...

423
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,500
You also play golf?

424
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,420
We don’t exactly know how to play it.

425
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,700
Would you like to teach us?

426
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,380
Sorry.

427
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,300
Mr. Huang had an appointment with me.

428
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,060
Mr. He.

429
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,580
You had an appointment

430
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,780
with your daughter?

431
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,620
No.

432
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,220
I didn’t know my father
had an appointment with you.

433
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,020
Since we met,

434
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,580
why don’t we play golf together?

435
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,340
All right.

436
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,900
The more, the merrier.

437
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,420
Mr. Fang doesn’t like to be merrier.

438
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,980
We’d better play alone.

439
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,540
Dad.

440
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,660
Are you afraid to lose to Fang Zhiyou?

441
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,660
I’m afraid he’ll be sad when losing the game.

442
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,780
We don’t know who will win

443
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,780
unless we compete.

444
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,740
I’ll go get changed.

445
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,500
Mr. Huang.

446
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,860
That was a brilliant move.

447
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,980
You’re just far in excess of

448
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,020
my dad and Fang Zhiyou.

449
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,260
The game isn’t over yet.

450
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,700
It’s hard to tell

451
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,180
who will win.

452
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,220
Yes.

453
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,860
I’m the one who taught you to play golf, huh?

454
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,180
I told you.

455
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,460
Playing golf is just like designing.

456
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,780
Technology alone will not work.

457
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,780
Superb technology and mental toughness

458
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,980
are both integral.

459
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
Sometimes,

460
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,740
you still need a little luck.

461
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,900
It’s been years.

462
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,020
And you have never changed.

463
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,060
You still like to teach others.

464
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,980
See?

465
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,820
That shows your mental deficiency.

466
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,340
Before you play,

467
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,940
you’re short of confidence.

468
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,020
I’m sure I’ll win.

469
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,700
Why don’t you give in,

470
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,820
in case you lose face later?

471
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,860
I’m young enough.

472
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,980
I can afford any loss,

473
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,900
unlike you.

474
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,460
Mr. Huang.

475
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,380
That’s a real match-fixing.

476
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,460
Mr. He.

477
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,300
You’ve got a chance.

478
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,220
But let’s make a deal first.

479
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,540
When you win, you’ll buy us dinner.

480
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,100
We don’t know the result yet.

481
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,740
I’ll try.

482
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,180
I’m doomed.

483
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,940
I had thought I would win.

484
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,980
It seems that

485
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,940
you’ll buy us dinner,

486
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,980
Mr. Huang.

487
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,420
Fang Zhiyou.

488
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,700
Mr. Fang.

489
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,900
You really had good luck.

490
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,100
Mr. Huang.

491
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,980
Shall we have another game?

492
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,780
Mr. Huang.

493
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,180
For Huaxing project,

494
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,180
we’ll strive for it.

495
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,780
Welcome to compete with us in the project.

496
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,180
Excuse me.

497
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,340
Mr. Huang, sorry.

498
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,500
Fang Zhiyou.

499
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,180
Zhiyou.

500
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,340
Zhiyou.

501
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,980
You can’t just leave.

502
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,060
What will Mr. Huang think of us?

503
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
When you did the trick behind me,

504
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,540
why didn’t you ask me what I thought of?

505
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,220
I didn’t leave immediately,

506
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,100
for your sake already.

507
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,940
I knew you would be angry with me.

508
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,380
Curse me as far as you want.

509
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,620
But we can’t just

510
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,700
lose Huaxing project.

511
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,020
I know what I should do with the project.

512
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I’m confident to get their approval.

513
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,420
with the design proposal.

514
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,340
You know what decides the success of a project.

515
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,540
It’s...

516
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,260
I know.

517
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,300
But I won’t spend time or energy

518
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,660
on such tricks.

519
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,860
Could you not be so stubborn?

520
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,580
Actually,

521
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,820
you just disdain to socialize with others.

522
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,060
What’s shameful about getting on well with clients?

523
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,980
If we want to defeat my dad,

524
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,180
we must have Huaxing’s people treat us fairly.

525
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,100
I only want them to be fair to my design.

526
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,020
Zhiyou.

527
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,380
I really don’t want to quarrel with you.

528
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,780
I just want you to see through the truth.

529
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,140
My dad enjoys high prestige in this industry.

530
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,340
He’s also our biggest competitor.

531
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,300
But you saw it.

532
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,540
He lost the game to make Mr. Huang happy.

533
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,980
But I don’t want to be He Yuliang.

534
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,140
Fang Zhiyou.

535
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,900
You really bought them?

536
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,020
Tickets for the premiere!

537
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,060
I failed to buy one on the Internet.

538
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,380
It means I can help more than the Internet.

539
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,620
There’s still time.

540
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,980
Why don’t we have something to eat?

541
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,420
Hmm.

542
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,300
= Thanos Fang =
Wait a minute.

543
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,140
Mr. Fang.

544
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,780
Where are you now?

545
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,580
Me?

546
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,380
I’m doing some shopping with a friend.

547
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,660
You have fifteen minutes.

548
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,820
Come to me right away.

549
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,140
Now?

550
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,420
Yes.

551
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,740
Right away. Right now.

552
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,260
Hello?

553
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,660
Hello?

554
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,580
What?

555
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,820
Your boss called?

556
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,340
He asked me to meet him right away.

557
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,980
I don’t think I can enjoy the premiere with you.

558
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,060
It’s okay. It’s what bosses always do.

559
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,940
He called you so urgently.

560
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,020
There must be something urgent.

561
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,020
Go ahead.

562
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
I’m terribly sorry.

563
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,940
It’s okay.

564
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,220
We can enjoy the film next time.

565
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,780
Next time,

566
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
I’ll buy the tickets.

567
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,420
Hmm.

568
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,540
I’m leaving then.

569
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,500
Hello, sir.

570
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,140
How can I help you?

571
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,940
I’ll just look around.

572
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,340
I don’t need any help now.

573
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,460
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

574
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,660
Xu Yiren, pick one.

575
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,020
You asked me here,

576
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,380
to do shopping with you?

577
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,820
Tell me.

578
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,340
Which client are you picking the bag for?

579
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,100
I want you to give me some advice.

580
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,980
Pick one.

581
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,620
A man or women? How old?

582
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,100
A woman. In her twenties.

583
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,940
What’s her style?

584
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,780
Is she a sweet young girl or mature office girl?

585
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,340
Neither.

586
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
What...

587
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,100
What does she like?

588
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,660
She likes to talk back.

589
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,780
She likes to gossip behind others.

590
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,300
She also likes to nickname others.

591
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,300
Rebelling style, then.

592
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,700
What’s her taste?

593
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,860
She doesn’t have a good taste.

594
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,420
She always dresses herself
like a middle-aged lady.

595
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,300
She has a bad figure and bad taste.

596
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,180
She doesn’t have any sense of fashion.

597
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
What a poor girl!

598
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,260
She sounds so bad in your mouth.

599
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,780
What about this one?

600
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,180
It’s a simple style.

601
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,460
It won’t go wrong as a gift.

602
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,700
Do you like it?

603
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,340
It doesn’t matter if I like it.

604
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,260
It matters if the girl likes it.

605
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,300
That’s why I’m asking you.

606
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,940
Do you like it?

607
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,900
It’s for me?

608
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,780
You lost your purse during work that day.

609
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,700
I’m buying one for you.

610
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,820
Mr. Fang, I forgot to tell you.

611
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,740
I found my purse.

612
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,620
A kind man picked it up and gave it back.

613
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,460
If you don’t like it, pick another one.

614
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,820
Are you okay?

615
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,300
No.

616
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,020
I’m sad.

617
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,940
I need to relieve anxiety.

618
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,340
You go shopping

619
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,340
to relieve anxiety?

620
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,340
Why do you have so many questions?

621
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,100
So, what you just said...

622
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
Bad figure and bad taste.

623
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,420
That’s me?

624
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,740
Am I wrong?

625
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,300
Waitress.

626
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,660
Get me the most expensive purse in your shop.

627
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,380
Is he mad?

628
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
He really bought it.

629
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,300
You picked the most expensive one, didn’t you?

630
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,220
I was angry, so...

631
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,620
Do you know what you look like now?

632
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,020
What?

633
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,180
You’re just like a Mary Su in my comic.

634
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,940
Why did he buy me

635
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
such an expensive gift?

636
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,220
I get whatever I want.

637
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,020
He’s going too far.

638
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Annoying.

639
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,540
I’m truly anxious.

640
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,700
Tell me.

641
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,020
It’s such an expensive purse.

642
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,060
Shall I accept it or not?

643
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,700
No way.

644
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,980
I must give it back to him tomorrow.

645
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,100
Why are you

646
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,380
changing so quickly?

647
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,180
You were worried about work and rent
the other day.

648
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,980
Now, you don’t know which purse to choose.

649
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,340
I really feel relieved for you.

650
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,620
Annoying.

651
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,820
You know what?

652
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,940
After you break up with Gao Ming, the jerk,

653
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,340
you’ve got such good luck in love.

654
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,940
A cool boss.

655
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,580
A handsome man.

656
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,020
What are you talking about?

657
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,260
The handsome man picked up your purse.

658
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,380
The cool boss bought you a new purse.

659
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,140
If I draw the stories in my comic,

660
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,860
a lot of girls will be jealous.

661
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,020
You know what?

662
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,660
Fang Zhiyou must have a crush on you.

663
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,260
What are you talking about?

664
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,460
Trust me.

665
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,060
When you can’t stop someone

666
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
from spending money for you,

667
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,020
he must have a crush on you.

668
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,500
And he’s a rich man.

669
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,380
Such relationship between

670
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,940
a boss and his subordinate is worthwhile.

671
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,740
Come on!

672
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,900
Are you losing your mind

673
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,140
because you have trouble drawing comics?

674
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Fang Zhiyou and me?

675
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,140
How is that possible?

676
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,660
Keep denying.

677
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,580
Who am I?

678
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Miss Xia Di.

679
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,180
Expert in girls’ love.

680
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Wait to have a slap in your face.

681
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,020
That’s not going to happen.

682
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,940
Give up.

683
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,540
I won’t argue with you.

684
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,100
Come on.

685
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,620
Top-brand purse girl.

686
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,940
My comic with Fang Zhiyou as the prototype

687
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
will be published on COMICS soon.

688
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,460
But I still need some stories.

689
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,580
Help me to study on him,

690
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,900
his behaviors,

691
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,140
hobbies or something.

692
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,620
Help me collect some material.

693
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,540
Do you hear me?

694
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,100
You want me to be your spy?

695
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,500
I won’t do that.

696
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,140
Objection overruled.

697
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,100
I always support your living.

698
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,220
And you don’t help me with this?

699
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,740
Don’t forget.

700
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,420
I know everything about you.

701
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,900
You wetted the bed at Grade Three.

702
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,940
And you knitted a sweater for the jerk.

703
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,900
Be careful, or I’ll use you as the prototype.

704
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,980
I’ll even use your real name.

705
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,500
You won’t.

706
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,460
Try me.

707
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,340
Humph. Annoying.

708
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,460
You always bully me.

709
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,100
Wait and see.

710
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,580
So, it is the movie world.

711
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,700
To build a theme park for Huaxing,

712
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,700
we’d better do an on-the-spot investigation,

713
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,460
so that we can predict what our client needs.

714
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,260
Got it.

715
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,980
Shall we also

716
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,620
experience sightseeing items

717
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,820
in this place?

718
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,540
Isn’t it the train station

719
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,860
in the hot spy drama a few days ago?

720
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,700
We come to work.

721
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,580
Oh.

722
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,980
Help me to study on him,

723
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,700
his behaviors,

724
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,940
hobbies or something.

725
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,900
First,

726
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,820
he has obsession at work.

727
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,580
He takes all kinds of tools with him.

728
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,900
He uses the old-style camera instead of a phone.

729
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,420
You’d better take photos of

730
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,540
their landmarks.

731
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,340
Oh.

732
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,540
For example,

733
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,060
where there are the most visitors

734
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,140
is the most popular.

735
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,820
For another example,

736
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,100
you should record characteristics of main visitors.

737
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,340
Second,

738
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,220
he likes to sketch

739
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,620
and record his inspirations.

740
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,500
By the way,

741
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,580
you should take photos of the main structures.

742
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,740
Got it?

743
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,100
Oh, yes.

744
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,260
What are you murmuring?

745
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,780
Nothing.

746
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,380
Third...

747
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,740
Fang Zhiyou

748
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,260
may have the sixth sense.

749
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,620
All right.

750
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,900
It’s your turn to take photos.

751
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,500
Oh, okay.

752
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,060
Give it to me.

753
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,420
Everyone should protect animals. Have a look.

754
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,260
Everyone should protect animals. Have a look.

755
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,540
Everyone should protect animals. Have a look.

756
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,660
Everyone should protect animals. Have a look.

757
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,300
Shiyu?

758
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,740
Yiren?

759
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,420
Why are you here?

760
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,140
I’m handing out leaflets.

761
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,860
Fang Shiyu.

762
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,300
Why are you skipping classes again?

763
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,820
I’m not.

764
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,700
This is a practical activity of our school.

765
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,820
I spent the whole day, but haven’t finished yet.

766
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,060
You’re handing out leaflets,

767
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,100
alone?

768
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,540
You’ll help me.

769
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,380
My classmate stood me up.

770
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,060
I’m afraid I can’t finish it today.

771
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,740
Hurry.

772
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:22,386
Come on.

773
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,420
What are you doing?

774
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,340
Get changed.

775
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,340
Get changed?

776
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:26,940
This one.

777
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,580
I can help to hand out leaflets.

778
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,220
But forget the costume.

779
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
You don’t like this one?

780
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,620
I’ve got this one,

781
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,580
this one,

782
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,500
and this.

783
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,500
Pick whatever you like.

784
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,580
Well...

785
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,260
I’ll just pick this one.

786
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,740
What are you laughing at? This is yours.

787
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,620
Your boss has got changed.

788
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,180
What about you?

789
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,020
= Care for Life Protect Wild Animals =
Yiren, are you ready?

790
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,340
Yes.

791
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,900
I’m coming out.

792
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,340
Hmm.

793
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,900
You look gorgeous.

794
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,580
Turn around.

795
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:07,780
Uh...

796
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,340
The skirt is too short.

797
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,580
It looks great.

798
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,180
Look at me.

799
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,140
Am I wearing it correctly?

800
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,980
Mr. Fang, your gloves...

801
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,900
What?

802
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,300
They look good.

803
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,220
You look gorgeous

804
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,060
in this costume.

805
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,700
What are you looking at?

806
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Your eyes are popping out.

807
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,420
Get to work.

808
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,260
Go.

809
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
-Hello.
-Everyone should protect animals.

810
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,340
-Protect endangered animals.
-Have a look.

811
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,660
Look at him. Look.

812
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,860
What a lovely panda!

813
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,300
-Can I take a photo?
-Can I take a photo with you?

814
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,020
Doomed.

815
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,380
They must be treating Mr. Fang...

816
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,260
-Could you take a photo for us?
-as a staff member.

817
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,340
Thank you.

818
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,460
Such a girlish post.

819
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,540
I’m doomed.

820
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,060
He’s going to get mad.

821
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,300
Thank you. Thank you.

822
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:00,940
Go.

823
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,020
Hello.

824
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Everyone should protect animals.

825
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,700
Have a look.

826
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,636
♪ My love for you is like marshmallow ♪

827
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,030
♪ Bite it and it feels sweet ♪

828
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,220
What? Why do you always look at me?

829
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,780
I wonder what magic this costume has

830
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,020
to change you greatly.

831
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,820
Magic?

832
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:32,133
♪ Don’t suspect my faith ♪

833
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,940
This one is blurry.

834
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,860
Take another photo.

835
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,500
Stand closer.

836
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,660
Brother.

837
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
Look what a perfect match you and Yiren make.

838
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,460
I don’t see that.

839
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,500
Then I’m sure you haven’t found out that

840
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,100
Yiren likes you.

841
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,460
What are you talking about, little girl?

842
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,460
Look.

843
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,660
I’ve been observing her the whole day.

844
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,300
Look.

845
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,380
Wasn’t she peeping at you?

846
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,180
Wasn’t she?

847
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,780
And she blushed.

848
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,460
Look.

849
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,860
Are you having too little homework?

850
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,980
You must have plenty of time, huh?

851
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,660
At the next parents’ meeting,

852
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,060
I’ll tell your headmaster about it.

853
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,300
Believe it or not, I don’t care.

854
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,300
It’s rare when people like each other.

855
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,020
Cherish her.

856
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,180
Here I am.

857
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,740
You must be waiting for long.

858
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,260
The line was long.

859
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,140
We’re not in a hurry.

860
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,660
Take it.

861
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,540
Oh, brother.

862
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Lend me a hundred yuan.

863
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,580
What for?

864
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,140
My classmate and I are going to see a film.

865
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,180
Take your own chance.

866
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,580
By the way,

867
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,380
drive Yiren home safely.

868
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,140
She’s having a hard time working for you.

869
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,940
Give her more bonus.

870
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,620
Your sister is so sensible,

871
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,460
especially in terms of reward and punishment.

872
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,700
We should hire her

873
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,100
as our CFO.

874
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,740
If she were our CFO,

875
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,500
my company would have gone bankrupt
a million times.

876
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,380
What are you laughing at?

877
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,300
Mr. Fang.

878
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Where are we going?

879
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,740
To see an exhibition.

880
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,140
= Honey Xia =

881
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,700
Yiren.

882
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,420
What kind of girl does your Thanos boss like?

883
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,900
How do I know?

884
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,900
Ask him.

885
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,380
Hurry.

886
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,940
Then I’m sure you haven’t found out that

887
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,580
