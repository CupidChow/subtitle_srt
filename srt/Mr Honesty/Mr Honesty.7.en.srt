20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Brother,

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,440
please let Yiren come back.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
She indeed made a mistake.

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,560
But you can dock her pay,

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,600
cut her bonus,

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,840
or even fine her.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
You don’t have to fire her, right?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,280
Gu Bo,

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,600
when your father invested in Square ＆ Circle,

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,040
we agreed that

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
he’ll never interfere with the company’s operation,

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
or my decisions.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Didn’t he tell you?

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,960
I know.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
But I’m not interfering with your decisions.

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,600
I’m discussing it with you.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
Just mind your own business.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,760
Your father wanted you to study abroad,

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,480
but you wanted to work as an intern here.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,640
Now you’re here,

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,320
you should focus on work

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
and learn from your colleagues.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
Don’t worry about other things.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
It’s not like that.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,640
But...

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
I promised Xia Di.

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
So you did this for Xia Di?

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,280
Does your father know that

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
you put aside your work

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
to chase a girl?

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Can you please not mention my father?

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,560
I admired you very much back then.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
That’s why I persuaded my father

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
to invest in your company.

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
If you regret it now,

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,520
go ask your father to withdraw his investment.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,920
That’s not what I meant.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Why are you so stubborn?

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
Right.

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
Xu Yiren indeed made a mistake.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
But haven’t you ever made a mistake?

61
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,160
She actually regrets it very much.

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
You know what?

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
She spent several days

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
making a model

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,440
of the main buildings,

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
so that she can take it to Mr. Huang

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,240
and ask him to take a look at your design.

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,000
She’s trying her best to make up for it.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Can’t you give her another chance?

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
Not all mistakes

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
can be corrected.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
No! What should I do?

73
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,320
How can I explain to Xia Di?

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Sha Sha.

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Yiren,

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,000
how are you doing?

77
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,280
I...

78
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,320
I’m good.

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Thank you for calling me.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,760
Oops.

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,480
I’m sorry.

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,640
What happened, Yiren?

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Nothing.

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,880
Someone bumped into me.

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
Where are you?

86
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,560
I’m at the gate of Huaxing’s office building.

87
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,120
Our company

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,280
lost the project because of me.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
So,

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,320
I’m waiting for Mr. Huang here,

91
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,080
and see if he can give us another chance.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
You’ve left the company.

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Why bother doing this?

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,680
I caused the trouble.

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
Of course I should make up for it.

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,680
Whether I’m there or not,

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
I have to do this.

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh, right.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
I heard you became Mr. Fang’s assistant.

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
No. No.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,440
Ms. He is trying to recruit a new assistant.

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,560
I’m just doing this temporarily.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,240
Don’t be so tense.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,720
I want to give you a few reminders.

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,040
Mr. Fang

106
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
is a very difficult person.

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,480
But if you’re considerate enough,

108
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
you can get along well with him easily.

109
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
Remember,

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,080
every morning

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,880
at 8:50,

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
make a Caramel Americano for him.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,760
Because

114
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,400
he’ll arrive at the company

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
at 9:00 every morning,

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
and then, he’ll have a cup of coffee.

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,280
The coffee will get cold if you make it too early.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,240
But he’ll get angry if you make it too late.

119
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,360
Remember

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
not to add milk.

121
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,040
This is what you need to do before 9:00.

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,680
You must be careful.

123
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
Don’t make any mistake.

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,000
After 9:00,

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,760
the first thing

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
is to confirm his schedules for the day.

127
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
He prefers to have everything planned in advance.

128
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
We’ll visit Mr. Shang and his wife at 11 o’clock,

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
and then go to the hospital at 12 o’clock.

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
In the afternoon,

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,080
we’ll go to the construction site.

132
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Please take a look.

133
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
Everything can be rescheduled

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
except the appointment at the hospital.

135
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,840
Besides,

136
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
you have to remind him

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,240
to take a break every two or three hours.

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,080
Normally he won’t listen to you.

139
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
So you need to come up with something

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
and go to ask for his approval,

141
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
so that he can take a break passively.

142
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Mr. Fang,

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
um...

144
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,560
what would you like to eat for dinner?

145
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Same as yesterday.

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,840
A new restaurant opened near the company.

147
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,600
The food is delicious.

148
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
Would you like to try it?

149
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,760
It’s fine to drink 3 cups of coffee a day.

150
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
If he wants more,

151
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,640
you should ask him to drink tea.

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,560
I’m sorry.

153
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Did I say too much?

154
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Now you’re his assistant.

155
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
No, no.

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Not at all.

157
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,640
Thank you, Yiren.

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,000
No need.

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,240
I’ll sort it out

160
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
and send you a copy another day.

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,960
OK.

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,680
I have to go now.

163
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
I still have something to do.

164
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,320
I’ll talk to you another time.

165
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,040
Bye.

166
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,280
OK.

167
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,520
Take care.

168
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,200
Hmm.

169
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,200
Mr. Fang.

170
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
You mean you deleted the file

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,760
in the U-disk?

172
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,160
Yes.

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
No.

174
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
It wasn’t on purpose.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
After Yiren prepared the files,

176
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Chu Lin and I wanted to dress her up

177
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,840
for the bidder conference.

178
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,720
It’s so pink.

179
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,320
What do you know?

180
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,840
This is the most popular color for this season.

181
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,920
It took me a lot of effort to get it.

182
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
It hasn’t hit store shelves yet.

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
Still,

184
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
I think this color

185
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,560
is too weird.

186
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,000
How about this?

187
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,760
You can use mine.

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,400
The color is more acceptable.

189
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,440
Come.

190
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
Let’s go to the bathroom

191
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,600
and wipe off this deadly lip color.

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
You should also

193
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,960
change your outfit.

194
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,920
It’s so ugly.

195
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,360
You!

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
That’s called “Deadly Barbie Pink”!

197
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,880
You’re so outdated!

198
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,560
So rustic!

199
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,800
Sha Sha,

200
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,760
don’t get angry over this.

201
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
They don’t have a discerning eye.

202
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Right.

203
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,400
Hmm!

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
What?

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,920
You pissed me off.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
I really didn’t know.

207
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,400
The U-disks look the same.

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
After what happened later,

209
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
I realized something is wrong.

210
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
Then I found that U-disk

211
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,680
containing the design proposal

212
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,040
under the desk.

213
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
It turned out that

214
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,120
I accidentally switched Xu Yiren’s U-disk

215
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
with the new one I got from the company.

216
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,240
Mr. Fang,

217
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
it has nothing to do with Yiren.

218
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,360
It was all my fault.

219
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,800
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

220
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
Because...

221
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,160
Because I was afraid

222
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
you’ll also fire me.

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Then why do you tell me now?

224
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Yiren said

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
one should correct his mistakes bravely.

226
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,040
I know I won’t be able to correct mine,

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
but I should at least admit it.

228
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,920
Mr. Fang,

229
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
I’m sorry.

230
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,200
Mr. Fang.

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,800
Remember to

232
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,040
call the client later

233
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,160
and inform them of this.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,640
Mr. Huang,

235
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
I’m Xu Yiren from Square & Circle.

236
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,320
Will you leave or not?

237
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
I’ll call the cops if you continue like this.

238
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
What’s it about?

239
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Oh, here’s the thing.

240
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,920
Last time during the bidder conference,

241
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
my company lost the bid

242
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,160
because of my mistake.

243
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
So I brought the architectural model

244
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,400
of Mr. Fang’s design here today.

245
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Please take a look.

246
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,400
Mr. Huang,

247
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,320
it’ll only take you several minutes,

248
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
please take a look.

249
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,920
I’m sure you’ll be satisfied.

250
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,520
Move away!

251
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,240
Are you alright?

252
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,760
It’s nothing.

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Fang Zhiyou?

254
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,040
What’s it again?

255
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,560
Pick it up.

256
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Are you kidding me?

257
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,280
I never joked around.

258
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
Please pick it up.

259
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
It’s all my fault.

260
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,240
I’m sorry.

261
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,080
I shouldn’t have disturbed Mr. Huang.

262
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
I’m sorry.

263
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,400
Xu Yiren, don’t move.

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,600
Do I need to repeat myself again?

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,240
Fang Zhiyou,

266
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,600
you’re going too far.

267
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,480
I actually wanted to

268
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,520
give Square & Circle a second chance.

269
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,160
Now it seems that...

270
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,840
There’s no need.

271
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
I request you to pick it up

272
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
and apologize to my assistant.

273
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,680
You!

274
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,440
You’re not willing to?

275
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
Xu Yiren, call the cops.

276
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,000
Ah?

277
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,120
I...

278
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
No matter what she did,

279
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,200
you shouldn’t bully her.

280
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,160
You want to apologize here

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
or in the police station?

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,960
Sorry. Sorry.

283
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,440
Mr. Huang didn’t mean it.

284
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Sorry. Sorry.

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,960
Wait.

286
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
What’s it again?

287
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,520
I said

288
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,280
you should apologize to her.

289
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,760
I’m sorry.

290
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
It’s all right.

291
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,240
Are you alright?

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,240
I’m fine.

293
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,880
Can you walk?

294
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,640
Hmm.

295
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,640
Let me help you.

296
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Ah, Mr. Fang.

297
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,720
There’s no need.

298
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,240
I’m fine.

299
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
What if someone sees this?

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
If you don’t care,

301
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,800
you can continue struggling,

302
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,600
just don’t say I’m molesting you later.

303
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,120
Are you on purpose?

304
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,040
The bones are unharmed.

305
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
We can just ice the injury.

306
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,120
I...

307
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,440
I was really fine just now.

308
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,080
But you offended Mr. Huang,

309
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,280
he’s not likely to...

310
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,920
Huaxing has signed a contract with Liangshan.

311
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,680
I learned that on my way here.

312
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,960
Whether I offend him or not,

313
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,480
we’ll not get the project.

314
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
So it’s not all

315
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
because of you.

316
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,040
It’s true that you’ll never let me down.

317
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,160
I thought too much again.

318
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Why did you lie to me?

319
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
Ah?

320
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,280
Oh.

321
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,480
I was afraid that you may get angry.

322
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,520
I knew you hate Gao Ming very much.

323
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,880
You think he’s a big liar

324
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,640
who never tells the truth.

325
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,680
But,

326
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,880
he was not like that

327
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
when we first knew each other.

328
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
So you got back together?

329
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,560
No matter how sweet

330
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,040
the memory is,

331
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,040
it’s all in the past.

332
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,040
Maybe I knew he was cheating me all along,

333
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
I just didn’t want to admit it.

334
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,480
He’s the first person

335
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,640
that made me feel

336
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
valued and protected.

337
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,480
Besides Xia Di,

338
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
no one else

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,520
has ever treated me so well.

340
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
Maybe I was just dependent on him.

341
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,160
How is that possible?

342
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,560
What about your parents?

343
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,760
They don’t treat you well?

344
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,400
My parents

345
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,000
passed away in a car accident

346
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,960
when I was ten.

347
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,400
So I grew up in my uncle’s home.

348
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,600
It doesn’t matter.

349
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,560
It’s been so many years.

350
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,800
I’m not sad anymore.

351
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
But some wounds

352
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,280
won’t heal

353
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
in one or two years,

354
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,280
or even 10 years.

355
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,280
Do your uncle and aunt treat you well?

356
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Very well.

357
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,080
I only understand this today.

358
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,560
Understand what?

359
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,040
How you felt

360
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,200
when I lied to you.

361
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
Those words

362
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,880
are really annoying.

363
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
That’s good to hear.

364
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,360
Even if it’s out of goodwill,

365
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,480
or for the sake of others,

366
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,280
lies are still lies.

367
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
They won’t change anything.

368
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,040
I’m sorry.

369
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,520
I accept your apology.

370
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,520
But

371
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
don’t lie to me again.

372
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
Otherwise, I won’t let you

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,080
get away so easily.

374
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,160
I know.

375
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,680
What?

376
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,160
How is your foot?

377
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
I’ll take you to the hospital.

378
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
Otherwise you won’t be able to work tomorrow.

379
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,400
I can.

She’s actually very talented.

391
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,720
Hmm.

392
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,640
Almost 1% as good as me.

393
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,120
You’ll fire your assistant

394
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,360
if she likes you?

395
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,960
Right.

396
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,880
So that she doesn’t have to

397
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,800
face a man that she can’t have every day.

398
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
Xu Yiren,

399
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,440
get real.

400
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,280
This is an illusion.

401
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
This is just an illusion.

402
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,320
My priority is to make money.

403
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,760
Sleep now.

404
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,800
Hello, everyone.

405
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,240
Yiren,

406
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
why do you come back?

407
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,520
I’m back to work.

408
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
Thank you, Yiren.

409
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,320
Seems Luo Xiaoba

410
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
is not very well-informed sometimes.

411
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,720
But it’s great to have you back.

412
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,360
I finally

413
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,840
get to eat the breakfast you buy again.

414
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,320
Thank you.

415
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,120
You’re welcome.

416
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,040
Don’t bully Yiren like this every day.

417
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
I bully Yiren?

418
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
I gave money to Yiren

419
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,280
every time she bought me breakfast.

420
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,200
What about you?

421
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,520
I didn’t give money to her once or twice.

422
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,360
Just admit it.

423
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,000
I gave money to her every time.

424
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,360
Yiren.

425
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Don’t be a bully.

426
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,480
A flat white and croissants.

427
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,680
Your favorite.

428
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
Yiren,

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,160
I was not...

430
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,120
Don’t mention it.

431
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,000
Let it become our little secret.

432
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,800
Why?

433
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
It’s all in the past.

434
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,040
You see?

435
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
Now I’m back to work.

436
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Let’s not mention it.

437
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
Thank you, Yiren.

438
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,880
It’s alright.

439
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,840
If you really feel bad about it,

440
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,120
just let me use your deadly barbie pink

441
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
lipstick again.

442
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,160
Actually,

443
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
I liked it very much.

444
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
Great. Great.

445
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
- Here. Here.
- There’s a darker color.

446
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
I’ll give it to you

447
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,880
if you like it.

448
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
I’ll share them with you

449
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,040
if they launch popular lipsticks

450
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,440
of new colors in the future.

451
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,320
Take it.

452
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
From today,

453
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,560
you’ll be my best friend

454
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,520
at Square & Circle.

455
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,520
Hey, Sha Sha,

456
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,880
what do you mean by that?

457
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,800
Yiren is your best friend?

458
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,760
What about us?

459
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,800
Right.

460
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
You’re my good friends,

461
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
but Yiren is my best friend.

462
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,160
Morning, Ms. He.

463
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,800
Ms. He.

464
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,040
Morning, Ms. He.

465
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,960
What are you doing here?

466
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
I asked her to come back.

467
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,760
There’s no need to recruit a new assistant.

468
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,560
You come with me.

469
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Oh.

470
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,000
The regular meeting

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,720
will be held at 10 o’clock.

472
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,360
I’ve talked with Mr. Liu.

473
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,760
Although we lost the bid,

474
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,440
but our design

475
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
is very representative.

476
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
So he hopes you can share

477
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
your design concept at the meeting,

478
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,600
so our designers can learn from you

479
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,080
and improve themselves.

480
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,560
Then you’ll have afternoon tea

481
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,320
with the person-in-charge of Moon Bay Resort

482
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,240
at 14:00.

483
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,960
Afternoon tea?

484
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,480
Not in the company?

485
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
This is the first meeting between you.

486
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
I think the atmosphere

487
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
in the company is too tense.

488
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I talked with his secretary

489
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
and changed it to afternoon tea.

490
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,360
If you don’t like it,

491
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,520
I can change it back.

492
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,080
No need.

493
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,920
Afternoon tea then.

494
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,600
It’s good.

495
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,480
Hmm.

496
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
In the evening...

497
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,000
I have other things to do.

498
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Cancel all the appointments.

499
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,280
I know.

500
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,440
It’s Shiyu’s birthday today.

501
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,600
You’ll celebrate with her.

502
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,160
I’ve already canceled

503
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,200
all the other appointments.

504
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,160
You even know this?

505
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,120
Fang Shiyu posted a WeChat moment in the morning.

506
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
Seems she’s looking forward to it very much.

507
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,400
I hope

508
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,640
your birthday gift won’t let her down.

509
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,080
I think she’ll like it.

510
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,440
Then I’ll go and get things ready.

511
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,080
Fang Zhiyou,

512
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,960
let’s have a word.

513
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,960
Why did you ask Xu Yiren back?

514
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,080
You recruited her,

515
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,000
so I thought you’ll be happy

516
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,040
if I ask her to come back.

517
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,320
I recruited her because I thought

518
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,000
she can be a useful helper to you.

519
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,720
But it turns out she’s a problematic person.

520
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,600
She’s not the one to blame for the failure.

521
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,840
You know that.

522
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,720
But she lied to you,

523
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
don’t you care?

524
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,840
I do care.

525
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,360
So this is her last chance.

526
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,960
Fang Zhiyou,

527
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,520
do you know that you’ve changed?

528
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,440
Before,

529
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
you hated it a lot when people

530
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,760
challenged your limits and principles.

531
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,240
But it seems

532
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,440
you don’t care about that anymore

533
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,040
when it comes to Xu Yiren.

534
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,320
For instance?

535
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,680
Before,

536
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,720
you put Square & Circle

537
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,520
ahead of everything.

538
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
But the first question

539
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
you asked her that day

540
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,120
is where she went,

541
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,040
not why the design proposal

542
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
was not in the U-disk.

543
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,680
What you cared about is her,

544
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,200
not the fact that

545
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,280
we’d lost an important client.

546
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,560
Also,

547
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,720
you hate it when people lie to you.

548
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,840
Xu Yiren lied to you again and again,

549
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
but you still want her

550
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
to be your assistant.

551
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
I told you just now.

552
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,720
I recruited her because I thought

553
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,240
she can help you solve your problems.

554
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,600
But now she’s causing more problems for you.

555
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
But she’s really not the reason

556
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,040
why we lost the project with Huaxing.

557
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,920
I’m not talking about the project.

558
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,800
I’m talking about you.

559
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,720
In my opinion,

560
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,360
she can’t stay here any longer.

561
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,000
Yuwen,

562
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
you’re my best friend,

563
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,640
and my closest business partner.

564
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,040
I’ll consider

565
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,280
your advice very carefully.

566
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,680
What if I insist on firing her?

567
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,800
Then give me a

568
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,680
convincing reason.

569
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,440
Because I...

570
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,080
OK, I understand.

571
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
She can stay here.

572
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,280
But I won’t tolerate her

573
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
if she makes a mistake again.

574
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,400
That depends on what kind of mistakes she makes.

575
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Fang Zhiyou!

576
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Yuwen,

577
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,560
she’s my assistant.

578
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Let me

579
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
make my own decisions,

580
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,080
alright?

581
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,680
Hey, ladies.

582
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,840
It’s time to get off work.

583
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Why don’t you leave?

584
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Now since you’re all here,

585
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
I find it inappropriate to leave.

586
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
Done. Done.

587
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,720
Hurry.

588
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,480
Let’s go.

589
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,040
Hey, Yiren.

590
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,800
We’re off.

591
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,760
- Ok.
- Bye.

592
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,560
See you tomorrow.

593
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,920
See you, Yiren.

594
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,120
- Ok, bye.
- Bye.

595
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,080
Mr. Fang,

596
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,240
it’s about time.

597
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,280
Mr. Fang!

598
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
Mr. Fang, all you alright?

599
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Mr. Fang, what’s wrong?

600
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,680
Wait!

601
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,000
Mr. Fang!

602
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,400
Mr. Fang!

603
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,200
Mr. Fang, are you alright?

604
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,520
Should we go to the hospital?

605
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,600
Fine.

606
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,520
It’s too urgent.

607
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,320
Mr. Fang!

608
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,960
Are you alright?

609
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
Have some water and rinse your mouth.

610
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Let me call the ambulance,

611
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,680
OK?

612
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,880
There’s no need to go to the hospital.

613
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
You can go home.

614
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
You’re even throwing up bile.

615
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,840
Did you eat expired food accidently?

616
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
What if it’s food poisoning?

617
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,280
Let’s go to the hospital.

618
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
Only then can I feel relieved.

619
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,920
I know

620
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
what’s going on.

621
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,080
This is acute gastroenteritis.

622
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,400
It’s no big deal.

623
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,360
But you really

624
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
don’t look very well.

625
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
I know you want to

626
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
celebrate your sister’s birthday tonight.

627
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,600
But you have only one life.

628
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,200
You can’t put your life at risk.

629
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,880
Come on.

630
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,000
Don’t you have some common sense?

631
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,400
Acute gastroenteritis won’t kill people.

632
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,920
Don’t be so stubborn, alright?

633
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Even if you go there,

634
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,800
Shiyu won’t be happy

635
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,040
seeing you like this.

636
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
How about this?

637
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,680
You can give your sister a call,

638
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,800
and let her go to your place.

639
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,320
Just tell me what she likes to eat,

640
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,360
I can cook them for you.

641
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,920
You can celebrate at home.

642
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Is that OK?

643
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,760
You can cook?

644
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
Of course.

645
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Xia Di said

646
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,440
I can open a restaurant with my skills.

647
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
Do you want to have a bite?

648
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,280
That’s decided then.

649
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,360
Otherwise,

650
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,480
I’ll take you to the hospital.

651
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,680
What?

652
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,320
I’m the boss, alright?

653
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
You can be the boss when you recover.

654
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,480
Now you’re a patient.

655
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,040
I forgot to take my keys.

656
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,920
Be careful, Mr. Fang.

657
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,040
Really?

658
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,320
This is big news.

659
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,240
Be careful.

660
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Lie down for a while,

661
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I’ll call a designated driver.

662
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,320
Don’t act tough when you’re so sick.

663
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,160
My birthday is not that important.

664
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,880
You should’ve let Yiren

665
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,680
send you to the hospital.

666
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,440
Stop it.

667
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,160
I don’t know if these pills

668
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,480
Yiren bought can ease your disease.

669
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,360
Brother,

670
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,600
are you feeling better?

671
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,120
We’d better go to the hospital.

672
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,760
Shiyu,

673
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,280
I’m sorry.

674
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,920
I promised Mom

675
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,480
I’ll celebrate your birthday every year,

676
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
and keep you company on behalf of her.

677
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
Why say sorry?

678
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,320
You’re here by my side right now.

679
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,240
Little lucky star,

680
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,960
I’ve made a big meal for you.

681
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,600
It’s time to eat.

682
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,320
I can finally eat something.

683
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,520
Hurry.

684
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,240
Wash your hands first.

685
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,520
Do you feel any better?

686
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,360
Eat something first.

687
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,320
Hmm.

688
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,200
Yiren?

689
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,520
Hmm?

690
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,360
You cooked all these?

691
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,040
Yes.

692
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
Your brother said these are your favorite.

693
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,960
Are you satisfied?

694
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,120
Three cup chicken?

695
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,680
I haven’t eaten it for a long time.

696
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
Try it!

697
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
It’s hot.

698
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,840
Ouch!

699
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,000
Be careful.

700
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,760
It’s still very hot.

701
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,720
Oh my! It’s so yummy!

702
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,320
You can be a three Michelin star chef.

703
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,200
It’s much more delicious than the dishes

704
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
in those expensive restaurants.

705
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
Brother, try it!

706
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
They’re as good as the dishes Mom cooked.

707
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,760
Is it so good?

708
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,160
Did she pay you to say so?

709
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,840
These dishes are not for you.

710
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,600
I specially made something for you.

711
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,160
But today is my birthday.

712
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,640
You’re so biased.

713
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Right. Right.

714
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,520
Patients should have porridge.

715
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,040
Back when I caught a cold and had a fever,

716
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,240
mom would cook porridge for me.

717
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,520
It’s such a pity.

718
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,600
Yiren and I will have to

719
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,080
finish off these delicious dishes.

720
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,480
What? I can’t even decide

721
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,840
what I want to eat?

722
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,040
I cooked these dishes.

723
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,000
You have to listen to me.

724
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,400
Xu Yiren,

725
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,920
you should think before you speak.

726
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,400
Now it’s past office hours.

727
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Brother, just give up.

728
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,360
It’s for your own good.

729
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,400
Right, Yiren?

730
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,520
No, no, no.

731
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,640
Um…

732
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
This is my habit.

733
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,960
If Mr. Fang falls ill,

734
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,680
that means I’m not doing my job well.

735
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,400
So, I...

736
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,960
You care about my brother.

737
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,160
Just admit it.

738
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,400
You adults are really complicated.

739
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,440
Hurry and eat.

740
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,760
Eat more.

741
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,120
Xu Yiren is my assistant.

742
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,640
Only I know if she’s suitable

743
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,840
for the job.

744
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,080
Let me

745
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,240
make my own decisions,

746
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,880
alright?

747
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,080
One more cup.

748
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,640
Yuwen?

749
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,840
How come you’re drinking alone?

750
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
Do you mind if I join you?

751
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,840
I don’t mind.

752
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,520
A cup of wine.

753
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,720
Are you feeling upset

754
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,520
because of that project with Huaxing?

755
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,560
You should’ve known that

756
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,000
there’s no project Liangshan can’t get

757
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
if we set our sights on it.

758
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,840
Mr. Liang is right.

759
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,840
If Fang Zhiyou had known when to give up,

760
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,320
he wouldn’t have wasted so much time.

761
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you.

762
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,760
You speak really like my father.

763
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,640
No wonder

764
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,400
he likes you most among his other students.

765
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,760
There’re a lot of things I need to learn from him.

766
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,080
You’re as cocky as him.

767
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,840
Yuwen,

768
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,680
come back.

769
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,320
After we complete this project,

770
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,640
Liangshan will

771
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,600
move to a higher level

772
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,920
within the industry.

773
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,200
You know Liangshan is keeping a position for you.

774
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,520
Besides, Mr. Liang is getting old.

775
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,280
He hopes people like us who are close to him

776
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,480
can stay by his side.

777
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,560
Come back, Yuwen.

778
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,840
Let’s make Liangshan better together.

779
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,600
Hey, Yuwen!

780
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,480
You don’t need to send me home.

781
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,520
You haven’t recovered.

782
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,840
Just go back and have a rest.

783
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,520
It’s nothing.

784
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,440
I’m much better.

785
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,040
Thank you

786
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
for tonight.

787
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Why are you laughing?

788
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,200
Nothing.

789
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,520
I’ve never seen you

790
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,080
say thank you so sincerely.

791
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,560
So in your eyes,

792
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,120
it’s so hard to get along with me?

793
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,400
I’d say

794
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,880
it’s very hard.

795
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,120
I have to tell you the truth anyway.

796
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,840
I really want to say thank you to you.

797
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,880
Shiyu hasn’t eaten such delicious dishes

798
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,640
in a long time.

799
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,560
I always took her to Michelin restaurants

800
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,200
to celebrate her birthday before.

801
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,440
But she didn’t like the food there.

802
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,760
Really?

803
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,640
Shiyu said the dishes I cooked

804
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,720
taste like the dishes your mom cooked.

805
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,760
I was worried that

806
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,840
maybe she’d gotten sick of those flavors.

807
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,640
How could that happen?

808
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,880
Shiyu likes the dishes

809
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
our mom cooked most.

810
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,800
But...

811
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,720
But what?

812
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,440
After Mom left,

813
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,040
she didn't get to eat them again.

814
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,000
Mr. Fang...

815
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,920
Don't apologize.

816
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,920
Now we’re even.

817
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,760
So today,

818
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,200
only you’re here to celebrate Shiyu’s birthday.

819
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Where is your dad?

820
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,680
He’s still alive.

821
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
But he’s like a complete stranger to us.

822
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,800
How come?

823
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,840
I shouldn’t ask this.

824
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,640
You can ask.

825
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,080
But I don’t want to answer it.

826
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,800
Come.

827
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,040
Didn’t you just eat?

828
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
You’re hungry again?

829
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,200
When I was a kid,

830
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,160
sometimes I’d buy a roasted sweet potato.

831
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,560
and wandered the streets eating it.

832
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Sir,

833
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
I want a roasted sweet potato.

834
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,200
OK.

835
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,000
Thank you.

836
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,240
Thank you.

837
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,560
Why didn’t you go home?

838
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,520
I wanted to play outside.

839
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,160
No kid

840
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,800
wants to go home.

841
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,320
My biggest wish when I was a kid

842
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,120
is to eat a roasted sweet potato

843
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,200
without sharing it with others.

844
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,800
Actually I haven’t eaten it for years.

845
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,520
I’ll share it with you.

846
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,520
You became hungry so fast!

847
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,760
Do you know that

848
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,520
every girl has three stomachs.

849
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,440
One is for food,

850
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,520
one is for snacks,

851
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,840
and one is for milk tea.

852
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,560
Why don’t you eat?

853
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
You didn’t even let me eat vegetables.

854
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,080
Can I eat this?

855
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh.

856
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,760
Alright.

857
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,720
I forgot that.

858
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,560
Give it to me then.

859
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
Eat slowly.

860
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,240
No one will take it from you.

861
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,880
Is it sweet?

862
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,800
Hmm.

863
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,200
Xu Yiren,

864
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,440
don’t tell me

865
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,320
you’ve fallen for Fang Zhiyou.

866
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,040
No, no.

867
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,680
You can fall for anyone,

868
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,800
but not him.

869
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
If you date him,

870
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,440
you’ll beak up immediately

871
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,480
because you may lie to him occasionally.

872
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,840
What’s on your mind?

873
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,240
He said he doesn’t like you.

874
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,480
Hello, Aunt.

875
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,360
Hello, Yiren.

876
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
Are you still up?

877
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah.

878
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,400
I’m still up.

879
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,760
That’s good. That’s good.

880
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,920
I...

881
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,600
I just want to ask when you’ll

882
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,720
transfer the living expenses for this month?

883
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh.

884
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,120
Sorry, I forgot.

885
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,200
I’ve been too busy recently.

886
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,480
Tomorrow...

887
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,400
No, I’ll transfer it to you right now.

888
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,000
It’s fine. It’s fine.

889
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,560
I don’t mean to urge you.

890
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,120
After eating dinner today,

891
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,440
I thought of you

892
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,720
when I was chatting

893
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,400
with your uncle and Qing.

894
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,120
I miss you.

895
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
So I gave you a call.

896
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,320
You should go to rest now.

897
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,320
Good night.

898
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,760
Hmm.

899
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,080
Aunt, good night.

900
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,320
Xu Yiren,

901
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,040
look at yourself.

902
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,480
You and Fang Zhiyou

903
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,280
belong in two different worlds.

904
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,640
Don’t waste your time daydreaming.

905
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,080
You won’t be disappointed

906
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
if you don’t aim too high.

907
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
= Square & Circle =

908
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,040
Isn’t this Xu Yiren?

909
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,400
Seems it’s her.

910
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,880
Morning.

911
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,880
Yes, it’s her.

912
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,960
- Is it her?
– It’s her. It’s her.

913
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,400
What are you watching?

914
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,680
Start work now.

915
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,080
Hey, have you heard about this?

916
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
Mr. Fang and his new assistant slept together.

917
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Ah?

918
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,160
Really?

919
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,240
Where did you get the news?

920
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I saw that in a chatting group.

921
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
He’s not toying with her feelings.

922
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,840
It’s said he already bought a house for her.

923
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,560
It was designed by Mr. Fang himself!

924
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
Really?

925
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,720
But as far as I know, Mr. Fang

926
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,360
and Ms. He were childhood sweethearts.

927
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,040
Believe it or not,

928
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,360
Liu told me that

929
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,960
Mr. Fang and Ms. He

930
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,760
had a quarrel with each other in the office.

931
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,920
The way I see it,

932
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,160
it must be because of Yiren.

933
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,320
Ms. He has

934
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,360
no chance anymore.

935
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,560
Luo Xiaoba,

936
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,920
Riren will suffer a lot because of you.

937
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,640
Now how can she face others in the company?

938
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,720
What are you saying?

939
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
- Come on.
- She’s not married yet.

940
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,360
Of course they can date each other.

941
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,120
Unbelievable.

942
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,760
Luoyang.

943
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
What are you talking about?

944
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
Yiren,

945
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,680
um...

946
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,080
We... It’s just...

947
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Sha Sha.

948
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,160
Where are you going?

949
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,080
I want to take a walk.

950
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,240
Tell her.

951
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
I saw you and Mr. Fang

952
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,200
were together yesterday,

953
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,720
I thought that...

954
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,320
you were dating each other,

955
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,480
so I told...

956
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,040
What?

957
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,880
...everyone about it.

958
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,360
