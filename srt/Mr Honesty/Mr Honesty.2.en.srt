Mr. Fang.

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,140
Sorry.

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,460
I didn’t mean that.

29
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,460
I...

30
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,140
I had planned to...

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,620
You’re too heavy.

32
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,140
What do you mean?

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,740
Do you want to watch me get changed?

34
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,580
No.

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,940
I’m leaving right away.

36
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,300
Your package.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,820
I...

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,060
I put your package in the outer room.

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,260
It’s him.

40
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,180
Why so suddenly?

41
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,060
Ms. He.

42
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,180
Ms. He.

43
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,060
Ms. He.

44
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,100
What should we do?

45
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,780
Mr. Liu.

46
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,700
What are you doing?

47
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,060
Ms. He.

48
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,780
If I’m right,

49
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,540
I’ve sent my resignation

50
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,100
to your email.

51
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,860
You must have received it.

52
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,060
Mr. Liu.

53
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Give me a bit more time, all right?

54
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,940
I will persuade Fang Zhiyou.

55
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,220
Don’t try to fool me.

56
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,820
Xu Yiren.

57
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,940
Tell Mr. Liu

58
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,740
what Mr. Fang told you.

59
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,620
Mr. Fang?

60
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,180
He asked me to cancel

61
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,660
all his appointments today

62
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,980
and he would have a talk with Mr. Liu.

63
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,820
He just called me.

64
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
He said

65
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
he would like you

66
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,900
to wait for him.

67
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,140
Do wait for him.

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,580
Must I wait

69
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,300
because he wants it?

70
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,620
No. No.

71
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,580
Mr. Liu.

72
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,020
Mr. Fang is coming back soon.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,460
He asked me to keep you,

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,740
whatever it would take.

75
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,180
If you leave,

76
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,140
he’ll curse me to death.

77
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,460
Do me a favor, could you?

78
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,660
Please!

79
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
I’m begging you.

80
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,820
Mr. Liu.

81
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,780
-Please wait a minute.
-Please wait a minute.

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,740
Mr. Liu, wait a minute.

83
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,540
Well, I’m tired with the packing.

84
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,180
Shall we

85
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,420
sit down and have some coffee?

86
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,260
Okay. Okay.

87
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,060
Mr. Liu.

88
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,100
Have some rest in the meeting room.

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,460
I’ll go make you some coffee.

90
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,580
Flat white without sugar, right?

91
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,260
Clever girl.

92
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,980
I’ll be right back.

93
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,060
Mr. Fang.

94
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,220
You’re back so soon.

95
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,100
Come to my office.

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
This way, please.

97
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,860
Make the coffee and wait for me.

98
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,540
Okay.

99
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,740
What do we do?

100
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,380
Ms. He.

101
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,980
It’s okay.

102
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,780
Well done!

103
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,580
I’ll give you 10% of the share.

104
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,740
From tomorrow on,

105
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,580
you can have your own studio.

106
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I won’t interfere anymore.

107
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,060
And?

108
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,980
Nothing else.

109
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,460
Whether you’ll leave or not

110
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,060
doesn’t matter to me at all.

111
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,580
But I must secure the project with

112
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,540
Xingcheng Real Estate.

113
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,260
These are my conditions.

114
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,540
If I knew you would say this,

115
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,580
I shouldn’t have listened to Xu Yiren.

116
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
Xu Yiren made up

117
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,060
whatever she said.

118
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,340
None of her words came from me.

119
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,780
Don’t be too arrogant.

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,140
At Xingcheng’s board meeting next Monday,

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,620
my design will be approved of.

122
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,220
Don’t cry by then.

123
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,220
I was sick in my childhood.

124
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,580
My tear glands have been blocked.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,060
Use the speakerphone.

126
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,860
Xu Yiren, come in.

127
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,020
It’s okay.

128
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,540
Fang Zhiyou.

129
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,540
I’ve sent an email to

130
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,420
HR Department.

131
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,020
Go for the resignation procedures.

132
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,660
Mr. Fang.

133
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,340
Fang Zhiyou.

134
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,260
I told you that

135
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,900
I’ll fire you

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,980
the moment you lie.

137
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,980
I asked her to lie.

138
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,980
Would you like to fire me, too?

139
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
Leave us.

140
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,060
Ms. He.

141
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,020
Don’t worry.

142
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,620
When I’m here,

143
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,420
no one dares to fire you.

144
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,220
Go.

145
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,900
Just this once.

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Fang Zhiyou.

147
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,700
If we really lose

148
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Xingcheng’s project,

149
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,420
in less than six months,

150
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,100
all employees will quit

151
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,260
before you fire them.

152
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,460
Can you finish so many dishes?

153
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,260
I know you’re mentally tortured.

154
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,660
Eat them for compensation.

155
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,380
I thought I would be fired today.

156
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,580
Luckily, Ms. He helped me.

157
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,060
She is nice to you.

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,500
She’s a good woman,

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
and very capable.

160
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,300
In our company,

161
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,620
she’s the only one who can control Thanos.

162
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,180
What a pity!

163
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,420
She failed today.

164
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,620
I don’t understand.

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,980
Is it so hard to say sorry?

166
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,500
I think he has a cool personality.

167
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,340
I like that.

168
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,780
Don’t betray me.

169
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,100
People like him

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,540
have suffered too little.

171
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,860
The problem isn’t serious enough.

172
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,500
If the company would shut down

173
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,820
without his apology,

174
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,220
let’s see if he’ll still say

175
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,100
he never lies.

176
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,580
Why do you sound

177
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,260
so jealous of him?

178
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,620
I am jealous of him.

179
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,140
How many people can live as freely as they wish?

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Hello, Aunt?

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Now?

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,980
Come. Come in and have a look.

183
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,780
Look at the sofa.

184
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,900
And the television.

185
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
They’re new.

186
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,780
And...

187
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,620
Come here. Come.

188
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,380
Look at the yard.

189
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,740
How big it is!

190
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,140
It’s so big.

191
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,060
Think of the location

192
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,740
And the rent.

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,140
Aunt.

194
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,860
It’s a real bargain.

195
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
How can you do this?

196
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,140
I’m still living here.

197
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,460
How can you show someone else the apartment?

198
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
Ignore her.

199
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,660
If you like my apartment,

200
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,340
negotiate with your friend

201
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,980
and rent it asap.

202
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,700
Okay.

203
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,420
A lot of people want it.

204
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,060
Okay.

205
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,300
I’ll go back and discuss with my friend.

206
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,980
Okay. Go ahead. Hurry.

207
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay. See you, Aunt.

208
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,620
See you.

209
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,020
Aunt.

210
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,580
Oh, you’re just in time.

211
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,620
Uh, the pipe...

212
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,740
I had it repaired.

213
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,180
Here’s the bill.

214
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,820
Come.

215
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,060
Have a look.

216
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Pay for it.

217
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,700
Why is it so expensive?

218
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,740
Well, the floors were damped off.

219
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,620
So was the furniture.

220
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,580
I paid for them.

221
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,180
Half a month ago,

222
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,100
I told you there was something wrong with the pipe.

223
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
But you didn’t have time to have it repaired.

224
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,380
Then it went wrong.

225
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,100
Why is it all my fault?

226
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,660
Not your fault?

227
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,740
Can it be mine?

228
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
Because you weren’t home that day

229
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,860
and didn’t answer the phone.

230
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,700
You must

231
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,980
pay for it.

232
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,980
But...

233
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,740
I...

234
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,700
I don’t have too much money now.

235
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,380
Well, you look rather poor.

236
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,260
How about this?

237
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,460
Pay it with your rent.

238
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Look.

239
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,420
Rent for three months
and the deposit.

240
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,140
It’s not enough.

241
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,780
But fine...

242
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Consider me unlucky.

243
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,460
Here is the thing.

244
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,580
Today,

245
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,020
pay the rent for the next three months

246
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,260
or pack up and move out.

247
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,180
Aunt.

248
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,180
Aunt.

249
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,740
Can we negotiate?

250
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,060
Aunt.

251
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,980
Please.

252
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,140
There’s nothing to negotiate about.

253
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,940
Pay the rent

254
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,860
or move out.

255
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,780
I...

256
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,900
Xu Yiren.

257
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,660
Mr. Fang.

258
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,500
Where are you?

259
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,340
Go visit a client with me.

260
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,660
Sorry.

261
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,140
I’ve got some emergency.

262
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,460
I must ask for a leave today.

263
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
Fine, then.

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,140
Tomorrow...

265
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,780
The day after tomorrow.

266
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,860
The day after tomorrow,

267
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,940
I’ll pay the rent, all right?

268
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,860
Okay, then.

269
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,900
But you know what?

270
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,260
When you pay,

271
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,500
the rent will go up.

272
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,980
Five hundred more

273
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,300
for each month.

274
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,100
Five hundred?

275
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,300
= Zheng Zhong =

276
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,820
Hello, Zheng Zhong?

277
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,700
Send me Xu Yiren’s address.

278
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,940
Right away.

279
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,500
Aunt.

280
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,820
We signed the contact.

281
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,860
How can you raise the rent without a reason?

282
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,820
What do you mean?

283
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,340
This is my own apartment.

284
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,180
I get to decide the rent.

285
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,220
I’m telling you.

286
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,820
You have two days.

287
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,580
You...

288
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,700
You shall

289
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,540
pay the rent

290
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,460
or you shall

291
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
just move out.

292
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,140
It tastes bad.

293
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,380
Aunt.

294
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,700
What?

295
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,460
Uh...

296
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,060
Don’t...

297
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,220
Don’t prick your hand.

298
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,860
You...

299
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,660
Look.

300
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,620
It’s just a lamp.

301
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,420
Fifteen yuan is enough, isn’t it?

302
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,380
I’ll pay for it.

303
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,140
Come on.

304
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,740
I’ll transfer it to me.

305
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
Remember to accept it.

306
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
What bad luck!

307
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,100
Who are you?

308
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,100
This is the emergency?

309
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,060
You... you’re her boyfriend, aren’t you?

310
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,420
Good.

311
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,980
Pay the rent for her.

312
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,500
Why must I pay the rent for her?

313
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,700
Besides, you have no right to kick her out.

314
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,060
This is my apartment.

315
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Why can’t I kick her out?

316
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Have you signed the contract?

317
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,900
Yes.

318
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,780
It won’t be expired in six months.

319
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:26,980
She...

320
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,780
She broke my floors.

321
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,580
All the floors.

322
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,060
Shouldn’t she pay for that?

323
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,220
I heard you before I came in.

324
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,900
As in the general rental contract of our city,

325
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,420
the owner shall be responsible for

326
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,580
all hardware damage in the apartment

327
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,420
as well as all other losses.

328
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,540
The water pipe is hardware.

329
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,700
She doesn’t need to pay for that.

330
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,180
You...

331
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,300
Really?

332
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,140
Haven’t you read the contract?

333
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,820
Don’t try to scare me.

334
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,380
It’s my apartment.

335
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,460
I have the final say.

336
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,580
I won’t rent it to her.

337
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,500
You can do that.

338
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,300
According to the contract,

339
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,580
you must compensate for the breach of contract

340
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,180
and tell her to move out a month in advance.

341
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,180
Pay the compensation

342
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,340
and she’ll move out next month.

343
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,940
Why?

344
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,540
If you feel unconvinced,

345
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,980
you can file a lawsuit.

346
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,140
Oh, but you know what?

347
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,620
The losing party pays for the lawsuit.

348
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,260
And you’ll be on the blacklist of rental.

349
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,420
No estate agent will

350
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,820
help you rent your apartment anymore.

351
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,460
Don’t try to scare me.

352
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,460
Fine.

353
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,340
Fine.

354
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,540
You’re good.

355
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,300
You’re really something.

356
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
She hasn’t gone far.

357
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,540
Shall I get back the pay for the lamp?

358
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,180
No.

359
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
Gao Ming bought this for me.

360
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,100
It doesn’t matter.

361
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,860
Let’s go.

362
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,340
Aren’t we going to visit a client?

363
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,900
Thank you

364
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,660
for that.

365
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,460
You’re welcome.

366
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,780
Shall I buy you dinner?

367
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,940
I said “You’re welcome”.

368
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,580
I was just caring for the weak.

369
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,180
By the way,

370
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,860
go have you IQ tested.

371
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,660
The company will pay for it.

372
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,260
What?

373
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,380
You don’t even read a rental contract.

374
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,900
I seriously doubt

375
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
if you’re competent

376
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,180
to be my assistant.

377
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,780
Funny joke.

378
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,020
I never tell jokes.

379
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,260
Hello, sir.

380
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,140
Mr. Fang.

381
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,740
Why didn’t you tell me

382
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,380
we were coming here?

383
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,500
I could have got changed.

384
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,300
You don’t need to.

385
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,700
It doesn’t matter what you wear.

386
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,700
Doing business isn’t in a show.

387
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,060
Wearing properly will be all right.

388
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,300
You’re wearing properly.

389
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,980
Is this a compliment?

390
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,620
Not really.

391
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,340
Oh,

392
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,020
you’ve got a mission.

393
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,340
You’ll take charge of the conversation
besides the business.

394
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,140
If you realize I’m saying something wrong,

395
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,340
try your best to stop me.

396
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,100
You don’t understand?

397
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,180
I do.

398
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,380
If I say something

399
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,700
that sounds dishonest,

400
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,020
will you fire me?

401
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,940
I promise I’ll do the mission well.

402
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,420
If we get this client,

403
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,820
our company can hold for a long time

404
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,220
even without Xingcheng project.

405
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,020
Let’s go.

406
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,220
Mr. Fang, at last we meet.

407
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,060
I asked to meet you several times.

408
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,460
Ms. He always said you were abroad

409
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,420
or you were sick.

410
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,780
But today,

411
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,900
you asked to see me.

412
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,940
When I was little, I heard something.

413
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,420
There’s always obstruction
when important people meet.

414
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,900
Mr. Yang, you and Mr. Fang are important.

415
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,380
When you meet,

416
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,060
there’s certainly obstruction.

417
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
Oh, I also heard a saying.

418
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,820
Nothing good comes easy.

419
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,180
So, this time,

420
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,100
our cooperation

421
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,500
will be smooth.

422
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,220
Mr. Yang.

423
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,420
I’d like to propose a toast on behalf of Mr. Fang.

424
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,140
You’re quite glib-tongued.

425
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,780
And you know a lot.

426
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,580
Mr. Fang.

427
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,780
You have good luck.

428
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,180
I’ll drink it first.

429
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,420
Good.

430
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,180
I like straightforward guys.

431
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,780
My turn.

432
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
I know.

433
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,980
Our company isn’t as big as Xingcheng.

434
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,740
You don’t always think highly of us.

435
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,060
Mr. Yang.

436
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,140
You’ve got an odd sense of humor.

437
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,940
Your company has been developing greatly.

438
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,620
I heard you just won the bidding

439
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,180
for the best land in the west of the city.

440
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,380
You’ve got broad prospects.

441
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,660
Then why didn’t you want to

442
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,380
cooperate with us before?

443
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,660
I didn’t want to cooperate with you,

444
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,500
because I thought your designs

445
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,860
weren’t to my taste.

446
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,500
I didn’t think we could cooperate.

447
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,980
I knew it!

448
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,500
Taste varies from

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,100
person to person,

450
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,540
just like fashion of clothes.

451
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,180
They keep changing.

452
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Look at your company.

453
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,140
In the past two years,

454
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,700
you sold so many house properties.

455
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
It means you’re enterprising with a vision.

456
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,860
Just like this time,

457
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,620
you come to us for cooperation.

458
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,580
You want

459
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,220
some improvement

460
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,580
in the design of house properties.

461
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,140
Am I right?

462
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,180
Girl.

463
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,620
You’re giving me an out.

464
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,700
If I don’t accept it,

465
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,060
I’ll feel sorry for your shrewdness.

466
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,380
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

467
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,820
I’ll drink as a little apology.

468
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,260
Okay.

469
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,540
Come on.

470
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,860
Let’s enjoy the meal.

471
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,820
All right.

472
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,780
Mom, look. Here’s a pony.

473
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,980
Little boy.

474
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,340
What would you like to eat?

475
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,580
I’ll get you some, all right?

476
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,300
Mom, look. Pony.

477
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,100
Little boy.

478
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,780
You like ponies so much?

479
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,580
Let me make one for you.

480
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,780
-All right?
-How?

481
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,340
Come.

482
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,020
Look carefully.

483
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,740
Mr. Fang.

484
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,580
She’s kind.

485
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,180
What a good girl!

486
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,100
Why do you like this place?

487
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,460
You always stay here for the whole day.

488
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,780
Is everything settled for Xingcheng?

489
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,300
Don’t worry.

490
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,780
I sweet-talked Junior Mr. Xu.

491
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,420
He always doesn’t like Fang Zhiyou.

492
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,860
He could do nothing because of his father.

493
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,980
But this time, his father has given him

494
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,860
full authority of all projects.

495
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,940
His priority is to

496
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,540
kick Fang Zhiyou out.

497
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,540
Don’t be careless, anyway.

498
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,420
Fang Zhiyou is a tough man to deal with.

499
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,940
Got it.

500
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,100
But you know what?

501
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,300
I must say thank you.

502
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
Otherwise,

503
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,860
I wouldn’t have decided to leave..

504
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,140
Well,

505
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,020
you don’t need to thank me.

506
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,340
We both take what we need.

507
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,460
By the way,

508
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,260
how has Fang Zhiyou

509
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,740
offended you?

510
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,380
That’s not your concern.

511
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,020
You’re right.

512
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,500
Fang Zhiyou is so stubborn.

513
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,300
Because he’s a bit talented,

514
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,540
he thinks highly of no one.

515
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,460
It’s not weird when he offends everyone.

516
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,740
Now, he’s proud.

517
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,820
But he’ll beg someday.

518
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,540
Even if he begs for mercy,

519
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,700
he’ll only do it to me.

520
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,980
You

521
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,780
don’t deserve that.

522
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,900
Done.

523
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,300
Hello.

524
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,540
I’m Pony.

525
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,620
What’s your name?

526
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,420
Mom.

527
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,620
Look, a pony.

528
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,860
So beautiful!

529
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Girl, you’re awesome.

530
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,620
My son is naughty.

531
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,140
When he loses temple, I can’t calm him down.

532
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,980
He’s a little boy.

533
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,820
A boy is always naughty.

534
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,140
A naughty boy

535
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,540
will have a bright future when he grows up.

536
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,540
Cheers.

537
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,620
To our successful cooperation.

538
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,980
Come and catch me.

539
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,140
Say sorry to Aunt.

540
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,100
You have ten seconds.

541
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,700
It’s okay. It’s okay.

542
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,940
It doesn’t matter.

543
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Little boy, stop crying.

544
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,660
I’ll give you the pony, all right?

545
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,980
Come to me, son. Stop crying.

546
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,740
Sorry.

547
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,100
Mr. Yang. Mrs. Yang.

548
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,340
Mr. Fang doesn’t know

549
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,700
how to play with kids.

550
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,020
He didn’t mean that.

551
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
He’s joking.

552
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,380
I’m not joking.

553
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,700
You...

554
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,780
Mr. Fang.

555
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,900
Didn’t we make a deal not offend others?

556
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,180
I don’t want to offend anyone.

557
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,380
But I don’t allow anyone

558
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,860
to bully my employee.

559
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,660
Sorry.

560
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,140
He didn’t mean that.

561
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,180
Well, Mr. Fang,

562
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,980
apologize to my son.

563
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,020
He’s a little boy.

564
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,500
But please show some respect.

565
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,220
Respect should be mutual.

566
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,940
He disrespected my employee first.

567
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,900
How did he disrespect your employee?

568
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,060
Like she said,

569
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,900
a little boy

570
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,420
is always naughty.

571
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,140
Yeah.

572
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,940
He’s a little boy.

573
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,180
He’s naughty and naive.

574
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
But as his parent,

575
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,220
shouldn’t you correct his errors promptly?

576
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,060
Instead, you act like

577
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,540
it’s okay whatever your son does.

578
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,540
I don’t accept that.

579
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,620
What do you mean?

580
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,300
How about this, Mrs. Yang?

581
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,740
Mr. Fang.

582
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,860
You think a naughty boy has no problem, huh?

583
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,420
Come on.

584
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
Throw it to your mother’s face.

585
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,540
Don’t push too far.

586
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,140
Mr. Fang.

587
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,540
You two, get out.

588
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,380
It’s okay. Mom is here.

589
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,020
Don’t be scared.

590
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,060
Don’t be scared.

591
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,020
Sorry.

592
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
I’m terribly sorry.

593
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,220
Sorry, little boy.

594
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,140
It’s for you.

595
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,140
Mr. Fang.

596
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,940
We’ve lost the business, right?

597
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,220
What do you think?

598
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,700
Sorry.

599
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,420
It’s my fault.

600
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,820
What does it matter to you?

601
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,260
Mr. Fang.

602
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,780
I don’t understand.

603
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,700
You just need to say something

604
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,340
that others want to hear.

605
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,860
Is it so hard?

606
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,820
I can’t do it, anyway.

607
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,540
Okay.

608
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,220
I’ll do it.

609
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,300
You’ll just

610
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,380
say less.

611
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,660
No way.

612
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,180
I hate lies.

613
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,940
I can’t do it, anyway,

614
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,620
even if I know some lies

615
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,780
can make our lives better.

616
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,940
I also know no one wants to work for me,

617
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,740
because of this.

618
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,300
But I still can’t do it.

619
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,820
Because I hate lies so much.

620
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,780
I see.

621
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,980
If there’s something you don’t want to do,

622
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,060
I’ll do it for you.

623
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,180
I’m your assistant anyway.

624
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,620
What do we do now?

625
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,140
We’ve lost the project with Xingcheng.

626
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,500
We’ve lost the new client, too.

627
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,420
It’s not the time to feel desperate yet.

628
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,140
Hello.

629
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,980
Hello.

630
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,100
Can I have a cup of cold brew

631
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,300
and a croissant.

632
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,460
Sorry.

633
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
The last two croissants were just sold.

634
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,260
What bad luck!

635
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,060
The lady just bought them.

636
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,300
Thank you.

637
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,300
Hey, beauty.

638
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,380
Can you eat up these

639
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,940
by yourself?

640
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
I bought them for my colleagues.

641
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,500
Wait a second.

642
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,500
Can we negotiate?

643
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,460
Could you

644
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,500
give me a croissant?

645
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,180
I can exchange my sandwich for that.

646
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,020
You have no idea.

647
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,620
Croissants in this shop

648
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,260
taste super superb.

649
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,820
I came early for them.

650
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,940
But all croissants were sold out.

651
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,620
You bought them for your colleagues.

652
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,620
Maybe,

653
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,260
they prefer sandwiches.

654
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,460
Sandwiches in this shop taste great, too.

655
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,340
Okay. Okay.

656
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,340
Thank you. Thank you.

657
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,660
Wait.

658
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,340
What else would you like?

659
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,260
I’d like

660
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,140
a sandwich.

661
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,180
And...

662
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,460
a bag of cookies.

663
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,140
Here you are.

664
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,860
The sandwich.

665
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,900
Wait.

666
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,580
Look.

667
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,860
I’m so lucky today

668
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,500
to meet such a kind beautiful girl

669
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,100
like you.

670
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,020
Uh...

671
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,860
I’d like to give the cookies to you.

672
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,060
No, thanks.

673
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,220
See you.

674
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,820
= He Yuwen =

675
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,300
= From Mr. Xu, Fang, wait for me downstairs.
I’ll be arriving soon. =

676
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,620
Hello, everybody.

677
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh, there you are.

678
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,900
Thank you for the croissant this morning.

679
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,580
You know what?

680
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,820
The online rating is real.

681
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
-Who is he?
-No idea.

682
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,580
The croissant tastes great.

683
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,780
I’ll buy you one next time.

684
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,660
Because of a croissant,

685
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,420
you stalked me?

686
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,620
No, I...

687
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,500
There you are.

688
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,740
Ms. He.

689
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,100
You’re late.

690
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,620
I was lost.

691
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,580
It’s too hard

692
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,700
to find your company.

693
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,460
Let me introduce you.

694
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,460
This is our new intern.

695
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Hello, everyone.

696
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,020
I’m Gu Bo.

697
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,740
I’m a senior at the College of Design.

698
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,820
Everyone,

699
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,780
hope we’ll get on well.

700
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,820
-Okay. -Okay.

701
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,580
Xu Yiren.

702
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,820
Take him to Design Department.

703
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,420
Shouldn’t I meet Mr. Fang...

704
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,700
Mr. Fang?

705
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
He isn’t here today.

706
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,540
Meet him some other day.

707
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,780
Uh, come with me.

708
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,540
This seat is unoccupied.

709
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,900
It’s yours, then.

710
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,660
I’ll leave for a moment. It won’t be long.

711
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,900
When Mr. Fang comes back,

712
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,740
call me right away.

713
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,540
Okay.

714
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,340
Something fishy.

715
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,140
Think about it.

716
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,740
Our company is shutting down.

717
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,460
Why are we still hiring an intern?

718
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,020
Hello, everyone. I’m Liu Tianyang.

719
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,420
= Xingcheng Real Estate Project Design Plan =
Hello, everyone. I’m Liu Tianyang.

720
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,260
I’m the chief designer

721
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,860
for Xingcheng project.

722
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,500
Based on the project orientation,

723
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,260
appearance design

724
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,620
and the usage of public space

725
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,260
are a bit different from

726
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,380
the previous projects of Xingcheng.

727
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,340
It adapts to market demands.

728
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,420
Next,

729
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,020
let me explain to you

730
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,220
our proposal in details.

731
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,940
That is

732
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,900
my whole design.

733
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,900
Everybody.

734
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,020
If you’ve got any question,

735
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,620
we can keep discussing.

736
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,500
Thanks.

737
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,940
It’s right to be different.

738
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,500
In the past decades,

739
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
we’ve built

740
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,140
similar buildings.

741
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,140
It’s time to have a new style.

742
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,900
Yes.

743
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,500
Mr. Xu gave me many valuable suggestions.

744
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,900
on this design.

745
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Here,

746
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,740
I’d like to say thank you to him.

747
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,460
Well,

748
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,020
I don’t think there’s any problem.

749
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,540
After all,

750
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,900
this is

751
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
the first project

752
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,980
Junior Mr. Xu has been in charge of

753
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,500
since he took office.

754
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,020
A young man

755
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,220
should behave like one, right?

756
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,700
In this case,

757
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,140
this proposal

758
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,020
is settled.

759
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,460
Mr. Liu.

760
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,940
You’ll be responsible for

761
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,460
the remaining work.

762
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,300
Leave it to me.

763
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Don’t worry.

764
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
I’ll try my best.

765
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,340
If there’s no more objection,

766
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,140
let’s call it a day.

767
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,900
Okay.

768
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,660
Please wait.

769
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,860
Mr. Xu.

770
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,180
I had a little traffic jam on my way here.

771
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,900
Dad.

772
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,180
Why are you back?

773
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
I’m...

774
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,740
I’m only a bit late.

775
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,060
And the meeting is over?

776
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,060
Sorry to hold you up, everybody.

777
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,020
Shouldn’t we

778
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,900
go through the proposal for our new project?

779
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,740
Let’s do it.

780
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
Okay, Mr. Xu.

781
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,500
-Our project...
-Fang.

782
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,380
Come in.

783
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,060
Sit down.

784
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,420
And listen to him.

785
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
Okay, Mr. Xu.

786
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,500
Luckily, someone left.

787
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,300
Otherwise, an intern like me

788
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,780
wouldn’t have had a seat.

789
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
How did you know?

790
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,300
What?

791
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,340
Your chief designer quitted his job

792
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,500
and left with his subordinates.

793
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,340
He would also take away a VIP client.

794
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,180
How did you know that?

795
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,740
That’s because...

796
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,940
Before I came here,

797
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,820
I had to do some investigation.

798
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,980
I...

799
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,860
I saw how you talked to Ms. He.

800
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,340
I thought you knew each other.

801
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,500
Uh...

802
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,300
Kind of.

803
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,860
You really knew her?

804
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,700
You’re her relative?

805
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,620
No. No. No.

806
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,540
Absolutely not.

807
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,940
I am

808
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,620
the son of

809
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,220
her father’s student’s friend.

810
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,620
I’m not familiar with her.

811
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,460
Not familiar at all.

812
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,820
You nearly confused me.

813
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,220
But...

814
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,220
You’re not coming in the right time.

815
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,780
You also think

816
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,140
Square & Circle is doomed?

817
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,380
Don’t talk rubbish.

818
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,740
When did I say that?

819
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,900
Just rest assured.

820
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,540
Don’t worry.

821
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
When I’m around,

822
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,140
the company won’t be doomed.

823
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,740
Why?

824
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,260
Because...

825
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,820
I’m a lucky guy.

826
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,460
When I’m around,

827
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,620
all problems will be solved.

828
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,660
Fine.

829
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,140
Lucky Gu.

830
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,060
Take care.

831
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,820
I knew you would be here.

832
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,300
How was it going?

833
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,660
Done.

834
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,060
You really persuaded Mr. Xu?

835
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,140
How was it possible?

836
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,580
-How could he...
-Fang Zhiyou.

837
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Watch out.

838
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,020
Mr. Liu.

839
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,300
Mr. Liu.

840
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,500
Get up.

841
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,900
What a tough life I’m living!

842
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
I’ve been working in this industry
for a dozen years.

843
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,860
But such a young man humiliates me every day.

844
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,140
If it weren’t for raising my family

845
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,260
and paying the housing loan,

846
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,620
I would have quitted my job long ago.

847
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,020
Get up. Don’t you feel ashamed?

848
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,100
I’m already too ashamed

849
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,340
to be living on this planet.

850
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:25,900
Yes.

851
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,900
I’m sorry to you.

852
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,660
But look how poor I am!

853
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,420
Why don’t you let me punch you?

854
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,420
What?

855
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,980
Why can’t you just satisfy me?

856
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,580
If you used your sweet talk

857
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
to design things,

858
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
you wouldn’t have suffered.

859
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,540
What do you know, young man?

860
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,620
Do I fatter clients for myself?

861
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,340
I do that for our company.

862
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,700
You’re never grateful.

863
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,220
He’s making a good point.

864
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,820
You can’t be the chief designer.

865
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,060
You can only be the team leader.

866
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,580
You need to cut your salary, too.

867
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,940
Or it’ll be unfair to other employees.

868
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,300
But I believe

869
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,820
when you focus on designing,

870
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,180
everything will

871
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,780
return to normal.

872
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
What do you mean?

873
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,700
Just answer me.

874
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,740
Do you want to come back?

875
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,940
Yes.

876
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
I can’t believe it.

877
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,220
All right, Mr. Liu.

878
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,100
Don’t be too happy.

879
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
You can come back.

880
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,580
But you must sign a non-competition agreement

881
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,340
Within five years,

882
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,820
if you dare to have another job-hopping,

883
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,180
we can sue you.

884
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,420
I won’t. I won’t.

885
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,740
No matter who asks me to leave,

886
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,900
I won’t do it again.

887
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
Who asked you?

888
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,060
No one.

889
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,100
I just lost my mind.

890
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,060
Mr. Fang.

891
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,820
Thank you.

892
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,180
You convinced me.

893
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,460
Let’s go.

894
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,140
Do you need to be so happy?

895
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,860
Sure.

896
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,780
Because we got Xingcheng project?

897
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,700
Not exactly.

898
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,780
I just didn’t expect that

899
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,260
you would forgive Liu Tianyang.

900
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,540
He’s a competent designer.

901
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Otherwise,

902
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,780
I wouldn’t have asked him to work for me.

903
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,380
But his experience hindered him

904
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,740
from developing his design ability.

905
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,500
Anyway, I sympathize with him.

906
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,180
He’s always scolded by a young man.

907
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,220
If I were him,

908
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,580
I wouldn’t bear with that, either.

909
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
I’m glad you know.

910
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,740
Why don’t you change your temper?

911
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,660
I can’t.

912
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
You’ll have to help.

913
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,740
Be nice to me, then.

914
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,100
What?

915
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,180
Are you feeling bad?

916
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,900
Liu Tianyang said

917
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,460
someone asked him to leave.

918
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,460
You’re suspecting

919
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,380
my dad?

920
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,820
No.

921
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,340
I guess

922
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
it’s someone else.

923
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,020
Someone else?

924
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,740
Who?

925
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,660
Mr. Fang.

926
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,500
They’re celebrating in there.

927
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,940
Would you like a drink, too?

928
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,260
This is what you want.

929
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,020
Open it.

930
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,140
What’s this?

931
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,820
It’s so beautiful.

932
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,460
It’s for you.

933
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,700
For me?

934
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,620
This moon lamp is for you.

935
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,460
But you shouldn’t be like the moon,

936
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,860
waiting to be lit up.

937
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,300
You should be the sun.

938
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
You’re the only one

939
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,460
