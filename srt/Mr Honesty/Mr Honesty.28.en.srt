Why don’t you open it?

I won’t.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,600
Leave him inside.

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
What a cliché!

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,840
Miss Xia Di,

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,080
open it now.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,600
What if it’s not Gu Bo inside?

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,840
Yeah.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,960
People are watching you.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Open the box.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Fine.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,880
Surprise!

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
Hello, sweetie.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
Are you surprised?

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,360
Are you excited?

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,600
Sweetie,

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,840
let me out.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Squatting there makes my back hurt.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,480
Mom,

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,640
be careful.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,400
Are you thrilled?

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360
What’s this? What are you doing?

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,480
You didn’t invite me

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
to your celebration.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
I had to come unannounced.

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,920
Your presence doesn’t have to be...

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
A surprise, right?

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,040
This is nothing.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,400

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600

Xia Di,

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680
please marry me!

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,680
He loves joking.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,520
We’re being watched.

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Knock it off! Get up.

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,120
I won’t.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
I’m not joking.

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
Didn’t you say if your books were sold out,

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
you’d marry me?

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
When did I ever say that?

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,400
Even if I did,

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
I said it as a joke.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
Why did you take it seriously?

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
It wasn’t a joke to me.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,280
I am serious.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,760
Xia Di,

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
I love you.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
You love me, too, don’t you?

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,000
Aren’t we

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
happy together?

75
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,600
We are,

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,960
but I’ve never considered marrying you.

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,520
Fine,

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,080
if you don’t want to be my Mrs. Gu,

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
I can be your Mr. Xia.

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,880
I mean it.

81
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,680
Gu Bo...

82
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Xia Di,

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,280
Gu Bo cares so much about you.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
To prepare for this proposal,

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
he booked the entire bar

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,400
and went all the way to pick me up

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,960
just so

88
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
I could be your witness.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,000
You know?

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,720
He’s a rare catch.

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Don’t lose him.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Mom,

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
what’s wrong with you?

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
How did Gu Bo win you over?

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,360
Didn’t you think he’s young

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
and penniless?

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,000
I was narrow-minded.

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,840
But now, I think you’re perfect together.

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
I support you.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
You too, don’t you?

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,680
Marry him!

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
I won’t.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,840
What did you say?

104
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,920
I won’t.

105
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
Why not?

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
Tell me,

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
what’s wrong with my boy?

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
How is he your boy?

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
There’s nothing wrong with him.

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,440
But now, it’s too soon to marry.

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,400
Too soon?

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
When will you marry then?

113
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,880
Wait till

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I become

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
one of the best comic book writers.

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,080
Oh, well,

117
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,600
you’ll grow old alone.

118
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,760
Mom, I’m your daughter, aren’t I?

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Don’t you know

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,200
how popular my new book is?

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,680
I don’t.

122
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,000
All I know is

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
Gu Bo bought all those leftovers

124
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
with his salaries when he was still an intern.

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
Don’t tell her that.

126
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,280
Really?

127
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
No way!

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,400
Are you an idiot?

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
Enough!

130
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
Don’t worry.

131
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
I know what I’m doing.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
You’ll have to tell her sooner or later.

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,800
His family holds Square & Circle’s shares.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Hey,

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,080
Xia Di,

136
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,080
I know

137
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
you don’t like rich men,

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,040
right?

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I’ve tested him.

140
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,840
Turns out, he’s

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
hopelessly in love with you.

142
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,280
He only cares about you

143
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
and he cherishes you wholeheartedly.

144
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
That’s why I’ve agreed

145
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
to entrust you to him.

146
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,920
Really.

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Impossible!

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,840
He lied to you.

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
He pretended to be rich to fool me once.

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,240
That’s impossible!

151
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,280
Ask Xu Yiren.

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,640
Doesn’t her boyfriend own Square & Circle?

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Xia Di...

154
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Is it true?

155
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,840
Actually...

156
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,360
Is it true or not?

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
I can explain.

158
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,720
I’m listening.

159
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,200
It’s not what you think.

160
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,440
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

161
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,040
I...

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,440
I have no idea

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
how things have gone this far.

164
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,480
You have no idea.

165
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,680
You don’t know.

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
You don’t know, either.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
The whole world knows but I don’t.

168
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,200
I’m the only fool, aren’t I?

169
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,240
Xia Di, I’m sorry.

170
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Xia Di...

171
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Go away!

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
You’re my best friend.

173
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,280
The one and only.

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,200
Why did you also lie to me?

175
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,960
- Are you going to give me that you-had-no-choice-
- I...

176
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,320
and-it-was-for-my-best crap again?

177
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,600
Xu Yiren,

178
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
whether to choose the lie or the truth

179
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
should be up to me,

180
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
not you.

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Xia Di...

182
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,720
Xu Yiren,

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
you haven’t changed at all.

184
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
There’s one thing

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
she forbids me from telling you.

186
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,600
But after consideration,

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,640
I think you should know the truth.

188
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,880
Ms. He!

189
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,960
I’m sorry, Xu Yiren.

190
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
I can no longer tolerate

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,880
your lies.

192
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Zhiyou,

193
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
your father

194
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
faked his illness.

195
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
She knew that long ago

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,480
and promised your father to keep it from you.

197
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,800
Fang Zhiyou,

198
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
I can explain.

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
I...

200
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,360
Fine.

201
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
Explain it.

202
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,000
What now?

203
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
Are you speechless?

204
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,880
It’s true, isn’t it?

205
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you remember your promise to me?

206
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You don’t?

207
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
I’m sorry.

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,600
Why did you lie to me?

209
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
And you did it with him!

210
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Fang Zhiyou,

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
calm down.

212
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Forget it.

213
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Whatever coming out of your mouth

214
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,400
is nothing but lies.

215
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
Fang Zhiyou,

216
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,520
don’t go.

217
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
I’m so sorry.

218
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,000
Please don’t leave.

219
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,040
Let me go.

220
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Fang Zhiyou,

221
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,240
Zhiyou!

222
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,080
Zhiyou!

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
Zhiyou, where are you going?

224
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,920
I know you’re mad.

225
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,280
Whenever you were upset,

226
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,200
I was always there for you.

227
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,200
I don’t need you.

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,800
Stop following me.

229
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
It’s OK.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I can wait.

231
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,680
Anyway, you’ve realized

232
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,840
Xu Yiren isn’t that special.

233
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,960
Zhiyou,

234
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
ever since that incident,

235
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
you’ve never set foot in my office again.

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,760
I thought people could change

237
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,800
but I was wrong.

238
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
You’re still you,

239
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,600
a disgusting liar!

240
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,400
I guess

241
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Xu Yiren

242
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,040
must have told you everything.

243
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800
Why did you drag her down?

244
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
You knew she was all I had.

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,840
Why?

246
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,800
I’m

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,360
a manipulative

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
and unscrupulous liar.

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
You know that.

250
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,400
From now on,

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,480
you and I are done.

252
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,760
You’re my best friend.

253
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,960
The one and only.

254
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Why did you also lie to me?

255
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
- Are you going to give me that you-had-no-choice
- I...

256
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
and-it-was-for-my-best crap again?

257
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,360
Xu Yiren,

258
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
whether to choose the lie or the truth

259
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,920
should be up to me,

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
not you.

261
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
Fang Zhiyou,

262
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
don’t go.

263
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
I’m so sorry.

264
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,040
Please don’t leave.

265
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,560
Let me go.

266
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,160
Fang Zhiyou,

267
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Zhiyou!

268
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,800
How did this happen?

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
Yiren.

270
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,880
Hello?

271
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,120
I need you.

272
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
I’m scared.

273
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,480
Shiyu!

274
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,240
How is your dad?

275
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
The doctor is still inside.

276
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,240
My dad’s assistant

277
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,200
saw him in his office unconscious.

278
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
My brother didn’t answer his phone,

279
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
so he called me.

280
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,400
Yiren,

281
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
I’m scared.

282
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,400
It’s OK.

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
The doctor is with him.

284
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
He will be fine.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,560
Don’t worry.

286
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
Professor Xu,

287
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,960
how is Mr. Fang?

288
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
He had

289
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
a mood swing

290
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,760
which elevated his blood pressure.

291
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,040
He’s stable now. He’s fine.

292
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,880
Don’t worry.

293
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,080
Luckily,

294
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,000
it wasn’t a stroke.

295
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
If he had a stroke,

296
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
plus his Alzheimer’s...

297
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
Professor Qu,

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,520
you can stop covering for him.

299
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
We know

300
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,280
he faked his illness.

301
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,360
He faked it?

302
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
He admitted it himself

303
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,080
that he doesn’t have Alzheimer’s.

304
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,600
He lied only to...

305
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
Impossible!

306
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,920
I diagnosed him myself

307
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,520
and I’ve been responsible

308
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,640
for his treatment.

309
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
A fake one?

310
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,960
I’m a doctor.

311
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,720
Even if the patient tried to fake it,

312
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,040
I wouldn’t cooperate with him

313
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,120
to fool you.

314
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,680
But

315
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,080
your assistant said

316
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
there wasn’t his medical record

317
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,280
and you didn’t prescribe him

318
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,680
any medicine for that disease.

319
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,400
Mr. Fang

320
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,480
asked him to keep it a secret

321
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,400
for the sake of his law firm.

322
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,440
Hadn’t you found out about it,

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,560
I wouldn’t even tell Fang Zhiyou.

324
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
I tested his pills.

325
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
They’re vitamins for seniors.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,160
Yiren,

327
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,320
I switched out his sleeping pills.

328
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,080
He was taking them for a while.

329
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,880
I read online

330
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,240
that people take them for mental comfort.

331
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,760
Vitamins would work just the same.

332
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,080
So I switched his pills.

333
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,440
It’s OK.

334
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
Professor Qu,

335
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
may I see him now?

336
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,760
Sure,

337
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,920
but don’t press him.

338
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
I won’t.

339
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,160
Shiyu,

340
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,600
I’d like to talk to your dad alone.

341
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Can you wait here for me?

342
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,320
Good girl.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Mr. Fang.

344
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,720
Have a seat.

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
You must have

346
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,440
known the truth.

347
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,440
Why did you lie to me?

348
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,240
You’re just like Fang Zhiyou

349
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,200
with no sense of humor.

350
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,200
This isn’t humorous at all.

351
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,160
What I told you that day

352
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,000
was partly true.

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,080
Letting you discover my illness

354
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
was also part of my plan.

355
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,000
I wanted you to tell Fang Zhiyou

356
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,400
about my illness

357
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,360
and I knew you could make him come home.

358
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Eventually,

359
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,360
you did it.

360
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,880
What place trust in me?

361
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,080
I know my son.

362
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,200
He’s never looked at others

363
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,480
the way he looks at you,

364
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,280
not even He Yuwen.

365
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,000
She’s been with him for years,

366
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,200
but he’s never paid extra attention

367
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
to her at all.

368
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,640
That day,

369
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,280
when I see you two

370
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,960
in front of my wife’s tomb,

371
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
I realized

372
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
you’re special

373
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,200
to him.

374
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,560
But I didn’t expect

375
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,200
what happened to Li Zhe and his family

376
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,560
would affect him

377
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,720
so much.

378
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
I can’t apologize

379
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,920
not only because

380
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,600
it concerns my own dignity,

381
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,320
but also

382
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,560
the credibility of my law firm.

383
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,000
The price is huge.

384
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,320
So you sacrificed Fang Zhiyou again?

385
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,880
I was selfish.

386
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,840
I thought as long as he came back

387
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
and started to talk to me,

388
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,760
after a while,

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,320
our relationship

390
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,920
would be eased.

391
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
I couldn’t tell what was wrong

392
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,040
with that report.

393
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,080
But at that exact moment,

394
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,800
I seemed to have an epiphany

395
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,520
as if someone was telling me

396
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,240
if I wasn’t sick,

397
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,360
Zhiyou

398
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,680
wouldn’t have to be caught

399
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,480
between me and Li Zhe.

400
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,680
So you admitted that you were faking your illness.

401
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,320
Why didn’t you let me tell him?

402
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,240
I’d like to see

403
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
how much

404
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
you’d do for him.

405
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
After all,

406
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,240
he’s going to spend the rest of his life with you.

407
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,080
That’s absurd!

408
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,400
Do lawyers like you

409
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,120
love digging into people’s hearts?

410
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,800
Is that fun?

411
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,680
No.

412
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
I’m not getting any younger.

413
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
Zhiyou

414
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,760
and Shiyu

415
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
will have their future without me.

416
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,200
Right now,

417
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,680
I can only see as much as I can

418
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
before it’s too late.

419
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
Yiren,

420
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
I have one more favor to ask.

421
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
Please don’t tell Fang Zhiyou

422
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
about what happened today.

423
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,200
I won’t lie for you anymore.

424
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,040
But you have nothing to worry about.

425
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
Whatever I tell him now,

426
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,360
he won’t believe me again.

427
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,160
Get some rest.

428
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,880
I’m leaving.

429
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,720
Xia Di,

430
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,560
I know you’re up there.

431
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,600
Xia Di, open the door.

432
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Just hear me out, OK?

433
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,440
Xia Di,

434
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,200
let me explain.

435
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

436
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,840
Hey, when we first met,

437
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,560
you didn’t ask me

438
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
if I’m rich.

439
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Wait, do you remember

440
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,360
last time,

441
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,560
I told you the truth.

442
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,360
I told you everything, but you didn’t believe me.

443
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,000
I...

444
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,240
Hey...

445
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,800
Look, Xia Di,

446
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
you can vent all your anger on me.

447
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
Just open the door first, OK?

448
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,720
Xia Di, let me in.

449
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,040
I know it’s my fault.

450
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,520
Xia Di.

451
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
From now on,

452
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,920
you and I are over.

453
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,320
Hey...

454
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,800
Don’t...

455
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,120
Xia Di,

456
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,880
I disagree.

457
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,320
I’ll never agree.

458
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,920
Xia Di,

459
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,400
listen,

460
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
you can ask me to do anything,

461
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,400
but I won’t break up with you

462
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
even if I die!

463
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,280
Xia Di...

464
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,240
Go die!

465
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
No, Xia Di.

466
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,840
If I die,

467
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
no one will love you as much as I do.

468
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
You’ll be sad.

469
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,640
Xia Di, open the door!

470
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
I’m really sorry.

471
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Xia Di.

472
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Xia Di, open the door.

473
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,600
I won’t leave you, Xia Di!

474
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,840
Please open the door.

475
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,160
Open it!

476
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
I can’t stand

477
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,840
your so-called white lies.

478
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,840
From this moment on,

479
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
you and I

480
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,680
are strangers.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
There’s nothing left between us.

482
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,200
Xia Di, don’t be so serious.

483
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,120
Listen to me, please!

484
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,880
Get out!

485
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Xia Di, I can explain.

486
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,760
Xia...

487
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Out!

488
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,280
Don’t push yourself too hard.

489
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,520
And don’t worry about work.

490
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
I’ll take care of it.

491
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,640
Go home and rest.

492
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,280
I said

493
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,160
I don’t need you.

494
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Alright then.

495
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,280
Maybe to you,

496
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,880
work

497
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,640
is the best way to get over a failed relationship.

498
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,000
Who says it failed?

499
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,400
OK.

500
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
You can take care

501
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
of your personal business.

502
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
But I have to ask

503
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,760
about the work arrangement.

504
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,160
Will Xu Yiren

505
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,480
still remain

506
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
as your assistant?

507
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,360
Zhiyou,

508
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
why didn’t you answer my calls?

509
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,680
Zhiyou,

510
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
I’ll leave you and Shiyu alone.

511
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,840
I’m out.

512
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,800
Come with me.

513
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,600
Dad is sick.

514
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,880
I know it.

515
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,160
What does he have now?

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,280
It’s real.

517
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,640
He didn’t lie.

518
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,760
I wrote this recommendation letter for you.

519
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,880
Take it.

520
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
You’ll have a better chance to be hired.

521
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,240
If it fails,

522
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,200
I can get you a job in Liangshan.

523
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,520
You will be paid just as well.

524
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
At this stage,

525
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,720
what’s the point of doing this?

526
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Why did you do that?

527
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
You mean

528
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,160
why I told Fang Zhiyou

529
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,640
about his father’s sickness?

530
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,720
Why couldn’t I?

531
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,920
I simply said the truth.

532
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,640
Professionally speaking,

533
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
I didn’t do anything wrong.

534
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,760
I’ve never come late or left early.

535
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,000
Nor have I broken any rules.

536
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
My performance is recognized by everyone.

537
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
You have no reason to fire me.

538
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,680
Xu Yiren...

539
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,640
Call me shameless

540
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
or dull,

541
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,120
anyway,

542
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,320
I’m not leaving.

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
Have you considered Fang Zhiyou?

544
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,040
With you here,

545
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,440
how will he feel?

546
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,440
I want to be selfish just this once.

547
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,840
But Fang Zhiyou...

548
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,040
He didn’t give me the boot,

549
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,800
did he?

550
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,280
I’m his assistant.

551
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,160
I won’t leave

552
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,520
unless he tells me to.

553
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,200
Fine.

554
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,840
You can stay.

555
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,720
But given your current condition,

556
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,160
you can’t keep working as his assistant.

557
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,880
If you insist on staying,

558
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,760
you’ll be transferred to another position.

559
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,000
Sure.

560
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
As long as I can stay,

561
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,560
I’ll do anything.

562
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
How could I tell

563
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
if this isn’t another lie he told?

564
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,640
Fang Zhiyou!

565
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
Even if it’s true,

566
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
it has nothing to do with me.

567
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
How could you do this?

568
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,600
Why couldn’t I?

569
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,400
He lied to me over and over.

570
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
How am I supposed to believe him again?

571
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
Have you never lied to me?

572
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
Didn’t you and dad

573
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,760
keep his illness from me?

574
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,160
How are you different from Xu Yiren?

575
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,080
Why are you mad at her?

576
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,600
Stop sticking your nose

577
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,040
into our business.

578
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,960
You think I wanted to?

579
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,160
I was afraid you’d end up alone.

580
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,640
Yiren.

581
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,440
Ms. He.

582
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
Attention, everyone.

583
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,200
Starting from today,

584
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,560
Xu Yiren will no longer work

585
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
as Mr. Fang’s assistant.

586
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
And

587
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Yu Qing

588
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,280
will replace her.

589
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Ms. He!

590
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,200
That’s Admin’s decision.

591
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,960
You said you’d follow it.

592
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,280
Are you having second thoughts?

593
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,600
No.

594
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,960
Good.

595
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
From now on,

596
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,840
you’ll take Yu Qing’s position.

597
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,680
Thank you, Ms. He.

598
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
I’ll give it my all.

599
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,040
Mr. Fang,

600
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
are you...

601
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
OK with my arrangement?

602
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
I’m taking Shiyu home.

603
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,440
Call me if there’s an emergency.

604
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,440
Yiren.

605
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,840
It’s OK.

606
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,320
Go home with your brother.

607
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,480
Go.

608
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Go ahead.

609
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,240
Back to work.

610
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,560
Yiren...

611
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
The view here is indeed better.

612
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,320
Yiren,

613
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,720
thanks a lot.

614
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,800
Get in.

615
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,800
Fang Zhiyou, you suck!

616
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,760
Where are you going?

617
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,560
I’d rather walk than ride with you.

618
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
Xia Di,

619
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,240
can we talk?

620
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,480
No.

621
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Xia Di,

622
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,200
you’re right.

623
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
Whether to choose the lie or the truth

624
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,960
is up to you.

625
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,960
I lied to my best friend

626
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,080
and boyfriend.

627
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,320
I had this coming.

628
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,400
What happened between you and Fang Zhiyou?

629
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,800
We...

630
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Never mind. Save it.

631
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,680
I don’t want to know.

632
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,800
I’m sorry, Xia Di.

633
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,040
I’ll leave.

634
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
Once you’re in a better mood,

635
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,840
we can talk again.

636
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,960
That’s unnecessary.

637
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
I’m going to stay at a hotel for two months.

638
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
If Gu Bo shows up again,

639
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,920
just kick him out.

640
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,760
Xia Di,

641
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,440
you...

642
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,680
you don’t...

643
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,840
you don’t need to do this.

644
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,320
Do you have somewhere else to go?

645
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,320
Xia Di...

646
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,120
I’m not doing this for you.

647
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
I’m simply avoiding you.

648
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,680
Mr. Li,

649
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,040
Xie Dongren will soon be prosecuted.

650
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,360
They’ll look into Jiaye’s financial problem, too.

651
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,120
Our lawyer said we have a big shot to win.

652
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
You have nothing to worry about.

653
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
Information about the Zhiwu Library Project

654
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,400
has been sent to your mailbox.

655
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,040
That project is still calling for bids,

656
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,080
so there isn’t much about it.

657
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,440
But both Square & Circle and Liangshan

658
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,760
will bid for it.

659
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,400
What is this?

660
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,720
Didn’t you say

661
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,440
you wanted to build a house

662
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
to store

663
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,360
all fairy tale books

664
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,720
and then you wouldn’t

665
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,760
have to come out again?

666
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
This is good.

667
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,320
But I don’t like this corner.

668
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,720
It’s ugly.

669
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
No, it’s not.

670
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,480
Yours is ugly.

671
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,720
Yours is.

672
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,960
Add a few lines here.

673
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,200
Go away!

674
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,320
Can’t you show some compassion?

675
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,040
I lost my girlfriend.

676
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,200
It’s your fault.

677
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,240
Fang Zhiyou,

678
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
although you’re my idol,

679
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,800
don’t think I wouldn’t diss you.

680
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,680
Hey,

681
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,480
are you really a human?

682
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,360
We both lost our girlfriends.

683
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,040
I can’t even eat a croissant.

684
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,480
How can you still be in the mood of reading?

685
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,680
I didn’t lose my girlfriend.

686
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,720
Yes.

687
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,720
You didn’t.

688
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,920
You simply

689
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,160
made Xu Yiren lose her boyfriend.

690
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,080
I wonder if Xia Di

691
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,200
is just as heartless

692
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,760
as you are.

693
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,760
No, no.

694
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,000
My girl would never be like you.

695
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,400
Look at me.

696
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,520
Am I pale enough?

697
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,360
If Xia Di

698
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,440
sees me like this,

699
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,160
will she worry about me?

700
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,520
I’m doing it!

701
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,160
Hey,

702
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,240
if I catch a cold,

703
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,240
will Xia Di

704
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,840
stop being mad at me?

705
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,120
Whatever you do now is of no use.

706
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,760
Since you told her the first lie,

707
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
you should have been ready

708
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,200
for the consequence.

709
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
Instead of reflecting on yourself,

710
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,600
you’re trying to tell more lies.

711
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,920
I don’t get it.

712
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Did I kill others

713
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,720
or destroy their ancestors’ tombs?

714
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,880
I mean,

715
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I simply

716
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,400
didn’t tell her my family is rich.

717
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,360
Technically,

718
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,880
that was not a lie

719
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,160
because it didn’t cause her any damage.

720
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,040
The lie itself

721
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,600
is damaging enough.

722
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,640
What’s that smell?

723
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,480
Repellent?

724
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,600
Yu Qing,

725
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,040
what’s the perfume you’re wearing?

726
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
So strong!

727
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,440
It’s a luxury brand

728
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,880
you don’t know of.

729
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,760
There’s perfume even I don’t know of?

730
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,560
Let me see what it is.

731
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,400
Guys, check it out.

732
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,320
Which brand?

733
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,400
What perfume is it?

734
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,640
This is her so-called luxury.

735
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,480
What is this?

736
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,240
What is it?

737
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,600
A real luxury brand!

738
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,520
Awesome!

739
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,280
Let me see.

740
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,560
Never seen it before.

741
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,280
Look,

742
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,760
it should be

743
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,000
“Dior”,

744
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,600
not “Dory”.

745
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,680
Dory!

746
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,120
Did you pay 100 Yuan for this knock-off?

747
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,720
100 is too much.

748
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,360
How cheap!

749
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,800
Luo Yang,

750
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,520
a package for you.

751
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,400
Thanks, Yiren.

752
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,320
You’re welcome.

753
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,320
Your, Chu Lin.

754
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Thanks.

755
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,560
No biggie.

756
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,240
The rest are all yours.

757
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Thank you, love.

758
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,840
You bought way too many clothes.

759
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,520
You should control yourself.

760
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,560
I need them emotionally.

761
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,800
Yiren,

762
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,240
when packages come next time,

763
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,000
you don’t need to bring them to us.

764
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,080
We can pick them up ourselves.

765
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,120
No big deal.

766
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
When I brought you packages,

767
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
you didn’t tell me to stop.

768
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,320
You...

769
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,080
It’s not the same.

770
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,960
Exactly.

771
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,600
Xu Yiren,

772
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,960
go get takeout for ten.

773
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,040
Mr. Fang and the Design Department

774
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,840
will have a luncheon with our clients.

775
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,800
Didn’t you order it?

776
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,520
I forgot.

777
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,240
It’s too late to order it now.

778
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Go get it.

779
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,720
I don’t need to tell you

780
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,760
what Mr. Fang usually eats, do I?

781
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,720
Yu Qing,

782
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
you’re an assistant.

783
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
That’s the most basic work.

784
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,080
Don’t lecture me.

785
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,760
Don’t forget

786
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,440
right now,

787
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
I’m Mr. Fang’s assistant.

788
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,320
And you

789
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,960
should run errands for us.

790
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,600
Go ahead.

791
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
If you’re back late,

792
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,040
we’ll all have to work on an empty stomach.

793
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,880
How could she

794
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,920
bring back so much food?

795
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,880
I’ll go with you.

796
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,480
Don’t worry, Sha Sha.

797
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,200
Go back to work.

798
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,280
I can do it.

799
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Can’t I catch any luck?

800
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,520
No need.

801
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,880
I can’t afford to pay you back.

802
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,600
Either I clean it for you,

803
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
or you do it yourself.

804
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,840
Thanks.

805
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,840
Why are you doing this?

806
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,360
What do you mean “this”?

807
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,000
Why can’t I do this?

808
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,920
All work is equal.

809
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,120
What happened?

810
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,920
I’m busy.

811
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,960
Can’t talk right now.

812
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,000
Thanks.

813
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,520
I must go!

814
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,280
Only 20 minutes left before the lunch break.

815
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,800
If I don’t go back in time,

816
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
our clients won’t have anything to eat.

817
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
I’ll take care of them.

818
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,840
You...

819
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,920
come with me.

820
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,120
You...

821
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,120
Let go of me!

822
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Mr. Wei, thank you

823
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,960
for telling us more about Zhiwu Library.

824
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,040
We have a clearer direction

825
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,520
of the design.

826
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,040
Next, allow me

827
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,920
to give you a brief introduction

828
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,360
to our plan and initial ideas.

829
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,080
It’s lunchtime.

830
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,640
How about

831
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,880
we continue after having lunch?

832
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,720
Sure.

833
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I do feel hungry.

834
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,800
Mr. Fang,

835
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,040
lunch has arrived.

836
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,640
Mr. Fang,

837
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,680
aren’t we going to have a quick meal?

838
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,280
This is too much.

839
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
We’re honored to have you here, Mr. Wei.

840
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,440
You should be well-received.

841
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,000
Thanks.

842
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,680
Mr. Fang,

843
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,400
this meal is Mr. Li’s treat

844
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,760
on behalf of Miss Xu Yiren.

845
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,600
Bon Appétit.

846
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,560
Which Mr. Li?

847
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
