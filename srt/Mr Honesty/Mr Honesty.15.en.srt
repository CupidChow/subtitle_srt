20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Dude.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,080
Here are so many other benches.

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,040
Don’t interfere when I feel sad, will you?

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Are you going to keep feeling sad

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,520
or have a talk with me?

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Idol?

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,640
You know how to make notes of experience.

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,680
Not a very stupid guy.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
What does it help

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
when I make good notes?

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I’m still not qualified to stay in your company.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
Why do you want to be a designer?

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,120
Because of you.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,880
Give me another reason.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
No.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
You want the truth, don’t you?

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,840
This is the truth.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,680
Everyone thinks I’m doing monkey business.

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,160
Even my father thinks

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
I have 3-minute passion.

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Well, I admit that

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
I wanted to be a designer

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
because I thought it was cool.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,680
But gradually,

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
I begin to love this industry.

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,920
I want to design buildings

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,760
with my name on them,

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
like you do.

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
I want to see people

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
live in houses I designed

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
and live their own lives.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
Xia Di told me

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
I couldn’t talk about my dream

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
unless I wanted to

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,080
strive for it.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
But I’ve really

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,200
tried my best.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
I still can’t make it.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Well, you’re a clever man.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
And you work hard.

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
What you need is experience and patience.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Compare to that,

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,000
I think more of

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
your attitude and responsibility.

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
In our industry,

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,480
there can be no error.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
One false step will

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,000
make a great difference.

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,320
Understand?

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,760
You and your father

70
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
are different.

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,760
But I still ignored it

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
for your father’s sake

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
when you resigned.

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,040
It means,

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,880
you used up the chance

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,840
to get help from your father.

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
From now on,

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,080
I’ll be stricter with you.

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
In this case,

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
do you still want to come back?

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Idol.

82
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
If you’re kidnapped,

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
wink to me.

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,040
It hurts.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,240
It hurts?

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh, it’s real?

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,560
Zhiyou.

88
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,160
I can stay?

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,840
You won’t fire me,

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,720
will you?

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
I didn’t mean to fire you.

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
You quitted your job.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
I don’t care.

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
Anyway, when you allow me to stay,

95
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,600
it means

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
I’m not that bad, isn’t it?

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
I have great potential, don’t I?

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
You can’t do without me,

99
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,200
right?

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,880
I knew it!

101
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
Don’t push it.

102
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,280
If you keep talking like that,

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
I’ll regret.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
Don’t.

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
Rest assured.

106
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
I will

107
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
work hard

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
and be your successor as early as I can.

109
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,840
You will.

110
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
Xia Di.

111
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
Xia Di.

112
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
Xia Di.

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,000
Xia Di?

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Xia Di.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,200
Xia Di.

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Finally...

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Finally, you’re back.

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,600
Where did you go last night?

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Your phone was power off.

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
Gu Bo, you’re getting

121
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
more uncontrollable.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
I was so sad.

123
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Then I checked in at a hotel.

124
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
Hotel?

125
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
Don’t get me wrong.

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
I stayed there alone

127
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,080
for a night.

128
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
What’s wrong?

129
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
I fell asleep when I waited for you.

130
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,320
I had a stiff neck, I think.

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,120
Don’t move.

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Let me give you a massage.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
It hurts!

134
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
You mean

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
you waited for me the whole night?

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Hmm.

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,560
You didn’t answer the phone.

138
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
I was worried.

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800
Worried about me?

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,040
Not very much.

141
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,200
I was just a bit worried.

142
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
That’s good, too.

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
My idol praised me.

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
My princess worried about me.

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
What a happy day today!

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,680
You look energetic.

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,000
Quite different.

148
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Sure.

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
You know what?

150
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I’m no longer what I was yesterday.

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
From today on,

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,600
I’ll work hard

153
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,920
and encourage myself.

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,600
I won’t let my idol down.

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,280
How did Fang Zhiyou inspire you?

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
He praised me.

157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,480
He said I was clever and had potential,

158
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
and when I worked hard,

159
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
I would succeed.

160
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,280
That’s true.

161
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
Fang Zhiyou never lies.

162
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,200
That’s right.

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,160
Good, then.

164
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,600
The trouble has gone away.

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,160
But...

166
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
I persuaded you for days.

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
In the end,

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,680
Fang Zhiyou helped you with only a few words.

169
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
Seems like your idol is more helpful

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,400
than your princess.

171
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,720
No way.

172
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
He’s my idol.

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
But you’re my princess.

174
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,200
Anyway,

175
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,440
I’ll always rely on you.

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,920
It hurts!

177
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

178
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,560
Here.

179
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me massage you a bit more.

180
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Madam.

181
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,680
This apartment has a good layout.

182
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
The community is of good quality

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,080
in this neighborhood.

184
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
It’s safe to live here.

185
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,480
The subway

186
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,360
is less than 500 meters away.

187
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,840
There are supermarkets and markets around.

188
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
It’s exactly what you want.

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,120
It’s really hard

190
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,240
to find this apartment.

191
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
This is the kitchen.

192
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,920
It looks good.

193
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
But I don’t remember

194
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,680
if I told your director

195
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,640
my expected price...

196
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
I know.

197
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,960
You’ll pay the price

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
you want.

199
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,160
Also,

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,360
you can pay monthly,

201
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,520
with a one-month deposit.

202
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you sure?

203
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Hmm.

204
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920
Such a good landlord?

205
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,080
Could this apartment be haunted?

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
It isn’t!

207
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
You know what?

208
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,840
Even if

209
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
the price doubles,

210
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
I can rent the apartment soon.

211
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
If it weren’t for...

212
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
For...

213
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,520
For what?

214
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
Nothing.

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,520
That’s why

216
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,400
I think

217
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
it’s your fate.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080
The landlord

219
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,800
has high demand

220
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
for the tenant.

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,600
It took me trouble

222
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
to find you

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,560
who fits the bill.

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
Win-win, isn’t it?

225
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
I want to meet the landlord.

226
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,000
The...

227
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
The landlord...

228
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,160
He...

229
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
He’s abroad.

230
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,560
Uh...

231
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,400
Uh...

232
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,360
He gave us carte blanche.

233
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
May I...

234
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,240
May I call him?

235
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,880
Uh...

236
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,640
Madam.

237
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
Don’t you believe me?

238
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
No.

239
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,640
If I can call him,

240
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I’ll do it.

241
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
If I can’t,

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
I won’t rent it.

243
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,160
But...

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,480
Madam.

245
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,360
Don’t go...

246
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
If you leave, I...

247
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
I can’t explain.

248
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,760
Take it back.

249
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
I knew this would happen.

250
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,960
That’s why I entrusted an intermediary.

251
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Why do we always cheat each other

252
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,120
when we meet?

253
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Fang Zhiyou said you approached me

254
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
to take revenge on him.

255
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,640
Is that true?

256
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
What do you think?

257
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,360
You’re avoiding my question.

258
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,520
So, it’s true?

259
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Sometimes, I wish

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
you weren’t so clever.

261
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,880
I’m not clever at all.

262
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,680
But I told you

263
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,600
we were alike.

264
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,640
So, you said

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
you wanted to be my friend.

266
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
You were also lying, huh?

267
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
Then why don’t you keep lying to me?

268
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
You saw me through.

269
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,720
I don’t need to keep lying.

270
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
What?

271
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
You realize

272
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,800
I lied to you to annoy Fang Zhiyou.

273
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,080
You’re disappointed?

274
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
Very disappointed.

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
I always thought

276
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,760
you were a warm and kind man,

277
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
even if I got to know

278
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
you tried every means to defeat Fang Zhiyou.

279
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,560
I don’t want to see you like that.

280
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,480
I know it’s not your fault.

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
But now...

282
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,200
So what?

283
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
You saw through at last.

284
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
You’re lucky.

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
It’s not too late.

286
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,480
If there isn’t a reason,

287
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
we’d better not meet again.

288
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
Mr. Li.

289
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
You could have explained to Xu Yiren.

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
There was nothing to explain.

291
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
She was right.

292
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,680
I cheated her and used her.

293
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
If someone cared for me,

294
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,080
helped me whenever I was in trouble

295
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
and looked for the apartment for my family,

296
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,440
just to use me,

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
I’d rather be used.

298
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,920
You’re talking too much.

299
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
It’s the problem between Fang Zhiyou and me.

300
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
I shouldn’t have

301
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,480
got her involved.

302
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Since she doesn’t want to meet me,

303
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,160
let’s not meet then.

304
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Tomorrow,

305
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,120
give this to her for me.

306
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,640
Aye.

307
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,120
What are you doing?

308
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,360
You freak me out.

309
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Did you go to

310
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
see Li Zhe?

311
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
How did you know?

312
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,320
Why did you go?

313
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
You like him?

314
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
No.

315
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,960
I don’t.

316
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,720
I don’t believe you.

317
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
What do I do then?

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
I’ll punish you.

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,680
How?

320
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,440
I want strawberries

321
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
on your neck.

322
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
Oh, it was a dream.

323
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,720
Yiren.

324
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
Get up!

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,560
I’m going to school.

326
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
I’m getting late.

327
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Okay.

328
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
Hurry up.

329
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Yiren, hurry up.

330
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,000
I’m getting late.

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
Hurry up.

332
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,720
The breakfast is done.

333
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,400
Eat it.

334
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,640
When I went out for running,

335
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
I bought strawberries in the supermarket.

336
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,400
Come.

337
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Have some strawberries.

338
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,920
No.

339
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Who has strawberries in the morning?

340
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
What a freak!

341
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
It’s sweet.

342
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,480
Freak.

343
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
How do you plan the follow-ups

344
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,520
for Moon Bay Resort?

345
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,720
Watercolor painting and manual modeling

346
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,400
helped a lot.

347
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,440
But we still depended on luck.

348
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,680
Next,

349
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,720
we still need a legitimate modeling company.

350
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
I think so, too.

351
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,120
We need a professional company

352
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,080
to implement the project.

353
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,640
Dasheng is a good company,

354
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,520
I think.

355
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
Oh,

356
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
why don’t you

357
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,840
have Xu Yiren look for

358
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
the modeling company?

359
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Xu Yiren?

360
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
Why?

361
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,920
She’s Li Zhe’s close friend.

362
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,640
Maybe she can help us persuade Li Zhe

363
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
to cooperate with us.

364
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,680
You get her wrong.

365
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,240
She knows Li Zhe,

366
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,520
but they’re not close.

367
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,640
Really?

368
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,240
They are not

369
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
in a relationship?

370
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,440
Then why did she meet Li Zhe alone

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,480
when we were having team building?

372
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Anyway, they’re not in a relationship.

373
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
You’re so sure?

374
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,120
Well, I think

375
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,760
it’s good if Xu Yiren and Li Zhe

376
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,840
are in a relationship.

377
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,920
It’s good news

378
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
for us.

379
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,440
I think she will help to

380
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,560
persuade Li Zhe.

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,520
Anyway,

382
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
we’re not going to cooperate with Dasheng.

383
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,080
I’ll look for the modeling company myself.

384
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,200
Look at Xu Yiren.

385
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
She’s brilliant.

386
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,080
In this case,

387
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
shall I find another assistant for you?

388
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,680
Why?

389
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,360
If Xu Yiren is in a relationship with Li Zhe,

390
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
she shouldn’t be staying

391
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,520
in our company.

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Also,

393
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,480
I don’t think

394
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
Li Zhe will let her work so hard.

395
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
Think about it carefully.

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,840
I’ll leave you alone.

397
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
What are you looking for, Yiren?

398
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
My watch.

399
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,200
I remember I left it in the office.

400
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
But I didn’t find it the whole morning.

401
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,040
Stop looking.

402
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
When the old is lost,

403
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,120
the new one will come.

404
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
I wore it for years.

405
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,880
Let me help you.

406
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,640
What color is your watch?

407
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,120
Golden.

408
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,440
According to the constellation divination,

409
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,120
I’ll lose money this month.

410
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,600
Can it be true?

411
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
Don’t trust that.

412
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,680
Hey, Yiren.

413
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
You freak me out.

414
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,480
What do you come for?

415
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,760
Why are you sighing

416
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,320
in the early morning?

417
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,640
I lost my watch.

418
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
I can’t find it now.

419
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,440
You lost your watch?

420
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
- Did you leave it somewhere? - It’s not here.

421
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,280
By the way,

422
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,000
Xia Di asked me to tell you

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,360
to go back home for dinner.

424
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,840
Her mother sent her

425
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
such a big piece of ham.

426
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,120
She wants me to cook, doesn’t she?

427
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
That’s the same thing.

428
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,320
Yiren.

429
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,600
See?

430
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
Someone wants to see you.

431
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
What brings you here?

432
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
To give your watch back.

433
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Why do you have it?

434
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,680
I wondered why you left early yesterday.

435
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,200
So, you dated a handsome guy.

436
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,520
Don’t talk nonsense.

437
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,240
I didn’t date her.

438
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,520
Mr. Li did.

439
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
After you left,

440
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,440
Mr. Li found this.

441
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,760
And he fixed the watchband.

442
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
He asked me to give it back to you.

443
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Sounds weird.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Don’t be scared.

445
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Let me help you

446
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,120
figure out what’s happening.

447
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,840
What bad luck!

448
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
I smell an explosive situation.

449
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,320
Idol.

450
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
How explosive you are!

451
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,280
Don’t be angry.

452
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
Keep cool.

453
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,200
Yiren just

454
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
dated Li Zhe

455
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,360
yesterday.

456
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,280
No, not dated.

457
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,600
They just

458
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,080
met each other.

459
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
You know what?

460
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,840
You’re being jealous

461
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,720
so frequently.

462
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,960
Be careful,

463
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,920
or it’s not good for health.

464
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
Shut up.

465
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,440
Even if I shut up,

466
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,520
you’re still jealous.

467
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,680
Dude.

468
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,840
It’s normal

469
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,400
to fall in love with someone.

470
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Don’t resist it.

471
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,760
Besides...

472
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,560
If you fail to say it out,

473
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,840
you can express your feelings by action.

474
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,160
I’m sure

475
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,560
Yiren will understand.

476
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,440
You know what?

477
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The mouth

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,640
has a more important function,

479
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,400
besides speaking.

480
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Do you know what it is?

481
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,440
Talking nonsense like you do.

482
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
To kiss, dude.

483
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
I want to whisper to your ear

484
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,680
and kiss your face.

485
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
My love

486
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
is to be romantic

487
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
to you.

488
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,160
Are you alright?

489
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
Forget it.

490
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,120
You won’t understand.

491
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,880
Just tell me.

492
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,920
Do you need me

493
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,680
to figure out

494
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,840
if Xu Yiren likes you?

495
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,560
No.

496
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,560
Keep being proud.

497
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
You’ll regret someday.

498
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Kiss?

499
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,720
How to kiss?

500
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
Mr. Fang.

501
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you occupied?

502
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
What would you like to eat?

503
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
I’ll buy it in the supermarket.

504
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,600
Don’t you have anything else to tell me,

505
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,600
except this?

506
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
You reversed the book.

507
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,600
And?

508
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
I met Li Zhe yesterday.

509
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,400
He asked an intermediary to find me an apartment.

510
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
But I didn’t know

511
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,400
he owned that apartment.

512
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,880
Find an apartment?

513
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,960
Are you so anxious

514
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,120
to move out?

515
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
What’s the problem of my house?

516
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,720
It’s not for me.

517
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,720
Your house is perfect.

518
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,240
But I can’t always stay.

519
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
No one expels you.

520
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,040
Do you prefer to be helped by Li Zhe,

521
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,760
rather than me?

522
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
Why must I

523
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,520
be helped by others?

524
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
Or do you think

525
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
I can do nothing without you?

526
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
At least, I’m paying you.

527
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,560
I know.

528
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,240
I know I’m merely your assistant.

529
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,120
I don’t mean that.

530
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,360
What do you mean then?

531
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,680
Mr. Fang, do you know

532
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,400
you’re really confusing me?

533
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,600
What you said

534
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,280
gives me an illusion that...

535
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
that...

536
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
that if you like me.

537
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,560
So, it’s my illusion.

538
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,280
Right?

539
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,080
So, please.

540
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,360
Don’t be so nice to me.

541
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,200
Don’t always lose temper

542
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,280
because of Li Zhe.

543
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,120
If you’re jealous...

544
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Why are you jealous when you don’t like me?

545
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,520
If you’re not jealous,

546
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,160
you must be hating me

547
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,400
because you hate Li Zhe?

548
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
No.

549
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,640
No what?

550
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
You’re not jealous?

551
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
Or it’s not my illusion?

552
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
You must explain to me clearly today.

553
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,640

What sound?

570
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,560
Don’t be scared.

571
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,920
It must be Yiren.

572
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,840
Go open the door.

573
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,960
My legs are numb.

574
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I’m not going.

575
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
It hurts!

576
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,040
Still numb?

577
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,160
Go open the door.

578
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,960
Gu Bo, what are you doing?

579
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,160
You freak me out.

580
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,640
There you are, finally.

581
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
We’re starving.

582
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,800
The kitchen is ready for you.

583
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
What’s wrong?

584
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,000
Looks like you saw a ghost.

585
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
I did.

586
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,440
Though

587
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
I don’t know what to say,

588
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,920
I know what to do.

589
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
What did you say?

590
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
Fang Zhiyou kissed you?

591
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,640
Keep your voice down.

592
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,840
Let me confirm it.

593
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
You

594
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,480
and Fang Zhiyou

595
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,760
kissed each other

596
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,920
mouth to mouth?

597
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Where are you going?

598
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,680
To get some wine.

599
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,120
What an exciting moment!

600
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
We must celebrate it.

601
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,200
Stop it.

602
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,840
What wine!

603
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,720
Seriously?

604
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,280
I’m worried.

605
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,000
What are you worried about?

606
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
The assistant eats dirt

607
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,280
and gets her cool boss

608
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,680
who is always single.

609
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,600
It’s exactly what happens in a comic book.

610
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,480
Awesome.

611
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,160
I’ve got stories to update.

612
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,320
How inhuman you are!

613
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,880
I’m worrying,

614
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,360
but you’re still thinking about your comics.

615
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,920
How inhuman you are!

616
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Instead of treating me dinner for such good luck,

617
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,320
you pull a long face.

618
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,840
Smile.

619
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,840
Go on.

620
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,680
What happened later?

621
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
What did he say

622
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,400
after he kissed you?

623
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,120
No idea.

624
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
Ah?

625
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
You ran away?

626
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,520
You just ran away?

627
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,200
My mind was going blank.

628
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
When I came to myself,

629
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,400
I had been out of the office.

630
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,400
When you ran away after kissing him,

631
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
it was as bad as

632
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,080
you didn’t buy the fruits in the market

633
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,360
after trying some.

634
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,200
He kissed me.

635
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,040
Then tell me.

636
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,320
What do you think?

637
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
What?

638
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you like him?

639
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
If you like him,

640
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,960
that’s okay.

641
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,040
If you don’t like him,

642
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,400
you have had bad luck.

643
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,040
But you just said I had good luck.

644
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,280
Cut the crap.

645
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Get to the point.

646
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,160
All right.

647
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
You don’t need to answer.

648
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Where’s your phone?

649
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,080
What?

650
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,520
Find your phone

651
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,400
and call Fang Zhiyou.

652
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,360
Tell him you like him

653
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
and I agree on

654
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,520
your relationship.

655
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,840
Stop it.

656
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,920
He didn’t say he liked me.

657
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,320
I’m still confused,

658
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,240
however hard I think about it.

659
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,400
Tell me.

660
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,440
How come he likes me?

661
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Come on.

662
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
Xu Yiren.

663
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,400
Are you too simple

664
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,960
or stupid?

665
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Does Fang Zhiyou ever joke?

666
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,400
He doesn’t even lie.

667
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,120
When he kissed you,

668
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,480
could he be joking with you?

669
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,400
But,

670
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,880
he didn’t

671
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
confess his feeling to me.

672
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Oh, that’s what annoys you.

673
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,000
Send me a red packet.

674
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
What a surprise to see you

675
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,600
falling in love!

676
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,920
You managed to confess your love.

677
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,600
You must send me a red packet.

678
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,580
= Gu Bo =

679
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,420
= Mr. Fang =

680
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,160
Hello?

681
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,680
Well done, Zhiyou.

682
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,960
You’re an actionist.

683
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,920
What do you mean?

684
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,360
Did you really confess your feeling to Yiren

685
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,560
and kissed her?

686
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,480
Yes.

687
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
I...

688
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
I kissed her.

689
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,720
What a surprise!

690
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,160
Yesterday, you played numb

691
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,560
and asked me for help.

692
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,960
Turns out you’re experienced

693
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,280
and you took action so fast.

694
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
I admire you.

695
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,560
I really do.

696
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
She...

697
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,680
What does Xu Yiren think now?

698
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,280
How do I know?

699
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,400
She’s chatting with Xia Di

700
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,240
in the bedroom.

701
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,600
Go and listen...

702
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,920
Listen to them.

703
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,880
You want me to eavesdrop?

704
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,400
But,

705
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,240
how can you ask me to do that?

706
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
What do you mean I ask you?

707
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,000
You’re eavesdropping, aren’t you?

708
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
How do you know?

709
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
All right.

710
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,760
Just wait.

711
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,740
= Red Packet from Fang Zhiyou =

712
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,340
= Red Packet from Fang Zhiyou 200 yuan =

713
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,980
= I’ll complete the mission. =

714
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,320
The man you like adores you, too.

715
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,840
Do you know what a low probability

716
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,280
it has?

717
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,840
You just get a stroke of luck.

718
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,800
Fang Zhiyou isn’t a stroke of luck.

719
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,800
I am.

720
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,840
I am, all right?

721
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,480
And I’m jealous, too.

722
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,720
You’re defending him before getting in love.

723
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
And you said you worried.

724
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,000
You’re showing off, I think.

725
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,320
Xia Di.

726
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,480
To be honest,

727
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,120
I’m very happy now.

728
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,960
But I’m also worried.

729
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,000
About what?

730
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,600
Don’t you think

731
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
he and I are from different worlds?

732
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,200
Stop talking like

733
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,840
you’re in a TV drama.

734
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,320
I’m more familiar with that.

735
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,960
But...

736
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,320
I know.

737
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,520
You and he

738
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,320
have totally different characters.

739
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
But you two complement each other, too.

740
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,560
He’s a tough guy to get on with.

741
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
But you get on well with each other, don’t you?

742
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Everything has its vanquisher.

743
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,520
He’s so handsome,

744
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,160
talented and rich.

745
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,640
If he had no shortcomings,

746
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
that would be too unfair.

747
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,640
How could ordinary guys live?

748
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,320
Well, I don’t think

749
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,280
his character is a shortcoming.

750
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
It’s my problem.

751
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,080
He hates to lie.

752
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,360
But I...

753
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,560
I can’t promise I’ll never lie.

754
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,520
Even if we’re in a relationship,

755
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,440
we’ll break up sooner or later, I’m afraid.

756
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,800
Zhiyou.

757
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
I heard Yiren said

758
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,240
you were from different worlds

759
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,200
and you didn’t make a perfect couple.

760
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,120
But I heard it intermittently.

761
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,440
I’m not so sure.

762
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,400
What did you do to Yiren?

763
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,240
Why aren’t you sleeping yet?

764
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,960
Did you tell her you liked her?

765
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,880
Why did you kiss her

766
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,560
before confessing your love to her?

767
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,800
You were skipping things.

768
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,600
Girls don’t like that.

769
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
You know what happened?

770
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,560
Sure.

771
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,760
Maybe,

772
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,840
Yiren thinks

773
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,360
you disrespect her a lot.

774
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
You know what?

775
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,480
A kid shouldn’t interfere with

776
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,000
adults’ stuff.

777
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,800
Get to sleep right away.

778
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
Hurry up.

779
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,400
You’re a kid

780
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,600
in terms of love.

781
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,560
Fine, forget it.

782
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,400
You’ll be dumped.

783
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
Little girl.

784
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,920
Wasn’t there a regular meeting this morning?

785
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
Why didn’t you wake me up?

786
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
I asked them to have the meeting tomorrow.

787
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
You drank too much last night.

788
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,400
Mr. Li.

789
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,080
If you truly like Xu Yiren,

790
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,680
maybe you can defeat Fang Zhiyou.

791
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,200
I don’t think he’s as good as you.

792
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,080
In love,

793
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,160
we don’t get back

794
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,960
what we pay.

795
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,240
And I’m not sure if I’m sad

796
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,360
because I like her,

797
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,120
or because I hate Fang Zhiyou,

798
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,960
or even because

799
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,240
she’s much like her.

800
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,640
It’s me.

801
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,680
Okay. Send it to me.

802
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
The teacher is back.

803
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,120
And the detective has found everything

804
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,520
about the girl in the photo.

805
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
She’s sending it to me.

806
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,080
Who is she?

807
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,800
♪ You said if we turned around ♪

808
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,950
♪ We would meet again ♪

809
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,080
♪ I’m waiting when you rewrite the ending ♪

810
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,900
♪ And then I’ll stick to it♪

811
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,280
♪ Could you wait ♪

812
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,340
♪ Don’t give up so quickly ♪

813
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
♪ All lies ♪

814
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,360
Little girl.

815
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
What’s happening to you?

816
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,720
I can’t find my way home.

817
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
I also find it a coincidence.

818
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,160
Feels like

819
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
it’s our fate.

820
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
I helped you every time.

821
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
In this case,

822
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I think it’s our luck

823
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
to meet each other often.

824
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,800
Am I right?

825
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,320
Well,

826
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,480
Miss Xu Yiren.

827
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,440
May I have a chance

828
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,560
to introduce myself to you again?

829
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,840
I’m Li Zhe.

830
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,000
I’m Xu Yiren.

831
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,440
Sha Sha.

832
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
Sha Sha.

833
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,560
Ah?

834
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,120
Where’s Mr. Fang?

835
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,440
Is he in the office?

836
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
What?

837
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,480
Mr. Fang.

838
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,200
Is he in the office?

839
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,360
He...

840
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Is he in the office, Sha Sha?

841
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
You want to see me?

842
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,960
Why don’t you just come to me?

843
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,240
Excuse me for a minute.

844
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,000
Where are you going?

845
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
To get my package.

846
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
To answer a phone call.

847
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,160
It’s not ringing.

848
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,100
= Xu Yiren =

849
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,340
= Li Zhe =

850
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
It’s ringing now.

851
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,600
Hello?

852
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
I’m at the entrance of your company.

853
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
I want to see you.

854
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,320
I’m occupied.

855
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Come out, or I’ll get in.

856
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,880
Don’t.

857
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,720
I’ll be right there.

858
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Mr. Fang.

859
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,360
I...

860
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
Didn’t I say...

861
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,280
Yiren.

862
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,600
What’s wrong with you?

863
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
Are you alright?

864
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,520
Yiren.

865
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,560
I want to tell you...

866
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,280
Let go of her.

867
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,680
Mr. Fang.

868
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,200
I...

869
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,800
I have something to ask her.

870
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
It’s none of your business.

871
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,320
I said,

872
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
let go of her.

873
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
And I said none of your business.

874
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,920
Please get away.

875
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,120
