1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,640
Must I say it out?

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, say it.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,640
You’re in a wrong coat.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,200
Purple doesn’t suit you.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,760
It makes you look like

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
a giant eggplant.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,120
But you gifted it to me.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,240
I like it.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
Barbie pink has high demand for the skin color.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,360
If you didn’t use the lipstick of this color,

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,000
I might not have seen

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,400
the freckles and pimples on your face.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,080
I’ll do better next time.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,640
And your face...

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,880
Did you fail to communicate with

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,240
your plastic surgeon?

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,000
It looks a bit weird.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,720
Weird?

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,120
What do you mean?

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,640
Stop!

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Since you don’t like to listen,

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
why did you bother to ask me for opinions?

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,280
Is it so hard

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,920
to accept the truth?

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,160
Are you nuts?

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,680
Xu Yiren.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,320
Hmm?

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,400
I mean

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,080
you look weirdly beautiful today.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
People lie for three reasons.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,840
Pandering.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,640
Showing off.

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
And defending themselves.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,920
But I choose to

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,160
tell the truth.

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,100
= Petit bébé from France =

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
It’s my troublesome roommate.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,240
Hello?

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
I’m having lunch with my parents.

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,320
I miss you, of course.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,520
I’m anxious to fly back and see you.

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,040
All right, honey.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,480
I’ll call you back later.

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,560
A freak is staring at me.

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,440
I love you, too.

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
Don’t talk to your roommate like that.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
You need to take care of each other.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Is your roommate a girl?

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
Is she your father or mother?

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Why did you lie?

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,320
It’s none of your business.

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
You’re cheating on your girlfriend.

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,000
Am I wrong?

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,640
Dude.

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
We’re both men.

56
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,320
You understand.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,200
Pretend you didn’t hear me, all right?

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,880
Thanks, bro.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
The one who called

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
was his girlfriend in France.

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
He said he missed her

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
and was anxious to fly back and see her.

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
I guess she doesn’t know you, either.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,280
Oh, and...

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
I’m not a freak.

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,040
You are.

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Gao Ming, is that true?

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,400
He’s a psychopath passing by.

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,480
And you believe him so easily?

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,800
You...

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,480
Well...

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,680
Let’s break up, then.

73
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,220
= Square & Circle =

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,540
= Mr. Honesty =

75
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,500
= Episode 1 =

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,560
Morning, Ms. He.

77
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,840
As you asked,

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
all appointments for Mr. Fang this afternoon

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,200
have been

80
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,480
cancelled.

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,440
Where is he?

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,600
He’s in the office building.

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
When I got off the plane,
I got a call from Melissa.

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,880
She said...

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,800
Did she cancel the agreement?

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,320
No.

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,000
But...

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
you pissed her off.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,200
Then what are you anxious about?

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,280
Fang Zhiyou.

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,320
I remember you promised me

92
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,000
you would behave properly in front of clients

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
and wouldn’t say anything you shouldn’t say.

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,960
That’s why

95
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
I let you meet her alone.

96
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,120
She asked me

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
how she looked.

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
It wasn’t my fault.

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Couldn’t you...

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,720
No.

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,120
All right.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,200
I see.

103
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,240
It wasn’t your fault.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
She asked for it.

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
If they couldn’t even

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
accept a little truth,

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
don’t waste our time, then.

108
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,280
Fine. Fine.

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,200
You win.

110
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,080
I knew I couldn’t persuade you.

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
I’ll buy a new dress and apologize to her.

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,960
In return,

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,240
you’ll go to a supplier for the contract.

114
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,900
= Taximeter =

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,760
Sir.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,160
I’ll get off here.

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,540
= Mr. He =

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Xu Yiren.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,120
Hello, Mr. He?

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Where are you keeping the color charts?

121
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
The client is arriving soon.

122
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,320
Come back immediately.

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,520
Okay.

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,360
I see.

125
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
= Meeting Room =

126
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,080
Come in.

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,440
Mr. He.

128
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,600
Xu Yiren.

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,880
Xu Yiren?

130
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,160
Put it down.

131
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,960
These are the color charts you asked for.

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,320
Go make a cup of coffee for our guest.

133
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,120
Oh.

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Mr. Fang.

136
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,000
Please have a look.

137
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,280
These are the wallpapers

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
we’ve just designed for this season.

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,440
Uh...

140
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,280
I’m terribly sorry.

141
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,040
My secretary got a pipe burst at home

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,040
and she asked for a leave.

143
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,800
She always keeps

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
the color charts.

145
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,600
So...

146
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,260
Pipe burst?

148
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,320
That girl?

149
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Ah, yes.

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,880
Come in.

151
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,760
Give it to Mr. Fang.

152
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,080
Okay.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
You had a pipe burst at home?

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,560
Mm.

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Then why were you still in the vein

156
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,200
for dating your boyfriend?

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,320
What?

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,120
Xu Yiren.

159
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,400
Mr. He.

160
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,600
Let me explain.

161
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Mr. He.

162
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
It seems your employee

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,560
has problem with honesty.

164
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
When I look for partners,

165
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
honesty comes first.

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
I think

167
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
we’d better not cooperate this time.

168
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,840
Mr. Fang.

169
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
You and your boyfriend make a perfect match.

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,120
He cheated on you.

171
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,080
You lied to your boss.

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,560
You!

173
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,960
Mr. Fang.

174
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Mr. Fang.

175
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,680
All lies will be exposed.

176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Truth can’t be covered up,

177
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,720
no matter how many lies you tell.

178
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,360
Xu Yiren.

179
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
Do you have any idea how big a project
you made me lose?

180
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
You’re fired.

181
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Lie isn’t the antonym of truth.

182
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,360
If truth hurts people,

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
I’d rather

184
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,520
cover it up.

185
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
When someone tells a lie to escape,

186
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
he’ll be destroyed by the lie, too.

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
You can run,

188
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,360
but you can never hide.

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,400
Not everyone is brave enough to face the day.

190
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,200
Lies give room for retreat.

191
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
Escaping is shameful.

192
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,560
But it works.

193
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
Aunt.

194
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Finally, you’re back.

195
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,320
There was a pipe burst in the toilet.

196
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
I called you a million times.

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
But you didn’t answer.

198
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320
Look.

199
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,440
Water is everywhere.

200
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,600
How can I rent the apartment later?

201
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Clean it up.

202
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,320
I’ll come back

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
and deal with you later.

204
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,760
Xia Di.

205
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
It tastes so bad.

206
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
Try more and you’ll find it good.

207
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
He’s the worst man I’ve ever met.

208
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,880
You...

209
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,840
You’re ungrateful for his help.

210
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,120
He didn’t help me.

211
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
He’s Thanos.

212
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,600
He kills whoever he meets.

213
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,080
Without him,

214
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,960
I wouldn’t have lost my job.

215
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,240
My apartment wouldn’t have been flooded.

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
I wouldn’t have lost my place to live in.

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,920
I lost my job and I’ll pay for the pipe burst.

218
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
You lost both your job and your lover.

219
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560
Shouldn’t you think about

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
what to do next?

221
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,840
Why are you still trying to take revenge?

222
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,120
Excuse me.

223
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,640
Hello?

224
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,040
May I speak to Xu Yiren?

225
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh.

226
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,440
You’re wanted.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
Me?

228
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,600
Hmm.

229
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Hello?

230
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,680
This is Xu Yiren speaking.

231
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,040
Hello?

232
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,040
I’m with HR Department of Square & Circle.

233
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
Because I failed to get through to your number,

234
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
I called the emergency contact.

235
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,880
Can you come to our company for the interview

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
at two tomorrow afternoon.

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,520
Do you have time for that?

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,880
Sorry.

239
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,920
I broke my phone.

240
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,520
Yes, I have time for that.

241
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,640
I’ll be there on time.

242
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,600
Thank you.

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,360
Thank you.

244
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,120
Oh, okay.

245
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,040
See you tomorrow.

246
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Xia Di.

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
You’re right.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
I have no time to be sad.

249
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,000
I must move forward.

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,040
Tomorrow,

251
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
I’m going for a new interview.

252
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,920
Come on.

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,640
Let’s drink.

254
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,520
What’s happening?

255
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,240
Cheers.

256
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,820
= Square & Circle =

257
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Why don’t you introduce yourself?

258
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,040
Hello, everyone.

259
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,480
I’m Xu Yiren.

260
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,440
I’m 25 years old.

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,040
I...

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
Why did you leave your previous company?

263
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,240
Because...

264
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
I think Square & Circle is a bigger platform.

265
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,480
And your company philosophy is

266
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,880
consistent with my future career plan.

267
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,200
So...

268
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,560
I’m not asking why you come.

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
I’m asking why you left your previous company.

270
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Because...

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,800
Because...

272
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
That company made few profits.

273
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,520
I haven’t had my salary for months.

274
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,560
Then I...

275
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
Why is it you again?

276
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,400
Mr. Fang.

277
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,080
You...

278
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,640
You know her?

279
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,320
Mr. Fang.

280
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,960
You...

281
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Out.

282
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
A lot of interviewees came today.

283
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,840
You still haven’t found anyone?

284
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,440
Fang Zhiyou.

285
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Don’t think

286
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
you can run away from it.

287
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
It’s been over one month

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,400
since you cursed Tina away.

289
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
You know what?

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,680
Whatever happens,

291
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
you must choose an assistant today.

292
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
Tina was my assistant the month before last.

293
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,400
Rona was my assistant last month.

294
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,200
You even remember that so clearly.

295
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
She was just an assistant.

296
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,480
Must you fire her

297
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
only because she was late once or twice?

298
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Being late wasn’t the problem.

299
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,200
But she asked someone else to clock in for her.

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,800
She was lying.

301
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,880
Fang Zhiyou.

302
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,760
When can you have a new assistant then?

303
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,320
Lower your so-called standard

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,800
for your assistant.

305
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,960
Not lying is the lowest standard.

306
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,520
How can I have a lower one?

307
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,280
You can’t impose your standards on others.

308
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,680
But you can do that.

309
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,520
I’m only honest with you.

310
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,880
Forget it.

311
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
It always happens.

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Why must I come and try?

313
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:26,920
See you.

314
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,800
I’ll go and find you an assistant.

315
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Thank you.

316
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,800
Fang Zhiyou.

317
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Have you thought about it?

318
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,400
Maybe people lie

319
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,160
because they have no alternative.

320
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,600
A lie is a lie.

321
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
The rest are all excuses.

322
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,200
See you.

323
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,700
= Xu Yiren =

324
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Thanos is to blame.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,600
Canceled?

326
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,840
Hmm.

327
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,480
Okay.

328
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,120
I see.

329
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,280
Are you nuts?

330
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,680
You are!

331
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
Do you think it is fun?

332
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,760
Why did you interfere with my private life

333
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,920
as you pleased?

334
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
Why did it matter to you

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,120
if my boyfriend cheated on me?

336
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,440
Why were you so meddlesome?

337
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
I said only one sentence...

338
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

339
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
Don’t say you cared for you

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,600
and didn’t want me to be cheated on.

341
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,200
Do I even know you?

342
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,640
Why must I care for you?

343
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,960
I just told the truth.

344
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Because of you,

345
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
I lost my boyfriend

346
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,000
and my job.

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
I even have nowhere to live now.

348
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,760
New job...

349
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,920
You even broke

350
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,360
my last hope.

351
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
How did I offend you?

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,440
You kept talking so much.

353
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
But what does it have to do with me?

354
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,080
What... what do you want?

355
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,640
Don’t dream to leave,

356
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,400
unless you explain to me clearly.

357
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,800
Fine.

358
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
I’ll waste my time

359
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,560
and explain to you.

360
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
You lost your boyfriend because he cheated on you.

361
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
You lost your job because you lied.

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,240
You failed the interview,

363
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
because you were not capable enough.

364
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,400
You had nowhere to live because...

365
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,120
Because of what?

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,840
Because I really had a pipe burst.

367
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
You told a lie and it got back to you.

368
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,520
Anyway, I have nothing to do

369
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,720
with your failure.

370
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,280
It was because you failed to work hard

371
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,240
in the past twenty years.

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,720
Otherwise,

373
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,240
even if I didn’t tell you,

374
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
your boyfriend would still cheat on you.

375
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,920
You were fired because of one lie.

376
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
It means

377
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
you can easily be replaced at work.

378
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,320
Even if you bothered to

379
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,960
make an exquisite resume,

380
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,800
how did that help?

381
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,760
Without enough competence,

382
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,480
you’re not capable

383
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,560
to be my assistant.

384
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,400
So, all I said

385
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,520
is just the truth.

386
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,760
What have I done wrong?

387
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you think I don’t know that?

388
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
Must you tell me?

389
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,760
Didn’t I know

390
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,240
he wasn’t as nice to me as before?

391
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,240
But he was the only light

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,880
I had embraced in the past twenty years.

393
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
With him,

394
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,920
I wasn’t scared however hard my life was.

395
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,480
But now, the only light for my life

396
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,320
has gone.

397
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Why did you expose us?

398
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,480
Couldn’t you pretend you didn’t hear or see that?

399
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
I don’t know you, anyway.

400
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,200
I didn’t have a reason.

401
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,640
I just hate lies.

402
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,440
And...

403
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
You’re the one

404
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
who messes up your own life.

405
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,840
My life is in a mess.

406
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
But how can you say I’m not working hard?

407
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,200
You’re not me. How can you say that?

408
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,000
I don’t need a reason.

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,510
♪ Lie in the room ♪

410
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,690
♪ Feels like floating in the black hole ♪

411
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,420
♪ Stay sober when I’m sleepless ♪

412
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,990
♪ Have a realistic dream ♪

413
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,320
They’re out.

414
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
Well, I have no other options.

415
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,560
To be honest,

416
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,760
hiring an assistant for Mr. Fang

417
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,960
is much harder than hiring a chief designer.

418
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,520
All these years,

419
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,880
no one manages to bear with him,

420
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,960
except you.

421
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,620
= CV of Xu Yiren =

422
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,680
Are you okay?

423
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,440
Can you get up?

424
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,000
I’m fine. I’m fine.

425
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,800
Are you alright?

426
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,600
Are you hurt?

427
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,240
No.

428
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,040
I’m not hurt.

429
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,800
I’m so sorry.

430
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,920
I didn’t see you.

431
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,000
It’s okay.

432
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
I shouldn’t have been standing here.

433
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,680
Besides,

434
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
I was too careless.

435
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,400
It wasn’t your fault.

436
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
I’ve got a right person for you.

437
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,480
Yes.

438
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,360
Uh, she...

439
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,920
she has working experience.

440
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,080
And she looks

441
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,680
honest.

442
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,360
But Mr. Fang kicked her out.

443
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,280
He doesn’t have the final say.

444
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,720
Ms. He.

445
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,200
Mr. Fang rejected me.

446
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
But you...

447
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,880
Don’t worry.

448
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,400
Just tell me.

449
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,640
Do you want to work with us?

450
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Why me?

451
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,200
Why are we hiring an assistant with a high pay?

452
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,120
Yes.

453
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Because Mr. Fang is tough to get on with.

454
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,800
I experienced that.

455
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
You’ll do the daily work

456
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,960
of an average assistant.

457
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,560
There are two more things.

458
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,840
First,

459
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,840
if you promise to work,

460
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,240
I hope you can stick with it.

461
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,240
Second,

462
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
your most important job

463
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,600
is exactly

464
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,520
to lie.

465
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,760
Let me put it mildly.

466
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,280
I want you to

467
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
smooth Fang Zhiyou’s interpersonal relation.

468
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
Stop him from

469
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,280
saying anything he shouldn’t say.

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,840
You must do everything without a trace.

471
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,880
You’ll have a one-month probationary period.

472
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,240
If you fail to do the job well

473
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,280
within one month,

474
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,760
you can quit.

475
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,960
And you’ll have two months’ pay as compensation.

476
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,600
Deal.

477
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,020
= Square & Circle =

478
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,640
I’m the first

479
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,320
on the first day to work.

480
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,640
A good start.

481
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,200
Let me see where I sit.

482
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
Assistant?

483
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,320
It’s my seat, I guess.

484
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,600
It seems

485
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,840
I don’t need to always look at Thanos.

486
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,960
You know the girl yesterday, huh?

487
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Hmm.

488
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,080
Mr. Fang has a new assistant.

489
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,680
It’s the girl who was cursed away yesterday.

490
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,280
What a fearless girl!

491
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320
Who are you?

492
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,760
Come out.

493
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,000
Who are you?

494
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,840
Hello, everyone.

495
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,040
I’m Xu Yiren.

496
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,320
The fearless girl you just talked about.

497
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,200
There you are.

498
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,400
-Morning, Ms. He. -Morning, Ms. He.

499
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,480
Let me introduce you.

500
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,360
This is...

501
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,320
Don’t bother.

502
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,360
We just knew each other.

503
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,560
Hello, I’m Luo Yang.

504
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,400
I’m Ms. He’s assistant.

505
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,120
Hello.

506
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,280
Hello.

507
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,080
I’m Chu Lin.

508
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,960
I’m in charge of brand maintenance
and media communication.

509
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,480
Hello.

510
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,120
Hello, guys.

511
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,720
Where’s Sha Sha?

512
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Is she late again?

513
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,720
I think

514
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,960
she has come already.

515
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,640
Morning, Ms. He.

516
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Uh, I was here early.

517
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,320
And I went to buy some coffee for you.

518
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
Latte for you.

519
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,240
Thanks.

520
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,240
Oh.

521
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
I didn’t know there was a new girl.

522
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,600
So...

523
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,200
It’s okay.

524
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,960
It’s okay.

525
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,400
It doesn’t matter.

526
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,480
Give yours to her.

527
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,440
Use it

528
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
to welcome our new colleague.

529
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,400
Welcome to our company.

530
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,880
Since...

531
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,520
we’re a family.

532
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,840
As a family,

533
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,840
we certainly

534
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,720
will help

535
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,120
each other out.

536
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,000
Why is it empty?

537
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you.

538
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
I’ll work hard.

539
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,160
I will.

540
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,760
Fine. If you’ve got no more questions,

541
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,080
get back to work.

542
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,880
I’ve got a question.

543
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,840
Now,

544
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,160
shouldn’t you explain to me?

545
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,880
Why is she here?

546
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,520
After thinking about it carefully,

547
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,080
I believe

548
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,400
she’s the best assistant for you.

549
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,960
He Yuwen.

550
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,200
Did you do this on purpose?

551
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,280
You know she’s a...

552
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,800
Mr. Fang.

553
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,320
She’s your assistant.

554
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,000
But she’s affiliated with
Administration Department.

555
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,120
It means,

556
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,720
she’s my subordinate.

557
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
Please tell me.

558
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,400
Can’t I even hire

559
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,120
a mere employee?

560
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,000
You did this on purpose.

561
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,200
It’s for you.

562
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,920
Thanks for that.

563
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,200
For what?

564
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,360
You’re welcome.

565
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
Smart girl.

566
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,960
Well,

567
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,040
if you run into any trouble,

568
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,600
come to me.

569
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,160
Thanks.

570
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
To you?

571
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,680
What can you do to help?

572
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,080
Sha Sha.

573
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
Did Chu Lin and I not help you

574
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,080
or did we hurt you?

575
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Why does Yiren have the coffee while we don’t?

576
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

577
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,640
All right.

578
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
I won’t get anyone wrong.

579
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,120
Xu Yiren

580
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,400
may not be an excellent assistant.

581
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,680
But she’s the most suitable assistant for you.

582
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,080
How do you know?

583
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,200
Well.

584
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,400
Do you dare

585
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
to make a bet?

586
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,440
If you’re dissatisfied with her

587
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,280
within one month,

588
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
you can fire her at any time.

589
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,840
But if she makes no mistake

590
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,560
within one month,

591
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,720
you must keep her.

592
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Come on.

593
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
If you didn’t

594
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,040
make enemies everywhere

595
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
and failed to be flexible,

596
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,160
I wouldn’t have been so busy that

597
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
I didn’t have time for a spa.

598
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,240
All right?

599
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
If you can’t change your tough temper,

600
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
let me save myself at least.

601
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,240
One month only.

602
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Deal.

603
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,120
See you.

604
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Mr. Fang. Ms. He.

605
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I don’t care how you used to behave.

606
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,240
But from today on,

607
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,000
if you tell one more lie,

608
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,200
you’ll be fired.

609
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,000
I see.

610
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
I can stay?

611
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,640
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

612
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,720
Work hard.

613
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Thank you, Ms. He.

614
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,680
Ask the Design Department

615
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
to come for a meeting in five minutes.

616
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,880
Copy.

617
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,000
Let me tell you some good news.

618
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,800
For this project,

619
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,680
Xingcheng Real Estate

620
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,200
has basically

621
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,600
approved of

622
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,000
our design.

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
There are some little details

624
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,480
to be modified.

625
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,960
Say whatever you want.

626
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,120
It’s not working.

627
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,400
Do it again.

628
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,960
Ah?

629
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
Stop him from saying anything

630
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,040
he shouldn’t say.

631
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,200
But it has been approved of
by Xingcheng Real Estate.

632
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,160
I disapprove of it.

633
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,080
I think...

634
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,680
Mr. Fang.

635
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
Would you like some coffee?

636
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,560
I’ll go make some for you.

637
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,440
Get out.

638
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,360
Ah?

639
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Do I need to repeat it?

640
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,520
Oh.

641
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,000
I’m kicked out on the first day at work.

642
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,840
This proposal...

643
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
has been approved of by Xingcheng.

644
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,320
Are you going to demolish it?

645
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,320
Because you didn’t meet me.

646
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,160
Anyway,

647
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,600
all designs in Square & Circle

648
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,160
mustn’t be used without my approval.

649
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
No one else have the final say.

650
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,840
All right.

651
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,080
In three days,

652
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,120
I need to see your new idea.

653
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,920
Sorry.

654
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,200
I can’t do it.

655
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,480
Okay.

656
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,080
You can’t do it.

657
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,160
I’ll do it myself.

658
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
Mr. Fang, where are we going?

659
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Can you drive?

660
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,720
Learn it.

661
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Oh.

662
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,360
The seatbelt.

663
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,200
Oh.

664
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,080
Mr. Fang.

665
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
I can’t pull it.

666
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,160
What else can I expect you to do?

667
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,240
All right. Let go of it.

668
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,680
Doomed. Doomed.

669
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,000
Thanos is coming to fasten my seatbelt.

670
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,720
What are you waiting for?

671
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,680
Ah?

672
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,720
Sit in the back.

673
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh.

674
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,760
Mr. Fang.

675
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,120
Where...

676
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,920
Where are we going?

677
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,120
Hello, Xia Di?

678
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,800
Hey, where are you?

679
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,600
You know what?

680
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
I reserved the restaurant after all the trouble.

681
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
It doesn’t wait.

682
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,400
Sorry, Xia Di.

683
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,800
Today,

684
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,080
I must work overtime.

685
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,880
I can’t go home until tonight.

686
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,680
Xu Yiren.

687
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,560
Why do you work overtime on the first day?

688
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,280
Come right away!

689
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,480
I can’t go.

690
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,080
Why don’t you

691
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,840
eat more for me.

692
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,160
Fine, then.

693
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
Remember. You owe me.

694
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,280
Okay.

695
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,320
I’ll remember.

696
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,320
When I’m paid,

697
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,200
I’ll buy you dinner.

698
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
All right. Stop pretending to be pitiful.

699
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,960
Get back to your work.

700
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,280
Bye-bye.

701
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,680
I checked. There’s no reservation.

702
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,560
On which app did you make it?

703
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,800
I reserved it on YELP.

704
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,880
Look.

705
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,680
Oh, sorry.

706
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,040
I think I made a mistake.

707
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,000
I reserved it for next month.

708
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,600
Sorry, sir.

709
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
I can’t help.

710
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,200
Sorry.

711
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,280
Would you kindly make an exception?

712
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,680
Hello. Two seats for Miss Xia.

713
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,520
I got it wrong.

714
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,840
Okay. Come in, please.

715
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,560
Oh, I won’t go.

716
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,320
Let him in.

717
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,360
Wait a minute.

718
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,360
Thank you.

719
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,640
Are you alone?

720
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,840
Would you like to have dinner with me?

721
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,960
No, thanks.

722
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,760
I don’t usually have dinner with a stranger.

723
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,520
All right.

724
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
So cool.

725
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,600
Wake up.

726
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,240
Where are we?

727
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,720
Hey, don’t move.

728
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,120
What?

729
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
Will I really leave you here?

730
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,360
You don’t need me to drive you back?

731
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,640
Yes.

732
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,800
I don’t like to bother you.

733
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,320
Drive safely.

734
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
He really didn’t drive me home.

735
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,200
It’s so late.

736
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,840
I wonder if there’s the last bus.

737
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,360
Wow.

738
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
It’s over twelve o’clock.

739
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,000
Cinderella is finally back.

740
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,680
Are you still eating?

741
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,880
You know what?

742
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,640
I’ve never seen a man like him.

743
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
It was so late.

744
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,280
He left me alone at the bus station.

745
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,560
Luckily, I caught the last busy.

746
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
= Ten Cents =
Otherwise, before I get the salary,

747
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,800
I would have wasted my money on a taxi.

748
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
= Strong Girl =
You sound excited.

749
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
But who are you talking about?

750
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Who else could it be?

751
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
My Thanos boss.

752
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,720
Shouldn’t you be a senior office lady?

753
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,160
What?

754
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Why do you look like you just fought for
train tickets during Spring Festival?

755
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
What should I do, Xia Di?

756
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,000
It was my first day at work.

757
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,600
I wanted to quit more than two hundred times.

758
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Well, eat this.

759
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,360
Refresh yourself and work hard tomorrow.

760
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,960
The Xu Yiren I know

761
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,720
doesn’t give up easily.

762
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,320
Xia Di.

763
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,520
Don’t flatter yourself.

764
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,600
I’ll deal with you for your no-show.

765
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,200
Not before I finish eating.

766
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,440
I’m back.

767
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,420
= Kiss the Sun =

768
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,160
Mr. Fang?

769
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,840
Mr. Fang?

770
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Mr...

771
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,200
Mr. Fang.

772
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,480
Fang Zhiyou.

773
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
Why do you always bully me?

774
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,720
If you keep doing that,

775
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,800
I’ll...

776
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,840
I’ll...

777
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,000
Mr. Fang.

778
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,320
Are you alright?

779
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,780
= 49 Paper Boats and 49 Kites =

780
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,480
Mr. Fang.

781
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,280
Look.

782
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,440
Fang Zhiyou has a picture on his back.

783
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
Look who is the tortoise now.

784
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,440
