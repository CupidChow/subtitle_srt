20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,760
Try this chestnut cake.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,720
It’s your favorite.

22
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,080
And this chocolate cake.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Let me tell you.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,440
It’s high in phenethylamine.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,920
It can relieve depression effectively.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
And this one,

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,160
strawberry cake.

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,360
Look,

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,040
the strawberries

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
are red and big.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,360
So your comic book

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
will sell very well.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,720
It’ll become

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,600
a bestseller before you know it.

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,480
It’s been a whole day,

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,360
but

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
not even a single copy was sold.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,480
If this continues,

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
I’ll become really astonished,

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
and you’ll be the one crying.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
Why am I the one crying?

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,560
Because I need to find an outlet

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,600
when I’m in a bad mood.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Listen to me,

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,440
there are many ways

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
to blow off steam,

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,800
but you shouldn’t commit

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
domestic violence.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,480
Besides,

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
this is just the first day.

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
You need to be patient.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
What do you know?

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,520
The first week’s sales volume is very important.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,360
The sales volume of today really sucks,

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,400
next up, it’ll only get worse.

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,400
Impossible.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,440
That’s not gonna happen.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
Don’t worry.

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
You have me.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,200
I guarantee that

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,120
your book

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,760
will sell better than

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
all the other books.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Stop daydreaming,

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,960
will you?

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
You don’t believe it?

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,720
Then,

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
how about we make a bet?

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Bet what?

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,520
If those copies sell out,

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,320
you...

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,000
you should

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
marry me.

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
I was

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,160
just kidding.

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
Don’t mind.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,840
If you don’t like it,

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
we can bet something else.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
Gu Bo, be honest with me.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,360
You actually don’t

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
want to marry me at all, right?

82
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,840
If these copies can really sell out,

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
I can even ask you

84
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
to marry me!

85
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Really?

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,320
You must keep your word.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
Let’s swear it.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,480
This way.

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
Shiyu said

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,320
you’re at home today.

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
So I came over to see you.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
Thank you for caring.

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,240
Have a seat.

95
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,280
Zhiyou said

96
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,720
you like to drink soup.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
Please bear with it

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,960
if the soup doesn’t taste good.

99
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,040
It smells so good.

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Let me try it.

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,080
How is it?

102
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,760
So fresh.

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Since Zhiyou’s mother died,

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
I’ve never had soup at home.

105
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you.

106
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
You’re welcome.

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
You can always tell Zhiyou

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,000
if you want to have soup,

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
I’ll cook some and bring it to you.

110
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,200
Hmm.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
You didn’t just

112
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,160
come here to bring the soup

113
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
to me, right?

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
You should know

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
why I came.

116
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,440
Zhiyou’s still waiting for your reply.

117
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,200
How do you think

118
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
I should reply him?

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
In the past,

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I’d say it’s better

121
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,920
to promise him first.

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,960
It’s just an apology.

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
You won’t lose anything,

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,320
but it can repair your relationship with Zhiyou.

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
I think it’d be worth it for you.

126
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,440
Then how do you

127
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
think now?

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Now I think

129
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,400
if you’re not willing to

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,440
take responsibility for what you did,

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,400
if you don’t want to

132
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,600
apologize to Mr. Li and Li Zhe

133
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
sincerely,

134
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,280
then,

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,560
you’d better

136
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,960
not do that.

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,280
Zhiyou

138
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,480
will only get sadder.

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
I’m sorry,

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,560
but I won’t change my mind.

141
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,440
Oh, right.

142
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,040
How are you recently?

143
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
I’m fine.

144
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Thank you.

145
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
Did you take your medicine on time?

146
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Zhiyou said

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,480
you almost took your medicine twice last time.

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,400
This is all within expectation.

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,720
My guess is

150
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,080
my disease will get more serious.

151
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,680
See?

152
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
It’s about time to take medicine.

153
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,240
Let me get it for you.

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay.

155
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,280
How many pills?

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,920
Two.

157
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Thank you.

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Send the files to me asap.

159
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,880

don’t you want to see

177
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
what outstanding design

178
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,440
you can get

179
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,320
if you work with

180
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
such a gifted designer?

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
I know this person you’re talking about.

182
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
What’s more,

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,560
I know He Yuliang had high hopes of him.

184
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,200
He left Liangshan to start his own business

185
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
when he had everyone’s attention.

186
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,760
He Yuliang is my father.

187
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,040
But their personal grudges

188
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
are none of my concern.

189
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
If I were you,

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,840
I wouldn’t judge a person

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,280
based on other people’s remarks

192
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
which might be groundless.

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
Please take a look.

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
Of course,

195
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,640
if you want to work with a company

196
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
that’s reliable

197
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,800
and has a good reputation,

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
then forget that

199
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
I came today.

200
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay.

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
I’ll consider it.

202
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,640
Dad,

203
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,680
you must be tired.

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Let me help you get into bed.

205
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,840
Dad,

206
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
I won’t be able to

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,960
come to see you in the next few days.

208
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
I have work to do in the company.

209
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,120
Be good.

210
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,040
Don’t. Don’t.

211
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Let me help you. Let me help you.

212

I’m finished.

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
I’m finished, too.

215
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Yours is a sailing boat?

216
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Can you teach me?

217
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,200
I won’t.

218
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,840
So stingy!

219
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I’ll give this one to you.

220
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
I’ll fold them for you

221
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,000
no matter how many you want.

What’s this?

224
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
Ms. He?

225
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,560
Nothing.

226
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,720
Who’s sick?

227
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,680
No one.

228
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Is it Fang Zhiyou?

229
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,480
No.

230
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
It’s not him.

231
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me.

232
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,920
I’m leaving.

233
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
Ms. He!

234
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
It’s...

235
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Fang Zhiyou’s dad.

236
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,200
Mr. Fang?

237
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
Ms. He.

238
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
It’s not convenient to talk here.

239
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,840
Let’s find another place.

240
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,720
Hmm.

241
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,720
That’s it.

242
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
How come

243
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,440
Mr. Fang...

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
Fang Zhiyou also couldn’t accept it.

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,760
If he finds out that

246
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
his dad is probably deceiving him,

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
he’ll feel more miserable.

248
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,560
Yuwen,

249
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
what should I do?

250
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
I don’t dare tell Fang Zhiyou,

251
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
or discuss this

252
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,160
with anyone.

253
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,720
How about this?

254
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
If you trust me,

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,080
you can give the pill to me.

256
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,000
I have a friend who’s working in the hospital.

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
I can ask him to test the pill

258
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,960
and see what it is.

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,960
Don’t you remember?

260
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
Fang Zhiyou said that

261
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,960
truth is always truth.

262
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,480
No one can hide the truth.

263
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
You stole this pill

264
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,480
because you wanted to

265
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,800
learn the truth, right?

266
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,960
But I’m afraid to know the truth.

267
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,040
That would change nothing.

268
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,920
At least we should find out

269
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
if Mr. Fang has really fallen ill.

270
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
As for Fang Zhiyou,

271
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,520
let’s not tell him for now.

272
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
Yiren!

273
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Yiren!

274
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,040
Hurry!

275
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,960
Answer the phone for me!

276
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Just say I’m taking a shower.

277
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,480
No, no.

278
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,280
Say I’m completely drunk.

279
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,680
Right. Right.

280
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,280
Say I’m drunk.

281
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,800
Hurry.

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,800
Hello?

283
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,760
Excuse me.

284
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,440
Xia Di went out.

285
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,680
She forgot to take her phone.

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,720
I’ll let her

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,240
call you back when she’s back.

288
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,600
Thank you.

289
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Bye-bye.

290
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,800
Bravo!

291
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
You exceeded the deadline again?

292
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
No.

293
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
It’s worse than that.

294
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,480
My book didn’t sell well.

295
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
I’m afraid Little Witch will scold me.

296
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
Really?

297
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,040
Now my reputation has been ruined.

298
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,640
Though not very famous,

299
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,520
I’m still a contracted author.

300
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,480
And I have a lot of fans.

301
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,360
Now the sales volume is so low,

302
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
it’s such an embarrassment.

303
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,120
I shouldn’t have published the book.

304
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,880
I should continue drawing webcomics.

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
Don’t be impatient.

306
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,440
Physical books don’t sell well nowadays.

307
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,120
Besides, they just hit store shelves.

308
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,280
The sales volume will increase gradually.

309
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,280
Selling books is just like getting a man.

310
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,840
A good start is very important.

311
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
You have to win his heart

312
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
while he’s

313
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
infatuated with you.

314
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,720
Before he comes to his senses,

315
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,680
you have to conquer him

316
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,120
and leave him no chance to escape.

317
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
It seems

318
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,400
you’ve conquered Gu Bo?

319
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,720
All within my control.

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Xia Di,

321
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,880
tell me,

322
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
if one day,

323
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,720
I mean if,

324
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,080
you find that

325
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,920
Gu Bo’s hiding something from you,

326
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,880
of course,

327
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
it’s not something bad,

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
what will you do?

329
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,280
That’s simple.

330
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
You still remember what taught you

331
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,920
when Gao Ming cheated on you?

332
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,560
A hundred ways to kill people

333
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,240
without taking any responsibility.

334
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
I’ll try each and every one of them on him.

335
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
How come I feel

336
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,280
you’re actually hiding something from me?

337
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,400
No.

338
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,180
I need to answer this.

339
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,740
= Ms. He =

340
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Hello, Ms. He?

341
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,760
I’ve got the test report.

342
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,960
Go ahead.

343
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,720
I’m prepared for the result.

344
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,640
It’s

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
= Test report Sample name Vitamin E=
a kind of Vitamin E supplement for elderly people.

346
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,680
What we feared the most

347
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
has come true.

348
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
What’s the matter, Yiren?

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,880
Don’t scare me.

350
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,240
What happened?

351
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
Sorry, Xia Di.

352
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,760
I have to go.

353
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,640
Where are you going?

354
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
But we said we’ll

355
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,300
eat hot pot with Gu Bo later.

356
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,900
= Square & Circle =

357
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,760
What are you thinking about?

358
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,920
Nothing.

359
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,560
What’s the matter?

360
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,200
Take a look at this.

361
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,080
I just received this.

362
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,300
= Fond Architectural Engineering
RFP of Zhiwu Academy =

363
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,280
I know that

364
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
you always wanted to design academies.

365
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,400
This is the largest cultural tourism project

366
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,960
of Fond Architectural Engineering this year.

367
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
It’s a chance you can’t miss.

368
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,360
What’s wrong?

369
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,440
Now we’re working on the Moon Bay

370
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,480
Resort Project.

371
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,800
I need to follow up on many things.

372
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,320
I’m afraid I won’t have enough time for it.

373
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,440
You can let Liu Tianyang

374
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,160
follow up on the project.

375
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
What’s more,

376
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,000
we haven’t taken any other projects recently.

377
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,080
I think you have enough time.

378
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,280
If I remember right,

379
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,960
you already drew

380
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,440
a similar design several years ago.

381
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,880
You can just revise it

382
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
and use it to participate in the bid.

383
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
Let me think about it

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,600
Why?

385
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,840
Okay.

386
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,640
After all,

387
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,120
you’re the designer.

388
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,360
I just think that

389
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,240
if we can get this project,

390
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,200
it’ll greatly enhance

391
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,080
our company’s brand image.

392
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,640
Think about it carefully.

393
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
I will.

394
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
You don’t look very well.

395
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Should I

396
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,320
ask Xu Yiren to make a coffee for you?

397
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,120
She’s on leave.

398
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,840
There’s no need.

399
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,320
She’s on leave?

400
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Is she sick?

401
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,520
She went to see my father.

402
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,760
Xu Yiren

403
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,640
told me about your father’s disease.

404
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,360
Feel free to let me know

405
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
if you need any help.

406
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,240
Okay.

407
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
In fact,

408
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
I don’t know

409
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,160
what I can do either.

410
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,640
Luckily, she often

411
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
went to visit my father.

412
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,760
They actually have

413
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,040
a lot of things to talk about.

414
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,880
That’s good.

415
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I’ll leave then.

416
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,580
= Test report Sample name Vitamin E =

417
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,680
Let me apologize to you first.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,520
I took a pill from you last time

419
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,640
and had it tested.

420
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
Here’s the result.

421
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Since that’s the case,

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,880
there’s no need

423
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,400
for me to explain.

424
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,400
Fang Zhiyou doesn’t know this, right?

425
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
Otherwise, he’d have come with you.

426
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,760
You want to get an answer from me

427
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,080
and then tell him,

428
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
or you don’t intend to tell him at all?

429
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,000
Seems I guessed right.

430
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,480
You really love my son.

431
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,040
You don’t want him to get hurt.

432
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,920
But the one who’s hurting him

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,280
is his father.

434
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,920
I admit that

435
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,760
I lied to you.

436
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,160
But if I hadn’t lied,

437
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,600
my son would have never

438
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,280
come back to this house.

439
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,160
So you’ve been using me

440
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,920
since we first met, right?

441
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,160
Yes.

442
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,760
I let you see the medicine bottle on purpose.

443
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,400
Then I let Shiyu

444
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
ask Zhiyou to come back

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
to celebrate my birthday.

446
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,240
So that I can make him believe that

447
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,280
I’ve got Alzheimer’s.

448
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,960
I had everything planned in advance.

449
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
How could you do this to Fang Zhiyou?

450
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,200
Tell me,

451
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,880
do I have any better options?

452
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
Do you think I’m willing to do this?

453
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
You knew clearly that

454
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,280
Fang Zhiyou hates lies very much,

455
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
but you still lied to him

456
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
again and again.

457
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
Have you ever thought about how he’ll feel

458
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
if he learns the truth?

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
But,

460
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,040
if you don’t tell him,

461
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
then he’s not going to get hurt.

462
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,160
If a lie never gets exposed,

463
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
then it’s not a lie.

464
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Don’t you think so?

465
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,480
Yes.

466
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
I lied to him.

467
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,480
But because of this lie,

468
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,400
he did come back to this house.

469
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,360
Although he’s still angry at me,

470
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,800
at least he started to talk to me.

471
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,840
I just want him to come back,

472
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,320
even if he comes back to quarrel with me.

473
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
But a lie

474
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,720
will get exposed sooner or later.

475
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,400
Even so,

476
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,000
I’m willing to make a bet.

477
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,920
I bet that

478
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,200
Zhiyou will forgive me.

479
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,360
I bet that our relationship

480
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,760
can go back to normal.

481
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
I know that

482
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,000
you love Zhiyou with all your heart.

483
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,240
I’m begging you,

484
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,280
I don’t want to lose my son.

485
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
You looked absent-minded

486
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,560
when we were eating just now.

487
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,280
Did you go to see my father?

488
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Did he give you a hard time?

489
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,640
No.

490
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
I’m not like you.

491
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
I won’t quarrel with him.

492
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,800
Then why didn’t you answer my call?

493
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,560
I...

494
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,320
I fell asleep on the subway.

495
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
Let me go with you

496
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,920
when you go to see my father next time.

497
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
Hmm.

498
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,560
If...

499
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
If your father still refuses

500
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,560
to apologize to Li Zhe’s father,

501
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
what will you do?

502
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
Will you forgive him

503
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
because of his disease?

504
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,120
I don’t know.

505
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
I always thought

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,480
the only feeling I have for my father is hatred.

507
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,200
But after he fell ill, I found that

508
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,160
I actually care about him very much.

509
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,720
Blood ties can’t be broken.

510
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,480
Now I only hope

511
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,080
he can do things he should do

512
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,080
for the sake of our relationship.

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,560
Yiren,

514
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,640
let’s get married after

515
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
these problems are solved, alright?

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
I want to give you a home,

517
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,080
a home that belongs to

518
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,520
you and me.

519
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,960
What?

520
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320
You’re not willing to?

521
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
Who’d propose

522
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,480
to her girlfriend like this?

523
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
I’m not prepared at all.

524
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,920
I said that involuntarily.

525
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,280
If you

526
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,320
don’t refuse,

527
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
I’ll take that as a yes.

528
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,600
I hope this day

529
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,960
will come soon.

♪ Love is growing and do you feel it ♪

531
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,170
♪ My world shines more brilliantly
with you around ♪

532
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
Why did you ask me to come here?

533
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,720
What happened?

534
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,640
They’re gone.

535
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,880
They’re all gone.

536
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,520
What is gone?

537
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,680
It’s still here, alright?

538
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,520
Hello,

539
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,920
I want to buy this book.

540
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,440
Sorry.

541
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,280
We’re out of stock.

542
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,320
This is an advance copy.

543
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,200
I can book it for you if you need it.

544
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,520
Okay.

545
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,360
Thank you.

546
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
It’s alright.

547
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,640
Did you hear that?

548
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,560
They’re gone.

549
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,880
They’re sold out.

550
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,040
Sold out.

551
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,400
Quiet. We’re in the library.

552
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,640
Sorry.

553
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,880
Thank you.

554
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,640
Can you see clearly

555
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
with this pair of sunglasses?

556
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,800
Now I’m the author of a bestseller.

557
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,200
What if

558
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,800
someone recognizes me?

559
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,200
But your book

560
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,680
doesn’t come with a photo of you,

561
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,160
who’ll ever recognize you?

562
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
Seems

563
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,040
it makes sense.

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Tell you what,

565
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,400
Little Witch called me in the morning.

566
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,360
She said

567
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,680
my book sold out within a few days.

568
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
So I’ve decided

569
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,760
to throw a big party

570
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,400
to celebrate the success.

571
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,120
You should ask Fang Zhiyou to come, too.

572
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Don’t tell me you’ll let him know.

573
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
If he doesn’t come,

574
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,680
our friendship is over!

575
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,760
I’ll be there.

576
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Let me do the prep work.

577
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I’m very good at it.

578
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,800
You think you can stay out of this?

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,160
I want...

580
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
You can have everything.

581
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,520
Don’t worry.

582
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,080
I’ll give you a surprise.

583
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,000
My boyfriend is so caring.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,720
You’re great.

585
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,360
What’s wrong?

586
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,120
It’s fine.

587
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,720
I ate too much.

588
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
I need to go back to the company now.

589
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,880
We’re still on break.

590
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
I don’t want to be

591
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,040
a third wheel here.

592
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,160
You can continue acting lovey-dovey!

593
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,440
Don’t go back too late.

594
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,920
I won’t help you

595
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,600
if Fang Zhiyou criticizes you again.

596
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,520
Got it.

597
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,120
Bye-bye.

598
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,400
Xu Yiren’s been acting weird recently.

599
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,920
Is it because her relationship with Fang Zhiyou

600
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
is stressing her out?

601
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
Sometimes it’s good to be unmindful.

602
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,360
The regular meeting

603
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,720
will start in 10 minutes.

604
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,960
I know.

605
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,040
What’s this?

606
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,480
How do you like it?

607
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,920
It looks nice.

608
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,080
It takes full advantage

609
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,880
of the natural environment.

610
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,800
It adopts a classical style,

611
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,200
but applies a modern concept.

612
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,960
It looks like

613
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,720
a paradise

614
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,640
that’s hidden

615
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,920
in the mountains.

616
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,920
I like it.

617
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,440
Our company took a new project?

618
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
How come I don’t know?

619
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
I’m still considering

620
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,600
if we should take it.

621
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,680
You’re considering it?

622
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,560
But you’ve finished the design drawing.

623
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,960
When did you draw it?

624
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
I’ve never seen you working on it.

625
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,240
I finished this drawing

626
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
five years ago.

627
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,280
I’ve always wanted to build an academy,

628
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,240
but I haven’t yet had an opportunity.

629
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,440
Isn’t it

630
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,560
a good opportunity now?

631
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,960
You just said

632
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
you’re still considering it.

633
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Why are you hesitating?

634
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,040
Actually, this is a dream

635
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
of Li Zhe and me.

636
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,760
But I don’t know

637
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,280
how to realize it by myself.

638
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,080
Since it’s your dream,

639
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,760
you should stick to it

640
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
no matter it’s just you or you two.

641
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,120
Don’t give up.

642
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,760
I really

643
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,920
like this design.

644
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,840
Let it shine,

645
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,480
alright?

646
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,400
But I’m not sure

647
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
if I can win the bid.

648
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
Of course you can.

649
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,240
As long as you participate in the bid,

650
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
you’ll definitely win.

651
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I assure you of that.

652
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Okay.

653
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,600
I’ll listen to you.

654
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,720
I can

655
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
come again later.

656
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,320
No need.

657
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,200
You want to see me?

658
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,400
No.

659
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,120
I want to see her.

660
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,360
Let’s go.

661
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,800
Hmm.

662
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,960
Since when did you become so close?

663
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,280
It’s a secret.

664
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
I’ve talked with the attorney.

665
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,120
They’ll sue Jiaye for slander.

666
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,720
Make sure Xie Dongren

667
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,040
doesn’t have any evidence.

668
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,720
I confirmed that.

669
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,360
He doesn’t have any.

670
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,720
You’ve always been meticulous.

671
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,960
Xie Dongren is no match for you.

672
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,880
= Despicable =
He overestimated himself.

673
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,360
I’ll call the cops.

674
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,000
It’s fine.

675
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,120
Let him vent his anger.

676
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,840
This is all that he can do.

677
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,360
Clean it up for me.

678
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,560
Okay.

679
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Let me call for a cab for you.

680
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,240
There’s no need.

681
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,760
I want to talk a walk.

682
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,280
Thank you.

683
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,340
= Scoundrel =

684
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,720
Why are you here?

685
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,800
I passed by here.

686
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
I saw the gate is open,

687
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,160
so I came in.

688
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,240
I heard about what’s happened to Dasheng.

689
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
But I believe

690
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
you can take care of it.

691
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,840
What else do you expect?

692
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,200
You actually came to laugh to me, right?

693
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,680
Sorry.

694
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
I’ve let you down.

695
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Li Zhe,

696
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
do you still remember our dream when we were kids?

697
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,360
We wanted to build a building

698
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
and put all the fairy tale books in it.

699
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
I forgot it long ago.

700
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,080
But I still remember it.

701
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,720
I received the RFP for Zhiwu Academy.

702
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
I want to cooperate with you

703
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,960
and win this bid together.

704
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,200
Cooperate with me?

705
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
Do you know what you are saying?

706
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,800
I know.

707
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
I want to join hands with Dasheng

708
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,880
and build an academy

709
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,040
that can house

710
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,280
all the fairy tale books out there.

711
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
Fairy tale books?

712
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,760
Do you know what you said

713
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,680
sounds like a joke?

714
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
I won’t cooperate with you.

715
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,800
Even if I agree,

716
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,920
aren’t you afraid I’ll set you up again?

717
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,480
I am afraid.

718
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,240
But I’m willing to

719
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,840
believe you once again.

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,280
Fang Zhiyou,

721
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
I really hate seeing you like this.

722
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,400
You even

723
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,840
make me feel guilty to hate you.

724
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
You can build the academy yourself,

725
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
there’s nothing

726
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
more than hatred between us.

727
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,840
What’s more,

728
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,440
don’t go to disturb my father again.

729
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,160
Don’t get close to my family.

730
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,280
I finally got to see Honey Xia.

731
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,880
No.

732
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,040
I’m too nervous.

733
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,800
Yiren,

734
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,480
my heart is beating faster.

735
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,400
I didn’t know you’d get nervous.

736
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,280
Of course.

737
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,680
I’m a loyal fan of Honey Xia.

738
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,520
Really?

739
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Xu Yiren,

740
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
look what time it is!

741
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,160
Aren’t you ashamed?

742
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,080
This cute girl is...

743
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,240
So you’re Honey Xia?

744
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,000
You’re really beautiful and kind.

745
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,640
I’m Fang Shiyu.

746
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,920
I’m a loyal fan of you.

747
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,640
You’re Fang Zhiyou’s sister, right?

748
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,000
I didn’t expect

749
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,880
Thanos has such a lovely sister.

750
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,920
And she’s my fan!

751
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,800
You have a discerning eye.

752
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,400
Had I known this,

753
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,760
I would’ve introduced you two long ago.

754
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
It’s still not too late.

755
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
= Xia Di! Xia Di! Always Pretty! =

756
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I’m here to root for you.

757
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
You’re so caring.

758
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,160
From now on,

759
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,080
you’ll be the chairman of my

760
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,920
international fan club.

761
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,560
Really?

762
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,120
Hmm.

763
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,600
I thought

764
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,000
I can be the chairman of your fan club!

765
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,280
Yiren,

766
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,720
how can you compete with me for this?

767
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,200
I already gave my brother to you.

768
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,480
Right.

769
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,400
Where is Fang Zhiyou?

770
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,200
My brother will come later.

771
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,240
Honey Xia,

772
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,880
can I take a selfie with you?

773
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,360
Sure.

774
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,320
Let’s go over there.

775
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,680
Go ahead.

776
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,280
Let’s go.

777
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,520
Yiren,

778
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,160
can you do me a favor later?

779
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,360
What favor?

780
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,440
I have a surprise for Xia Di.

781
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,880
Come closer.

782
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,360
Listen.

783
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,600
Mr. Wei, thank you for trusting us.

784
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,160
We’ll do our best.

785
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,800
Mr. Fang,

786
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,080
Ms. He is really capable.

787
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,040
She’s amazing!

788
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,120
Had it not been for her,

789
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,320
I wouldn’t have sent the RFP to you.

790
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,480
I’ve always known

791
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,680
Yuwen’s capability.

792
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,720
So I’ll do my best

793
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,960
this time

794
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,320
to make her efforts worthwhile.

795
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,160
With you and Ms. He, I’m sure Square & Circle

796
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,040
will have a brighter future.

797
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,120
I believe so.

798
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,920
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

799
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
Mr. Wei, may I ask,

800
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,000
which companies have participated in the bid?

801
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,480
Zhiwu Academy

802
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,640
is the largest cultural tourism project

803
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
of Fond Architectural Engineering this year.

804
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,120
So we’re looking to work with

805
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,520
the best design companies.

806
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,440
Including your company,

807
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
we’ve only selected three.

808
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
I heard

809
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,880
Liangshan will also participate in the bid.

810
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,560
I wonder what the other one is.

811
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,320
The other company

812
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,480
also did several projects successfully before.

813
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,760
It’s Qingxuan Design.

814
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,880
I think the competition must be interesting

815
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,920
since you’ll confront Liangshan.

816
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,320
Although Square & Circle

817
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
is the only company among the three

818
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,880
that hasn’t done a similar project before,

819
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,240
I can guarantee that

820
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,320
we can do better than

821
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,240
the other two companies.

822
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,240
I really admire your confidence a lot.

823
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
I checked the files Ms. He gave me.

824
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,720
Your design is very unique.

825
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,760
I look forward to it very much.

826
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,200
Don’t let me down.

827
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,040
I was not surprised at all.

828
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,280
I already guessed that

829
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,640
Liangshan will also participate in the bid.

830
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I trust you.

831
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,640
I’m sure we won’t lose.

832
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
I also trust myself.

833
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,240
Even Yiren said

834
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,600
she likes my design very much.

835
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
Xu Yiren is your girlfriend.

836
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,280
She’ll only say things pleasant to hear.

837
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,800
Although she never studied design,

838
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,480
she’s been trying hard

839
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,240
to gain professional knowledge

840
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,720
since she entered the company.

841
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
So,

842
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,360
she’s developed a certain level of

843
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
aesthetic judgment.

844
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,120
Besides, she knows me well.

845
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,760
She won’t talk insincerely

846
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,920
to please me

847
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,240
on such a matter.

848
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,840
I didn’t mean anything by it.

849
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,040
But you said so much.

850
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,760
Will you go back to the company?

851
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,600
No.

852
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,600
Her friend is holding a party today

853
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,480
because her book sold well.

854
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,840
I said

855
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,680
I’ll go there after I’m finished.

856
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,080
You’re going to attend a party?

857
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,720
It’s not bad

858
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,680
to try something new.

859
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,560
I have no interest in parties.

860
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But,

861
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,280
I want to see how you’ll handle a party.

862
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,000
Do you mind if I go with you?

863
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,720
You can send me there,

864
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
of course I won’t mind.

865
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,320
Let’s go then.

866
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
Change to a cool pose.

867
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,640
Alright. Take a rest.

868
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,280
Okay.

869
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,080
Do you want to eat fruit?

870
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,440
Hmm.

871
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,720
Here.

872
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,640
Let’s eat this.

873
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,880
Yiren!

874
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
The meeting is over?

875
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
Do you mind if I join you?

876
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,520
Of course not.

877
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,760
The more the merrier.

878
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,760
Let me introduce you

879
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,200
to Xia Di.

880
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,000
Let’s wait a moment.

881
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,320
The show is starting.

882
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,400
The music is great.

883
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,960
The box is coming.

884
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,520
Honey Xia,

885
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,240
could it be a mysterious gift for you?

886
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,560
From whom?

887
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,240
Probably it’s from Gu Bo.

888
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
Where is Gu Bo?

889
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,120
Don’t tell me

890
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,800
Gu Bo is inside the box.

891
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,640
Gosh, this is so rustic.

892
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
Since they already sent it here,

893
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,520
you should open it and take a look.

894
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,360
I won’t.

895
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,560
Let him stay inside a bit longer.

896
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,720
This is so rustic!

897
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,760
Honey Xia,

898
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,000
you better open it now.

899
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,280
What if it’s not Gu Bo?

900
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,560
Right.

901
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,680
Everyone’s watching.

902
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,560
Open it.

903
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,680
