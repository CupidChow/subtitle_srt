20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Hey, little girl.

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
What happened?

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,920
I can’t find the way home.

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,400
I want mom.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Stop crying.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,280
I’ll give this bird to you.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
Stop crying, okay?

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
Stop crying.

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
Let me send you home,

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
alright?

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,600
Thank you, sir.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Now can you send me home?

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
It really isn’t you?

33
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,280
Mom.

34
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
What are you doing?

35
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,480
I’m doing housework.

36
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,960
You should rest in bed.

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Stop doing housework.

38
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
I’ve totally recovered.

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
I won’t get out of breath

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,360
even if I run ten laps.

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Only dead persons won’t get out of breath.

42
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Did Gu Bo leave?

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,240
Not yet.

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
Why is he still here?

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
He’s so cheeky.

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,160
Mom,

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,040
he doesn’t have a place to stay.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
He’s miserable.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Don’t try to

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
drive him away all the time, okay?

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
There are a lot of miserable persons.

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,720
Can you help all of them?

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
I’m not being harsh.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,400
But people will get the wrong idea

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,360
if you and him live together.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
Let’s not worry about this now.

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
No one will care about that.

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Who said that?

59
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,000
Did you check the profiles I left for you?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,120
They’re all blue chips.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
What are you saying?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,760
Mom, you started to

63
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
buy stocks again?

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
Knock it off.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Trying to change the topic every time?

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,160
I’ll not

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
let you get away with it this time.

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
Mom, I have an incoming call.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,680
I gotta go.

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
I usually called you “my princess”,

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,640
so you think you can have everything your way?

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
You’re a girl.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,840
Besides,

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,400
I always told you to drive carefully.

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,080
You just wouldn’t

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
listen to me.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,760
How many times has this happened?

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,040
More than twice.

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,360
You think you’re a hero?

80
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,000
You want to be a soul knight?

81
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
What?

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
Why are you all worked up?

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,520
I’m scared.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
Seriously?

85
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
Should I call her or not?

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,960
If you don’t tell her,

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,240
she’ll treat you as her buddy forever.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
Her buddy?

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,440
No, no.

90
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,460
= Princess =

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,320
I should call her.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,620
= Princess =

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Hello?

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Hello, princess.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,400
I want to invite you to dinner.

96
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,080
Why?

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
To...

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,760
To celebrate your recovery,

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
and express my gratitude

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
for letting me stay in your place.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,640
Oh, right.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,400
I’ve found a top-rated restaurant.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
I’m sure you’ll like it.

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,040
There are many...

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Okay.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,800
See you this evening.

107
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,720
Xia Di,

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,200
I have something to say.

109
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
In fact...

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
Look!

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
A super handsome guy just passed by!

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Handsome?

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,680
I don’t think so.

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Of course.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Didn’t you see how macho he is?

116
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
Oh boy.

117
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,800
I’ll definitely feel secure

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
if I stand next to him.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Didn’t you say

120
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
you don’t like to be protected,

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,240
but you like to protect others?

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
Did I ever say that?

123
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,040
Hmm.

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,720
You have it all wrong.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,080
I’ve always liked muscular men.

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
Men that are super macho.

127
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,680
I’ve always liked mature men

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
that are older than me

129
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
and rich.

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,960
Right.

131
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,640
I’ll find a boyfriend like this

132
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,120
in the future.

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
Do you really mean it?

134
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,560
Hmm.

135
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
Actually I’m a very

136
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,320
superficial person that only cares about

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,760
a man’s appearance.

138
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,840
What is it that

139
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,200
you wanted to tell me just now?

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,560
I wanted to say

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
the food here is very delicious.

142
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,120
And the service is excellent.

143
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
They’ll even play music for us.

144
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,320
No, no.

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,200
Please stop.

146
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Play Detective Conan.

147
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
Detective Conan.

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,520
I’ve had a dream since childhood.

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,320
I always wanted to see

150
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
if a murder will take place

151
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,760
if I listen to this theme song

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
in, for example, a hotel.

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Now I feel like

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
I’m dying.

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,480
The food is really delicious.

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you.

157
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,160
Then you should eat more.

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,920
Miss, this balloon is for you.

159
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,280
I wish you happiness.

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
Eat up. Eat up.

161
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,480
Here.

162
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,040
You can go over there.

163
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,520
Over there.

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,440
There are also guests.

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
Over there. Over there.

166
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,520
Their performance is great.

167
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Why did you tell them to go away?

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
You just said

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
you’re dying.

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,560
We need more witnesses to be here.

171
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,200
Eat up.

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
Right, Gu Bo,

173
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,640
have the electrical problems been fixed?

174
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
It’s been almost two months.

175
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
I don’t know yet.

176
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
They didn’t inform me.

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,560
Are you going to drive me away?

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,480
I’m used to living alone.

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,800
Now you’re here,

180
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
I don’t feel very comfortable.

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
You should ask about it later.

182
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
Go back if the electrical problems are fixed.

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,440
But you haven’t fully recovered.

184
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,920
I can still take care of you.

185
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
I recovered long ago.

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,920
But I...

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I’ve got used to the bed in your house.

188
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
You like it?

189
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
I can give the mattress to you.

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,000
Then...

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
What about the daily meals?

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,560
You can’t finish two dishes by yourself.

193
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,960
It’d be great to eat with another person.

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
You’re right.

195
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
Seems it’s time for me

196
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,320
to look for a boyfriend.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
It’s decided then.

198
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I’ll give you two weeks.

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Let’s buy a green pepper.

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,320
Get some leek sprouts over there.

201
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,160
I can cook meat with them tomorrow.

202
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,840
Hmm.

203
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Here you are.

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
You got the wrong one.

205
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,240
These are leeks, not leek sprouts.

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,280
Leeks?

207
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Hmm.

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,600
Aren’t they the same thing?

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,520
No.

210
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,920
Leeks are green.

211
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,160
Leek sprouts are yellow.

212
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,320
And leek sprouts are thinner than leeks.

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Fine.

214
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
I’ll change it.

215
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,040
Help me get a bottle of dark soy sauce.

216
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,840
Hmm.

217
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Dark soy sauce.

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,760
Here you are.

219
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
It must be one of them.

220
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,200
I’m afraid I may get the wrong one,

221
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
so I took another bottle.

222
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,760
Sorry to say this,

223
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,120
but you’re wrong again.

224
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
This one is light soy sauce.

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,720
And this one is soy sauce.

226
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
They’re not what I want.

227
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
But aren’t they also soy sauce?

228
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
It’s different.

229
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,040
Light soy sauce

230
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,400
can enrich the flavor of a dish.

231
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,960
Dark soy sauce can add color to a dish.

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,760
And soy sauce

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,960
can increase the freshness of a dish.

234
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Now I know.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Dark soy sauce is different from soy sauce.

236
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,120
Light soy sauce adds color to a dish.

237
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,760
Soy sauce can

238
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,560
enrich the flavor of a dish.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,240
Alright. Alright.

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

241
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I told you

242
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
I can come alone.

243
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,960
But you insisted on coming with me.

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,920
Let me do it. Let me do it.

245
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,960
I actually came here

246
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,320
to do some practice.

247
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
Practice what?

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
I can’t let you do

249
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,360
these things all by yourself in the future.

250
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,680
I need to learn these skills gradually.

251
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,040
I need to know more

252
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
about daily necessities,

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,520
like soy sauce, leeks.

254
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
Otherwise, how am I supposed to...

255
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
What’s wrong?

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,760
Did I say anything wrong?

257
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
No.

258
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Thank you.

259
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,600
I’ve got used to

260
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,080
doing these things by myself.

261
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,640
I never wanted to bother others.

262
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
Thank you for being willing to

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
do these trivial things for me.

264
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
Let’s change the soy sauce first.

265
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Hmm.

266
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,280
Welcome to our shop.

267
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,480
Please check our new arrivals.

268
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,280
Yu Qing,

269
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,360
how many times have I told you?

270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Ours is a high-end dress shop,

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
not just any clothes shop.

272
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
You should watch your attitude.

273
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,200
You’re representing the image of our shop.

274
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,320
Didn’t I tell you not to

275
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
check your phone during work hours?

276
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,200
If I see you do this again,

277
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,760
you’ll be fired immediately.

278
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,680
Did you hear me?

279
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Okay.

280
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,640
Stand straight.

281
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,560
What image are you talking about?

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
You’re just envious

283
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,480
because I’m beautiful?

284
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,840
Manager,

285
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
I need to go to the bathroom.

286
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,240
Give it to me.

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,920
It’s so heavy.

288
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,920
Who is it?

289
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,600
My cousin.

290
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,080
Hello, Qing?

291
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Hello,

292
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,240
where are you?

293
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,400
I’m in the company.

294
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,320
Nothing really.

295
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,240
My mom wants you to eat with us.

296
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,200
Okay.

297
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,640
I’ll go back when I have time.

298
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,200
I’m hungry.

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Let’s go back.

300
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,640
How despicable you are!

301
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
You’ve been dating a rich guy,

302
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720
but you didn’t tell me.

303
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
Are you afraid I’ll steal him?

304
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,880
So stingy!

305
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Hello?

306
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,520
Yes, I have time.

307
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,840
I’ll be right there.

308
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
You said you want to see me,

309
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
so I skipped work to come here.

310
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,560
A caramel latte for you.

311
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,000
I think you’ll like sweet drinks.

312
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,120
Yes.

313
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
You ordered it for me,

314
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,000
of course I’ll like it.

315
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
Sorry for last time.

316
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
I left without saying goodbye.

317
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
I already forgot that.

318
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,880
But are you alright?

319
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,600
You look very pale.

320
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
You feeling unwell?

321
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Did you go to see the doctor?

322
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
I have something to ask you.

323
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,560
Where did you

324
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,640
get that little bird?

325
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,920
That bird?

326
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,840
It’s from a friend.

327
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,000
Which friend?

328
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
I...

329
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
I can’t remember.

330
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
I got it when I was a kid.

331
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,400
Can you think carefully about it?

332
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
When and where

333
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
did that person

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,720
give it to you?

335
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,800
I really can’t remember.

336
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,560
But why are you asking me this?

337
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,800
Do you know

338
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
this girl?

339
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
Isn’t this Xu Yiren?

340
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
Are you sure?

341
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,160
This is our primary school graduation photo.

342
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,440
I’m pretty sure.

343
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
I was also there.

344
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,080
See?

345
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,120
This is me.

346
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
You and Xu Yiren were classmates?

347
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,640
Yes.

348
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
Didn’t you say

349
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
this hairpin is yours?

350
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Yes.

351
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
It is mine.

352
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,600
Now I remember,

353
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,480
when we took the photo that day,

354
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,200
Xu Yiren took the hairpin from me.

355
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,760
She was always like that,

356
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,560
always trying to take things from me.

357
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
She’s a few months younger than me,

358
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,360
so my parents always let me get her way.

359
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
But I got the hairpin back later.

360
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Did you go on a trip to the Qing Mountain

361
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
when you were in the fifth grade?

362
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,120
How do you know?

363
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
Did an accident happen that day?

364
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,320
Probably.

365
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,400
Did it happen or not?

366
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,560
What do you mean probably?

367
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,400
I can’t remember.

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
I fell ill back then.

369
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,160
I forgot it when I woke up.

370
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,760
Besides,

371
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,040
you said it was an accident.

372
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,400
So it was not something pleasant.

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
I must have been scared.

374
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
So it’s natural that I can’t remember it.

375
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,600
Li Zhe,

376
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,120
why are you asking me this?

377
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,040
I admit that

378
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,280
I lied again

379
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,960
just now

380
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
when my cousin called me.

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
I promised you

382
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,680
I’ll spend some time with you,

383
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,320
so I...

384
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,440
Come in.

385
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,640
Shiyu said

386
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,280
this is your private space.

387
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Can I come in?

388
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Should I send you an invitation?

389
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,440
Sit.

390
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
Aren’t you angry?

391
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,240
Not at all.

392
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,040
The view from here

393
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,480
is really good.

394
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,200
Xu Yiren.

395
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,840
Hmm.

396
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
Before you appeared,

397
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
this place was like a lonely island for me.

398
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,040
I only came here to

399
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,640
vent my anger at lies,

400
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,800
and shrink from my responsibilities.

401
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,480
Then you appeared,

402
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,040
I started to get

403
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
a feeling of home.

404
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
Gradually,

405
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,680
I started to justify your lies,

406
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
not because of other things,

407
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,560
but because of you.

408
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,160
Also because

409
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,440
I was the reason you lied.

410
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,920
Do you mean that

411
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,520
I can continue telling small lies?

412
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
From today,

413
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
for every lie you tell,

414
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
you’ll get punished.

415
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,920
What’s with the look?

416
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,400
Are you expecting the next punishment?

417
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,320
Then you can try and tell another lie.

418
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,480
No, I won’t.

419
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,680
What are you doing?

420
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,280
I cooked this for you.

421
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,160
It can moisten the lungs.

422
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Hmm.

423
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,480
You cooked it?

424
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,000
Hmm.

425
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
It’s hot. Be careful.

426
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,040
How does it taste?

427
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,360
Compliment me.

428
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,960
I’ve finished it.

429
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,880
What’s it?

430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,040
Wine poached pear.

431
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,080
I have a low alcohol tolerance.

432
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
Alright. Alright.

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,280
Stop pretending.

434
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,480
Hey!

435
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,520
What are you doing?

436
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,240

437
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,920

438
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,160
You’re crazy.

439
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,600
You just said you’ll

440
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,840
sing a lullaby for me.

441
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,520
Hurry.

442
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,600
Okay.

443
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,360
I’ll sing it for you.

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,040

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
Let me tell you a secret.

447
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Go ahead.

448
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,400
Listen up.

449
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,600
Actually,

450
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,480
I like my assistant Xu Yiren.

451
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,520
Although she’s flat-chested,

452
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,480
and her legs are skinny.

453
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Why do you hit me?

454
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
What are you saying?

455
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
But I still like her.

456
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
You’re insane.

457
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,920
So annoying.

458
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,320
Why do you scold me?

459
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
I didn’t.

460
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,920
What the hell?

461
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,440
Am I cute?

462
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,600
You’ve gone mad.

463
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,320
You...

464
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,520
Have your fun.

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,920
I don’t want to speak to you.

466
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,280
Where are you going?

467
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,040
Don’t go.

468
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,680
You can’t go.

469
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
Why are you flat-breasted?

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
It’s flat.

471
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
Fang Zhiyou,

472
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,320
sleep already.

473
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,280

474
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,520

476
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
How do you feel,

477
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,160
sweetie?

478
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,560
Do you feel any better?

479
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,240
I want to change my job.

480
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,920
I have to stand for ten hours a day.

481
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,240
It’s worse than hell.

482
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,480
My legs have gotten thicker.

483
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,240
I know.

484
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,560
I know your work is very hard.

485
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
But I went to great lengths

486
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,520
to get this job for you

487
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,360
through a friend of your father.

488
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,120
Not everyone can work there.

489
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,360
You should hang on.

490
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,520
I can’t.

491
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
You can try it yourself.

492
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,480
What kind of job is that?

493
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,120
I can earn so little money.

494
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,960
Sweetie,

495
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,720
that’s because you didn’t see

496
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,280
how potential this job is.

497
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,800
Think about it.

498
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,320
What kind of people

499
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,640
will buy clothes in such places?

500
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
They’re all well-educated rich men.

501
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,360
You can’t buy such a chance

502
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,680
with money.

503
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,560
Maybe

504
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
you’ll meet a rich young man

505
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,400
some day.

506
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
I actually saw

507
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
a handsome rich guy today.

508
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
Who’s he?

509
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
But do you know who he was with?

510
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
Whom was he with?

511
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,200
Xu Yiren.

512
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,240
Impossible.

513
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,080
Maybe

514
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,720
she was

515
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,120
just meeting a client.

516
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,480
Who will meet their clients in a shopping mall?

517
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,600
Besides, they were holding each other’s hand.

518
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,240
They must be very close.

519
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,320
How dares she lied to us?

520
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,720
She said she doesn’t have a boyfriend,

521
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,440
but who is this man?

522
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,400
No.

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,600
What are you going to do?

524
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,880
I have to ask her about this.

525
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,920
She deliberately deceived us,

526
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,440
will she tell you anything?

527
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,760
If you ask her,

528
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,560
she’ll become more cautious.

529
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
That nasty girl!

530
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,280
No wonder she didn’t even

531
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,600
take Li Zhe seriously.

532
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I thought she just wanted you to have him.

533
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,800
It turns out

534
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
she actually has a better man.

535
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,120
What are you saying?

536
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,120
Li Zhe is nothing less than that man.

537
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,040
Right. Right.

538
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,880
I know you’re interested in Li Zhe.

539
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,240
I also think he’s a good choice.

540
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
It’s actually good if Yiren has a boyfriend.

541
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
So that she’ll not compete with you.

542
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,880
You must do your best,

543
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,640
got it?

544
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,560
I knew that.

545
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
Mom,

546
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,280
do you still remember that

547
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,920
Xu Yiren once went lost

548
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,560
during that spring trip

549
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,120
when we were in the fifth grade?

550
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Yes.

551
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Your father and I

552
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,000
had to go to the Qing Mountain at midnight.

553
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,240
She was such a trouble maker.

554
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,360
Then did she

555
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,320
get that little bird during that trip?

556
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,080
Little bird?

557
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,000
That grass-woven bird

558
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
she cherished so much

559
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,160
and asked us to bring here?

560
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
I don’t know such a thing.

561
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Why do you want it?

562
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
Not that.

563
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
It’s Li Zhe who wants it.

564
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,840
Seems he’s very interested in that thing.

565
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,480
He came to ask me about it today.

566
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
But I was smart.

567
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,520
I said that bird is mine.

568
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,520
Why would he be interested in that bird?

569
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,360
I don’t know.

570
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
But I think

571
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,280
it’s not as simple as it appears.

572
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,560
I’ve confirmed it.

573
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,240
Yu Qing didn’t lie.

574
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,280
They became classmates

575
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,920
after Xu Yiren started to live with them.

576
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,680
That detective also asked the councilor.

577
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
She only remembers that someone went lost.

578
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
But she couldn’t remember

579
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
who she is.

580
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
I’ve been looking for her for so many years.

581
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,120
Now I’ve found her,

582
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,320
but

583
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
I don’t feel happy about it at all.

584
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,600
In fact,

585
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
we’re not 100% sure

586
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,120
that little girl is Yu Qing.

587
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
She could be Xu Yiren, too.

588
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Perhaps

589
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,960
you can ask her about this.

590
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:26,343
♪ My love for you runs so deep ♪

591
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,320
This is the last reason I have

592
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,720
to keep pestering Xu Yiren

593
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,080
shamelessly.

594
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,220
♪ Not to leave me ♪

595
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
What should I do

596
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,996
♪ You gave me a promise before ♪

597
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
if it’s not her?

598
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,890
♪ Capture the warm moment ♪

599
00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:51,646
♪ I loved crisscrossing shadow ♪

600
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,840
Why is he sleeping on the floor?

601
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Did I kick him down?

602
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,640
Um,

603
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,480
you’re awake.

604
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,360
Morning.

605
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,920
How come I’m sleeping on the floor?

606
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,400
What’s wrong?

607
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,440
My waist.

608
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
It hurts.

609
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
I had a dream last night.

610
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,400
Someone was kicking me all the time.

611
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,320
What’s with that look?

612
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,480
It was not me.

613
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,960
Um,

614
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
I’m going to wash my face.

615
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,120
Hello, Qing?

616
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,640
I have time.

617
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,200
Okay.

618
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,680
See you later.

619
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,760
This takeaway is very delicious.

620
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,960
I’ve eaten their food for one week.

621
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,720
But I’m still not sick of it.

622
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,400
My treat.

623
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,080
Qing,

624
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,080
is there anything

625
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,320
you want to say to me?

626
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,400
So I can’t even ask you to eat with me?

627
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
We haven’t eaten like this for a long time.

628
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,880
Do you still remember

629
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,760
we often ate lunches like this

630
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,600
when we were in the primary school?

631
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,080
Looks so delicious!

632
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,120
Who cooked it?

633
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
Who cooked it for you?

634
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
It looks so good!

635
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,560
It smells great!

636
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,720
I’m almost drooling.

637
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
My mom cooked this for me.

638
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,920
- So good! - Your mom is amazing!

639
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,400
My mom always cooked this for me.

640
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Have one.

641
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,560
My mom always cooked this for me.

642
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,220
= Shop manager =

643
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,960
Our manager is in menopause.

644
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,240
She vented her anger at me every day.

645
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,840
I was so annoyed that I wanted to change my job.

646
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
I really envy you.

647
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
You just need to dress up

648
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
and sit in the office every day.

649
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,600
Is your company recruiting employees?

650
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,640
You can recommend me.

651
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,280
We’re not recruiting.

652
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
You can also recommend me

653
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,880
to other companies.

654
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,760
I want a job

655
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,880
as easy as yours.

656
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,600
Qing,

657
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
you’ve been doing this job for just a couple days.

658
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,080
You also quit your last job very soon.

659
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I think

660
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,400
you should be patient

661
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,680
and do this job well.

662
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Wait at least till you pass the probation period.

663
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,440
Just tell me if you don’t want to help me.

664
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
I’m not scheming like you.

665
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,960
You know how to deal with people here.

666
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,120
You have a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

667
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,280
But it’s not your turn to teach me.

668
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,560
This bracelet looks beautiful.

669
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,240
Hmm.

670
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
What are you doing?

671
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,840
I won’t take it from you.

672
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Why so nervous?

673
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,920
It’s from your boyfriend?

674
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,560
No.

675
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,200
You can tell me.

676
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
I won’t tell my mom.

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,360
You have a boyfriend, right?

678
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,680
No.

679
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,120
I really don’t.

680
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,280
You...

681
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
You can mind your own business,

682
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,400
and don’t try to take things from me again.

683
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,440
You like this bento, right?

684
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
You can have mine as well.

685
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,600
Eat up.

686
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
Something is obviously off.

687
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,640
How dares she talk back to me?

688
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,800
Fine.

689
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,880
I still need her help.

690
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
Oh, right.

691
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,800
I’ve brought those things here.

692
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,560
Remember to fetch them when you have time.

693
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,360
I’ll fetch them this weekend.

694
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,960
I saw that

695
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,480
there is a grass-woven bird in the box.

696
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,280
It’s very cute.

697
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,160
I can’t give it to you.

698
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
No way.

699
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Why so nervous?

700
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,680
I don’t want it.

701
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,080
But who gave it to you?

702
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
You cherished it so much.

703
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,080
Didn’t I tell you before?

704
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,480
That boy who carried me

705
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,320
to the police station gave it to me

706
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
when I went lost during that trip.

707
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,520
A boy?

708
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,840
What’s his name?

709
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,280
I don’t know.

710
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,760
I was so worried back then.

711
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,320
I forgot to ask.

712
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,880
Did you see him again?

713
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,040
He left after he sent me to the police station.

714
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,680
Later,

715
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,000
I tried to find him,

716
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,560
but I never got any clues.

717
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Seems

718
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,520
that boy who saved Xu Yiren

719
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,920
is Li Zhe.

720
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,160
It’s really a pity.

721
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,120
Eat.

722
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,280
You can eat yourself.

723
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Hey, Gu Bo.

724
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,120
What are you doing?

725
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,160
I need to take a lunch break.

726
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,760
Xia Di rejected me.

727
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Ah?

728
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,400
Xia Di rejected you?

729
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,080
It’s worse than that.

730
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,880
She told me that

731
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
she’s never gonna

732
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,960
like me in her lifetime.

733
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,680
She said

734
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,760
she likes

735
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,600
mature

736
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
and macho men

737
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,360
that are older than her

738
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,400
and rich.

739
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,080
I can only meet one of the four requirements.

740
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
How is that possible?

741
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,200
Xia Di never liked

742
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
muscular men.

743
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,240
She never drew them.

744
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
And she doesn’t care about wealth at all.

745
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,560
Move aside! Move aside!

746
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
She can’t even

747
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,120
handle her own relationship well,

748
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,800
but now she’s giving you advice?

749
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,360
Why are you here?

750
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,040
I came to see my brother.

751
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,240
Seriously?

752
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,640
You were

753
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,160
eavesdropping on us just now?

754
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,560
Actually,

755
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,920
I wanted to be nice

756
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,200
and teach you a trick or two.

757
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,600
But seeing how rude you are,

758
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,800
I’ve changed my idea.

759
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,080
What?

760
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,280
Did I hear it wrong?

761
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,880
You said...

762
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,480
you...

763
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,840
want to teach me?

764
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,840
Can you understand what we’re saying?

765
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
She’s Cui Yingying.

766
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,360
I’m the matchmaker.

767
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Romance of the Western Chamber.

768
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
You don’t know?

769
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Are you kidding me?

770
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,520
Ask her

771
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
if my tricks are useful.

772
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
I actually brought

773
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
her and my brother together.

774
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,080
Matchmaker,

775
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,120
you see,

776
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,320
it’s scorching hot today.

777
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
You should have taken an umbrella.

778
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,760
You’ll get sunburned.

779
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,320
I’ll shield the sunlight from you.

780
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,160
Oh, right.

781
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,240
I’ll take you to an interesting place.

782
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,000
Let’s have a talk over there,

783
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,760
is that okay?

784
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,440
Let’s go.

785
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,960
Didn’t you come to see your brother?

786
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,120
Yiren,

787
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,480
you should go back to work.

788
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,520
My brother will get anxious

789
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,320
if he can’t find you later.

790
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Don’t worry about us.

791
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,720
Tell my brother

792
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,240
dad will go there early on that day of next month.

793
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
Let him make some time for it.

794
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Which day?

795
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,880
Is it good?

796
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,600
Eat slowly.

797
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,000
There are many more.

798
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,480
Can I take one away later?

799
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
Of course.

800
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,040
See?

801
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,480
These are all for you.

802
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,560
No.

803
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
You have to give me some advice first.

804
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Actually it’s very easy.

805
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,160
Judging by

806
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
what you said,

807
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,520
I can say that at least

808
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,800
Xia Di doesn’t hate you.

809
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,120
Why?

810
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,160
Think about it.

811
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Will you let a person you hate live in your home?

812
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,040
You won’t, right?

813
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,520
Will you let a person you like live in your home?

814
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,440
You will, right?

815
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,480
But now she wants to drive me away.

816
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,160
That means she must be

817
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,520
in a difficult position now.

818
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But

819
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,320
why did she lie to me?

820
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,600
She could tell me directly.

821
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,440
Women

822
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,560
are entitled not to tell the truth.

823
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,160
That means I still have a chance.

824
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,840
Probably this is a test for me.

825
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
I’ll confess my love to her again.

826
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,400
Thank you, little matchmaker.

827
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
These are all yours now.

828
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
I’m not finished yet.

829
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,040
Another possibility is

830
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,280
she really sees you as her buddy.

831
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,520
But she didn’t want to tell you,

832
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,120
or you’ll feel really awkward.

833
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,320
Her buddy?

834
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,000
Buddy.

835
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,800
Where is Ms. He?

836
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,960
Mr. Fang.

837
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Ms. He took a leave again.

838
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,960
She’s on leave again.

839
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,640
What happened?

840
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,480
Ms. He has been constantly absent recently.

841
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,200
We don’t know why.

842
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,280
Luo Yang,

843
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
have you got any news?

844
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,720
I’m afraid

845
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,680
I won’t be able to be

846
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,960
your news source anymore.

847
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,960
Ms. He and Mr. Fang quarreled a lot.

848
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
But Ms. He was never angry

849
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,920
for such a long time.

850
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,560
Right.

851
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,320
I wonder what is going on this time.

852
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,280
Why are you here?

853
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
What happened?

854
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
What are you thinking about?

855
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,400
Nothing.

856
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,560
You must be tired.

857
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,440
Let me give you a massage.

858
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,080
Okay.

859
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,040
What happened between you and Ms. He?

860
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
It’s because of you.

861
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,960
Me?

862
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,600
Hmm.

863
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,240
How come?

864
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,840
She quarreled with me after she learned

865
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,880
we had been dating each other.

866
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
Does Ms. He

867
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,040
actually...

868
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,240
Don’t worry about it.

869
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,080
Yuwen seldom got angry.

870
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,280
Probably she got angry this time

871
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,240
because I didn’t

872
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,520
tell her my relationship

873
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,040
with you and Li Zhe.

874
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
I’ll go to see her

875
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,440
when she feels better.

876
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,280
Don’t worry.

877
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,080
It’ll be fine.

878
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,040
Hmm.

879
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,920
Oh, right.

880
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,200
Shiyu just came here.

881
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,280
She let me tell you

882
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,040
to make some time

883
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,480
for that day of next month.

884
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,680
Your dad will be there early in the morning.

885
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,480
What’s it?

886
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
What’s wrong?

887
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,680
It’s the anniversary of my mother’s death.

888
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,360
Did you try to avoid your father

889
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,280
on this day every year?

890
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,120
Yes.

891
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,440
We’d quarrel when we see each other.

892
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,640
I don’t want my mother to see that.

893
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,120
Right.

894
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,840
Remember to bring a bunch of jasmine flowers.

895
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,440
My mom liked jasmine flowers.

896
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
Okay.

897
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
I’m going, too?

898
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,320
Right.

899
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
I was about to tell you this.

900
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,960
It’s time for you to meet her.

901
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,320
But...

902
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,440
I’m not ready yet.

903
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,280
Ready for what?

904
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,880
This outfit looks good on you.

905
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,480
Okay.

906
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,120
We’ll go together.

907
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Then...

908
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,520
when will you take me

909
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,680
to see your

910
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,840
uncle and aunt?

911
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,920
They’ve

912
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,200
been

913
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
busy lately.

914
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,800
We can

915
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,840
do that

916
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,000
after we finish this project.

917
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,280
Hmm.

918
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
Give me a hug and go back to work.

919
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
You should lose weight.

920
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,120
So annoying.

921
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,480
Have a good rest.

922
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,400
Have a good rest.

923
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,880
I’m leaving.

924
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,160
Bye-bye.

925
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,920
Bye-bye.

926
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,320
Bye-bye.

927
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,480
Bye-bye.
