20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Put me on the sofa.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,760
Hmm, okay.

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,120
Be careful.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Yiren.

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,520
You must be tired.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Come and have a rest.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,880
What?

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,040
She comes for the first time.

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,760
Why don’t you get her some water?

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
There’s water at my place, too.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,720
I feel a bit thirsty.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
Do you hear?

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,280
Get me a lactobacillus drink.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
What are you waiting for?

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,280
I’m so poor. I can’t walk.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
No one even gets me a drink.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
What?

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Doesn’t it hurt now?

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Oh, it hurts.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,120
Stop pretending.

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
You’re pretending so poorly.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
And you have a poor memory.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,800
If your brother didn’t care too much,

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,920
he would have seen you through.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,240
Tell me.

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
What are you up to?

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Yiren.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,600
You must help me.

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
I caught you, huh?

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
Why do you have a drink when you’re just back?

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Come.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
Have some hot water.

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Good boy.

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,920
Mom.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Can I have the drink now?

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,400
Fine.

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
But promise me.

57
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Beverage isn’t healthy.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
It has little nutritive value.

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,520
Drink less.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,920
Hmm.

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,160
Okay.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
Dad, you’re back.

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Hello, Mr. Fang.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
You’re back?

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
Why don’t you sit down?

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,400
No.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
Let’s go.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,480
Zhiyou.

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
Today is father’s birthday.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Stay and celebrate with us.

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,160
We’ve come.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Just stay.

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,160
You rarely come back.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,400
Why don’t you

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
just have dinner with us?

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,800
It’s my first time to pay a visit.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,520
It’ll be rude if I just leave.

79
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Besides, today is your father’s birthday.

80
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
Let’s stay.

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
I’m begging you.

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,840
When mother was alive,

83
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,560
we were happy and lively at home

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,920
at everyone’s birthday.

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
But now it feels quiet at home.

86
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
I’ll leave immediately after we finish dinner.

87
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
Awesome. Zhiyou, you’re the best.

88
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
You lied to me, Shiyu.

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
I didn’t.

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,440
Zhiyou, let me take you to a wonderful place.

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,480
Thank you.

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,320
You’re welcome.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,600
I didn’t know it was your birthday.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,920
I didn’t bring any present for you.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,520
You brought me the best present.

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
Thank you.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,520
It’s fresh.

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Have a try.

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,440
New recipe.

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
This is where

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,360
you grew up?

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
So neat.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
Your father must be waiting

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
until you come back.

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,040
Today, I stay

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,240
for the sake of you and my mother.

107
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Don’t ask me

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,680
for more.

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,640
Wow, I feel proud.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Don’t think I don’t know.

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,920
You knew

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
Fang Shiyu was pretending.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
You lied to me with her.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
I’ll...

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
deal with you later.

116
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,440
Uh...

117
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,560
Aren’t you going to

118
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,840
talk with your father about the tablets?

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
He’s in the living room,

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,040
alone.

121
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,520
Maybe,

122
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
he’s waiting for you.

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,400
If he wants to tell me,

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
he will.

125
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
I said,

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
don’t ask me for more.

127
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,800
That’s your photo when you were little?

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,040
Adorable.

129
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Let me have a look at your photos.

130
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
I’m not asking for more, huh?

131
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,320
You saw it, didn’t you?

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
Only one photo?

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
I want more.

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,280
I don’t know

135
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
where the rest photos are kept.

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
All right.

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,760
I’ll go look for them.

138
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,880
The soup is almost ready.

139
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Have dinner first.

140
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,880
Why are you so good-natured?

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
You’re a guest.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Why does a guest

143
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,120
cook for herself?

144
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,880
What’s the problem?

145
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,920
Fang Shiyu loves my dishes.

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
Besides,

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
when someone likes the dishes I cook,

148
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
I can’t be too happy.

149
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
I also want to leave a good impression

150
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,280
on your father.

151
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
I begin to regret

152
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
letting you stay.

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Why are you even jealous of Shiyu?

154
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
I’ll put more vinegar in the dish

155
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
so that you can enjoy it.

156
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,640
I’ll let you know when dinner is ready.

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,720
There you are.

158
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,840
Yuwen.

159
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
You suddenly asked to see me.

160
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,840
I...

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
I’ve been staying here for the whole day.

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
I’ve thought a lot.

163
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
When we were in college,

164
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Fang Zhiyou always had higher marks than me.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
I’m He Yuliang’s daughter.

166
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,280
I strained every nerve to defeat him.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
But I failed.

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
Unexpectedly,

169
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
I fell in love with him.

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
At that time,

171
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
we were jealous of Fang Zhiyou.

172
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
He was talented.

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,840
Our teacher thought highly of him.

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,760
And you...

175
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
You look at him differently from

176
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,800
how you look at us.

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,840
Jealous?

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,440
You mean envious?

179
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
In our industry,

180
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
working hard matters.

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
But we can’t be talented by being envious.

182
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
I know how far I can go.

183
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,440
If he didn’t betray Mr. He,

184
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,360
I wouldn’t have gone so far

185
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,680
in Liangshan.

186
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Then you should be grateful to him.

187
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,760
We all witnessed

188
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
how highly Mr. He thought of him.

189
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,160
I can never forgive

190
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,400
what he has done.

191
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,440
Besides,

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
he hurt you again.

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
We’ve been known each other for so many years.

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
But now I begin to understand you.

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,800
Because you only saw Fang Zhiyou.

196
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,240
Qiming.

197
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
You’re a good man.

198
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,480
Are you

199
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
rejecting me?

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
I...

201
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
I’m going back to Square & Circle.

202
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Why?

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
I first joined Square & Circle

204
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,520
because of Fang Zhiyou.

205
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
Over so many years,

206
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
Square & Circle is not only my career.

207
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
Like you said,

208
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
I’ve put so many efforts in it.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
I can’t give up

210
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,240
just because of Fang Zhiyou.

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,640
Besides,

212
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
I’ve lost my love.

213
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,040
I can’t lose my career.

214
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
But if you go back to Liangshan,

215
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
you’ll also use your professional knowledge.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
There’s a bigger space for development.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
I’m not going back.

218
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,640
I joined Square & Circle for Fang Zhiyou.

219
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
But I left Liangshan

220
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,520
because of my father.

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,680
Mr. He?

222
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,360
He may be a venerable teacher

223
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
in your eyes.

224
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,960
But in my eyes...

225
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Forget it.

226
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
You’d better

227
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,800
not know something.

228
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,640
But in Liangshan, you can also...

229
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,720
I’ve made up my mind.

230
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,880
Today,

231
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,680
this is what I want to tell you.

232
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,740
= photos =

233
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,060
= Fang Zhiyou =

234
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,220
= Transfer Contract of ZYF Personal Law Firm =

235
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,480
Why did you transfer your firm?

236
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,760
I’m getting old.

237
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,960
I don’t want to be too exhausted.

238
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,440
You’re afraid of retribution,

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,560
because you’ve done many evil things, huh?

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,760
Son.

241
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,000
Why do you always

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
talk to me like that?

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
What do you want to tell me?

244
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,480
Dishes are coming.

245
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,600
Oh, yeah.

246
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Dishes you made

247
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
never let me down.

248
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
You little glutton.

249
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,520
It’s hard to

250
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,840
see them chatting for so long.

251
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,800
Shiyu.

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
Does your father

253
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
feel uncomfortable recently?

254
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
Uncomfortable?

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,120
For example,

256
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,520
does he leave things around and have a poor memory?

257
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,960
Or he forgets what he has just said?

258
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,280
Or does anything go wrong

259
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,080
at work?

260
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,240
Can’t you say something good?

261
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
I don’t mean that.

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well,

263
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
anything unusual?

264
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,480
I don’t know.

265
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
I don’t often

266
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,160
meet my father.

267
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,480
Before I get up,

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,120
he has gone to the firm.

269
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,520
When I come back,

270
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
he’s in the study.

271
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
As for his work,

272
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
I know nothing.

273
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,120
You care so little for your father.

274
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
You don’t understand.

275
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
My father and I don’t interfere with each other.

276
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,720
It’s awesome.

277
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,200
You’re too young.

278
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,240
When you grow up,

279
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,680
you’ll know

280
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
how happy it is

281
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
to have a father around.

282
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,280
Yiren.

283
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,440
Do you miss your father again?

284
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,200
It’s okay.

285
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,840
After you marry my brother,

286
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,160
my father will be yours.

287
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,600
Use him as you wish.

288
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,160
I won’t be jealous.

289
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
It’s so generous of you.

290
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you.

291
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,840
Let’s put in the candles.

292
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,520
Okay.

293
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,560
The doctor said

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
the disease I suffered from

295
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
just began.

296
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,600
If I take active treatment,

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
it’ll be worsened

298
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
very slowly.

299
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Don’t worry.

300
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,840
I won’t have total dementia too soon.

301
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,480
Does Shiyu know?

302
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,000
Shiyu?

303
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,120
She’s too young.

304
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
How would I tell her?

305
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Don’t worry.

306
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,360
I’ve arranged for the rest of life.

307
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,280
I won’t be your burden.

308
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,800
By then,

309
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,840
you just need to take care of Fang Shiyu.

310
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
I took back what I just said.

311
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,760
I mean, retribution.

312
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,400
I never trust

313
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,560
the retribution.

314
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,040
I heard

315
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
Li Zhe came back.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,560
And he made trouble for you.

317
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,400
What?

318
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,120
Do you need

319
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,920
my help?

320
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
How?

321
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,000
Put him in jail, too?

322
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,080
I’m a lawyer.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,360
Wining the case for my client

324
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,680
is my duty.

325
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,640
I don’t owe him anything.

326
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,280
Is lying to your son

327
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
also your duty

328
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,600
to win a case?

329
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,240
I explained to you

330
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
what happened that year.

331
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
I’m okay if you don’t accept it.

332
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,000
But it’s been years.

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,560
But do you still hate me?

334
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,960
No matter how many years it has been,

335
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
Li Zhe won’t forget it.

336
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,120
I won’t, either.

337
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,160
What exactly should I do

338
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
to satisfy you?

339
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
Apologize to everyone.

340
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,000
Apologize to those people

341
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,160
who you wronged that year.

342
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,440
No way.

343
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,840
Why?

344
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,360
Is it so hard to tell the truth?

345
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,720
Do you want me to lose all reputation?

346
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,720
At this moment,

347
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,320
you still care for your status

348
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,120
and reputation, don’t you?

349
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,040
Then why did you ask Shiyu

350
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
to trick me back?

351
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
You think your sickness

352
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,520
can make up for what you’ve done,

353
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,040
don’t you?

354
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,960
Then do you know what a life

355
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,240
Li Zhe and his father are living these years?

356
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,120
I’m wrong.

357
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
I shouldn’t have had any hope

358
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,880
on you.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
There you are, Zhiyou.

360
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,080
Come and have dinner.

361
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Dinner is just ready.

362
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,120
- What are you doing, Zhiyou? - What?

363
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,720
- I have no appetite.
- But we haven’t had dinner yet.

364
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,320
Dad.

365
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Why did you quarrel again?

366
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,920
Didn’t we agree to celebrate your birthday?

367
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
No.

368
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
I’m not going to celebrate my birthday anymore.

369
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,840
Dad.

370
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
Let me celebrate it for you.

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Happy birthday to you.

372
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,560
Happy birthday to you.

373
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,240
Happy birthday to you.

374
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Shiyu.

375
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,800
Fang Zhiyou.

376
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,800
Look.

377
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Don’t be unhappy.

378
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
Let me stroke your head.

379
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,280
Snore, snore.

380
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
Don’t be sad.

381
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Still doesn’t work?

382
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,120
How about a kiss?

383
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,760
I want more.

384
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:52,100
♪ It wasn’t perfect when we first met ♪

385
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:56,680
♪ When I was depressed, you turned up ♪

386
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,143
♪ Maybe we were destined to meet ♪

387
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,600
Luckily, I have you.

388
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,450
♪ When you come near, I have a crush ♪

389
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,480
♪ Every lie becomes sweet ♪

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,140
♪ Love looks messy, but my love grows ♪

391
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,280
A pair of eight.

392
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,080
Gu Bo.

393
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,360
What happened?

394
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
What makes you so happy?

395
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,840
The editor said

396
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,200
the press just called,

397
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,520
to book Season 2 in advance.

398
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,320
Really?

399
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,640
You’re really my princess.

400
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,760
What?

401
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
You just felt happy.

402
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
It suddenly occurred to me that

403
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,280
books don’t sell well.

404
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,960
If I publish some,

405
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
and they don’t sell well,

406
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
that will be awkward.

407
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,400
Forget it.

408
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
I’ll tell them not to publish any.

409
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,520
Don’t.

410
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,360
Why can’t they sell well?

411
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,200
Your new book

412
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
will certainly sell greatly.

413
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
Don’t worry.

414
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,080
What if I can’t sell any?

415
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
I’ll buy them all, then.

416
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,840
Stop boasting.

417
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,880
Ten thousand books.

418
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
I can even afford

419
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,080
twenty thousand books.

420
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,760
A piece of cake.

421
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,680
Why do I like it so much

422
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,880
when you boast?

423
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,800
My mother.

424
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,040
Don’t do that.

425
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,600
Why can you not answer her phone?

426
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Don’t.

427
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
Hello, madam?

428
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
Xia Di?

429
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,080
She’s at a meeting.

430
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,040
I’m waiting for her.

431
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,040
Have dinner together?

432
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,080
Okay. I’ll make a reservation soon.

433
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Okay, don’t worry.

434
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
Xia Di and I will pick you up later.

435
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,480
Okay. Bye.

436
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,160
Come to yourself.

437
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,280
Is that my real mother?

438
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
You’ve got a false mother?

439
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,080
Since when did you

440
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
get on so well with her?

441
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
Didn’t I tell you?

442
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,520
I’ll take care of your mother.

443
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,640
I’ve taken care of it.

444
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
No way?

445
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,480
How did you?

446
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
Well,

447
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
it’s a little secret.

448
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Little secret?

449
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,640
Just tell me.

450
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,600
How dare you keep a secret from me!

451
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,280
Hurry.

452
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Maybe because I’m adorable.

453
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
Stop flattering yourself. Just tell me.

454
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,520
Stop it. Stop it.

455
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,080
I’ll make the reservation.

456
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,280
Tell me, or I’ll throw you over shoulder.

457
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,000
- Don’t. - I’m doing it.

458
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
But I wanted coffee.

459
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,640
You’ve had enough coffee today.

460
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
Have a mandarin.

461
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,920
It provides vitamin C.

462
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,840
I don’t want it.

463
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,240
I want it, then.

464
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,500
= 49 Paper Boats and 49 Kites =

465
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
Still thinking about Li Zhe?

466
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
You’ve tried your best.

467
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
I know.

468
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,560
As far as I know my dad,

469
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,120
he won’t apologize

470
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,480
even when he dies.

471
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,480
You may think I’m not firm.

472
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,440
But I always think

473
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,080
he’s your father

474
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,080
and he’s sick.

475
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Whatever mistake he made,

476
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
it’s time to let it go.

477
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,000
I can’t do that.

478
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,640
If even I let it go,

479
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,680
Li Zhe will

480
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,080
feel sadder.

481
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
And I promised Li Zhe

482
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,640
I would fulfil his father’s wish.

483
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I don’t want you

484
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,800
to worry too much about this.

485
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,840
Whatever he says to me,

486
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,040
you have the right to know.

487
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,520
That’s all for me.

488
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,800
In fact,

489
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,280
I know

490
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,800
what else he wanted to say.

491
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
Do you remember

492
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,480
I asked you

493
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,920
what if

494
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
He Yuwen wanted to come back.

495
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,440
You promised to think carefully about it.

496
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,200
A competition as we had in the college.

497
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,520
Five times each.

498
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,960
Whoever shoots more wins.

499
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,960
As for the counter...

500
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,200
If you win,

501
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
I’ll totally disappear from your world

502
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
and no longer bother you.

503
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,600
If you lose,

504
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
have me back to Square & Circle.

505
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
What?

506
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,520
Afraid to lose?

507
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,160
You lost to me deliberately, huh?

508
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,160
The score is tied.

509
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Who wins?

510
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,920
I win, then.

511
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,680
Don’t you remember?

512
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,800
I never regret on what I’ve done.

513
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
But I also won’t

514
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
escape from the price I should pay.

515
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,480
I can give up my share of Square & Circle,

516
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,000
as long as you have me back.

517
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,560
What?

518
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,520
You don’t want to

519
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,200
degrade me or cut my salary, do you?

520
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,880
We’ve been friends

521
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,200
over so many years.

522
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
Don’t push it.

523
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
I don’t think so.

524
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,680
Because you’re not only my good friend,

525
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,960
but also my best partner.

526
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,120
Square & Circle needs you.

527
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,400
From today on,

528
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
He Yuwen is officially coming back.

529
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,120
Yuwen.

530
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
What would you like to say?

531
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,720
I have nothing to say about what happened.

532
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
I know you must be confused.

533
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,640
What I want to say is...

534
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
From now on,

535
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
I’ll focus on the company benefits

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
like I used to.

537
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,160
Hope you can also

538
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,840
work hard with me.

539
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,960
Mr. Fang.

540
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Since Ms. He is back,

541
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,560
shouldn’t you treat us

542
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,640
a big dinner?

543
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,760
Not today.

544
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
I’m going out with Xu Yiren later.

545
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,920
How about another day?

546
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
Do we have an appointment out?

547
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,760
I missed it?

548
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,520
I just made it.

549
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,160
With whom?

550
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,880
What do I need to prepare?

551
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,520
Nothing.

552
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Just go with me.

553
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,160
Yuwen.

554
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,960
Take care of them.

555
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Everybody,

556
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
get all files of recent days

557
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,400
when I was away.

558
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,680
In half an hour,

559
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,440
come in for a meeting.

560
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Okay, Ms. He.

561
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
I detected

562
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
your father’s disease.

563
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,040
At first,

564
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,000
he had planned to take treatment abroad.

565
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,520
But we didn’t suggest that.

566
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,200
Why?

567
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,840
Because Alzheimer’s disease

568
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,640
is caused by

569
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,440
brain cells injury.

570
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
Such injury

571
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,720
is irreversible.

572
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Throughout the world,

573
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,520
no country has special drug

574
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,680
for this disease.

575
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,840
So,

576
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,200
going abroad

577
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,480
won’t help much.

578
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
Is there any method

579
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,120
to slow it down?

580
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,960
Sure.

581
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
Besides regular medical treatment,

582
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,120
the patient

583
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,360
should practices more.

584
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,640
Not only

585
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,360
physical practice,

586
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,720
but also cognitive practice.

587
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,960
For example, ask him

588
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,840
to do some sports

589
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,200
physically and mentally.

590
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,800
What can we do then?

591
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,120
That’s the point.

592
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,680
Here is the thing.

593
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,680
As his son,

594
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,960
your care and concern for him

595
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,480
matters a lot.

596
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,440
I have

597
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,160
contacted many patients.

598
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,200
They’re treated in time.

599
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,920
And their families take good care of them.

600
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,760
Even if they fall sick in years,

601
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
they’ll be better

602
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,320
in recognition

603
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,160
and behaviors.

604
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Sure.

605
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,760
Frankly speaking,

606
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,960
patients with such a disease

607
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,040
will be like kids.

608
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,760
So,

609
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,800
you must be patient enough to them.

610
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Will he really

611
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,560
not remember anything,

612
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,760
including his families?

613
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,800
Well,

614
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,520
it varies from people to people.

615
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,680
But,

616
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,600
most patients

617
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,800
don’t remember.

618
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,540
= Introduction to Alzheimer’s Disease =

619
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,640
Have some water.

620
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,120
Professor Qu said

621
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,280
he needed his families the most.

622
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,400
If he sees me,

623
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,320
he’ll be worse.

624
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
You’re worried about him.

625
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
Why are you so stubborn?

626
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,480
I don’t know, either.

627
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,720
Other people

628
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
should be trying their best

629
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,400
to make him happy.

630
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,960
But I can’t do that.

631
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,080
Because I can’t pretend

632
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,280
he hadn’t hurt Li Zhe and his family.

633
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,880
If you want me to say something I don’t mean,

634
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,320
I can’t do that.

635
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
Instead of making him unhappy,

636
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,600
I’d rather not meet him.

637
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,440
It’ll be fine.

638
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,800
Everything will be fine.

639
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,720
Uh, Ms. He.

640
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,520
We’re so sorry.

641
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
When you were away,

642
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,920
we didn’t have a leader.

643
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,720
There were a lot of things

644
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
we failed to handle.

645
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,720
I see.

646
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,640
Thank you

647
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,560
for the past days.

648
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,040
I caused the chaos.

649
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,160
I’ll make up for it.

650
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,000
But this problem

651
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,560
shows that

652
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,920
our department is short of men.

653
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,320
How about this?

654
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,600
Luo Yang.

655
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,480
Go tell Zheng Zhong

656
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,120
we need a junior assistant

657
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,000
to handle some basic work.

658
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,800
Okay.

659
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
I’ll send a formal email to him,

660
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,160
after reporting to Mr. Fang.

661
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,000
Great.

662
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
Finally, we’ll hire new guys.

663
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Ms. He, you should have come back earlier.

664
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,840
It’s okay. It’s not late.

665
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,760
Reserve a restaurant for dinner.

666
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,440
It’s on me.

667
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,480
- Okay. - Thanks, Ms. He.

668
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,440
Thank you, Ms. He.

669
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,880
Dad.

670
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
I’ve done nothing wrong.

671
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
I won’t apologize.

672
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Do you want me to lose all reputation?

673
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,800
Fang Zhiyou!

674
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,880
Li Zhe.

675
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,080
I trusted you.

676
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,520
Why did you betray me?

677
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,200
I didn’t.

678
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
I’ll never forgive you.

679
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
I didn’t betray you.

680
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,480
Li Zhe.

681
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,080
It’s not what you think, Li Zhe.

682
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,640
Li Zhe.

683
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,280
Had a nightmare again?

684
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Since I was in a relationship with you,

685
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,640
I haven’t had a nightmare for a long time.

686
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
You’re having too much pressure.

687
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,520
You are

688
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,920
just like me in the past.

689
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,400
I lied,

690
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,720
because I didn’t want people to hate me.

691
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,800
But who will really

692
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
like lies?

693
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
Later,

694
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,560
people thought I was reasonable and easy-going.

695
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
But I didn’t feel happy.

696
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,920
You...

697
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,960
are just like the old me.

698
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,320
You can’t

699
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,920
totally ignore your dad.

700
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
And you can’t face Li Zhe.

701
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
So, you put all the pressure

702
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,200
on yourself.

703
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,920
Fang Zhiyou.

704
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,760
I really feel sad

705
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,920
to see that.

706
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
I remember when I was little,

707
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,360
Li Zhe’s dad often bought toys for us.

708
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
He always bought two toys.

709
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,720
One for me.

710
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,720
He said

711
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,960
a man must be honest.

712
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,960
But a man like him

713
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,040
became a liar,

714
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,120
who was hated by everyone.

715
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
And he was in jail,

716
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,040
for five years.

717
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
Li Zhe said,

718
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,040
even if his father failed to say anything,

719
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,480
he still expected

720
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
to be vindicated someday.

721
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,280
But...

722
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,320
your father is sick.

723
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,720
We can’t push him too hard.

724
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,920
If my father really

725
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,760
forgets what he did,

726
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,520
isn’t that satirical?

727
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,760
A man who hurt people

728
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,840
can forget everything.

729
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
But the man who was hurt

730
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
always remembers it.

731
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,440
I’ve made up my mind.

732
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,240
I’ll talk with my dad again.

733
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,440
However hard it is,

734
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,400
I will make him

735
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
vindicate Li Zhe’s father.

736
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,720
In this way, even if Li Zhe doesn’t forgive me,

737
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,760
I’ll be relieved.

738
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,040
Whatever you do,

739
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,880
I’ll always support you.

740
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,120
Now,

741
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,320
let Danfu

742
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,680
sleep with you.

743
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,880
I’m giving it to you.

744
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
From now on,

745
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,360
you’ll be my Danfu.

746
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Fang Zhiyou?

747
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
Fang Zhiyou?

748
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,840
Fang Zhiyou.

749
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,880
Fang Zhiyou?

750
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,520
Fang Zhiyou?

751
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,280
Where has he gone?

752
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,940
= To Li Zhe =

753
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,360
The news said

754
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
there was extreme cold weather in New York.

755
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,720
I remember you’re afraid of coldness.

756
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,680
I wonder if you’re still afraid.

757
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,040
What’s this?

758
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,840
My letter to Li Zhe.

759
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,400
Sorry.

760
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,640
I didn’t mean to read it.

761
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,920
It’s okay.

762
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,680
To you,

763
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,760
I’ve got no secret.

764
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,080
Since Li Zhe went abroad,

765
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,000
I’ve been writing a letter to him every month.

766
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
I knew he would never receive any.

767
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,280
But I often took them out and read them.

768
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,920
Funny, isn’t it?

769
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,880
If someone did this to me,

770
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,040
I would be moved.

771
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,160
But...

772
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,320
Why does it sound like

773
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
a romantic story

774
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,480
between my boyfriend and his ex?

775
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Look at you.

776
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,280
You think I’m jealous.

777
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,480
You’re jealous, too.

778
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,480
Hungry, aren’t you?

779
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I bought you breakfast.

780
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,760
Let’s go.

781
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,000
Come, dad.

782
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
Have an apple.

783
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,480
Apple.

784
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,360
Apple.

785
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,800
Zhe, have an apple.

786
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,640
You love apples.

787
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
Dad, you recognize me?

788
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,400
Zhe, you’re back.

789
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,880
Have an apple.

790
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,560
Have an apple.

791
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,680
Since when have we been so quiet?

792
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,040
Fang Zhiyou told me

793
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,600
your father was in hospital.

794
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,960
I come to see him.

795
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,160
The doctor said he could check out in a few days.

796
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,960
Thank you.

797
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,440
That’s good.

798
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
Today,

799
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,400
I come to show you something.

800
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,020
= To Li Zhe =

801
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,200
Why do you bring them to me?

802
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,440
What do you mean?

803
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,240
He asked you to do this?

804
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,560
No.

805
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,240
I don’t want to see you

806
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,960
continue like this.

807
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,880
You know.

808
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
Fang Zhiyou wasn’t to be blamed

809
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,280
for what happened that year.

810
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,200
He was hurt, too.

811
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
His father hurt him.

812
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
I know.

813
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
You’ve lived a hard life

814
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
in the past thirteen years.

815
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,560
So has he.

816
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,080
Are you really coming to see my father?

817
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,720
Fang Zhiyou sent you, didn’t he?

818
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,440
To show me the letters?

819
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,120
Escaping can help with nothing.

820
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,160
What am I escaping from?

821
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,080
You still treat Fang Zhiyou

822
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
as your best friend.

823
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,920
I don’t.

824
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,440
Stop lying to yourself.

825
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,880
I just hope

826
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,720
you can read the letters carefully

827
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
and see what a life

828
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,440
Fang Zhiyou has been living.

829
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,280
Even if his father hurt your father,

830
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
you and he

831
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,080
Shouldn’t be living like this.

832
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,560
You know what?

833
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,720
His father is suffering from

834
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,040
Alzheimer’s disease.

835
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,480
Fang Zhiyou is very sad.

836
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
He’s worried.

837
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,240
Even though,

838
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,640
he still wants to

839
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,960
vindicate your father

840
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,720
before his father

841
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,080
forgets everything.

842
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,600
I know.

843
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,440
You’ve had a hard time.

844
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,200
But if you want it,

845
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,080
you won’t be alone

846
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,120
