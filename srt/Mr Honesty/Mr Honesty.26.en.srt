= Episode 26 =

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,760
Yiren,

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,880
you know what?

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,560
We’ve been here for a long time,

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
but

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,880
I never treated you to a decent meal.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Your aunt’s cooking skills are poor.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
I know you dislike the food she cooks.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,960
So today,

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,480
I found this restaurant.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,040
Actually,

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
I don’t know if you like the food here.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
Have a try.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
Just tell me

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
what you have to say.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
You see?

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
Your aunt and Qing

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,760
were wrong before.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,280
You swore at them,

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
but they deserved that.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
I also scolded them many times after that.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,720
I know

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
you were treated unfairly

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,480
over these years.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,880
That’s all in the past.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
I already said

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
what I had to say that day.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Let’s not mention it.

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Let’s not mention it.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,280
Actually,

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
we want to

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,760
ask you to do us a favor.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
You know that

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
Qing was fired by Li Zhe.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
She hasn’t found

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
a suitable job yet.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
So...

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,600
I can’t

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
help you with this.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,640
It doesn’t have to be a very decent job.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
You can let her do anything

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,760
as long as she can work at your company.

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Right, Qing?

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Here’s the thing.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Qing

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
saw on the website

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
that your company is recruiting,

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
so I’m thinking

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,480
if you can...

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,440
Impossible.

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Yiren,

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
I...

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I really think

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
I was...

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
I was too impulsive that day.

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,400
I was wrong.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
I admit my mistake.

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
I really was wrong.

78
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
I’m too selfish.

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
I treated you very badly.

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
I’m an animal.

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
You see, I really...

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,400
I really...

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
I really don’t know what I can do

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
to calm your anger.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
Can you calm your anger?

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,200
You can let me do anything.

87
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,160
How about

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
you hit me?

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Right.

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
Hit me.

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,120
You’ll feel better if you hit me.

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Don’t be like this, alright?

93
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
Sit down already.

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,040
I just...

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,320
I just want to...

96
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,920
Sit down.

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,240
I want to say sorry to her.

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Yiren,

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,560
I’ve been thinking about this recently.

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,640
We grew up together,

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
but how come we ended up like this?

102
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,960
Now I’ve thought it through.

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
It was all my fault.

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,720
I was always jealous of you.

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,720
Because you’re more beautiful than me,

106
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
you’re cleverer,

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,960
you were a top student,

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
and everyone liked you.

109
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
I was afraid that

110
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,280
you’ll draw

111
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
people’s attention away from me.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
So I wanted to

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
to take things from you subconsciously.

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,720
But I didn’t know that

115
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
you’ll get hurt.

116
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
I didn’t want to beg you for help.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,200
Because I feel

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
so ashamed to see you.

119
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,160
But at the same time,

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
I still want to be your cousin.

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Yiren,

122
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,760
I was stupid before.

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,040
I’m older than you,

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,760
but I never took care of you.

125
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,080
Instead, I always bullied you.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,440
Can you give me another chance

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
to make peace with you

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,320
and get along well with you?

129
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,120
It’s fine even if

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
you don’t want to help me this time.

131
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
I can be jobless,

132
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,840
but I still want to be your cousin.

133
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
Okay?

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,280
Yiren!

135
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,480
Yiren!

136
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,640
I said it’s my treat.

137
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,840
Why did you pay the bill?

138
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Take it.

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,440
Uncle,

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
this meal is expensive.

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,000
Aunt and Qing are unemployed,

142
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
you should save money.

143
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,600
I might be short of money,

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,040
but I still have the money to treat you to a meal.

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
Just take it.

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
Don’t let me

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,520
feel guilty.

148
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
In fact...

149
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,360
I...

150
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
I didn’t want to bother you.

151
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
It’s just

152
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,800
Qing has been crying for a few days.

153
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Your aunt also cried along.

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
I’m really...

155
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
You know your aunt

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,240
is very small-minded.

157
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,920
I seldom had the chance

158
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
to say what I want to say.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
You know?

160
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I know.

161
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,680
Uncle,

162
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
you are my only family in this world.

163
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
I will

164
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
think about it.

165
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Okay.

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
Take your time.

167
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,600
Let me thank you in advance

168
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
on behalf of Qing.

169
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
Take care of yourself.

170
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,560
So,

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
you got softhearted again?

172
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Am I useless?

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,800
It’s very hard for you

174
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
to make a clean break with them.

175
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,000
After all, they raised you.

176
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Although your uncle

177
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,640
is a hen-pecked husband,

178
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
I call tell that

179
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
he’s a kind person.

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,240
He does see you as a family member.

181
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,640
When I was a kid,

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
every time when aunt bought fruit,

183
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,400
she’d give the biggest ones

184
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
to my cousin.

185
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,720
Once, when I opened my bag

186
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
after I arrived at the school,

187
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
I found there was a big red apple.

188
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,480
My uncle put it there secretly.

189
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
You know what?

190
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
My uncle never begged me

191
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,640
like this before.

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,640
I was hoping

193
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,880
you’ll no longer get hurt by them,

194
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,280
I never wanted you to

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
make a clean break with them.

196
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,880
Moreover, blood ties

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,440
can’t be broken.

198
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,960
Just like you and your father.

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,760
Fang Zhiyou,

200
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
tell me,

201
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
how high is the probability of success

202
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
if I, as your girlfriend,

203
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
ask you to do me this favor?

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,480
That will depend on

205
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
how you bribe me.

206
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,040
Then close your eyes.

207
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
What’s this?

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Is Danfu’s first kiss enough?

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,600
Of course not.

210
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
You’ve made up your mind?

211
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Hmm.

212
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,280
I want to help them once again

213
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
for the sake of my uncle.

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,080
More importantly,

215
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,720
now I’m confident enough to face them.

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,720
Like what I said,

217
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,240
now no one or nothing

218
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
can hurt me anymore.

219
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
Okay.

220
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,160
I’ll talk with He Yuwen tomorrow.

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
After all, she’s in charge of the recruitment.

222
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
She needs to agree first.

223
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,040
I understand.

224
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,720
It’s really great to have a boyfriend who’s a boss.

225
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,680
That’s for sure.

226
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
We’re recruiting a junior assistant.

227
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,040
Just a gofer.

228
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,360
You don’t have to review their resumes personally.

229
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,400
Of course I’ll do this personally.

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
It’s not because I don’t trust you,

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,260
but because I trust myself more.

232
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,020
= Yu Qing’s resume =

233
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,640
This one?

234
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,480
I’ve asked.

235
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,920
She’s Xu Yiren’s cousin.

236
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
It’s not good if they work

237
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
in the same department.

238
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,640
It’s not good.

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Let’s skip this one.

240
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
It’s all right.

241
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,480
Leave it here.

242
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
Ms. He,

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
you go ahead.

244
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
I’ll go out now.

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,440
No need.

246
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
It’s related to you.

247
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Check this.

248
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,920
I wanted to talk with you about this.

249
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,600
She’s Yiren’s cousin.

250
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,240
If possible,

251
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,640
I hope you can prioritize her.

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,840
Sorry, Ms. He.

253
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,680
I know this is inappropriate.

254
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,680
But

255
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,840
Yu Qing has some work experience.

256
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
That said, I’ll respect your decision.

257
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,760
Right.

258
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
You’re in charge of recruitment.

259
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
I won’t interfere with it.

260
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
It’s all right.

261
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,000
It’s just a junior assistant anyway.

262
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,320
Maybe I thought too much.

263
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
I’ll go explain to her.

264
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Ms. He!

265
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Ms. He!

266
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,880
Please listen to me.

267
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,600
I asked

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
Fang Zhiyou to do me this favor.

269
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
If you think I broke our company’s rules,

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
I’ll apologize to you.

271
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,600
Please forget I said that.

272
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,880
So are you showing off before me?

273
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
Because you can now sway Fang Zhiyou

274
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
through pillow talk?

275
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,600
That’s not what I meant.

276
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,560
Why so nervous?

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,960
I can’t even

278
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
joke with you now?

279
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,080
Yu Qing is that girl

280
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,160
who always took things from you?

281
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,920
Hmm.

282
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes.

283
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,920
Then why did you want her to work here?

284
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,320
She does have

285
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,800
a lot of bad habits,

286
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,560
but she has a sharp mind.

287
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
I’m sure she can do the job

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
of a junior assistant well.

289
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,160
You know I’m not talking about that.

290
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you worried for me?

291
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,400
Don’t be so complacent.

292
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
Even I can’t take Fang Zhiyou away,

293
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
you think she can?

294
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,840
But remember this.

295
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Some people will correct their mistakes,

296
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,400
but some never will.

297
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
You’d better be careful.

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,160
I know.

299
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,360
Thank you.

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,160
I can let her work here.

301
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,040
But if she can’t do her job well,

302
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I won’t keep her.

303
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,000
She’s at your disposal.

304
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,160
Thanks, Ms. He.

305
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
Everyone, stop for a minute.

306
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,720
Let me introduce you.

307
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,000
This is the junior assistant we just recruited.

308
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Let her take care of them

309
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,760
if you have any small tasks.

310
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,240
Hello, everyone.

311
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
My name is Yu Qing.

312
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
I’d appreciate your help in the future.

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
Great.

314
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
I have some files here.

315
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Print them for me.

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,600
I need five copies.

317
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,120
Thank you.

318
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Good timing.

319
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,600
I also have some files

320
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
to be sent to the meeting room.

321
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,520
Send them there.

322
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,120
Thank you.

323
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,160
These are

324
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,280
this month’s attendance sheets and expense reports.

325
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
Send them to the Financial Department.

326
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,640
Thank you.

327
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Yiren,

328
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,000
you’re here.

329
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
This is my first day at work.

330
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,000
Let’s have lunch together.

331
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
I still have work to do.

332
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,000
You can eat yourself.

333
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
You’re welcome.

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,280
What do you mean?

335
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
I specifically made it for you.

336
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
My signature black coffee.

337
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,640
Try it.

338
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,120
It smells good.

339
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,120
Luo Yang needs to learn from you.

340
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,760
No need.

341
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
You can call me

342
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,160
whenever you want to drink it.

343
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,480
But you’re Fang Zhiyou’s assistant,

344
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,400
not mine.

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Luo Yang will make coffee for Ms. He,

346
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
but I’ll make coffee

347
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,720
for Yuwen.

348
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,360
Seriously?

349
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
Is it because

350
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,920
I let your cousin

351
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
work in our company?

352
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,720
No.

353
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
It’s because

354
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
you recruited me

355
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
and you always treated me

356
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,640
as your little sister.

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
And now you’re back.

358
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,760
Sorry.

359
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,040
I thought

360
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
you were unhappy

361
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
because I asked Fang Zhiyou

362
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,720
to let Yu Qing work here,

363
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
I didn’t know

364
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
you were actually worried

365
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
I may get bullied by her.

366
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,320
But that doesn’t mean

367
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,760
I’ll give up on Fang Zhiyou.

368
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,400
I know.

369
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,960
You only drink black coffee,

370
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
but

371
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
it also tastes good

372
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,320
and will make you happy

373
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
if you add some sugar occasionally.

374
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,440
I’ll leave then.

375
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,560
Come on in.

376
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
Professor Qu,

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,760
someone wants to see you.

378
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,200
Hello, Professor Qu.

379
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
You are?

380
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,160
I’m Li Zhe.

381
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
We met many years ago

382
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,720
at Fang Zhiyou’s home.

383
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,480
You treated my mother before.

384
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Now I remember.

385
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
I came today

386
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
to ask you about something.

387
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,400
You can sit down.

388
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,000
There’s no need.

389
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I just want to ask

390
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,480
if Fang Zhiyou’s father, Fang Zhanyang

391
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,560
has got Alzheimer’s.

392
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,840
Is it serious?

393
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you saying?

394
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,120
You’re the attending doctor of their family.

395
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,960
You should know

396
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,600
his physical condition very well.

397
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,720
Fang Zhanyang is my patient.

398
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,120
But the question you asked

399
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
is about my patient’s personal information.

400
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
I can’t answer it.

401
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,880
Please leave.

402
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Now the Moon Bay Resort Project

403
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,960
has officially kicked off.

404
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,800
The Design Department can finally take a break.

405
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,600
Thank you.

406
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,320
We really worked very hard.

407
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,040
Mr. Fang,

408
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,720
how about

409
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
we go out and have some fun?

410
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
I know a place

411
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
where we can eat, play ball games

412
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,720
and Werewolf.

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
I can book it right now.

414
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
I’m good at playing Werewolf.

415
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
With your acting skill,

416
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
you dare to play Werewolf?

417
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,040
You’re really smart.

418
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,120
I have some photos of that place.

419
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
See if you like it.

420
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,720
Take a look.

421
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,360
Why did you get this nasty piece of work here?

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Aren’t you afraid that things may backfire?

423
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
It’s won’t be that serious.

424
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,520
Li Zhe already taught her a lesson.

425
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,200
I think she’ll do her job well.

426
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,560
Come on.

427
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Are you unmindful

428
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,080
or are you mentally stunned?

429
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,920
I’m sure Xia Di will

430
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
lecture you about it.

431
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,120
If you dare talk about this in front of her,

432
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,880
I’ll tell her your secret.

433
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
I’m wrong. I’m wrong.

434
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,360
You won.

435
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,440
Xu Yiren,

436
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,360
which place do you want to go?

437
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,600
I think the place Xu Qing just mentioned

438
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,320
is good.

439
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,800
Okay. That place then.

440
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Dismiss.

441
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
Fang Zhiyou’s becoming better

442
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,680
at wining a girl’s heart.

443
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
Why didn’t I realize this before?

444
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,640
No.

445
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,120
I have to learn from him.

446
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
You know what?

447
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,560
He was

448
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,240
obviously telling everyone that

449
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,720
he only cares about what you think.

450
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,880
You’re on par with him.

451
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,560
You’re very good at pleasing Xia Di.

452
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,560
Why do people have to

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
keep secrets from each other?

454
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,440
How long do you intend

455
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,440
to keep your secret from Xia Di?

456
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,640
Xia Di’s mother already knew.

457
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,160
Xia Di will know sooner or later.

458
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
I definitely will tell her,

459
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,560
but I’m worried about it.

460
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,960
Do you think

461
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
she will dump me

462
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
out of anger?

463
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,560
I’m getting more and more worried,

464
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
and more and more timid.

465
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,760
Am I actually

466
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,520
a perfect example of

467
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,840
digging oneself into a hole?

468
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,040
In the past,

469
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,360
I’d have told you to

470
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,040
keep it from her for as long as you can.

471
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,520
But,

472
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
now,

473
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,200
I think

474
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,880
honesty matters the most.

475
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,840
Honesty?

476
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,320
I’ve decided.

477
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,760
I’ll confess my love to Xia Di

478
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
and propose to her.

479
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,120
I will

480
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,520
pay the bride price first,

481
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
so that she can never leave me

482
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
in the future.

483
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
This way,

484
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
she’ll not get angry at me.

485
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,800
Isn’t this

486
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,920
a bit...

487
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,800
I wish you success.

488
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,160
You freaked me out.

489
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
What were you talking about with Gu Bo?

490
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
It’s been quite a while.

491
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
Don’t tell me you’re jealous.

492
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
I don’t feel very happy

493
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,520
when there are

494
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,160
other male creatures around you.

495
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
Why are you smiling?

496
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,880
Why are you smiling?

497
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
Why did you

498
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
never get jealous?

499
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,440
I did.

500
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,840
It’s just

501
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,160
I hid my feelings.

502
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
Why would you hide your feelings?

503
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,040
Then how am I supposed to know

504
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
you got jealous?

505
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,640
You have so many questions.

506
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Anyway,

507
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,600
from now on,

508
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960
you must let me know

509
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,680
if I ever make you unhappy,

510
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,360
alright?

511
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,800
Hmm.

512
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
Is this the only thing

513
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,800
you want to tell me?

514
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,240
I’m not

515
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,440
going home to eat tonight.

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
I’ll go to my father’s place.

517
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,440
Are you...

518
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,480
ready to face your father?

519
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
Do you need me to go with you?

520
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,120
No need.

521
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,200
Alright then.

522
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,400
You two

523
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
really should talk with each other.

524
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,760
But,

525
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
no matter what,

526
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
don’t push yourself too much,

527
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,160
okay?

528
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,840
Okay.

529
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,880
I promise you.

530
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,480
Good luck.

531
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,640
Xu Yiren,

532
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
let’s meet.

533
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,800
Fang Zhanyang is my patient.

534
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,720
But the question you asked

535
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
is about my patient’s personal information.

536
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
I can’t answer it.

537
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,760
You saw Professor Qu before, right?

538
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,880
You should know this is his voice.

539
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,200
What are you trying to say?

540
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,480
As a doctor, Professor Qu

541
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,040
wants to protect his patient’s privacy,

542
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,400
what’s wrong with that?

543
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,080
Professor Qu’s following his professional code.

544
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,080
But his assistant is not.

545
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
A while ago,

546
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,160
Fang Zhanyang

547
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,800
indeed came to Professor Qu

548
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,440
because of some health problems.

549
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,400
But,

550
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,920
it was hypertension

551
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
due to stress from work.

552
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
Alzheimer’s?

553
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
I’ve never heard about that.

554
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,320
Are you sure?

555
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,400
Maybe it’s because Professor Qu

556
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
hasn’t told you yet.

557
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,000
It’s possible.

558
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,320
But I’m responsible for

559
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,640
filing Fang Zhanyang’s medical records.

560
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,040
I never saw Professor Qu

561
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,680
prescribe medicine

562
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,600
for Alzheimer’s for him.

563
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,000
Probably you think

564
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,120
this recording is fake.

565
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,400
It doesn’t matter.

566
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,280
You don’t have to believe it.

567
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,720
I just want to remind you that

568
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,600
Fang Zhanyang

569
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,080
is a hypocrite full of lies.

570
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
He’ll do whatever it takes

571
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
to achieve his goal.

572
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,680
How is that possible?

573
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
Attorney Fang,

574
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,960
you forgot your bag.

575
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,720
I really have a bad memory.

576
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,380
How could I forget my bag?

577
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,060
= Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets =

578
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,920
I’m getting old.

579
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,640
Now,

580
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
do you still want me

581
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,040
to believe Fang Zhanyang?

582
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,560
What do you say?

583
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,240
Why are you saying this to me?

584
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
I just want to let you know

585
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,720
what kind of persons they are.

586
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
You’ve been persuading me to forgive them.

587
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
But in fact,

588
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,680
Fang Zhanyang never regretted what he did,

589
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,040
even for a moment.

590
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,200
He doesn’t even think he was wrong.

591
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,560
How can I forgive

592
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,280
such a person?

593
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,840
But you can’t prove

594
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,120
Mr. Fang is lying

595
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,480
with this conversation

596
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,080
with Professor Qu’s assistant.

597
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,680
People

598
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
tend to believe what they want to believe.

599
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,160
It doesn’t matter.

600
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
This is already enough

601
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,960
for me.

602
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
If you don’t believe me,

603
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,800
you can think of a way to prove it.

604
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,600
I?

605
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,000
You will.

606
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
I’m sure you’ll do it

607
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,840
for Fang Zhiyou.

608
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Dad,

609
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,680
are you sick?

610
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,880
Why are you taking medicine?

611
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,080
I haven’t slept well recently.

612
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
These are sleeping pills.

613
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Sleeping pills?

614
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,480
Dad,

615
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,280
my brother is here.

616
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,560
You’re back.

617
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
Why did you ring the doorbell

618
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,480
since this is your home?

619
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Don’t you have the key?

620
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
I’m not here to quarrel with you.

621
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
Shiyu,

622
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,520
did you finish your homework?

623
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Just say you want to talk with dad in private.

624
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Don’t use my homework as an excuse.

625
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,680
Dad,

626
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
didn’t you just take some?

627
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,040
Why do you want to take more?

628
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,560
These are sleeping pills.

629
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,000
I want to see how many are left.

630
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,800
I went to Professor Qu.

631
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,720
He said your disease

632
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
is irreversible.

633
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,600
It’ll only get more serious.

634
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
Zhiyou,

635
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
why do you always say things

636
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,680
people don’t like to hear?

637
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,960
How many clients have you offended?

638
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,920
How do you know that?

639
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,760
For all these years,

640
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
there was nothing I don’t know

641
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,640
about you and Square & Circle.

642
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,920
You can hate me.

643
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
But I won’t abandon you.

644
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,640
Dad,

645
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,440
can we sit down

646
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,520
and talk something over?

647
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
What do you want to talk about?

648
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
You know what it’s about.

649
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,560
You know what you did

650
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,800
back then.

651
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
Whether you admit it or not,

652
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,520
it’s a fact that you deceived us.

653
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,240
I know you won’t admit it,

654
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,640
because you’re the renowned Fang Zhanyang.

655
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,160
In your eyes,

656
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,760
facts and truths

657
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,800
are insignificant.

658
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,280
You only care about

659
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,160
if you can win.

660
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Zhiyou,

661
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,320
you were young at that time.

662
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
You knew nothing about what happened.

663
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,080
But now you’re a grown-up.

664
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,920
How can you still not understand it?

665
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,280
You said you’d deceive anyone,

666
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,240
including your son to achieve you goal,

667
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,200
if that’s what you believe,

668
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,760
then I’ll never understand it.

669
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,880
That’s how the world works.

670
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,200
Zhiyou,

671
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,400
do you really think

672
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Li Zhe’s father never deceived others?

673
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
He was just unlucky,

674
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,880
so he became a scapegoat.

675
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,040
How can you say such things

676
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,320
after you ruined their family?

677
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,760
If you hadn’t deceived us,

678
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,920
Mr. Li would have never given the evidence to you,

679
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,200
so you’d have never won that lawsuit.

680
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,160
Zhiyou,

681
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,520
if it hadn’t been me,

682
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,280
Li Jinghong would’ve lost his shirt.

683
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
You really knew nothing about it.

684
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
Then tell me,

685
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
why did you lie to me?

686
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,040
You promised me

687
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,480
you’ll defend Mr. Li,

688
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,440
but you became the plaintiff’s defense lawyer.

689
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,680
Did you consider my feelings?

690
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Do you know

691
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,760
how much you hurt me

692
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,240
by doing that?

693
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
I did consider that.

694
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,800
I thought you might become unhappy.

695
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
But I didn’t expect you’d run away.

696
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
I couldn’t force myself to face a father

697
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,840
that’s full of lies.

698
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,040
Because I can never know

699
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,840
if you’re telling the truth or if you’re lying.

700
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
A man who can

701
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,400
tell lies flawlessly

702
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,360
is really horrible.

703
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,560
Right,

704
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,160
Son.

705
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
I know I was wrong.

706
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,360
I’ll apologize to you now.

707
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,520
Zhiyou,

708
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,480
can you forgive me?

709
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,760
I’m not the one you should apologize to.

710
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,200
I told you.

711
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,360
There’s no way I’d apologize to

712
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Li Jinghong.

713
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,640
I knew

714
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,520
this would be your answer.

715
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,240
But this time,

716
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
I’m not giving up,

717
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
until you apologize to him.

718
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,760
Dad,

719
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,160
if you really care about me,

720
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,080
please think about it carefully.

721
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
I’ll wait for your reply.

722
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,000
Zhiyou,

723
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
since you’re here,

724
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,520
you can spend the night here.

725
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,200
I’ll come another time.

726
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
It’s thundering outside.

727
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,480
I’m sure it’ll rain tonight.

728
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,760
It’s not safe to drive.

729
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,960
Just one night.

730
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Please.

731
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,200
Zhiyou,

732
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,560
can I sleep with you?

733
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,560
No.

734
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,840
When I was younger,

735
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,240
I always came to your room

736
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,040
when it rained.

737
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
You’d then carry me to my room

738
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,640
after I fell asleep.

739
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,440
After you left home,

740
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,280
dad never let me

741
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
enter your room.

742
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
How come your bed

743
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,200
is more comfortable than mine?

744
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,520
I wonder

745
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
if dad can sleep better tonight.

746
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,320
Although he didn’t say it,

747
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,760
I know

748
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,040
he felt really happy

749
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,600
to see you come back.

750
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,920
Even if you came to quarrel with him.

751
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,680
Our home

752
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,280
is too quiet.

753
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,200
You’re here,

754
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,720
how can it be quiet?

755
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,960
Shiyu?

756
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,760
Shiyu?

757
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,040
Go back to your room to sleep.

758
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,960
You’ve grown up.

759
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,760
Go back to your room.

760
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,720
You’re back?

761
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
Didn’t I tell you

762
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,320
I won’t come back?

763
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,040
Why did you still wait for me?

764
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
I didn’t.

765
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,440
I fell asleep before I knew it.

766
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,760
Didn’t you sleep last night?

767
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,480
No.

768
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,800
Your conversation

769
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,640
didn’t go well?

770
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Yeah.

771
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,360
Within my expectation.

772
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,160
Let’s have breakfast.

773
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,040
I bought some porridge.

774
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,640
Hmm.

775
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,560
Did you catch a cold?

776
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,080
I’ll go find some cold pills.

777
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,120
It’s fine.

778
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,800
I’ve been too tired recently.

779
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,240
Then,

780
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,760
you can get some rest.

781
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
You don’t have anything to do this morning.

782
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
No need.

783
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,080
I just need this.

784
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,120
My hands are dirty.

785
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,320
Are you really fine?

786
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,840
No.

787
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
Last night,

788
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,200
I kept thinking about my childhood.

789
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,640
The meals my mom cooked,

790
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,120
my father’s back when he was busy with work,

791
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,320
and Shiyu.

792
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
She went to my room every time it rained.

793
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,320
I thought I’d never go back to that place again.

794
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,040
Turns out it’s not like that.

795
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
It’s never too late to go back there.

796
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,520
How’s your dad’s health?

797
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,880
If Shiyu hadn’t stopped him,

798
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,440
he would’ve taken the medicine twice.

799
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
Shiyu also knows?

800
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
She thought those are sleeping pills.

801
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,680
I think you can go to Professor Qu again

802
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,440
when you have time.

803
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
Coming up with a treatment plan

804
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,280
is also very important.

805
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,200
I will.

806
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,480
I want to see your dad.

807
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,800
You don’t need to push yourself.

808
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,600
I’m not.

809
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,760
I think he likes me.

810
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,920
So,

811
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,080
I want to see him more often,

812
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,360
so that I can leave a good impression on him.

813
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,240
Thank you.

814
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I’d love to do that.

815
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,200
Now you should have a rest.

816
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,160
If you continue like this,

817
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,400
others may think I’m mistreating you.

818
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,040
But I...

819
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,200
Say no more.

820
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,760
Be good.

821
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,880
Go ahead.

822
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,320
Thank you.

823
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,280
Your story is for girls.

824
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,840
It’s not suitable for these nerdy guys.

825
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,280
You’re right.

826
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,300
= Mr. Honesty =

827
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
See? I guessed right.

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,040
I’m sure she’ll buy it.

829
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,400
She’s too young.

830
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,840
She can’t understand the meaning of the story.

831
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Be patient.

832
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,400
Meaning?

833
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,640
How come I don’t know?

834
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,400
What meaning does it have?

835
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,200
This one.

836
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,080
Trust me on it.

837
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,000
Gu Bo,

838
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,320
seems she’s reading it carefully.

839
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,920
Right.

840
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
She has a discerning eye.

841
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,320
Wait for me.

842
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,880
What are you doing?

843
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
I’ll shill it for you.

844
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,320
The style of this comic strip is very special.

845
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,600
I’ve never seen one like this.

846
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,680
The plots are also

847
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,320
different from other comic strips.

848
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,680
A man that never lies?

849
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
This is really interesting.

850
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,840
This author is a genius!

851
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,800
It’s really amazing!

852
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,600
Come on.

853
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
Don’t leave.

854
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,560
You just checked the first issue.

855
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,640
