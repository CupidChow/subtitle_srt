= Episode 24 =

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Ms. He.

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,720
Fang Zhiyou didn’t know you came, did he?

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
Or he wouldn’t agree.

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
I am not him.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,920
He’s not me.

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
I like him.

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,640
But I don’t need to tell him whatever I do.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Ms. He.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,720
I come to invite you back to Square & Circle.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
The company needs you.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,920
The company runs, no matter who leaves.

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,720
Not to mention I’m away,

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
even if Fang Zhiyou is away,

33
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,840
the company won’t shut down.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
You really are old classmates

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,480
and partners.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,600
You said the same thing.

37
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,520
Yes.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
The company always runs.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,120
But how it runs

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,480
will be different.

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,640
You and he founded Square & Circle together.

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,640
You don’t want it to go wrong, do you?

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I don’t, of course.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
If possible,

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,640
I want to stay in Square & Circle.

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Fang Zhiyou, what would you like to eat?

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Oh, he’s gone for the parents’ meeting.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,640
Hello?

49
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,480
This way, Miss Xu.

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,200
Mr. Fang.

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,920
There you are.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Be seated.

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,440
Thank you.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
I had thought

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
Fang Zhiyou would be with He Yuwen.

56
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
What a surprise!

57
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,240
Ms. He is

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,720
an excellent woman.

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,240
I’m glad you know.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
But love isn’t an exam.

61
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,640
It’s not decided by scores.

62
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Why do you think

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,280
Fang Zhiyou likes you?

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
I know I’m not good enough for him

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
in your eyes.

66
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
He’s a talented designer,

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,520
and the boss of Square of Circle.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
I am

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
a very ordinary girl

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
you can imagine.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
To be honest,

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
at first,

73
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,840
I asked myself many times.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,680
Why did he fall in love with me?

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Why?

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,680
I don’t know.

77
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
Because he makes me understand that

78
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,280
this shouldn’t be a question.

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Why does

80
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
no one ask me

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
why I like him?

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,640
It’s right when I like him.

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,640
When he likes me,

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,520
he’s going mad.

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,320
But when a couple like each other,

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,400
the relationship should be equal,

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
shouldn’t it?

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
You may think

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,440
he bears with it when I’m ordinary.

90
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
But I also bear with

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
his bad temper and character.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,680
Sometimes he is arbitrary

93
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,960
and unreasonable.

94
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
Since he has so many drawbacks,

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
why are you still with him?

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
Because I understand him.

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
He understands me, too.

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,840
Because we understand each other,

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
we’re kind.

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,080
I saw it when he woke up

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,320
in the middle of night

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,680
because of losing his best friend.

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
So, I understand

104
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
why he behaves like this.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,400
I also understand

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
why he hates lies so much.

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,800
So,

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
no matter how unreasonable people think he is

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,960
and stay away from him,

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,680
I’ll still be with him.

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,320
Also,

112
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
he saw it when I humbly tried to

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
get back my ex-boyfriend

114
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,680
who cheated on me.

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,040
When I was sad and helpless,

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
he told me

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
to be the light of my life.

118
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,080
I want to face the true me

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
for him.

120
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,160
That is why

121
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Fang Zhiyou and I like each other.

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,840
If you meet me

123
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
because you want me to leave me,

124
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
sorry,

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,040
I can’t do that.

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,720
You’ve talked too much.

127
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,640
Aren’t you thirsty?

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
Have some water.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,640
Let me

130
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,440
say something.

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,160
You...

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,520
You get me wrong.

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
I never meant to

134
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
interfere with Fang Zhiyou’s relationship.

135
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,120
Because I know

136
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
it won’t work, however hard I try.

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,720
He won’t listen to me at all.

138
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,800
I know that quite well.

139
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,640
Today, I want to see you

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
to confirm something.

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,400
And I want you to

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
do me a favor.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
First, I want to confirm

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,000
if you love Fang Zhiyou with a true heart.

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Seems like

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
my son

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,320
has a good taste.

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
You just said

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
you wanted me to do you a favor?

150
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Yeah.

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
Look, I’m getting old.

152
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,640
I don’t want to die

153
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,600
when my son still hates me.

154
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
He doesn’t feel good, either.

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,000
But...

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
I don’t know

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
if I’m capable enough to help you.

158
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
Don’t rush to reply.

159
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
I know

160
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,480
I’m kind of forcing you.

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Why don’t you think carefully about it?

162
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,120
All right.

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
I’ve finished.

164
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I’ll go back to my firm for a meeting.

165
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Tea in this shop tastes good.

166
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,320
Order whatever you want.

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
It’s on me.

168
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,320
See you.

169
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,920
See you.

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,640
I was freaked out.

171
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,960
Xia Di.

172
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
Get up. It’s late.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
The breakfast is ready.

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,680
After breakfast,

175
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
we’ve got 100 things to do.

176
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
Weird. Why don’t I know

177
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
I’ve got 100 things to do?

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
I collected them through the whole night

179
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
last night.

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,120
100 romantic things

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
a couple must do.

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,040
Let me show you.

183
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
No.

184
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,280
I’ve got only one thing to do today.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Eat and sleep.

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
Don’t.

187
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
Xia Di.

188
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,520
It’s finally the weekend.

189
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,960
I haven’t seen you for days.

190
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
100 things are too many.

191
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,640
Let’s do half.

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,880
Okay.

193
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,120
Let’s do the other half next week.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Shall we go

195
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
and do the first thing?

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
You bad boy, what are you doing?

197
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,480
Mom!

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,440
Sir.

199
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
Here is your car.

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Okay.

201
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,920
Thank you.

202
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,480
Mr. Fang.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
You left your briefcase.

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,400
Oh, my poor memory.

205
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,000
I even left my briefcase there.

206

= Donepezil Tablets =

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
I’m getting old.

208
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,800
Thank you,

209
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,680
Miss Xu.

210
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,560
You’re welcome.

211
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,320
Call me Yiren.

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,760
Okay.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Why don’t you

214
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,520
call me Uncle Fang?

215
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,080
-See you. -See you.

216
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
I’m just in time.

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
You two

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
work together to cheat me,

219
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,720
don’t you?

220
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
Mom.

221
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Madam.

222
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,200
Don’t blame Xia Di.

223
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
It’s my fault.

224
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
I always stick to her.

225
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,640
I chased her.

226
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
I hid the files of

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,160
the blind dates

228
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,240
you gave me last time.

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
If you’re angry, vent your anger on me.

230
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,920
I won’t strike back.

231
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
What? You want to strike back, huh?

232
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,520
I knew

233
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,680
you were the worst.

234
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
You had an evil plan from the beginning,

235
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,200
didn’t you?

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
You’ve been staying here for long.

237
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
When will you leave?

238
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
Fine. Since you see him,

239
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
let me introduce him to you.

240
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
He’s Gu Bo, my boyfriend.

241
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,480
Say hello.

242
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,560
Hello, madam.

243
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,720
Put your arm down.

244
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,440
Can you reach him?

245
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,600
Come down.

246
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Don’t you hear me?

247
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
Put your arm down.

248
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,720
- Your arm. -Ms. Wang.

249
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Don’t push it.

250
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,920
Or I’ll fall out with you.

251
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
Well, show me. Go ahead.

252
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
You just know how to fall out, don’t you?

253
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
Why don’t you make the table fall?

254
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
Look at you.

255
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
How many times have I told you?

256
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,560
You must find a reliable boyfriend.

257
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Is he reliable?

258
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Why do you like him?

259
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
He’s just tall.

260
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,640
But what does that help?

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,920
He doesn’t need a ladder when repairing a lamp.

262
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
He’s young and energy.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I like him.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,920
All right.

265
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,480
Fine.

266
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,920
But I don’t like him.

= Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets =

268
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,000
Senile dementia?

269
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
How is that possible?

270
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,360
What are you reading?

271
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,880
Nothing.

272
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,320
You don’t look well.

273
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
Are you texting someone?

274
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,400
No.

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,960
And you don’t show me.

276
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
I’m reading the constellation fortune.

277
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
It says,

278
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
I have bad luck this month,

279
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
and I’ll quarrel with my boyfriend.

280
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
So,

281
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,840
I’m feeling sad.

282
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
What?

283
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,520
I didn’t expect you

284
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,400
to believe constellation fortune.

285
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,560
I don’t believe it too much.

286
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,280
But when I read it,

287
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
I feel bad.

288
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
Then stop reading it.

289
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay.

290
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Let’s go.

291
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,680
You haven’t told me where we’re going.

292
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,680
Let me take you to somewhere.

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
You used to take me to

294
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,640
where you wanted to go.

295
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
This time,

296
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,720
I’m taking you to where I want to go.

297
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,760
Do you dare to go?

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,240
Do you fear I’ll sell you?

299
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,880
No.

300
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,680
You trust me so much?

301
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,800
No.

302
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
Because...

303
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,280
no one can afford me.

304
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,600
How narcissistic!

305
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,040
I didn’t know that before.

306
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,280
Let’s go.

307
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,400
You’ve got plenty of time

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
to know me.

309
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,840
What?

310
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,560
This is where you want to come?

311
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
Yeah.

312
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,520
Do you think girls only go shopping,

313
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,400
having meals and watching films?

314
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
You are not happy?

315
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
Or do you want to

316
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,720
go shopping,

317
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
having meals or watching film?

318
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,320
Why do we come here?

319
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,640
An art exhibition

320
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,320
is being held in this place.

321
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,720
You said I should have a good taste

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
as your assistant, didn’t you?

323
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
So, please.

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Stay with me when I try to improve my taste.

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
If you’re not interested,

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,760
we can...

327
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
I’m not interested in this.

328
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,600
But I’m interested in you.

329
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,160
Let’s go.

330
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,840
What a big table!

331
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,280
How many dishes must I order?

332
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,480
Don’t worry. Order whatever you want.

333
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,240
But let me put it first.

334
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Don’t think you can buy me

335
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
with a big meal.

336
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,760
Sure.

337
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,680
I can’t

338
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
get my princess Xia Di

339
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,520
with only a meal.

340
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,040
Right?

341
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
I just want to talk with you.

342
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
We’ve got nothing to talk about.

343
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
But we must enjoy the meal.

344
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,720
Or it’ll be wasted.

345
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Right?

346
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,720
Yes.

347
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,080
Yes. Read the menu.

348
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
All right, young man.

349
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,200
I don’t want to

350
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
beat about the bush.

351
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,880
Well,

352
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
I think you’re a good young man,

353
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
and you’re not annoying.

354
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
Sometimes, you look adorable.

355
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
I am, aren’t I?

356
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,120
My mother always says that, too.

357
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,280
But you and Xia Di don’t make a perfect couple.

358
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,360
Madam.

359
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
Could you tell me why?

360
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,800
Xia Di and I

361
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,680
suit each other in height, figure,

362
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,400
hobby, eating habit,

363
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,800
constellation and even blood type.

364
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,720
But you’re so young...

365
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,960
I know your point.

366
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,040
I’m a few years younger than Xia Di.

367
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
But we’re in the modern age.

368
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Is age still a problem?

369
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,120
Yes.

370
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,960
It’s not a big problem.

371
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,280
But...

372
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,600
you just graduated, huh?

373
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,920
You can’t even support yourself.

374
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,640
How can you support my daughter?

375
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,680
You don’t want her to support you, do you?

376
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
I must make myself clear.

377
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,400
As long as I’m still alive,

378
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,840
this won’t ever happen.

379
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,720
I won’t let Xia Di suffer.

380
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
Madam.

381
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,400
You mean

382
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,040
you won’t ask us to break up,

383
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,920
as long as I can support Xia Di financially?

384
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,840
People always boast.

385
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,800
But how can you support her financially?

386
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
You should have told me earlier.

387
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,880
I thought there would be a big problem.

388
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,040
You sound arrogant.

389
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,360
Thank you.

390
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,640
I’m so tired.

391
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,560
It doesn’t seem big from the outside.

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
Why does it take us so long to walk around?

393
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,960
Inside it,

394
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,600
a layered dislocation structure is adopted

395
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,600
and the inner space is fully used.

396
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,880
The exhibition space

397
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,160
is one third bigger than

398
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,280
its real space.

399
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
You’re awesome.

400
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,440
When you walk around,

401
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
you manage to see its inner structure.

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
I’ll go to the bathroom.

403
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,080
Walk to the end of the corridor

404
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,960
and turn left.

405
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,600
How do you know?

406
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,360
Why did you say you didn’t come?

407
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,700
= Gold Award Tianyi Exhibition Center
Designer He Yuliang =

408
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh, the exhibition center won

409
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,760
the Gold Award of National Design Competition.

410
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,040
I shouldn’t have viewed it more carefully.

411
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,680
Mr. He Yuliang is the designer.

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,040
Why does that sound familiar?

413
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
He Yuliang?

414
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
He’s He Yuwen’s father.

415
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,120
And he’s Fang Zhiyou’s teacher.

416
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Why do you peep at me?

417
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,640
Why don’t you just look at me frankly?

418
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
Why didn’t you tell me earlier

419
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
you didn’t want to visit the exhibition center?

420
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,560
Is it because

421
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
He Yuliang is the designer?

422
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,680
Not really.

423
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,720
Then why?

424
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,080
Yiren.

425
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,280
I can’t lie to you.

426
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,600
But there’s something

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
I want to talk about.

428
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,520
Okay?

429
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,960
Sure.

430
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,920
You’re not angry?

431
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,040
I’m not.

432
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
Even if we’re in a relationship,

433
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
we have our own space.

434
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,280
Also,

435
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
I have something I don’t want to tell you.

436
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Fair enough.

437
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
Your phone.

438
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,600
My phone?

439
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
-Gu Bo? -Gu Bo?

440
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,220
= Xu Yiren =

441
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,920
Hello, Gu Bo?

442
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
Yiren, this is me.

443
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
Xia Di’s mother.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,720
Madam.

445
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Tell me.

446
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,800
What do Gu Bo’s parents do?

447
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,160
What do his parents do?

448
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I’m not very sure.

449
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,320
Yiren.

450
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
Tell the truth.

451
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,560
You don’t need to keep the secret for me.

452
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,120
Yiren.

453
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,400
I trust you only.

454
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Tell me the truth.

455
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,440
Is Gu Bo a shareholder of

456
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
your company?

457
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Uh...

458
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes.

459
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,520
But I don’t know

460
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
what his parents do.

461
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,760
I just know they do business.

462
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
And...

463
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,080
they do big business.

464
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,960
All right.

465
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,280
I know, then.

466
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,440
Thank you, Yiren.

467
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,400
Thank you, Yiren.

468
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,240
Oh,

469
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
remember not to tell Xia Di.

470
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,640
Got it?

471
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,640
I’ll hang up.

472
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,000
Madam.

473
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
Now you can believe me, can’t you?

474
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,680
Yiren is Xia Di’s best friend.

475
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
She can’t be cheating you for me.

476
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
You have a real life.

477
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,440
Why does a rich man like you

478
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,400
keeps a low profile?

479
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,200
Tell me.

480
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Does Xia Di not know that?

481
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,840
Don’t,

482
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,080
madam.

483
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,840
Don’t tell Xia Di about it.

484
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,000
If you tell her,

485
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,080
we’ll be doomed.

486
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,840
Why?

487
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
Your parents don’t like her?

488
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,240
No.

489
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,360
I’m afraid she’ll break up with me

490
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,680
if she knows.

491
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,960
How dare she!

492
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
Why does she want to break up?

493
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,800
Well,

494
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
it’s hard to explain in a short time.

495
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,280
Anyway,

496
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
you just promised me.

497
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,280
But...

498
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,680
No.

499
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Being rich isn’t enough.

500
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
How can you regret?

501
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,840
I...

502
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,440
I must be sure

503
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
if you have the true heart for my daughter.

504
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
I’m not selling my daughter.

505
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,560
Rest assured.

506
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,080
I’m true to Xia Di.

507
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,120
I swear to you.

508
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,560
As long as you allow me to be his girlfriend,

509
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,240
I promise

510
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
I’ll be nice to you all my life.

511
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,840
Swear to me.

512
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,360
Yes.

513
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,960
I swear to you.

514
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,080
All right.

515
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,880
I’m telling you.

516
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
If you dare to hurt my daughter,

517
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,280
I won’t let you go.

518
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,560
Thank you.

519
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Come. Enjoy the dishes.

520
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,360
Boxing needs strength and speed.

521
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,840
You’re just giving vent!

522
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,640
None of your business!

523
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,120
Since you decide to leave Square & Circle,

524
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
and leave Fang Zhiyou,

525
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
why do you still feel sorry?

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,240
Come back.

527
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
Mr. He is waiting for you.

528
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,840
I said

529
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,480
I wasn’t going back.

530
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,400
Why?

531
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,280
You didn’t, because of Fang Zhiyou.

532
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,160
But he’s so rude to you.

533
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Why don’t you give up yet?

534
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,600
You worked so hard for Square & Circle.

535
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,640
But Fang Zhiyou thought

536
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,720
you betrayed him.

537
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
He doesn’t deserve your love.

538
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,920
It’s true.

539
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,240
What?

540
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,280
I betrayed Square & Circle.

541
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,760
And I framed Xu Yiren up.

542
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,080
He wasn’t lying.

543
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,600
I did that.

544
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,080
Now you see.

545
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,760
I deserve that.

546
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,200
No.

547
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,720
No.

548
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,120
Fang Zhiyou forced you.

549
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,120
The He Yuwen I know

550
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
never does anything like that.

551
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,360
It must be Fang Zhiyou’s fault.

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,680
Yuwen.

553
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,080
Give up.

554
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,600
Fang Zhiyou isn’t your cup of tea.

555
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,360
He has

556
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
totally changed you.

557
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,440
Who is my cup of tea, then?

558
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,920
You?

559
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,480
You knew

560
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
I always loved you.

561
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,040
Yuwen.

562
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
I don’t care how you loved Fang Zhiyou,

563
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,320
even if you still love him.

564
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,680
I don’t care.

565
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
As long as you want to forget him

566
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,600
and pay more attention to me,

567
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I can wait.

568
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,800
I can wait, however long it takes.

569
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,280
Yuwen.

570
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,720
Gu Bo is good.

571
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
It was so long before he gave himself away.

572
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
I underestimated him.

573
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,760
Because you helped him.

574
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
I doubt

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,480
if you really like me.

576
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,120
You bear with it when Gu Bo lies.

577
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,080
When I tell a little lie,

578
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,560
you get angry with me.

579
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
You’re partial, Fang Zhiyou.

580
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,680
Xu Yiren.

581
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,560
If you think so,

582
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
let’s talk about it.

583
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
Since Gu Bo came to work,

584
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,880
you’ve been caring for him.

585
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
You nearly quarreled with me for him.

586
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,400
And you patched up his lie just now.

587
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,160
You’re partial, Xu Yiren.

588
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,160
Why do you like to rake up the past?

589
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
I like it, so what?

590
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,240
For you,

591
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,400
I’d always like to rake up the past.

592
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
Stop kidding.

593
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,120
Oh,

594
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,040
I promised Xia Di

595
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,720
to enjoy the girls’ night with her today.

596
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
So, I’m not going home tonight.

597
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,040
Seems like

598
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,120
Gu Bo must try harder.

599
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,920
Why does Xia Di still have time

600
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
to stay with you?

601
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
Fang Shiyu is right.

602
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,600
You’re super jealous.

603
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,640
I’m glad you know.

604
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,880
Come back to me on time tomorrow, Xu Yiren.

605
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Hmm.

606
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,680
Let’s go.

607
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,560
What?

608
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,640
You don’t want to leave me, huh?

609
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,480
Sorry.

610
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,000
I lied to you

611
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,720
this morning.

612
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,160
I wasn’t reading the constellation fortune.

613
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,720
I wasn’t chatting with others, either.

614
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
I was checking a kind of medicine.

615
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
I met your father.

616
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,320
I found that

617
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,840
he was taking Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets,

618
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,600
for senile dementia.

619
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,160
Hello?

620
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,280
Yes.

621
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,240
What?

622
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,720
Where is he?

623
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Okay.

624
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
So, you really let Gu Bo

625
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
stay with your mom alone?

626
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,240
Or what else could I do?

627
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,560
I just don’t want them to bother me.

628
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,280
What if

629
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,920
your mother doesn’t agree on your relationship?

630
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,160
She can disagree.

631
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
But I’ll still be in a relationship.

632
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,880
We don’t interfere with each other.

633
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,720
When did you see me

634
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
giving in to anyone?

635
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,600
Awesome.

636
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,160
Have you thought about it?

637
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
You and Gu Bo

638
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,680
don’t know each other very well.

639
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
I don’t know him enough?

640
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
I’ve even seen the hair

641
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,520
on his navel many times.

642
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,360
I don’t mean that.

643
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,680
I know your point.

644
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,160
But I don’t think love is a negotiation

645
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,200
where we can’t win

646
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,360
unless we knew each other enough.

647
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
The fun of love

648
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,640
is to get close to each other,

649
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,880
know each other

650
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
and then become a couple,

651
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,720
isn’t it?

652
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,640
I enjoy the process.

653
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,960
The other parts don’t matter.

654
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
You’re really

655
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,760
the master of romance comics.

656
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
I’ll learn from you.

657
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
The click rates go up again, huh?

658
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,260
= Ms. He =

659
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,160
So, being in a relationship really matters.

660
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Ms. He?

661
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,360
Xu Yiren.

662
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
You know that?

663
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,440
I’m not going to lose.

664
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,120
Ms. He.

665
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,200
What’s wrong with you?

666
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,760
Where are you? Sounds so noisy.

667
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,120
Hello?

668
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
Who is that to the phone owner?

669
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,560
This is her friend.

670
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
What’s happening to her?

671
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,240
Drunk?

672
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,960
Where is she?

673
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,440
Okay. I’ll be right there.

674
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,120
Please take good care of her.

675
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,880
Okay, thank you.

676
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,360
Xu Yiren.

677
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,200
It’s too late.

678
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,160
Why are you going to see her?

679
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,240
We’re having a girls’ night.

680
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,160
Are you really leaving?

681
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,360
She’s drunk in a bar.

682
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,160
I must go check on her.

683
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,760
You’re right.

684
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,680
It’s better than letting Fang Zhiyou go.

685
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,660
= The Operating Room =

686
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,280
Doctor.

687
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,080
How is my father?

688
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,480
Your father

689
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
was provoked.

690
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,400
He was so inflamed that

691
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,320
he had a heart attack.

692
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,680
Luckily,

693
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,800
we rescued him in time.

694
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
He’s out of danger now.

695
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,720
But he suffers from

696
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
hypertension.

697
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,600
And his heart function

698
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,080
is failing.

699
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,480
You must pay more attention.

700
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,440
Don’t let him

701
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,600
be provoked again.

702
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,520
Otherwise,

703
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,640
he might not be so lucky next time.

704
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,320
Okay, I see.

705
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,560
Thank you, doctor.

706
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,440
Be careful.

707
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,520
Stay off me!

708
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,800
Be careful.

709
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,840
Don’t touch me.

710
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
Stay off me!

711
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,560
What do you think you’re doing?

712
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,040
Drowning your sorrow?

713
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,560
If you really don’t want to see me,

714
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,000
why did you call me?

715
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,120
Xu Yiren.

716
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,040
You know what?

717
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,760
Don’t show off.

718
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,640
I’m not giving in.

719
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
When I first knew you,

720
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
I was jealous of you.

721
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
You have strong working ability.

722
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,800
You’re beautiful.

723
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,840
And you have a rich family.

724
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,480
In the TV show,

725
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,480
you’re a princess

726
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,400
and I’m a maid.

727
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,800
I admit it.

728
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,960
When I knew you adored Fang Zhiyou,

729
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
I said something to you

730
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,920
justly and forcefully.

731
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,560
But I was scared,

732
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,120
because you were far better than me.

733
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,920
But later, I got to know.

734
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,000
Love isn’t something

735
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,280
we use to compare.

736
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,720
Stop showing off.

737
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,720
I know Fang Zhiyou.

738
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,160
You will not

739
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,640
always stay with him.

740
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Do you really know him?

741
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,360
If you did,

742
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,040
you would have known that

743
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,800
he hated to be cheated most

744
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,640
and you wouldn’t have done that.

745
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
However much you hate me,

746
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,280
you shouldn’t have done that

747
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
to damage Square & Circle?

748
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,160
Do you know how sad Fang Zhiyou is?

749
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,040
Don’t try to teach me a lesson.

750
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,960
Why do you think you can?

751
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,360
You told lots of lies, didn’t you?

752
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes.

753
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,440
I admit it.

754
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,320
I’ve lied a lot to him.

755
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,520
I don’t want to

756
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,960
argue about kindness or evil.

757
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,840
But this is between him and me.

758
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,160
We don’t need others to judge.

759
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,840
So,

760
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,400
you mean,

761
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,520
when Fang Zhiyou doesn’t like me,

762
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,080
he won’t fall in with me,

763
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
no matter what I do, right?

764
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,640
I just want to tell you that

765
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,800
I know how you feel.

766
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,920
But a lot of things can’t be explained

767
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,680
in love.

768
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
I want you to understand.

769
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,720
To understand as early as you can,

770
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,720
so that you’ll be the confident
and proud you again.

771
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,960
That’s all I can tell.

772
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
I invited you back.

773
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
I did that with my true heart.

774
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
Square & Circle needs you.

775
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,360
Fang Zhiyou needs you, too, I guess.

776
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
If possible,

777
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
hope you can be our boss again.

778
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,200
Don’t you fear

779
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,880
I’ll interfere with your relationship?

780
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,040
I don’t dare to assure you.

781
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,440
I do.

782
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
But I trust Fang Zhiyou.

783
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,800
And I believe

784
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
I can protect our relationship.

785
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,200
Why did you come?

786
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,320
When you were abroad,

787
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,360
I changed your father’s emergency contact

788
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,440
into my number.

789
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,120
I just got a call

790
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,360
from the nursing home.

791
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
He no longer needs you.

792
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,480
I’m back.

793
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,760
I’m going to

794
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
take my father back to America.

795
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,600
But you were just back.

796
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
You should be happy.

797
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,080
When I’m away,

798
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,880
no one will always remind you

799
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,760
what you’ve done.

800
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,240
And no one will fight you for Xu Yiren.

801
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,320
But you come back to take revenge,

802
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,560
don’t you?

803
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,520
Compared to that,

804
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,440
I’d rather stay with my father

805
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,120
for the rest of his life.

806
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,200
But you don’t need

807
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
to leave.

808
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,480
What?

809
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,480
You want me to

810
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,480
stay here, watch you

811
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,960
and do nothing?

812
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,400
I can’t do that.

813
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,520
These are clothes and belongings

814
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,600
the patient took when he came.

815
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,120
Take them back.

816
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,040
What’s this?

817
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,720
I’m not sure.

818
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,920
When he was sent here,

819
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,480
he seized it in his hand.

820
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,880
Thank you.

821
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,400
Come out with me.

822
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,280
Seems like

823
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,540
= The biggest illegal funding case was solved. =

824
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,040
my father had a heart attack

825
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,600
because of this.

826
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
It’s been thirteen years.

827
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
Even if he doesn’t remember me,

828
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,720
he can’t forget what he suffered.

829
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,280
Even some irrelevant news

830
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,360
drove him crazy.

831
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,280
But I...

832
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,920
I always want to escape

833
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,560
and give up.

834
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,040
Li Zhe.

835
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,280
Hatred doesn’t change anything.

836
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,280
Let me help you.

837
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,120
Let’s take care of your father together.

838
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,520
Don’t show pity on me.

839
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,360
You know what?

840
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,840
My father doesn’t talk now.

841
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,720
But I’m sure.

842
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
When he’s alive,

843
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,200
he’s waiting

844
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
until your father kneels before him, apologizes,

845
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,640
and vindicate him.

846
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,240
I promise you.

847
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,560
I’ll try everything I can

848
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,680
to make my father apologize to your father

849
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
in front of everyone.

850
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
Shiyu doesn’t answer the phone.

851
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,520
Why didn’t you ask

852
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,640
what exactly happened?

853
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,560
I was too anxious

854
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,840
to ask much.

855
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,200
She said she was wounded in PE class

856
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,160
and asked us to go.

857
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,040
We’re going to school,

858
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,360
instead of hospital.

859
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,920
She may not be badly wounded.

860
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,360
Don’t be anxious.

861
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,160
Come on!

862
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,000
Come on!

863
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,000
Where is she?

864
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,400
Where were you wounded?

865
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,480
When I played football,

866
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
I accidentally turned over my toenail.

867
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,000
It hurts.

868
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,120
Don’t touch it.

869
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,120
Doctor in the infirmary just wrapped it.

870
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Let’s go to hospital, okay?

871
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,760
No. No.

872
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
Just drive me home.

873
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,000
Can you walk?

874
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,720
What do you think?

875
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,920
Come up.

876
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
I don’t want you to carry me.

877
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,320
I want Yiren.

878
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,680
Okay.

879
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Come up.

880
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,120
Don’t try to touch her.

881
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
You can’t be jealous of me, can you?

882
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
Fang Zhiyou, you’re super jealous.

883
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,960
Shiyu.

884
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
Lie down.

885
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,400
You’ll feel better.

886
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,480
Oh.

887
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,280
Shiyu, you’re awesome.

888
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,720
You played football with your left foot?

889
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,480
Uh...

890
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,120
What’s the name of Golden Left Foot?

891
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,240
No.

892
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
I’m not a left-hander.

893
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,240
I asked you to drive me home.

894
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,320
Why are we going to your place?

895
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,120
You need to be taken care of.

896
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,200
Can I count on him to take care of you?

897
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,160
He can’t take care of me. Can you?

898
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
I’m going home.

899
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,360
You always wanted to go to my place,

900
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,040
when I didn’t want it.

901
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,440
What’s wrong today?

902
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,560
I don’t want to interfere

903
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
with you and Yiren.

904
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Fang Shiyu.

905
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,840
I don’t care. I’m going home.

906
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,360
I’m going home!

907
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,880
I’m not going to your place.

908
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,760
All right. All right.

909
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Drive her home.

910
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,680
If she wants, just drive her home.

911
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,360
There we are, Shiyu. Get off the car.

912
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
I’m wounded.

913
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,640
Don’t you walk me in?

914
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,280
Dad can’t be home

915
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,720
at this moment.

916
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,680
Let me walk her in.

917
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,920
Let’s go.

918
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,480
Come on. Be careful.

919
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,800
