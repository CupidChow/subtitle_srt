= Episode 23 =

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,440
Yiren.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Why are you coming?

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
Gu Bo called me.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,920
I’m worried about you.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,040
What have you got?

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
I had planned to

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,760
record the evidence

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,480
and gave it to Mr. Jiang.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,160
It could vindicate us.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
But he found it

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
and took away the voice recorder.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,320
It doesn’t matter.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
You’re safe, anyway.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,080
What are you laughing at?

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
But he didn’t know

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,880
I had another voice recorder

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,280
in case.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,360
He admitted that

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,160
he asked someone

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,560
to frame me up through my computer.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,920
But he didn’t tell me who it was.

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Don’t be anxious.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,280
I’ll think of a way

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,640
to find him or her out.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,200
In fact,

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,480
you didn’t need to do that.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,760
I want to vindicate myself.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I always trust you.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,040
You know it.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
I know you trust me.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,240
But...

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,640
I want to vindicate myself

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
through my own efforts.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,480
I don’t want to always rely on others.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
Who else do you want to rely on?

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
You can only rely on me.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
You’re like the sun in my life,

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,080
warming me and shining over me.

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
But I don’t want to

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
be like the moon

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,960
when people can’t see me

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,040
without the reflected light from you.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
Even if I can only

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
be a little glowworm,

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,720
I want to shine over you

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,680
with my slight light,

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
even for a short way.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,480
You’re more than a little glowworm.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
You’re my rainbow.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,000
I want to go through the rain,

70
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,720
only to see you.

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,240
Get in the car.

72
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
We’re blocking the way.

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,280
I bought off Xie Dongren with Jiaye

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
to attend the bidding.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,520
Then I asked someone

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
to send the quotations of the other three companies

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,680
to Jiaye

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
through your computer.

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Jiaye didn’t attend the bidding

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,080
to succeed,

81
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,240
but to ruin

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,440
Fang Zhiyou’s reputation.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
You heard it, didn’t you?

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,800
Xu Yiren didn’t betray us.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
She’s innocent.

86
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Awesome, Yiren.

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,320
I knew you must be framed up.

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
Thank you, Sha Sha.

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,840
Thank you, Ziyang, Xiang Wei.

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Everybody, thank you

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,800
for always trusting me.

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,560
Since it’s figured out,

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
so much

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,920
for this.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
I don’t want anyone

96
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
to talk about it again.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
Moon Bay Project

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
will be restarted in two weeks.

99
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
As for the other three companies,

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
let them decide

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,480
if they still want to attend the bidding.

102
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,440
Mr. Liu.

103
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,800
Take care of

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,560
the rest of the project.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
You...

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,640
You still trust me?

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,080
You...

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,960
You’re always muddled

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
But you act poorly.

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
You won’t hurt our company

111
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,520
too badly.

112
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Fine.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Pretend I didn’t ask.

114
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,200
All right.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,240
Dismiss.

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,840
Okay.

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,720
Get to work.

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,040
It’s over.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,160
I’m finally vindicated.

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Thank you.

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,920
I have found

124
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
the one you want.

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,680
But...

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,600
are you sure you want to know who it is?

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Mr. Li.

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
You wanted to see me?

129
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
I had planned to ask the HR Department to tell you.

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
For the sake that you’re Xu Yiren’s cousin,

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,200
I’d like to explain to you personally.

132
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
From tomorrow on,

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
you don’t need to come.

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
I don’t need to come?

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,840
What do you mean?

136
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
Literally.

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
I hired you,

138
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
only because

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
I thought you were that girl.

140
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,280
Now I know you lied.

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
You have no reason to stay.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
Xu Yiren told you?

143
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,880
Don’t trust her.

144
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,160
She liked to snatch my things since she was little.

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,240
Everything.

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
My parents.

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
My toys.

148
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,680
And my friends.

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,320
Stop.

150
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,240
I suspected you at first.

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
But I’ve been looking for the girl

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
for so many years.

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,920
I didn’t want to give up any possibility.

154
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,320
You should feel lucky.

155
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
I have good temper now.

156
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,240
If it were in the past,

157
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
you would have suffered.

158
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,080
Get the pay for one more month.

159
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
It’s the best I can do.

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,080
From now on,

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I don’t want to see you again.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,440
And remember!

163
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Don’t dream to get

164
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,560
whatever doesn’t belong to you.

165
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
Why do you think you can teach me?

166
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
Are you doing better than me?

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Xu Yiren is in a relationship with Fang Zhiyou.

168
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
But you still want her.

169
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
I know Xu Yiren so well.

170
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,480
She always plays poor for sympathy.

171
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,960
She never tells the truth.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
But men like you

173
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
always trust her.

174
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Why?

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,640
Do you know

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
the biggest difference between you and her?

177
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,240
She likes to tell lies.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
But she’s pure.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,760
And you...

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
Everything of you

181
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
disgusts people.

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,880
Bai.

183
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,040
Go.

184
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,880
Let go of me.

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,080
I can walk out.

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,960
Gu Bo checked the monitors.

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
On the night

188
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,160
when the email was sent,

189
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,080
you were the only one who came in

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,360
but didn’t leave.

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
There was only one reason.

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,840
You wanted to leave after the monitors were off.

193
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,680
You sent the email

194
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
through Xu Yiren’s computer.

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,160
Don’t you want to explain?

196
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
I can try to trust you...

197
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Don’t bother.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,760
I did that.

199
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,680
I don’t like Xu Yiren.

200
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
You don’t like her.

201
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
And you always make things difficult at work.

202
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
I can understand that.

203
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,120
But I didn’t expect you

204
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
to cooperate with Li Zhe.

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
I thought you hated people like him.

206
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
I hate him.

207
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
But I’ll have the least of two evils.

208
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,320
And we hate the same guy.

209
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,440
You’re wrong.

210
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Li Zhe doesn’t hate Xu Yiren.

211
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,480
He hates me.

212
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,120
He hurt her,

213
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,160
just to hurt me.

214
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I feel

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,040
Xu Yiren isn’t good enough for you.

216
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,720
But you fall in love with

217
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
such a poor girl.

218
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,960
I don’t know

219
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,720
when you can realize

220
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,320
we’re in the same world.

221
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,200
We’re selfish and cold.

222
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
You’re losing your mind,

223
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,040
I suppose.

224
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
Selfish and cold?

225
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,760
Yuwen.

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Since we met,

227
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
you’ve never been selfish or cold.

228
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,000
Nor have I.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
What have you suffered lately?

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,360
If you still trust me,

231
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
you can tell me.

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I’ll always listen.

233
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,080
But I don’t allow you

234
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
to hurt Xu Yiren again.

235
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Otherwise,

236
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,520
we’ll no longer be friends.

237
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
I heard that

238
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,000
men were merciless.

239
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,680
Finally, I experienced it.

240
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,520
I worked hard for five years.

241
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,720
But I’m not as good as a girl

242
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
who lied for months.

243
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,080
All right.

244
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,040
Love each other

245
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,200
in your lies.

246
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,200
I quit.

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,080
Qing.

248
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,080
When you lose your job,

249
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
you can find another one.

250
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,880
Right?

251
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,840
But you must have something to eat.

252
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
Find?

253
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
How can I find another man

254
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,520
like Li Zhe?

255
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,160
It’s all Xu Yiren’s fault.

256
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,120
She doesn’t want me to live a good life.

257
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
Why did you bring her home?

258
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
What are you talking about?

259
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Yiren is your cousin.

260
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,680
Did you want us to send her to the orphanage?

261
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,800
She is an orphan.

262
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
You...what are you...

263
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,280
Our daughter is right.

264
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,000
We shouldn’t have taken her home.

265
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,960
It was your fault.

266
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Don’t...

267
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Don’t you think

268
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Yiren is our daughter’s jinx?

269
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,040
Look how she hurt our daughter.

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
Have something to eat,

271
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,800
all right?

272
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
Where are you going?

273
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
Look at your father.

274
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,840
Where are you going?

275
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Going to see Xu Yiren.

276
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
You left something?

277
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Follow the car.

278
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,360
Hurry.

279
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
Catch adultery?

280
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,800
I’m good at that.

281
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,000
Sit steadily.

282
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,520
This place?

283
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
It’s an expensive house, isn’t it?

284
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Thank you, sir.

285
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,480
You’re welcome.

286
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,400
See you.

287
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,760
Give it to me.

288
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
Go have some rest.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,760
Xia Di asked to

290
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,320
go out for fun someday.

291
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
Which day would you like?

292
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,160
How can we have fun together?

293
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
Uh...

294
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,360
She,

295
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,160
Gu Bo,

296
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,120
and us.

297
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,000
We can watch a film

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
and have dinner.

299
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,200
Uh.

300
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Do you feel it boring

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,840
to hang out

302
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,200
with me only?

303
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,800
No.

304
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
With more people,

305
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,440
there will be more fun.

306
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,080
We can order more dishes.

307
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
I don’t think so.

308
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,760
When we hang out together,

309
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
you will certainly put energy

310
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
on them.

311
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,920
What do I do then?

312
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,120
Do you know you look like a little boy

313
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
snatching for candies?

314
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,160
I don’t need to

315
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
snatch my own candies.

316
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,400
Do you really bring them home?

317
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,840
No.

318
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,800
I don’t know who it is.

319
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,560
I’ll go have a look.

320
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
Qing?

321
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
What brings you here?

322
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,000
Why can’t I come?

323
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
Qing.

324
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,120
How did you find this place?

325
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,240
A nice house, isn’t it?

326
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,080
No wonder you didn’t agree to move in

327
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
when my dad asked you.

328
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
So, you’re living with this man.

329
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,200
I underestimated you, Xu Yiren.

330
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
What do you come for?

331
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
What do I come for?

332
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
How dare you ask?

333
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,120
You promised

334
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,800
not to tell Li Zhe

335
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,320
you were the girl.

336
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,200
But soon you betrayed me.

337
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,320
Xu Yiren.

338
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,600
Good for you.

339
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,280
See?

340
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Li Zhe dumped me.

341
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,480
And I lost my job.

342
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Who else should I go to?

343
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,800
Li Zhe dumped you?

344
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,880
I don’t believe that.

345
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,480
You think he shouldn’t have done that,

346
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,160
don’t you?

347
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
How will Li Zhe like you

348
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,840
with his taste?

349
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Since he doesn’t like you,

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,560
how could he dump you?

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,680
You!

352
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Xu Yiren.

353
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,360
Don’t show off.

354
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,800
You’ll cry.

355
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,760
It’s okay.

356
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,120
Don’t worry.

357
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,080
I’ll explain to your uncle

358
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
with you.

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,720
Since

360
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,840
we’re in a relationship,

361
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
we’ll let them know.

362
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
I just fear Yu Qing will...

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,680
Forget it.

364
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,600
Don’t worry for what hasn’t happened yet.

365
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,440
You taught me that.

366
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,800
You’re a good student.

367
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
Since we were in a relationship,

368
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,680
I’ve been brave.

369
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
It’s okay, babe.

370
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
Damn Xu Yiren.

371
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,640
How dares she be so greedy!

372
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,160
She ruined your relationship

373
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,920
with Li Zhe.

374
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,920
But she lives in a big house

375
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
and is dating a rich man.

376
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
It’s her workplace, huh?

377
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
Rest assured.

378
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
I will certainly avenge you

379
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,560
today.

380
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,000
Go.

381
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,520
You don’t know?

382
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,080
Ms. He

383
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
came to our company

384
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
for Mr. Fang.

385
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,000
Now Mr. Fang is with Yiren.

386
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,400
I would also go if I were her.

387
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,720
It’s too embarrassed to say.

388
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,640
Stop talking nonsense.

389
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,520
When did I ever talk nonsense?

390
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,160
Besides,

391
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,640
there’s evidence.

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
It’s not nonsense.

393
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
I had thought

394
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,640
she married a rich man.

395
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,160
Turns out she’s the mistress.

396
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,440
Oh, I just wondered

397
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
why a rich man like Fang Zhiyou

398
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,320
fell in love with her.

399
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
She must have chased him.

400
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,280
Go.

401
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,960
Mom.

402
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,680
I’m not getting in.

403
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,600
I’m a girl.

404
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,760
I don’t feel like

405
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,840
quarreling with others.

406
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,960
Yes. Yes.

407
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,760
Babe.

408
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,080
Keep a good image.

409
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,200
Wait for me.

410
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,560
Be good.

411
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Xu Yiren?

412
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,360
Xu Yiren!

413
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,360
Hello.

414
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,400
Who do you want to see?

415
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
Xu Yiren.

416
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,920
And you are?

417
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
I’m her aunt.

418
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,760
Where is she?

419
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,800
She isn’t around.

420
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, you’re her aunt?

421
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Come on, ma’am.

422
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,400
Be seated.

423
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Be seated. Be seated.

424
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,360
Thank you.

425
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,560
Sha Sha.

426
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,800
Get her some water.

427
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Don’t ask for trouble.

428
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
She’s coming for trouble.

429
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Don’t waste the fun.

430
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,400
Go.

431
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,400
Ma’am.

432
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,360
Come.

433
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Have some snacks.

434
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,720
No. No.

435
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,560
Ma’am.

436
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,520
May I ask

437
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
what do you want Yiren for?

438
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
I come to ask her

439
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,960
why she insists on

440
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,040
being a man’s mistress

441
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
and ruining our family reputation?

442
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,520
She has a cousin.

443
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,560
And her cousin will get married.

444
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,720
If she continues,

445
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
she’ll damage my daughter’s reputation.

446
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Don’t talk nonsense, ma’am.

447
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,280
Xu Yiren isn’t a mistress.

448
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,840
- No, she isn’t. - You don’t know her.

449
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
My niece Yiren

450
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,280
always keeps me worried.

451
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,080
Since she was little,

452
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,040
she liked to flirt with boys.

453
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,400
In middle school,

454
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
she camped in the wild

455
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,200
with a senior boy of another school

456
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,520
and was caught by the police.

457
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,240
In college,

458
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,880
she had a boyfriend Gao Ming.

459
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
Wasn’t that good?

460
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,640
Gao Ming was a great man.

461
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,400
Unexpectedly,

462
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,440
when Gao Ming was abroad,

463
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,560
she couldn’t wait.

464
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
She came to your company,

465
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
knew your boss

466
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,080
and dumped Gao Ming.

467
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,400
Think about them.

468
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
It’s okay if they’re in a serious relationship.

469
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,440
But she becomes his mistress.

470
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,880
She’s going too far.

471
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,200
Wow, amazing.

472
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,400
Shut up.

473
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Ma’am.

474
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,040
We haven’t heard

475
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
what you just said.

476
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,240
In our company at least,

477
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
Yiren works very hard.

478
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah.

479
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,520
And...

480
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,600
She’s very nice to us.

481
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
- Isn’t she? - Yes.

482
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,600
She must be nice to useful colleagues

483
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,360
or male colleagues.

484
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
But you know what?

485
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,360
She isn’t

486
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,920
a very bad girl.

487
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,760
Before she came to my home,

488
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,400
she had suffered too much.

489
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,800
Then she had a problem,

490
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,680
snatching things.

491
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,800
My daughter,

492
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,720
I mean her cousin.

493
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Since she was little,

494
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,000
she had snatched so many things from my daughter.

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Young man, get me some water.

496
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,040
Listen to me.

497
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Now she’s doing worse.

498
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
She even snatches a man.

499
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I mean,

500
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,880
Mr. Li from Dasheng.

501
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,000
He’s my daughter’s boyfriend.

502
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,800
Seriously?

503
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,280
Is he?

504
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes.

505
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
They were in a relationship.

506
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,560
But...

507
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,440
Yiren didn’t want it.

508
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,080
She always went to see Mr. Li

509
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
and flirted with him.

510
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,120
Fine.

511
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,360
Now, Mr. Li is out of his mind.

512
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,040
He wants to

513
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
break up with my daughter.

514
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Li Zhe?

515
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
I’m her aunt.

516
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Today, I come to beg her.

517
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
She has Mr. Fang.

518
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,280
Could she let go of Mr. Li

519
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,920
and leave an option to my daughter?

520
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,840
Am I right?

521
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,160
But...

522
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh, dear.

523
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
No way?

524
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Is Yiren so scheming?

525
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:04,880
I...

526
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,760
Aunt.

527
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

528
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
This is the company.

529
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,760
If you continue, I’ll call security.

530
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,520
Finally, you come out.

531
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Go.

532
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Go call security!

533
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,480
I’ll see

534
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,440
how ungrateful you can be.

535
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
What have I said wrong?

536
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
In middle school,

537
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
weren’t you taken to the police station

538
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
because you camped in the wild

539
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,160
with a strange boy

540
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,360
from another school?

541
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,560
And we were informed.

542
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
Your uncle and I

543
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
went to the police station in the middle of night

544
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
and brought you home.

545
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
Have I done anything wrong?

546
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,800
Your uncle and I

547
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
brought you up carefully.

548
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,080
Have we done anything wrong?

549
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,320
You’re so rude to me.

550
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,800
Call the police?

551
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,680
Ma’am, calm down.

552
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
We’re still working.

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,200
I think I’ve heard enough.

554
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
You, granny.

555
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,560
Shiyu.

556
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,520
Every word you say

557
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,760
is starting a rumor.

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,160
This young lady

559
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
can send you a lawyer’s letter.

560
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,200
Who are you going to scare, little girl?

561
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
Shiyu, forget it.

562
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,160
You don’t decide

563
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,640
= ZYF Personal Law Firm, Fang Zhanyang =
if you’re starting a rumor.

564
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,080
Nor do I.

565
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,120
But the summons will.

566
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
If you don’t leave here

567
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,440
within fifteen seconds,

568
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,880
I promise you you’ll receive the summons

569
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,640
within three days.

570
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,920
One,

571
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,240
two,

572
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,680
three,

573
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,880
four.

574
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
What the hell!

575
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,360
Great!

576
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,080
She’s gone.

577
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,760
Awesome.

578
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Don’t you need to work?

579
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,160
Wasting my brother’s money?

580
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
Let’s get to work.

581
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,720
Shiyu.

582
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Thank you.

583
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
Why are you so numb?

584
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
She cursed you and you didn’t answer back.

585
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
Promise me one thing.

586
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Don’t tell your brother

587
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,520
what happened today.

588
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,320
All right?

589
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,120
Is something burning?

590
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Doomed. My dish.

591
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
I can’t tell you.

592
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,320
Can’t?

593
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
It means you know.

594
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Tell me.

595
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,720
What’s wrong with you?

596
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
I said I couldn’t tell you.

597
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,160
What are you doing?

598
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,560
Chinese, English, maths Olympiad, piano and ballet.

599
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,800
Pick one.

600
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
Or I’ll pay for all classes.

601
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,360
How inhumane!

602
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,640
All right. I’ll tell you.

603
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,320
When you were away from the office,

604
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
Yiren’s aunt came to your company

605
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,440
and made a scene.

606
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
Most annoyingly,

607
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,760
Yiren didn’t argue

608
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
and she was only anxious.

609
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,560
Her aunt was going too far.

610
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
That was close.

611
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Luckily, it’s not burnt.

612
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,120
Come and have dinner.

613
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Come with me.

614
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,680
Yiren.

615
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,640
Don’t blame me.

616
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
You pulled a long face and he saw you through.

617
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,440
Shiyu.

618
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,160
Go have dinner.

619
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,320
Hurry.

620
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,880
Why didn’t you tell me?

621
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
In case I got angry?

622
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,680
She said something disgusting.

623
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I didn’t want to make you

624
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
feel sad for me.

625
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
So, you feel sad alone?

626
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
I’m used to the way

627
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
my aunt talks.

628
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,080
In fact,

629
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
I’m very sad.

630
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,040
I don’t know

631
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,520
why she’s always so cruel to me.

632
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,120
Don’t try to understand anyone

633
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,400
with your kindness.

634
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
If you can’t

635
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
maintain a relationship,

636
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,760
family, friendship, or love,

637
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
unless you always make a concession,

638
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,840
what do you need the relationship for?

639
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,760
Uh...

640
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,800
If...

641
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
If one day,

642
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,240
we have to make a concession,

643
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,480
what will you do?

644
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
I’ll end the relationship decisively.

645
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,480
But the day won’t come.

646
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,440
Because the one who loves you

647
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,720
won’t aggrieve you.

648
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,760
I’ll get in alone.

649
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,880
You don’t need me?

650
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,520
It feels great to rely on you.

651
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,840
But I must settle something down

652
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,240
by myself.

653
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
You’re truly getting braver.

654
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,480
Go ahead.

655
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,200
Mom.

656
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
Thank you for today.

657
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,280
Is it sweet?

658
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,560
Yes.

659
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,280
I finally took revenge for you today.

660
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,840
What a pity!

661
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,800
I didn’t see

662
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,160
the sad look on her face personally.

663
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Don’t worry.

664
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,200
It’s not over.

665
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,040
Later,

666
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,720
take me to Fang Zhiyou’s home.

667
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,560
I’ll curse her in front of his house.

668
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
I’ll let all his neighbors know.

669
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Shame on you.

670
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,680
What kind of aunt are you?

671
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,440
You did that.

672
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,160
And how will Yiren work in her company?

673
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,560
I’m teaching her a lesson.

674
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,040
She lived a life on us.

675
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,640
We brought her up.

676
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
She’s getting fledged, huh?

677
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,000
And she bullies our daughter.

678
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,760
Never think of it.

679
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,480
You...

680
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,360
Be right there.

681
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,280
- Uncle. - Yiren.

682
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,680
You...

683
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
What?

684
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,040
You know you’re wrong

685
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,600
and you come with gifts?

686
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,760
You were stubborn, weren’t you?

687
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,720
A woman like you

688
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
must always be warned.

689
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,280
Or you would be proud.

690
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Honey.

691
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,640
Yiren.

692
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,720
I didn’t know what they did today.

693
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,520
If I knew,

694
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
I wouldn’t let them go.

695
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,600
I know.

696
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,520
Uncle.

697
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
When my parents died,

698
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
I was little.

699
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,120
But...

700
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,080
I knew something.

701
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
My parents died of accident.

702
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
There was pension,

703
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,320
wasn’t there, uncle?

704
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,000
And the apartment we lived in.

705
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
It wasn’t worth too much.

706
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
But selling it will afford my education.

707
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Right, aunt?

708
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,160
What do you mean, Xu Yiren?

709
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,120
Oh, I see.

710
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,840
You come to balance the books with us, huh?

711
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,680
Honey.

712
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,280
You...

713
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,160
Dayong.

714
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,120
Balance the books?

715
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,520
Can you balance?

716
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,800
Can you?

717
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,800
We brought you up.

718
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,920
Can you balance it?

719
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,240
With money?

720
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,480
Honey,

721
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
what are you doing?

722
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
You’re right.

723
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
I can’t balance my gratitude with money.

724
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,400
Because of this,

725
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,480
I’ve been bearing with it,

726
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,720
whatever you did.

727
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,400
Because you gave us a home.

728
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
Today, I come to tell you.

729
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
I bear with you and do nothing,

730
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,880
not because I think

731
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,840
I owe you anything,

732
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
but because I regard you as families.

733
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
But today, I realize

734
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,800
that’s my wishful thinking.

735
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,960
You never treat me as a family.

736
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
So, from today on,

737
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,600
if you do anything to me,

738
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,160
think about the consequence.

739
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,960
You’re threatening me, huh?

740
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,680
Yu Dayong.

741
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,640
Look.

742
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,920
This is the girl we brought up.

743
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,280
You know what?

744
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,920
You’re an ungrateful girl!

745
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,880
Fang, stop, could you?

746
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,560
Uncle.

747
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
I know

748
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
you’ve got a reason.

749
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
I don’t blame you.

750
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
But this family,

751
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,760
I’m not coming back again.

752
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,040
As long as you want it,

753
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,360
we’re still families.

754
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,760
Uncle, take care.

755
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,600
Yiren.

756
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,120
You.

757
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
Stop!

758
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,920
Stop, could you?

759
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,040
You damn girl!

760
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,280
- Never come back. - Yiren.

761
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Yiren.

762
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,800
- Yiren. - Take away your stuff.

763
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,520
Stop pit.

764
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,840
Look at her!

765
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,560
She’s being ridiculous!

766
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,960
Qing.

767
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
How was it going?

768
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,720
All right.

769
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,320
It’s all right now.

770
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,480
It’s all right now.

771
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,440
I always found it hard to say something.

772
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,080
But after I said it,

773
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,240
it no longer felt hard.

774
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,080
If I knew I would feel relived

775
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,440
after I said that,

776
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,240
I would have done it long ago.

777
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,920
People’s feelings

778
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,760
are like the computer’s RAM.

779
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,280
You can’t put in new things

780
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,440
before you empty it.

781
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
What else

782
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
should I put in then?

783
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,280
Me.

784
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,240
I’ll try to

785
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
fill it with all good memories

786
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,800
between us.

787
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Let’s go.

788
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,320
Dad.

789
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,440
The nurse said you were getting better.

790
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,880
And you could read newspapers.

791
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,080
They said

792
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,720
maybe you would

793
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,360
recognize me

794
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,360
if I stayed with you longer.

795
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,320
It’s okay.

796
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,120
Don’t be anxious.

797
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,680
We’ll try harder.

798
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,400
Dad.

799
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,520
Shall I take you back to America?

800
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,840
Let’s go back home.

801
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,760
You can see a doctor

802
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
and I can have a new start.

803
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,280
I know

804
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,760
vindicating yourself

805
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,800
is what you want the most.

806
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,600
I’m trying hard.

807
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,040
I promised you.

808
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
I’ll make Fang Zhanyang

809
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,160
kneel before you.

810
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
And I’ll make Fang Zhiyou

811
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
pay the price.

812
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,360
So, I hurt my best friend.

813
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,240
And I hurt the girl I adore.

814
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,160
But dad,

815
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
I can hardly recognize myself.

816
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
I’m a bit exhausted.

817
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,600
Dad.

818
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,920
I’m exhausted.

819
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
Zhe.

820
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
Have an apple.

821
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,000
And go to school.

822
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,520
Go to bed early.

823
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
You’re going to school tomorrow.

824
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,000
Have an apple.

825
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,880
Have an apple.

826
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,880
Go to school.

827
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,700
= Library =

828
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Yes.

829
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,360
Excuse me for a minute.

830
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,520
What are you doing?

831
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,920
I’m nervous.

832
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
What for?

833
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,880
I’m giving a speech, instead of you.

834
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,320
We share the same destiny.

835
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,440
I’m nervous for you.

836
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,720
All right.

837
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,600
No more kidding.

838
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,240
I’ve got something urgent.

839
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,480
Wait for me. I’ll be right back.

840
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,160
Where are you going?

841
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,560
Don’t bother. I won’t be long.

842
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,160
Why isn’t Yiren coming yet?

843
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,840
She said she would cheer for me.

844
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,440
Hello?

845
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,520
Wu, this is me.

846
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,600
Gu Bo.

847
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
I need your help.

848
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,280
Everybody, please be quiet.

849
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,120
Let’s welcome Miss Xia Di,

850
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,600
the author of Mr. Honesty,

851
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,800
to give a speech.

852
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Xia Di, Xia Di,

853
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,280
always pretty!

854
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,920
Xia Di, Xia Di,

855
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
always young!

856
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,200
Xia Di, Xia Di,

857
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,240
always pretty!

858
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,400
- Quiet, please. - Xia Di. Xia Di.

859
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,960
Always pretty!

860
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,560
- Please be quiet. - Xia Di. Xia Di.

861
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,840
We love you!

862
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
Xia Di, Xia Di,

863
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,040
Always pretty!

864
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,840
Thank you, everybody,

865
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,560
for supporting Miss Xia Di.

866
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,440
Thank you.

867
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,360
How?

868
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,320
When will you pay us?

869
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,400
- Yeah. - Yeah.

870
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,360
Don’t rush.

871
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,520
Come and line up.

872
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,560
Two hundred for each.

873
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,920
Show your payment code.

874
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,800
Say something.

875
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Line up. Line up.

876
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,160
Come on.

877
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,880
Get your pay here.

878
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,800
After getting two hundred yuan,

879
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,080
you’ll have a gift, too.

880
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,560
It’s very nice.

881
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,160
- Okay. - Thank you.

882
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,080
Thank you for the support.

883
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,800
Thank you for the support.

884
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,440
Thank you for the support.

885
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,480
Mr. Gu.

886
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,600
The money...

887
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,720
You’re my father’s secretary.

888
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,160
You have a dozen subordinates.

889
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,440
You won’t be short of money.

890
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,920
Thank you for the support.

891
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,840
- Thank you. - Thank you.

892
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,520
Thank you.

893
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,120
Thank you.

894
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,000
I don’t have a high pay.

895
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
Don’t worry.

896
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,800
After I become a regular worker and get my pay,

897
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
I’ll doubly pay you back.

898
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,360
Thank you.

899
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
Please keep supporting Xia Di.

900
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,760
Take this.

901
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,440
Thank you.

902
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,680
Scan it.

903
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,320
Thank you for the support.

904
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,160
You should have been a rich man.

905
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
But what are you doing now?

906
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,000
Look.

907
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,360
Nice, isn’t it?

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,320
Isn’t it?

909
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,920
- It’s nice. - Mm.

910
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,680
You know what?

911
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
A man

912
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,080
must support his girl.

913
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,840
I shall never disgrace her.

914
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,480
You’re still in the mood for love?

915
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,040
Your parents just regretted

916
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,880
letting you work in Square & Circle.

917
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
You didn’t inherit their family properties.

918
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,280
They said they would consider

919
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,520
having the second child.

920
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,720
By then,

921
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,880
you’ll have nothing.

922
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,800
Second child?

923
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Let them try.

924
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Then they won’t bother about me.

925
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,680
Thank you for...

926
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,880
Two hundred won’t satisfy me.

927
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,280
What do you think?

928
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,560
Mr. Gu!

929
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,000
Yiren.

930
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
Yiren.

931
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,000
Don’t be angry.

932
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,200
Please.

933
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,360
Don’t be angry.

934
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Good for you, Gu Bo.

935
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,720
You lied to us for so long.

936
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,080
Does Xia Di know?

937
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,120
Don’t tell her.

938
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,440
Why?

939
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,520
Think about it.

940
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,560
If you tell her,

941
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
she will know

942
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,720
I’ve been lying to her.

943
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,960
She’ll be angry

944
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
and maybe she’ll break up with me.

945
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,760
Do you want that?

946
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,440
But she will know someday.

947
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,280
I know it.

948
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,040
The later, the better.

949
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,640
People pretend to be rich.

950
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,840
But you pretend to be poor.

951
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
I don’t understand.

952
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
I don’t have an option.

953
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,000
It’s hard to explain.

954
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,280
You said

955
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,320
you took me as the intern because of my dad,

956
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,640
was it true?

957
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,160
Yes.

958
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Fang Zhiyou knew it, huh?

959
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,360
Let me tell you the truth.

960
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,680
I’m not only his fan,

961
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,320
but also a shareholder of Square & Circle.

962
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Shareholder?

963
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,520
You...

964
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,200
Fang Zhiyou learnt to lie?

965
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,960
Don’t get him wrong.

966
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,160
You never asked, did you?

967
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,840
My fault?

968
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,160
Fine.

969
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,720
I can hide it from Xia Di for the moment.

970
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,440
But you must find a chance

971
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,520
to explain to her.

972
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,160
According to

973
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,880
my miserable experience,

974
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
trust me.

975
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,040
All lies will be exposed.

976
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Instead of being exposed,

977
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,120
why don’t you tell her the truth?

978
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,560
I believe

979
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
she doesn’t want the truth

980
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,720
from someone else.

981
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,760
I see. I see.

982
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Yiren.

983
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
Keep the secret for me!

984
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,080
Keep it!

985
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,200
Think carefully about it.

986
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, dear.

987
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,880
Your emails...

988
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,080
I’m going mad.

989
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,760
Look how many files

990
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
are on my desk.

991
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,440
Make way. Make way.

992
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,920
Chu Lin.

993
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,840
Chu Lin. Chu Lin.

994
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,000
I’m asking the second time, huh?

995
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,720
Is my claim form checked?

996
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,040
Look.

997
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Xiang Wei.

998
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,120
Ms. He used to help.

999
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,760
When she was around,

1000
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,200
no other colleagues

1001
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
dared to make things difficult for us.

1002
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,240
All right.

1003
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,040
I’ll wait.

1004
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,640
Okay.

1005
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,400
In fact,

1006
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,040
Ms. He asked me secretly about

1007
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,200
what was happening in our company.

1008
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,400
She still

1009
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,480
sounded proud.

1010
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,840
But I could feel

1011
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,520
she still cared for our company.

1012
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,680
As far as I know,

1013
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,440
another firm gave her

1014
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,520
a very good offer,

1015
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
hiring her as

1016
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,080
the Executive Director.

1017
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,240
But she rejected.

1018
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,040
It means,

1019
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,880
she still cares for our company.

1020
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,520
Anyway, she grew up with the company.

1021
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,200
Letting go of Mr. Fang,

1022
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,160
I don’t think

1023
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,160
Ms. He can let go of our company

1024
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,720
in a short time.

1025
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,920
I just wanted some coffee.

1026
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,240
Enjoy it.

1027
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,640
I feel so happy.

1028
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,160
Don’t spit it out.

1029
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,400
It’s the punishment

1030
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,600
for hiding Gu Bo’s identity from me.

1031
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,400
How much sugar did you put?

1032
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,120
I’ll see

1033
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,520
if you still dare to hide anything from me.

1034
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,600
Now I feel

1035
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,240
He Yuwen made a point.

1036
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,600
It’s too dangerous

1037
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
to have my girlfriend as my assistant.

1038
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,080
I have something to tell you.

1039
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,640
Go ahead.

1040
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,560
A lot of things are pending

1041
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
in the Administration Department.

1042
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
Colleagues are depressed.

1043
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,960
So,

1044
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,640
could we...

1045
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,400
You want Yuwen back?

1046
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,280
Not only me.

1047
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
All the other colleagues do.

1048
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Well,

1049
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,320
she made a mistake.

1050
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,000
But with her around,

1051
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,160
our department is like

1052
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,680
having some assurance.

1053
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,680
A company runs,

1054
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,120
no matter who has left.

1055
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,760
Even without me,

1056
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,560
Square & Circle

1057
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,760
won’t shut down, either.

1058
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I don’t agree.

1059
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Why?

1060
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,120
Maybe many other people

1061
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,640
can do this job.

1062
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But no one loves Square & Circle

1063
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,360
more than Ms. He does.

1064
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,240
She is

1065
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,680
a bit strict with us.

1066
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,680
Sometimes, some colleagues complain.

1067
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,800
But they all know that

1068
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,080
she does everything for our company.

1069
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,920
I know.

1070
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,760
You make some sense.

1071
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,040
But,

1072
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,920
she was going too far

1073
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,120
and she crossed the line.

1074
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,520
I didn’t expect you

1075
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
to agree immediately.

1076
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,240
But at least,

1077
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,360
think about it.

1078
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,200
Okay?

1079
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,480
