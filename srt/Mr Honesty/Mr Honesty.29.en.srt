20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Just stop.

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,960
Fang Zhiyou bought me this pair of shoes.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
How could you believe Yu Qing’s words?

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640
You shouldn’t have let her work there.

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Fang Zhiyou

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
just sat and watched you being bullied?

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,560
It’s my fault.

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
I lied to him first.

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Xu Yiren,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,240
why are you always

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
so tolerant towards others

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,240
but showing me

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,680
your sharp claws?

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,880
Can’t you scratch others with them?

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,440
I’m not.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
You aren’t?

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
You aren’t bullying me

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
or being bullied?

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
In the past,

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
I always escaped

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
from problems

41
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
because I didn’t want to start a fight.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,520
It’d be bad if I lost,

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,400
and even worse if I won.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
But this time is different.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,040
I insist on staying with him.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
So however they torture me,

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
or whatever Yu Qing does to me,

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I’m not afraid.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Because I know

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
nothing they do can hurt me.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
Only Fang Zhiyou

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
can hurt you, right?

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
This time,

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
I hurt him.

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Bullcrap!

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Fang Zhiyou

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
loves torturing himself

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,080
and everyone

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,320
around him.

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
If he’s really mad,

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
he can vent his anger on his father.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,120
How could he do this to you?

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,320
What’s wrong?

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
Can’t I even complain about him?

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
This is the first time

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,080
I’ve seen you talk like this.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,240
You made me.

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,600
What’s so good about him?

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Why are you still clinging on to him

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
under this circumstance?

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,600
It’s embarrassing, right?

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,520
I’m not sure

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,000
if my effort will pay off,

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,520
but I can’t leave without trying.

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,320
You’ll find someone iridescent in life.

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,000
Once you do, nothing else matters.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
I’ve found him,

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
and I can’t live without him.

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
If I say

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,760
I’ll forgive Fang Zhanyang

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,640
and bury the hatchet

82
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
with Fang Zhiyou

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,080
as long as you leave him for me,

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,200
will you do it?

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
You won’t.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
If one day,

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,160
you decide to let go of the past,

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
that’s because you want to,

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,280
not because of me.

90
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
What if it is?

91
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Don’t you always

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
want us to make up?

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Just say the word.

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
You know Fang Zhiyou

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
hates deception the most.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
You two are over.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,280
Am I that bad?

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
I can be a better boyfriend.

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,440
Li Zhe,

100
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
even if Fang Zhiyou and I are over,

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,360
I won’t be with you.

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,720
Why not?

103
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
Because other than him

104
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
and Xia Di,

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,320
you’re my closest friend.

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
All these years,

107
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,480
every time I was about to give up,

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
I’d think of that boy

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
and

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
the bird he weaved,

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
the fairy tale he told.

112
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
I hoped

113
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
one day,

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,960
I could meet him again.

115
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
I wish

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
I could meet you earlier.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually, I’ve considered

118
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,200
that possibility, too.

119
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Had we recognized

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
each other earlier,

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,280
would the three of us

122
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
have come to a different end?

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,760
No.

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
Because Fang Zhiyou

125
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
isn’t first-come-first-served,

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,120
or one of my choices.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
He’s the only love of my life.

128
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,400
I’m certain

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,680
he thinks the same.

130
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,520
So,

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
I’d never love you

132
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
the way I love him.

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
Have you ever considered

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
whether you fall in love with me

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,440
for who I am

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,960
or because I’m dating Fang Zhiyou

137
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,920
or because of that little girl in your memory?

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Apparently, being together with Fang Zhiyou

139
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,000
has sharpened your tongue.

140
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,320
You can just say no to me.

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,800
Spare those excuses.

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,760
Honestly, though,

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,800
to think carefully,

144
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,680
you’re different

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
from before.

146
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
You were cuter then.

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
But now...

148
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,640
What will you do?

149
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,520
Sticking around him isn’t a good idea.

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
If you set your mind on him,

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,800
you should figure out a way

152
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
to make him stay.

153
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,840
My lie

154
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,920
hurt him

155
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
and my best friend.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
Other than lingering around,

157
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,880
I don’t know what else I can do.

158
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,280
Beg me

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,680
and I will help you.

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
What’s wrong?

161
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Can’t Yu Qing even make your coffee right?

162
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
No.

163
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
I’m not used to

164
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,960
seeing her around.

165
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,560
So...

166
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
should I switch Xu Yiren

167
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,280
and Yu Qing back?

168
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
I’m surprised

169
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
that Xu Yiren and Li Zhe

170
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,400
are still seeing each other.

171
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,920
What’s wrong?

172
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760
You never

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,520
beat around the bush before.

174
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,600
Just cut to the chase.

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,520
I didn’t mean anything.

176
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,240
Why didn’t you say anything until that day?

177
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,440
I understand why Xu Yiren asked me that.

178
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,280
But you too?

179
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,520
I told you the truth.

180
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,640
Was I wrong?

181
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
You knew it a long time ago

182
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
but didn’t tell me until that exact moment.

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
Like Xu Yiren,

184
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
I tried to keep it from you,

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
but later, I changed my mind.

186
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
Satisfied?

187
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
What’s on your mind?

188
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,400
I swear

189
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,440
I didn’t mean to set her up.

190
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
She made every choice herself

191
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
since the beginning.

192
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
She chose to lie to you

193
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,800
while I broke the truth to you

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,880
in a less harmful way.

195
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,760
How was that wrong?

196
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,400
Don’t you always believe

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
the truth matters the most?

198
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,160
I hope you really mean

199
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
what you said.

200
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,560
Mr. Fang,

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
here are the minutes of today’s meeting

202
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,680
for you to review.

203
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,640
Your minutes

204
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
are filled with misspelled words.

205
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
The jargon is all wrong.

206
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
Key points are either missing or incorrect.

207
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
Can you do your job?

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,160
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

209
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
- I’ll... - Don’t bother.

210
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Let Xu...

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,320
Sha Sha.

212
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,720
Mr. Fang.

213
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,640
Redo it.

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Yes.

215
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
Let me do it.

216
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,360
Sha Sha wasn’t in the meeting earlier.

217
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,520
Neither were you.

218
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
I can ask Sun Ziyang and Xiang Wei.

219
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,640
So can she.

220
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
I can’t.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,320
Communicating with the Design Department

222
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,880
is always Xu Yiren’s job.

223
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440
I can’t do that.

224
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,960
Please help me,

225
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,560
Yiren.

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,160
I got it.

227
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,040
Mr. Fang.

228
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,600
Can we have a word?

229
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,960
It’s about work.

230
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Come to my office.

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
Put it on my table, please.

232
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,680
What is it?

233
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
Li Zhe

234
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
would like to see you

235
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
to discuss Zhiwu Library.

236
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
When did he tell you that?

237
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,440
Just now,

238
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,040
we...

239
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,200
Yu Qing asked you to pick up lunch

240
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
but you went to see him.

241
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,400
If you’re unsatisfied with your job,

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
you can quit.

243
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,440
As long as you’re here,

244
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,880
you should do your job well.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
Li Zhe said

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,320
he’d take care of your lunch.

247
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,920
I’m sorry.

248
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
That was your job.

249
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did you give it to him?

250
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,280
Fang Zhiyou,

251
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,920
hear me out.

252
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,000
We’re at work.

253
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Mr. Fang,

254
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,800
actually...

255
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
Save it.

256
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,240
Whatever you say

257
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,760
isn’t all true.

258
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,680
You may leave.

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
If you aren’t afraid of being damned,

260
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
just kill me with the door.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,600
Close it.

262
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,520
I know you don’t want to see me.

263
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,440
You didn’t answer my calls or WeChat messages.

264
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,640
You thought I couldn’t find you

265
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,920
by hiding here?

266
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
I called

267
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,680
your editor.

268
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
She told me the address.

269
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,160
And here I am!

270
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,640
Mom,

271
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,920
can you leave me alone, please?

272
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Sure.

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,040
Once you and Gu Bo are back together,

274
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,880
I’ll disappear immediately.

275
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,640
No way in hell!

276
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,800
What’s wrong with you?

277
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,880
When I forbade you from seeing him,

278
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,200
you refused to leave him.

279
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,280
But now...

280
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Now, you know his family is loaded,

281
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
he’s a rich brat,

282
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,360
you can’t wait to marry me to him.

283
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
If you like rich men, you can marry him yourself.

284
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
What did you say?

285
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,360
What about your father?

286
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,520
Was I wrong?

287
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
I’m your daughter.

288
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,360
Why did you say that in front of everyone?

289
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,280
To make them think I’m a gold-digger?

290
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,880
No,

291
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,360
so many people were there.

292
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,560
I was anxious.

293
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,440
I didn’t mean to humiliate you.

294
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,440
Al... Alright.

295
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,880
I apologize.

296
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,040
I’m sorry, OK?

297
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
No need.

298
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
Alright. Enough.

299
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
I did say

300
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,360
I wanted you to marry a rich,

301
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,000
no, no,

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,480
a reliable and trustworthy man,

303
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,800
didn’t I?

304
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
And promising, too.

305
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,080
Because I didn’t want you to suffer.

306
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,760
You think I like Gu Bo

307
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,480
just because he has money?

308
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,000
Of course not.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
He also owns hotels.

310
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,160
Silly.

311
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
I can tell

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
he loves you wholeheartedly

313
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,720
and he’ll always take care of you.

314
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,480
How do you know that?

315
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Of course I do.

316
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,120
You know why

317
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,280
I married your father

318
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,360
who was the least attractive among my suitors?

319
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
He and Gu Bo

320
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,600
are of the same kind.

321
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,720
They see you as the apple of the eye,

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,840
the jewel on the crown.

323
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,240
You mean the most to them.

324
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
He’s nowhere near my dad.

325
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,480
My dad has never lied to you.

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,960
Don’t judge a book by its cover.

327
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
Look at what he did behind your back.

328
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
You know

329
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
how he got those books for you?

330
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,200
He bought them.

331
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,680
He checked every bookstore

332
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,880
and collected them one by one.

333
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,880
He didn’t have to do that.

334
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
He could have made a call

335
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
and others would’ve done it for him,

336
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,680
right?

337
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
But why he insisted on doing it himself?

338
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,880
I laughed at him but he said,

339
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,880
“Mrs. Xia,

340
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,920
how could I let others do

341
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,960
what will make Xia Di happy?”

342
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,240
You hear that?

343
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
Xia Di,

344
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,840
stop being mad at him.

345
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Think about it.

346
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
He didn’t tell you he’s rich

347
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,040
for a reason,

348
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,680
right?

349
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
At least, give him a chance to defend himself

350
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
before sentencing him to death.

351
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,200
Besides,

352
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,880
you met him way before me.

353
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,800
You know how well

354
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,600
he treats you, don’t you?

355
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,640
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

356
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
I’m surprised you asked to see me.

357
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,280
How did that meal taste?

358
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,440
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

359
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
After consideration,

360
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,160
I can work with you on Zhiwu Library

361
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
on one condition.

362
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
Fire Xu Yiren.

363
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,720
Not gonna happen.

364
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,680
Why?

365
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,640
Don’t you hate her

366
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,880
as much as you hate your father?

367
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,360
Or was I wrong

368
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
that all these years,

369
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,720
you’ve never hated him because of me?

370
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,080
You can do anything to me

371
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
but stay away from her.

372
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I thought you’re here to seek cooperation.

373
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,080
I know

374
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,800
you’d never cooperate with me.

375
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
You asked to see me

376
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,880
simply to take revenge for her.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,080
Why did you still come?

378
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
I can’t forgive her

379
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,680
but I hate myself more

380
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
For being unable to do that.

381
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,760
You finally realize how obnoxious you are.

382
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Listen,

383
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,080
I’m here to tell you

384
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
I like Xu Yiren

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
with no strings attached.

386
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,200
If you continue to torture her,

387
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,920
just let her go.

388
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,080
Maybe I’m a better match for her.

389
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,040
I won’t.

390
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,200
Why?

391
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,040
You’re sick

392
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,320
of your toy and you’d rather throw it away

393
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,560
than give it to others?

394
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
She isn’t a toy.

395
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
She’s the only love of my life.

396
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,520
If so,

397
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,840
how could you watch her

398
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
being bullied by Yu Qing?

399
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,120
Your love is damaging.

400
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,600
I told you

401
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,840
I’d take everything from you,

402
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
but now, I’ve changed my mind.

403
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
All I want is Xu Yiren.

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,760
Just wait and see.

405
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,240

522
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,200
Xia Di,

523
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,240
it’s been a week

524
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,840
since I last heard from you.

525
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,840
I feel like I’m dying!

526
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
Xia Di,

527
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
what will make you forgive me?

528
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,600
If you don’t answer me,

529
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,640
I’ll kill myself.

530
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,720
I’m serious.

531
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,220
= Gu Bo =

532
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,840
Xia Di,

533
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,280
I’m so glad you called.

534
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,640
We need to talk.

535
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,200
OK, no problem.

536
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,360
Anything you like.

537
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,960
Where are you?

538
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
Rende Hospital.

539
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,640
Hospital?

540
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
I’m on my way.

541
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
Hello? Hello? Xia Di...

542
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Yiren,

543
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,960
this is all they have in the store downstairs.

544
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,480
Have some water.

545
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,800
Mr. Fang,

546
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,880
you need to eat something.

547
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,560
Sir,

548
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
have some water.

549
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
It’s been over an hour.

550
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,120
Why isn’t he out yet?

551
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
He’ll be fine.

552
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,200
Of course.

553
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
Nothing will happen to my idol.

554
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
My words never go wrong.

555
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,840
Where’s Li Zhe?

556
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,200
He went to the police station to give a statement.

557
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
- Doctor! - Doctor!

558
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,240
How is he?

559
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,600
How’s my son?

560
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
His head

561
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,760
is badly injured

562
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
but luckily,

563
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,120
his brain is fine.

564
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,120
He only has a minor concussion.

565
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,920
Once he wakes up,

566
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
he’ll probably

567
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,800
feel dizzy,

568
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
sick and his ears ringing.

569
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,840
As for now,

570
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,000
all his other injuries

571
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,480
have been treated.

572
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Thanks.

573
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,160
But

574
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
his right forearm is broken.

575
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,360
It takes time

576
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,080
for that fracture to heal.

577
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,640
Fracture?

578
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,760
My son is a designer.

579
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,520
Mr. Fang,

580
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,040
at least, he’s safe.

581
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,360
He needs to be hospitalized.

582
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,960
- Thank you, doctor. - Thank you.

583
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,160
He’s fine.

584
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,960
Hello.

585
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,320
Xia Di?

586
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
Where are you?

587
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Hold on.

588
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,520
You aren’t dead?

589
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,440
You want me to be?

590
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,160
Didn’t you kill yourself?

591
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,560
Who told you that?

592
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
You’re nuts!

593
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,160
What’s up?

594
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,360
Why did you ask me to come to the hospital?

595
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,440
Fang Zhiyou is injured.

596
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
So,

597
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
you read my WeChat messages

598
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
and thought I’d kill myself,

599
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,280
so you rode over the speed limit for me.

600
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,000
Pay the fine for speeding.

601
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,280
Sure, sure, sure. I’ll pay.

602
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,200
By the way,

603
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,160
didn’t I tell you

604
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,400
not to ride too fast?

605
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Why didn’t you listen?

606
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,440
The traffic is busy.

607
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,920
What if something happens to you?

608
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
Let me see.

609
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,600
Let me check.

610
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,040
Did you get hurt?

611
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
You wouldn’t notice that yourself.

612
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,240
Your arm looks fine.

613
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
I shouldn’t have listened to you

614
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
but your mom

615
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,480
to take the key back.

616
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
Gu Bo,

617
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,680
what do you like about me?

618
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,560
You should ask me

619
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,920
what I don’t like about you.

620
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,160
What don’t you like about me?

621
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,680
I don’t like your excessive kindness.

622
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,640
You do everything for others.

623
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,080
Soon after you met me,

624
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,680
you bought me food and clothes.

625
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,760
You know what?

626
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
You should be a princess

627
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,600
that others take care of.

628
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,160
I don’t like you staying up all night to draw.

629
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
However much

630
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
your fans and editor rush you,

631
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,080
your health still comes first.

632
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,240
I don’t like you

633
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,000
always trying to lose weight.

634
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,520
Listen,

635
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,160
if anyone calls you fat again,

636
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,520
I’ll pummel him or her.

637
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
Also,

638
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
I don’t like...

639
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,880
I don’t like you

640
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,320
always treating me as a kid.

641
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,840
I’m only a few years younger than you

642
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,120
but I know

643
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,000
how to love a girl

644
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
and make her happy.

645
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,680
I want to make you happy.

646
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,720
Besides, I don’t...

647
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,880
♪ My love for you is like marshmallow ♪

648
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,690
♪ Don’t suspect my belief ♪

649
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,810
♪ No one can take you away ♪

650
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,620
♪ Don’t leave me ♪

651
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,160
Son,

652
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,920
I’m so sorry.

653
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,040
Hadn’t it for me,

654
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,040
you wouldn’t have felt guilt-ridden

655
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,840
about what happened to Li Zhe

656
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,480
and you wouldn’t have become like this.

657
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,400
Fang Zhiyou did what he did

658
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
not because he felt guilty

659
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,960
but he still takes Li Zhe

660
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,360
as his best friend.

661
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
You think he only feels guilty?

662
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
Actually,

663
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,880
he’s rather sad than guilty

664
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,520
about losing his friend

665
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,560
who got him out of his small world

666
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,720
and made his life colorful.

667
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,280
No one could replace him.

668
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,640
You probably don’t know

669
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,720
why he can’t let go of the past, do you?

670
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,480
That’s because Li Zhe

671
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,640
filled in for you and gave him company and warmth.

672
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,840
When Zhiyou was little,

673
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,400
I just started

674
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,360
my law firm.

675
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,920
I was so busy.

676
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,040
that I always came home

677
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,520
once in a few days.

678
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I thought

679
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,440
once my firm was on the right track,

680
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,040
I could spend more time

681
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,760
with my wife and son.

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,160
Next thing I knew,

683
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,640
my wife passed away

684
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,000
and my son became too old

685
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
to need my company.

686
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
It’s not that he didn’t need it.

687
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,440
You disappointed him so many times

688
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,280
that he just gave up hope.

689
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,400
I’m sorry.

690
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,800
I’m really sorry, son.

691
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,280
It’s all my fault.

692
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
It’s not too late

693
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,360
to make it up to him.

694
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,360
Even when he was bleeding,

695
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
the only thing he could think of

696
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,280
was to have you

697
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,480
apologize to Li Zhe and his family

698
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,880
to make up for the past.

699
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,960
Dad,

700
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
my brother is fine.

701
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Don’t worry too much.

702
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,480
After looking at all these photos,

703
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
I realize all these years,

704
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,920
your brother and I

705
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,280
haven’t even taken one photo together.

706
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,160
Dad,

707
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
I don’t need a big house.

708
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
I can go to school by bus.

709
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
I don’t need new clothes

710
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,720
or toys.

711
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,560
I can give them all up

712
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,520
as long as we can be together as a family.

713
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
I know.

714
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,720
I know what to do.

715
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,440
Don’t cry.

716
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,200
There, there.

717
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,360
You must be tired.

718
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,920
Get some sleep,

719
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,040
but don’t sleep late,

720
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,200
or I’ll get worried.

721
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,280
The doctor said his anesthetic is wearing off,

722
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,920
but due to the concussion,

723
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,600
he won’t wake up too soon.

724
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Don’t worry.

725
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,360
You’re worrying the most

726
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,440
and still comforting me.

727
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
You must feel guilty.

728
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,160
I didn’t ask for his help.

729
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,720
I told him to leave but he refused to.

730
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,240
Why should I feel guilty?

731
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
I’m glad you know that.

732
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,160
I’m sure he does, too.

733
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
He’ll soon wake up.

734
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,880
Is it serious?

735
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,360
He has a fracture.

736
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,240
The doctor said

737
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,160
he can still draw after it heals.

738
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
Those bandits!

739
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,680
What did the police do?

740
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,680
They’ve arrested Xie Dongren and his men.

741
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,280
They said

742
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,120
they had received the call

743
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
20 minutes ago.

744
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
Fang Zhiyou must have

745
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,320
called them beforehand.

746
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That idiot!

747
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,880
He already made the call.

748
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,560
Why did he still stay?

749
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,040
Had you been him,

750
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,760
would you’ve left him there alone?

751
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,480
Yeah.

752
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,120
Stop lying.

753
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,680
You sound

754
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,760
more and more like him.

755
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,360
You’re awake!

756
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,960
How do you feel?

757
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
Do you feel any better?

758
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
The doctor said you have a concussion

759
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,440
and you’ll feel dizzy and sick.

760
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
But don’t worry.

761
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,040
You will be fine.

762
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,480
Can you hear me?

763
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,920
Is your brain damaged?

764
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,640
Fang Zhiyou,

765
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
I’ll go get the doctor.

766
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,800
Don’t panic.

767
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,320
He’s good.

768
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,120
Mr. Fang,

769
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,040
he’s awake.

770
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,120
Zhiyou.

771
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,120
Zhiyou,

772
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,680
I’m here.

773
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,520
If there’s nothing else, I’m off.

774
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,680
Hold on.

775
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,600
