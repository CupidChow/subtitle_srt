Being in a relationship is hard.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
I know.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Yiren.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Yiren,

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
I mean,

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
I can make more money,

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,720
build my body,

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,600
put on height increase insoles to look taller.

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,640
But what about my age?

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,520
I can’t go back and argue with my mom

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,240
and ask her

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,240
why she didn’t give birth to me earlier?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
You’re younger than her,

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
so you have more time to woo her.

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,120
My trouble is bigger.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,240
Fang Zhiyou caught me lying again.

36
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,360
He totally ignores me now.

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
What were you thinking?

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
You knew

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
that was his sore spot

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
yet you keep stepping on it.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,920
You suck at being a girlfriend.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
But I saw

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
the look you were giving me.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320
You were drooling over him.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,320
I wasn’t!

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,160
We’re having a meeting.

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,920
Let’s go.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,920
I’m all alone

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,160
and stuck with work.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Design of the main structure of Moon Bay

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
has been settled.

52
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,480
Next, I’ll be focusing on

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
screening construction companies.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
I’ll entrust the rest of the work

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
to Mr. Liu.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,920
Thank you.

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,480
I got it.

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Consider it done.

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Look.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,600
Check this page.

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
And this one.

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,160
Control yourself, please.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Or your eyeballs will pop out.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
Yours will pop out.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,080
I’m not you.

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,440
Look at yourself in the mirror.

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Are there only two holes left?

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Guys,

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Xiang Wei just came up

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,640
with something new.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,960
It’s creative.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,080
I’ll send it to our chat group

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,200
for you to have a look.

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,840
Stop it, Xu Yiren.

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,920
Focus on the meeting.

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,200
Or, others will find out

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,040
you and Mr. Fang are seeing each other secretly.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

79
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,680
Uh...

80
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
I... I...

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Gu...

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
One more thing.

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,640
Xu Yiren is my girlfriend.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
We’ve been together for a while.

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
Not now.

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,440
That’s all

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,080
for today’s meeting.

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,680
What’s going on?

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,760
They’re dating secretly?

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,440
What do you know?

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
When did they start?

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,000
What’s happening?

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Good job!

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,760
Oh, no!

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,000
The whole company knows it.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
What should we do?

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Why are you staring at me?

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Do something!

99
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,240
I’ll ask Gu Bo

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,960
to tell others that he was joking.

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
You...

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
lost a bet,

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
so you had to play along with him.

104
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,280
He always jokes around.

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,320
Others will buy it.

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,480
I’m going to see him now.

107
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
You tell lies

108
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
and you’re teaching Gu Bo to do the same?

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,040
I’m your boyfriend.

110
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Are you ashamed of me?

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
No.

112
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
Then why you refused to tell others

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
that we’re in a relationship?

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
You’ve been avoiding and denying it

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
in front of your family and coworkers.

116
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,040
Is it so hard

117
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,240
to say the word?

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
No.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,360
I...

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,000
Without today’s incident,

121
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
when do you plan to tell them?

122
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,520
I...

123
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,480
I don’t know.

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
No.

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,920
I should ask you

126
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
if you’ll ever

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
tell others that Fang Zhiyou

128
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
is your boyfriend.

129
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,440
Didn’t we agree

130
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,080
to keep it low in the office?

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
Did you see that?

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
See?

133
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,800
That’s probably how celebrities

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,960
make their relationships public.

135
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
I wonder

136
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
how Yiren

137
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,840
hooked up with Mr. Fang.

138
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Ms. He tried for years

139
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,040
but she didn’t...

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
She’s

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
sophisticated in love.

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
She has skills.

143
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
Maybe next,

144
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
she’ll

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
get pregnant in order to be Mrs. Fang.

146
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,040
That’s absurd.

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
Yiren isn’t that kind of person.

148
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
You know her well?

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,880
As close as you’re to her,

150
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
she didn’t tell you about her relationship.

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,520
She’s good!

152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I never thought

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,960
Yiren would be

154
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,360
so capable than she seems.

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,960
You...

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Yiren,

157
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,080
he...

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,640
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Ms. He.

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,800
You’re chatting at work.

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,720
Are you all free?

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
Do you still want your paycheck?

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
We’re going back to work.

164
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,000
Good job!

165
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,520
Yiren,

166
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,800
don’t take Luo Yang’s words to heart.

167
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
He didn’t mean that.

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,920
You know he blabbers a lot.

169
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
I support you and Mr. Fang.

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Go get him, girl!

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,040
Let’s talk.

172
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,680
Name your price.

173
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,280
Pardon?

174
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,640
What can make you leave Fang Zhiyou?

175
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,400
I can meet your needs.

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
I don’t need anything.

177
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
I only want to be with him.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,400
Ms. He,

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,560
you gave me the chance

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
to work at Square & Circle

181
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,440
and you’ve been nice to me.

182
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
I know that

183
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
and I’ll always remember it.

184
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
I also know

185
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
your feelings for Mr. Fang...

186
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,000
How I feel about him

187
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
is none of your business.

188
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,760
All you need to know is

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
if this relationship continues,

190
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,360
it won’t benefit him at all.

191
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
I don’t get it.

192
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,720
I’ve sensed it clearly

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
that he isn’t as decisive as before.

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,080
He’s been hesitant and tentative.

195
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
I remember

196
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,400
you hired me

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
to work as a liaison

198
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,280
between Mr. Fang

199
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
and others

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
to make up for his deficiency.

201
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
Now, you’re calling him

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
hesitant

203
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,880
because

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
he can take

205
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
others’ feelings

206
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,520
into account.

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,560
Even clients said

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
they could communicate with him

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,760
like they did with others.

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
I don’t understand.

211
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,600
How is that change bad?

212
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
He doesn’t need to change.

213
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,680
You don’t know him at all.

214
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,720
Were he like others,

215
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,280
he wouldn’t be himself.

216
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
Hand in your resignation.

217
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
I’ll write you a recommendation letter.

218
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,160
You’ll be able to

219
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
get a better job.

220
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
But I won’t be able to see him again, right?

221
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,120
Xu Yiren,

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,680
you should know

223
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,760
that’s your best choice.

224
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
If you insist on staying,

225
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
I can still make you leave.

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Sorry, Ms. He,

227
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
unless Fang Zhiyou fires me,

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
I won’t leave.

229
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,720
Don’t come out until you finish ten laps.

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,120
Yiren,

231
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
what are you guys doing?

232
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Why are you torturing each other for nothing?

233
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
Your problem is lack of communication.

234
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
Just speak out your mind.

235
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
He’s of a different species.

236
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
He has no idea what you’re thinking.

237
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
Why are you held back

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
by the unknown future?

239
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,400
You’re advancing the suffering.

240
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,920
In terms of a relationship,

241
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,960
honesty is the key.

242
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Carpe Diem!

243
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
Understand?

244
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
What are you doing?

245
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,640
You just did one lap.

246
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,320
Get down.

247
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,440
Princess,

248
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,280
let me out.

249
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,560
No way.

250
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
You made the relationship

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,760
between Yiren and Fang Zhiyou public.

252
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,600
You must be punished.

253
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,560
I’ve been in guilt for a whole day

254
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
without eating anything.

255
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,280
I’m drained.

256
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
Ten laps would kill me.

257
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,360
Yiren,

258
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I’m so sorry.

259
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,840
It’s my fault.

260
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
I promise

261
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
from tomorrow on,

262
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,560
I’ll do anything for you

263
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,200
for a month.

264
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,360
Please let me out.

265
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,320
Let him out.

266
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,280
He’s had enough.

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
No.

268
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,040
I dare you!

269
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,640
Fang Zhiyou didn’t say anything wrong, though.

270
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,800
Think about it.

271
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,960
He isn’t an embarrassment.

272
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,320
Why couldn’t you

273
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,720
acknowledge your relationship?

274
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,680
If it were me,

275
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,000
I’d be mad, too.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,320
You can dream on.

277
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
Without you,

278
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
there wouldn’t have been such a mess.

279
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I said I’m sorry.

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
Well,

282
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
my mistake aside,

283
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
you can’t keep hiding your relationship

284
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
from everyone.

285
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,160
Had you men

286
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
made women feel secure enough,

287
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,520
Yiren wouldn’t have done that.

288
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Ask your boss

289
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,080
to reflect on himself, too.

290
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
Men can also feel insecure.

291
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Look,

292
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,000
today, Mr. Fang

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
announced his relationship with Yiren

294
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,320
in front of the entire staffs.

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
He was manly and aboveboard.

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,520
Were I a girl,

297
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,080
I’d marry him instantly.

298
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
You can marry him now.

299
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
Get on a plane and go abroad

300
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
right now.

301
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
I can’t.

302
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,640
I can’t steal my friend’s man.

303
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
I have principles.

304
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
Get down.

305
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,400
You know, I might have done you a favor.

306
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,880
You see,

307
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,000
everyone knows

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Fang Zhiyou

309
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
has been taken by Xu Yiren.

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,760
In this case,

311
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
no one dares

312
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
to seduce him again.

313
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
I’ve saved you so much trouble.

314
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
I’d appreciate if you stop causing me trouble.

315
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,120
From now on,

316
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,960
just stay out of our business.

317
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,360
Thank you.

318
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,880
Xu Yiren,

319
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,840
Gu Bo meant well.

320
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,760
Fang Zhiyou annoyed you.

321
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,240
Don’t vent your anger on others.

322
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
Didn’t you

323
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,640
ask him to finish ten laps?

324
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,240
I only said a few words and you’re mad already?

325
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
Anyway,

326
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
only I can yell at Gu Bo.

327
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
Others can’t.

328
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,320
Princess talked back to Yiren for me?

329
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
Unbelievable!

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
I have nine laps.

331
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Nine laps.

332
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,840
I sounded like an alpha male in the chick flick.

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,680
What happened to me?

334
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,520
Shiyu, it’s me.

335
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
Can you do me a favor?

336
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,100
= Xu Yiren. Are you coming back? =

337
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,220
= Xu Yiren Do you need a ride? =

338
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
Have a seat.

339
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,680
You must have drunk a lot.

340
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,920
Let me pour you a cup of tea.

341
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,680
No, thanks.

342
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,760
I’m here to ask you a question.

343
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Shoot.

344
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,840
If I’m asking you

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
to choose between me and Xu Yiren,

346
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
who’ll you choose?

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,960
Why do I have to?

348
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,000
Because I love you.

349
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,280
Zhiyou,

350
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,400
I’ve been with you for so long.

351
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,440
Whatever you do,

352
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,880
I give you my full support.

353
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
I even fell out with my father

354
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,680
for you.

355
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,040
If it were others,

356
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,120
they’d have figured it out long ago.

357
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,200
But I know you.

358
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,160
You aren’t sensitive to others’ feelings.

359
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,440
I thought

360
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,640
I could wait

361
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
until you realize my love,

362
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
but I didn’t expect

363
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,200
you’d fall for Xu Yiren.

364
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
You’re drunk.

365
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
I’m not.

366
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,640
I know what I’m doing.

367
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,560
Zhiyou,

368
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,760
tell me,

369
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,120
do you know how I feel about you or not?

370
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,320
I’ve always regarded you as my best friend.

371
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,000
I’ve never considered other possibilities.

372
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,360
Of course not,

373
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,960
because you’ve never truly cared about me.

374
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,680
You’ve never considered

375
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
my feelings.

376
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,640
Yuwen...

377
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Zhiyou,

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,760
now that you know,

379
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,520
is there anything you’d like to say?

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
If anything I did or said

381
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,520
misled you,

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,040
I apologize for that.

383
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,920
I don’t need your apology.

384
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,320
Tell me,

385
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,120
will you choose me or Xu Yiren?

386
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
Xu Yiren is my girlfriend.

387
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
That’s all

388
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,120
I want to say.

389
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,640
I don’t believe it.

390
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,120
What’s so good about her?

391
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,600
Why can’t you be with me?

392
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,520
I know I’m insensitive,

393
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,800
but whether she’s good or not

394
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,520
isn’t up to others

395
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,240
but me.

396
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,120
She’s merely

397
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,000
a menial assistant,

398
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Fang Zhiyou!

399
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,960
Yuwen,

400
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
I’ve always seen you

401
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,240
as my friend

402
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,720
and partner at work.

403
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,960
I don’t want you to insult her

404
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,400
in front of me.

405
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,440
Or, I may

406
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,320
say things that I shouldn’t.

407
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,760
So

408
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,720
you’ll abandon me

409
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,600
for her?

410
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
Is that so?

411
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,280
I appreciate your help

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
and the company needs you,

413
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,840
but

414
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,080
if you aren’t happy

415
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,760
working here,

416
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,840
I respect your decision.

417
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
As for your shares,

418
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
you can cash them in or hold them.

419
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,280
It’s up to you.

420
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
I see how much

421
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
I mean to you.

422
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Mission accomplished.

423
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,080
I’ve driven my brother away.

424
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
You can go get your things.

425
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,720
Thank you,

426
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,480
Shiyu.

427
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,720
Zhiyou,

428
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
what about this pair?

429
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,920
Chic and elegant.

430
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,160
They suit you.

431
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,880
Alright.

432
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,800
I’ll take them.

433
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
Check, please.

434
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Let me.

435
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,800
Today is your birthday.

436
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
Take them as your present.

437
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,680
Thank you.

438
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,080
Miss,

439
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,200
your boyfriend is so hot.

440
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
He isn’t my boyfriend.

441
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,880
How come?

442
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,880
Well,

443
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,760
it’s just a matter of time.

444
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,560
Really?

445
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,200
Yeah.

446
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,080
Thanks.

447
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
If

448
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,400
anything I did or said misled you,

449
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
I apologize for that.

450
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
I’ve always seen you

451
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
as my friend

452
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
and partner at work.

453
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,200
I don’t want you to insult her

454
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,480
in front of me.

455
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,200
Or, I may

456
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,240
say things that I shouldn’t.

457
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,720
If you aren’t happy

458
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
working here,

459
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,280
I respect your decision.

460
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,320
Does your previous proposal

461
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
still stand?

462
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Where are you going?

463
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
I thought you were out.

464
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,080
Yiren is coming back to pick up her things.

465
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
I told her you went out.

466
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,320
Sweet talk her and get her back.

467
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,880
If you grow old alone,

468
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,360
don’t blame me for not helping you.

469
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Mr. Fang,

470
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,200
this is your last chance.

471
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
Hell,

472
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,400
Fang Shiyu lied to me again.

473
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Her brother loathes liars

474
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,120
but she can lie through her teeth

475
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
without hesitation.

476
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,440
You don’t want to see me at all?

477
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,120
We need to give each other some space.

478
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,040
I don’t want to argue with you again.

479
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,840
I’ll be staying at Xia Di’s temporarily.

480
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,720
Once I have my own apartment,

481
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,840
I’ll move out.

482
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,280
To where?

483
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
I don’t know.

484
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,720
I’ll see.

485
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
Are you going to ask Li Zhe for help again

486
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
or simply moving to his neighborhood

487
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,520
to return his favor?

488
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,840
I don’t want to

489
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
start another fight.

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,800
Don’t go.

491
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,480
I won’t let you go.

492
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,520
Let me go!

493
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,480
I won’t.

494
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,360
What do you want?

495
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,480
I have no idea.

496
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,680
But if I let you leave,

497
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,240
I’ll feel worse.

498
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,520
Just speak out your mind.

499
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
He’s of a different species.

500
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
He has no idea what you’re thinking.

501
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
Why are you held back

502
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,440
by the unknown future?

503
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,520
You’re advancing the suffering.

504
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,720
In terms of a relationship,

505
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
honesty is the key.

506
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
Carpe Diem!

507
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,840
Men can also feel insecure.

508
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,240
Let go of me.

509
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,920
I’m not leaving.

510
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,640
I’m sorry.

511
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,640
I didn’t mean to keep it from my uncle

512
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,920
that we’re dating

513
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
or hide you

514
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,600
from my family.

515
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,040
But I’m scared.

516
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,520
From being cheated on by Gao Ming to unemployed,

517
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,520
from joining Square & Circle to knowing you

518
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,160
and falling in love with you,

519
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,000
all that feels like a dream.

520
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,640
I always wonder

521
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,360
what you see in me.

522
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,240
I don’t see a future with us together.

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,760
I’m not even sure

524
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
if you still love me tomorrow.

525
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,800
The bigger the hope,

526
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,920
the heavier the blow.

527
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,560
We’re the same.

528
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Same how?

529
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,120
Our insecurity is the same.

530
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,000
I’m also afraid you don’t love me

531
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
or you’ll leave me.

532
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
I even pictured in my head

533
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,480
if one day,

534
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,120
you weren’t with me.

535
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,560
Turns out,

536
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
I couldn’t live without you.

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,480
I’m used to

538
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,680
seeing you being stern.

539
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
This side of you attracts me even more.

540
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,840
We’re the same.

541
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,000
Of course we are.

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,760
Yiren,

543
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,760
I want you to know

544
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,960
that I’m also imperfect.

545
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,360
You said

546
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,560
I have tons of flaws.

547
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
You’ve been tolerating me.

548
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,400
Neither of us is perfect

549
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,040
but we’re trying to be better

550
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,320
for each other.

551
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,680
I’m inexperienced in love.

552
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
All I can give you

553
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,120
is a real me

554
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,920
who love you wholeheartedly.

555
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,040
Can you show me your other side?

556
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,840
Yes.

557
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,880
I’m good now.

558
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,680
Let me savor this moment.

559
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
Are you still mad at me?

560
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,240
I wasn’t mad at you.

561
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,960
I was just sad.

562
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,360
Are you still mad at me?

563
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
I wasn’t mad at you, either.

564
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,620
= Library =

565
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,640
Are you looking for this?

566
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,200
That day,

567
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,680
I flipped out

568
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,280
and lost control of myself.

569
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
I said a lot including things

570
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,160
I shouldn’t have said.

571
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
Well, since they were all out,

572
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,440
I feel much better.

573
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,800
Don’t worry.

574
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,840
I know love can’t be forced

575
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
and I respect your decision.

576
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,040
I just hope this matter

577
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
won’t affect our...

578
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
our...

579
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,160
friendship.

580
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,680
You bet.

581
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,240
That’s also what I think.

582
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,320
Looking back,

583
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,040
forcing you to choose

584
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,200
between me and Xu Yiren

585
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
is silly.

586
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,320
I admit

587
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,320
I’m jealous of her

588
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,360
because she did what I couldn’t.

589
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,960
She changed you.

590
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,120
Don’t compare yourself with her.

591
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,800
I know.

592
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,000
She has her strengths

593
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
and I have mine.

594
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
From now on,

595
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,360
I’ll devote myself

596
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,600
to work.

597
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,520
I’ve been at Square & Circle for so long

598
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,720
that I’m attached to it.

599
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,680
I can’t abandon it.

600
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,600
Zhiyou,

601
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,480
give it your all.

602
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
I’m waiting for you

603
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,080
to realize our dream

604
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,560
to make Square & Circle

605
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,440
the best design company in China.

606
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
I’m glad

607
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,560
you’ve come round.

608
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,600
Honestly,

609
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,000
the company and I need you.

610
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
After all, you aren’t just my best friend.

611
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,240
You and I make a great team.

612
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,640
I know.

613
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,480
= Scholars’ Former Residences I Drew =

614
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
Or,

615
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,480
how did I beat you

616
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,680
to find what you need first?

617
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,480
Are you choosing a construction company

618
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
for the Moon Bay Project?

619
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,640
Yes.

620
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,560
It’s a complicated project.

621
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
Ordinary companies

622
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
don’t meet our requirements.

623
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
We should choose our partner carefully.

624
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,080
I agree.

625
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,480
How about

626
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
we call for bids for Moon Bay

627
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,680
on a small scale?

628
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
My idea is the same.

629
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,680
That’s why

630
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,920
it’s better for us

631
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
to be partners at work.

632
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
An open bid is doable.

633
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,360
We can make full use of it

634
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,920
to pick the best company.

635
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,880
So far, Jitong and Hongtu

636
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
are the most suitable ones.

637
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,720
Please send them invitations.

638
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,120
I will.

639
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,720
I’ll work on the invitation.

640
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,880
I want Xu Yiren to assist me with the preparation.

641
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Are you cool with it?

642
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,160
Of course.

643
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,440
That’s her job.

644
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,840
You don’t need to check with me.

645
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,280
Let’s go over the process now.

646
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,080
I can’t.

647
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
I have a date with Yiren.

648
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,320
I forgot

649
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
you’re in a relationship,

650
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,280
unlike singles

651
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,600
who can work overtime.

652
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,240
It’s still the weekend.

653
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,520
Relax yourself.

654
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,600
Work can wait till Monday

655
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,040
Sure. See you.

656
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,760
See you.

657
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,280
That brat!

658
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,280
Is that not him?

659
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,560
Xia Di.

660
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
Hey,

661
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,400
where are you?

662
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,240
I’m at work.

663
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,000
What’s up?

664
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Did you see the sketch

665
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,320
I weeded out last time?

666
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,840
It’s in your TV stand.

667
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,360
In the TV stand?

668
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,160
Alright. I’ll check again.

669
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,560
Go back to work. Bye.

670
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,240
Bye.

671
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,520
Weird.

672
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,680
Am I

673
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,160
hallucinating?

674
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,440
Maybe I worked too hard to meet the deadline.

675
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,880
Gotta catch up on sleep.

676
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,160
I don’t want to die.

677
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,640
It’s breathtaking!

678
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,640
So comfy!

679
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,400
Why...

680
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,040
Why are you laughing?

681
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,400
Where are we?

682
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,720
A hot spring hotel.

683
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,040
Hot spring hotel?

684
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah.

685
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,360
Why are we here?

686
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,040
I’m not ready yet.

687
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,120
Ready for what?

688
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,120
To spend the night here.

689
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,360
What are you thinking?

690
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,280
You’ve read the proposal.

691
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
Moon Bay Resort features hot springs.

692
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,520
I meant to take you here long ago.

693
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,440
We can pay attention to details

694
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,240
that we can use or avoid.

695
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,880
Oh,

696
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,320
this is a business trip.

697
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,480
The hot spring here

698
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,400
is well-integrated with the scenery.

699
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
It’s like a whole

700
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
and quite unique.

701
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,840
It’s beautiful.

702
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,160
We can make Moon Bay Resort

703
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,720
a huge park

704
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,320
with hot springs like this.

705
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,480
Bridges and rivers,

706
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,000
pavilions and buildings can be partitions.

707
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,320
Scenes change with the location.

708
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,080
Each courtyard has its own theme.

709
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,800
Alright.

710
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
Let’s forget about work.

711
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,920
Just relax

712
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,840
and have fun.

713
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,640
OK.

714
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
What’s up?

715
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,960
Nothing.

716
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,840
This reminds me

717
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,680
of the old hot spring hotel

718
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,080
near my uncle’s place.

719
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Back then, they only went there with my cousin.

720
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I knew

721
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
taking one more child

722
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
meant they’d have to consider more

723
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,240
and pay more money.

724
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,360
So

725
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,440
I always told them I didn’t want to go.

726
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,320
But honestly, my biggest wish as a child

727
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,440
was to be in the hot spring all day long.

728
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
No problem.

729
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,680
Today, we can be in the water

730
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,520
as long as you want.

731
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,640
Let’s go.

732
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,280
OK.

733
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
I’ve shared my childhood wish with you.

734
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
You can

735
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,200
tell me yours.

736
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,440
I don’t

737
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,600
remember it anymore,

738
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
but now, I have a new one.

739
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,800
I want to tour around the world with you.

740
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,280
We can try

741
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,480
all sorts of entertainment.

742
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,840
When the sun sets,

743
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,360
we can have dinner together

744
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,160
and continue our journey the next day.

745
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,240
You’ll take me with you?

746
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,440
Of course.

747
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,720
In the past,

748
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,120
I never considered others’ feelings.

749
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,920
But since I met you,

750
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,440
I’ve changed.

751
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,440
I want to give you a better life.

752
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,240
What’s more,

753
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,560
right now,

754
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,040
I can understand

755
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,120
why people lie.

756
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,920
I’m the exact opposite.

757
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,920
Now,

758
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,720
I seldom lie

759
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
because you don’t like that.

760
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,880
So every time

761
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,720
when I’m about to tell a lie,

762
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,200
I’ll ask myself

763
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,120
if it’s necessary

764
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,280
not because I’m afraid of you

765
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,680
but because

766
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,040
ever since we met,

767
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
I’ve gradually

768
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,680
accepted the real me.

769
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,560
I’m following the instruction online.

770
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
It’s different from that in the picture.

771
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,680
Damn speaker box!

772
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,400
I just bought it.

773
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,320
I’ll ask them for five more as compensation.

774
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,240
What brings you here?

775
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,800
What’s wrong?

776
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,680
Am I unwelcome?

777
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,440
No.

778
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,160
Come on in.

779
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
Have you found the sketch?

780
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,520
Sketch?

781
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,920
Yes.

782
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,840
I put it in the TV stand.

783
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,760
Don’t worry.

784
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I’ll find it.

785
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,280
Look.

786
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
I’ve put them all together

787
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,320
in order.

788
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
Ah, yes.

789
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Why didn’t I see them?

790
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,040
You probably didn’t check carefully.

791
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,480
What’s this?

792
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,720
My speaker box.

793
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,360
I’m trying to fix it

794
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,560
before throwing it in the bin.

795
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,560
I can do it.

796
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,320
Let me fix it.

797
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
You?

798
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,920
Can you do it?

799
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
Men can

800
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,280
never say no.

801
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,520
You know what,

802
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,600
I’m an electronic genius.

803
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,320
I can fix it.

804
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,760
