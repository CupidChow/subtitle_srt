1
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,760
Why are you so careless?

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Chu.

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
You're not drunk.

4
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Are your legs

5
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Are you surprised?

6
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,800
Drunk is the same as my wound.

7
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
I pretended.

8
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,280
For...

9
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,479
to trap you.

10
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,600
Who do you want

11
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
to?

12
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,560
I did it for myself.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
When you abandoned me in the opera circle,

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,960
I almost became someone else’s toy.

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
I hate you so much.

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,160
I hate the Qin family.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,680
As long as this contract is announced to the public,

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,440
the truth behind Gu's fire.

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
At this time,

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
you still have to

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
to yourself.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,600
The person behind you is Gu Chi.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
So what?

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
So what?

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
Joo-Ryu.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
Let me ask you one thing.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,040
When you married into the Qin family,

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
when you married into the Qin family?

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,320
My sincerity

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,120
in the opera circle.

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,079
I chose gifts for you with joy.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
And you?

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,600
My pillow.

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,960
Don't waste your time on me.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
I won't tell you where Lu Huai is.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Qin Chu Shi.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
Kill me.

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,320
I never take back

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
will never be taken back.

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
As long as you are in the Qin family,

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
you will be Mrs. Qin.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,640
As for Lu Huai,

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
watch carefully

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
and see how I killed him.

45
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,320
I let him go on purpose.

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
He was just a move I made.

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Lu Huai.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,880
will die for sure.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Guards.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Keep an eye on Mrs. Qin.

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
If she leaves the room,

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
you will be punished.

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
Yes.

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,120
Manman.

55
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,880
You're good at shooting now.

56
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,120
This person

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,720
is the spy Mak Moon arranged at home.

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Did Lu Huai tell you that?

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Brother.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
I made a deal with Lu Huai.

61
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Miss saved me again.

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
And I owe you last time.

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,080
you owe me last time.

64
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
Do you know where Mowen is?

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
The suburb warehouse.

66
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
You're smart.

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,840
She never makes a loss.

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,320
But do you know

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,800
you could enter the dungeon so easily,

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
it means Qin Chu did it on purpose.

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Because he knew

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
once I escape,

73
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,680
I'll look for Mak Moon.

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,160
He's using me

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
to lure the snake out of its hole.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You know everything.

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,960
why did you tell me everything?

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Since the day of the accident at the station,

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,280
I swore in my heart

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
I won't

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,640
from you.

82
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,960
But Miss,

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
will you believe me?

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
Mowen was the last spy in the Qin family.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
There's a scar on his chin.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
Lu Huai.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,960
After you leave this time,

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
can you stop being enemies with the Qin family?

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Miss.

90
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,280
Lu Huai

91
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
Lu Huai has no choice.

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Miss,

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,200
You have no choice.

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
I know it's impossible

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I still hope

96
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
After Mowen died,

97
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,560
you and the Qin family are no longer enemies.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
That would be great.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Manman.

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
There's a gap

101
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
between you and Lu Huai.

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,200
I know even if you don't tell me.

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
Brother.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,480
Let Lu Huai go.

105
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,360
He shouldn't

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,480
on Zhou Liu.

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
Did he tell you

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,480
he and Zhou Liu

109
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
with Zhou Liu.

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
in the Qin family.

111
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
Sister-in-law, don't make it hard for yourself.

112
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,600
You should know

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
who I am.

114
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
You still call me sister-in-law.

115
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,640
I don't believe you don't love me and my brother.

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,120
If that's the case,

117
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
you could have killed me

118
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
you could have killed me.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,120
Manman.

120
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,760
I can't go back.

121
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Sister-in-law.

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
You're still in the Qin family.

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
Lu Huai is still alive.

124
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,120
It's not too late.

125
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,760
We get along well.

126
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
We once treated each other sincerely.

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm afraid

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
to be your sister-in-law.

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,440
Sister-in-law.

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
are willing to leave me and the Qin family.

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
What about my brother?

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
The people from Qin Mansion didn't tell me.

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
The line seems to be broken.

134
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,120
I'm afraid

135
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
in the Qin family.

136
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,440
This is our last spy.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
If he dies,

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,200
we can no longer know Qin family's whereabouts.

139
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,080
Lu Huai is the only one

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,080
is Lu Huai.

141
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,560
You mean

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,560
Lu Huai escaped?

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,480
It's a trap.

144
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,920
has been prepared for the Qin family and Lu Huai.

145
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,400
Qin Chu's leg was broken.

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,760
As long as he crashes into my net,

147
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,920
he'll die.

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
They would never expect

149
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,240
I have a perfect partner.

150
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
Now I know where Mak Moon is hiding.

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,840
Prepare the weapons and follow him.

152
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,480
Cover the servants' mouth.

153
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't let her know.

154
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
Father.

155
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
I can finally

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,680
is finally over.

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Why aren't you telling me?

158
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,920
Don't forget that you're mine now.

159
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,880
Did he go to see Mak Moon?

160
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Young man,

161
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
someone booked a boat ticket for you.

162
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Boss has seen through your cooperation with the Qin family.

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Run!

164
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
The boss knows you're suspicious.

165
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
You'll die if you go back.

166
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,760
I can't watch you die.

167
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,720
Move.

168
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
Shadow, I'll go.

169
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,200
I have my own reason.

170
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
Don't stop me.

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,760
The reason

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,080
for Qin Manzhi?

173
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,280
When you and I worked for Mo Wen,

174
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,600
we walked all the way here

175
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
All I think about is how to survive.

176
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,160
It's dangerous,

177
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
but I'm alive.

178
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,640
And now...

179
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Look at you.

180
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
You're crazy.

181
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
You're right.

182
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm crazy.

183
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,880
I don't know when

184
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
I fell in love with her.

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,440
Although the Qin family and I

186
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,720
with the Qin family,

187
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
But I can't.

188
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,640
I can't be her enemy.

189
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Please let me go.

190
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Lu Huai.

192
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,840
We promised to live and die together.

193
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,080
If you insist on going this way,

194
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,160
don't blame me for betraying you.

195
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,120
If it weren't for you,

196
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,240
I would have been cold.

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Cheers.

198
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
You're injured.

199
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,400
Don't drink too much.

200
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,480
Fine.

201
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,800
Consider it as we've had the Netherworld Wine together.

202
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,280
From now on,

203
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,880
If you die,

204
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I won't live in secret.

205
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,400
It's just a drunk talk.

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Don't take it seriously.

207
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
You can use

208
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
for yourself.

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
A drunken joke.

210
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,400
But I'm serious.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,040
Lu Huai.

212
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,360
Let's go.

213
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Young Master, we're late.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
This is a diversion.

215
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Go back to Qin Mansion now.

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes.

217
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
Let's go.

218
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
Miss, run! I'll stop them!

219
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,480
Go after them!

220
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
Come with me.

221
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,440
Why did you come back?

222
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Why did you hurt your hand?

223
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,880
It's just an old injury. I can handle it.

224
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,040
Let's go.

225
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,200
Where do you think

226
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
you can go?

227
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,120
Miss.

228
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,600
You're still here to save people with your injuries.

229
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,360
That's my fastest gun.

230
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,120
What a pity.

231
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Let's go. Let's go.
