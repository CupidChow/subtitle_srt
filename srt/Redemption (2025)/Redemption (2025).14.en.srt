1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,480
I can't marry you.

2
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,920
Let's call off the engagement

3
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,560
Siu-shun

4
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Thank you

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Manzhi and I

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,960
have something to talk about.

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

8
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,200
Is it my fault?

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
Young Master Shen

10
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,759
Why did you lie to me?

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Yes.

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,720
Something went wrong with the rouge.

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,600
Yes.

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
The rouge he gave me

15
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,960
was made by him.

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,640
Manzhi.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
It was a misunderstanding.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,600
At first,

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,960
I really thought the person you were looking for was me.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,560
Later, I really liked you.

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,840
I thought

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
even if it's a misunderstanding.

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Because I really love you.

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
There's no need to worry about the past.

25
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,160
If you can't,

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,680
keep treating me as that person.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
You are you, he is him.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
How can we mix up?

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm not as good as yesterday.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
I've never compared you two.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,240
You are you.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,480
He is him.

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
I just understand my feelings.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,560
If I marry you,

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll be your enemy someday.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,960
One wrong step

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,280
and wrong.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But you were waiting for him.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
What if he's dead?

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We haven't known each other for long.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,800
You don't know me.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
I never like to wait.

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,440
If you want anything,

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,800
I'll try to get it myself.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,480
I don't like the same thing.

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
I don't want it even if I have to.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,520
But Manzhi

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
There are thousands of emotions in the world.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
Maybe we can fall in love.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,720
In this world,

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
who would make rouge for you.

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
I can learn for you.

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,720
I'll make it for you.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,600
I promise

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
I will do a thousand times better than that person.

56
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,560
Young Master has something to tell Miss Qin.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,800
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
What does the Shen family have to do with me?

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
I only listen to Miss Yu.

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Manzhi.

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,560
I never told you.

62
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
Mother.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
is very sick.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
When she knew I was going to get engaged to you,

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
she was happy

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
she's willing to take medicine.

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
If she knows you want to break off the engagement,

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,760
maybe

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
Young Master Shen

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,000
It’s not a gentleman to force others.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Young Master insisted on coming in.

72
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm sorry

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,079
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
My mother was sick when I was young.

75
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
I was also anxious.

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
Since Manzhi understands,

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
what happened today...

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's not talk about what happened today.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,960
But in the future...

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Forget it.

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's talk about it later.

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,040
Lu Huai, let's go.

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,159
Mr. Shen.

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Excuse me.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
We've known each other for a long time.

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,520
But why do you only remember that person?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,159
I will make you change your mind.

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,760
Why did you tell Miss Qin that she's sick?

89
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,920
Her Ladyship is healthy.

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
Just let her really get sick.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,200
That's inappropriate.

92
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,200
My birth mother died a long time ago.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,160
That woman

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,280
took my mother's place for a long time.

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
and made some sacrifices for me.

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,960
for me?

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Madam.

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,080
Manman has been depressed in the Shen family.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,200
She didn't eat much for dinner.

100
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll bring her some food.

101
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,560
Xiao Wu and Chu are discussing the mole.

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
They're about to find out about you.

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,560
He never let go of his doubts about me.

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,200
Find an excuse to stay away from trouble for the time being.

105
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
But you're alone in the Qin family.

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
It's okay.

107
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,200
My position in the Qin family is still stable.

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Everything will be fine.

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Let's go.

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Manman.

111
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,960
I barely had dinner.

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
Have some soup.

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Sister-in-law.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Have you

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,720
shaken up to me before?

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,920
To be honest

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes.

118
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,640
Then why did you marry him?

119
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,159
Because I'm a dancer.

120
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,200
If I marry your brother, I don't have to show up in public

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280
Don't worry about money anymore.

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
You can take care of your family

123
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,600
and be a wife.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
You must be joking.

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
You were the top star of the big world.

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,800
It's hard to get a ticket with you.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,720
You already have the right to redeem yourself.

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,360
You chose your brother among many choices.

129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,840
You're not afraid of marrying him,

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,320
or leave him.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
After all,

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm still after your brother.

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
You can't live long if you want something.

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
No matter what you choose,

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,320
you have the confidence to bear the consequences.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,880
It seems Manman

137
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,800
has an answer.

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,200
What's wrong with Manman?

139
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
Sister-in-law.

140
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,600
There might be a rat in our house.

141
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
Come out.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
Why are you so fierce?

143
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,720
Tell Mak Moon

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
Don't play those childish tricks.

145
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
Don't put

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,480
on me and Qin Manzhi.

147
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,800
You mean

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,640
about the marriage between you and Qin Manzhi?

149
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,200
I have a grudge against the Qin family.

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,320
But I won't use her innocence.

151
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
You're protecting her.

152
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,480
Do you really not want anything to happen with her?

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
or dare not?

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
I don't want to say the same thing again.

155
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,679
Okay.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Let me ask you one last time.

157
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,080
If there is no blood feud between you and Qin Manzhi,

158
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
would you fall in love with her?

159
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Forget it.

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
I don't want to get involved in this.

161
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,240
The boss asked you to stop Qin Manzhi from investigating Third Master.

162
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,760
It’s up to you.

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Miss.

164
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,680
Lu Huai, I want to drink.

165
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,400
Poppet complains about me every day.

166
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
Only your place is the safest.

167
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,480
Why are you naked?

168
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't go, Lu Huai.

169
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,800
Drink with me.

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,560
If you have no blood feud with Qin Manzhi,

171
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
would you love her?

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,960
Miss.

173
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,760
Let me send you back to your room.

174
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,720
Lu Huai.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm falling.

176
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,600
Hold me tight then.

177
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,320
Young master, we've found out about Lu Huai.

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
How is it?

179
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,880
He is an orphan.

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
He went to an orphanage at seven.

181
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,640
But his experience before he was seven was blank.

182
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,680
What a coincidence.

183
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
Gu Chi died when he was seven.

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
It seems

185
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
I have to find an answer myself.

186
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,920
Young Master Manman Shen is here

187
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Have a seat, Young Master Shen

188
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,800
Bao, go get some tea.

189
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
Why did Young Master Shen come without a word?

190
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,360
Don't misunderstand Manzhi

191
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm not here for anything else.

192
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
But

193
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Shen’s has released a new fragrance powder.

194
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,400
I thought you might like it.

195
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,200
Look at this jasmine.

196
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,360
This rose

197
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,400
and osmanthus

198
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,080
You need to put them into the powder to bake them.

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,760
Then the taste will blend in.

200
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
Your house?

201
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,960
There's no such thing.

202
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,520
What are you doing?

203
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,720
Sorry, I’m allergic to Dingxiang.

204
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,920
What should I do?

205
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,040
I have a good nose.

206
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
That's why I'm easier to be tricked than my father.

207
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,240
It's nothing serious.

208
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,520
Take the medicine.

209
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
It smells good.

210
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,840
As long as Manzhi likes it.

211
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
What do you think?

212
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,000
Give me some advice.

213
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,200
You like the elegant taste.

214
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
This fragrance powder smells too strong

215
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Young Master Shen

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
I’m afraid it’s a waste of time.

217
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
Really?

218
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Miss.

219
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,160
It's a little cold. I'll get you a scarf.

220
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
Why did you leave in such a hurry?

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,920
Is there

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,920
a secret?

223
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Young Master Shen

224
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Sorry.

225
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,640
Lu Huai, are you okay?

226
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,680
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,000
The tea cup is too hot.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,800
I didn't hold it.

229
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Are you okay?

230
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,680
I'm fine.

231
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,800
Lu Huai is rough and thick.

232
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,600
It's okay.

233
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
Manzhi is straightforward.

234
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,760
She will be a member of the Shen family in the future.

235
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
Please be careful.

236
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,520
It's better to keep a distance from her.

237
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,640
Shen Panshu.

238
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
I haven't promised you yet.

239
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,040
I was too impatient.

240
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,920
Whether you will become a member of the Shen family or not,

241
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,360
Lu Huai shouldn't break the rules.

242
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
Young Master Shen is right.

243
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I will punish

244
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,760
I'll teach Chu a lesson.

245
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Go get changed.

246
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,800
Yes.

247
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
She is

248
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,200
helping Lu Huai.

249
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,480
What is Zhou Liu's relationship with Lu Huai?

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Since the fragrance powder has been delivered,

251
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,000
I have something to do.

252
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
I have to go.

253
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,080
Bao, see the guest out.

254
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
The moon shines on the moon.
