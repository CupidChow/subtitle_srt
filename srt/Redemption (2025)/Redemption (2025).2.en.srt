1
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,640
I thought you wouldn't come.

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
Lu Huai promised Miss

3
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,440
no matter what happens,

4
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,600
as long as it's a thunderstorm night,

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,480
I'll always be with you.

6
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,160
You keep your word.

7
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,880
You saved Zhou Liu in the big world.

8
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,039
Are you really not worried about me?

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,400
Are you angry because of this?

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,920
Don't worry.

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
Lu Huai's gun is very accurate.

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
No one can beat me.

13
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
You can only be my guard.

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Lu Huai,

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
will you feel wronged?

16
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
My lady is fine.

17
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,160
Lu Huai.

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
will be satisfied.

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Mak Moon is hiding again.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
We can't find him.

21
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
How dare he touch Manman?

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm tired of living.

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
Find a way to get him out.

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Yes.

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,560
Everyone at the ball said you like Lu Huai last night.

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,440
Of course I know my sister.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,040
She knew I wanted to marry her to the Shen family

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,360
and deliberately used Lu Huai to get mad at me.

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Young Master is wise.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
There are indeed some gossips outside.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
the Shen family has been working with the Qin family for a long time.

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
If we can get married, we'll get closer.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,920
It depends on whether he is capable or not.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,200
Isn't he coming back soon?

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,120
Arrange him to meet Manman then.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
Yes

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,520
By the way, how are the spices ready for the Shen Family?

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
Come to the dock in seven days.

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,600
Mr. A will deliver the goods himself.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,079
Remember to treat them well.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes.

42
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,040
I've arranged everything in Big World.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
The rest of the head showgirl

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,760
Miss doesn't allow me to disturb her.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Number one.

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,640
I heard that she helped me to save Miss.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
OK. Leave him alone.

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,360
Ask Lu Huai to come in.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,360
Which one would you like?

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,640
The left one.

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Help me change. I'm tired.

52
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Excuse me, Miss.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,760
Young master asked Lu Huai to go there.

54
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
Young master wants to see me?

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,720
In the Great World,

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
in the Great World.

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,080
Tell me what you want.

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
This is what Lu Huai should do.

59
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
I want nothing.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
You've been here for so many years.

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,120
You should know that...

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
I've always been fair.

63
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,080
I don't know.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,640
Money then.

65
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
I'll ask Xiao Wu to prepare it for you.

66
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,159
After the reward, let's talk about the punishment.

67
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,760
I sent more men to protect Manman.

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,560
You even took her out.

69
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,159
She almost died.

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Please trust me.

71
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,680
I can protect you.

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
I never trust anyone.

73
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
On my first day,

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,800
as your bodyguard,

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,159
you told me

76
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,000
to obey her orders.

77
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
She asked me to go to the Great World with her.

78
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
I have no right to refuse.

79
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
You're loyal to Manman.

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
You went to the Great World.

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
Then why are you so close to Manman?

82
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,680
Please continue to punish Lu Huai.

83
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,440
Manman, why are you here?

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,440
I heard you're punishing my men.

85
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,520
I want to come and watch.

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,640
Give me the whip.

87
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,320
Manman.

88
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,080
My men have no reason to punish my brother.

89
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,159
Young Master.

90
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Didn't I tell you not to let her in?

91
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
Please spare my life.

92
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Remember.

93
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
We don't keep losers.

94
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Young Master.

95
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,960
If you can't do it,

96
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,520
I can do it for you.

97
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
If you

98
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
punish Lu Huai,

99
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
to punish Lu Huai.

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,559
Young Master said

101
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
there are ten whips left.

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,679
Not a penny less.

103
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,400
I'll count for you.

104
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Five.

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,120
Six.

106
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,400
Seven.

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Nine.

108
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,280
Why are you so nervous?

109
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
I've seen it before.

110
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm afraid

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,440
it will affect you.

112
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
When you took off my clothes,

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
when you took off my clothes.

114
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Miss.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
I just don't want to get engaged.

116
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
That's why I'm acting for you.

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,600
Lu Huai only needs to cooperate.

118
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,720
But the situation is different now.

119
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,920
Why are you blaming me for hitting you?

120
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
Give me your hand.

121
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,880
Let me apply some medicine for you.

122
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,360
Sit.

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,760
I know you're doing this for me.

124
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,160
If you hit me,

125
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm afraid I can't get out of bed.

126
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,920
You're smart.

127
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Lu Huai.

128
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,320
You've been beaten for me for so many years.

129
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
Will you hate me?

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Miss.

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
saved Lu Huai's life.

132
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
I just don't understand

133
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,640
why you didn’t tell Young Master about finding someone.

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,320
This might delay your engagement with Shen family.

135
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
I haven’t made up my mind about the engagement

136
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,720
I just need to let Young Master Shen retreat

137
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
About finding someone

138
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,840
He doesn't want me to have a weakness.

139
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,440
If he knew,

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,280
he might kill him before me.

141
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Lu Huai.

142
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,120
You're badly injured this time.

143
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
Will you help me next time?

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
Don't worry.

145
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,240
I work for you.

146
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
I'll always listen to you.

147
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Young Master Qin, you're a rare guest.

148
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Why are you here so early?

149
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,840
It hasn't started yet.

150
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,880
Which one is the top one?

151
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,040
The top one.

152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
He's changing at the backstage.

153
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,160
I said I'm tired today.

154
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
It's useless to call me outside.

155
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
I won't perform today.

156
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
Why are you here?

157
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,320
I thought the Qin family had forgotten me.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
I didn't expect

159
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
It's not a big deal

160
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Young Master Qin has to come in person.

161
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
If I knew it was you,

162
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
I wouldn't have waited until now.

163
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Young Master Qin still loves to tell jokes.

164
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
Just like before.

165
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
Miss Manji is my friend.

166
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,920
That night,

167
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,440
the Qin family pushed me out to be a scapegoat.

168
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,720
Don't worry, Young Master Qin.

169
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,680
I promise I won't tell anyone.

170
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
You have a sharp mouth.

171
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,440
You've been doing well these years.

172
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,720
When did Young Master Qin care so much about women?

173
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Or a woman you abandoned?

174
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,200
What happened? Are you hurt?

175
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,720
It's none of your business.

176
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
Protect Manman's injury.

177
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,400
You said it has nothing to do with me?

178
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,520
Young Master Qin.

179
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
I’m not the opera performer

180
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,960
the opera performer.

181
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,200
Please show some respect.

182
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
I have something to do.

183
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,920
I won't keep Young Master Qin.

184
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,920
Please.

185
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,280
Young Master.

186
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,480
I just got something from a reporter.

187
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,320
Wu.

188
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,400
What do you think of Lu Huai's shooting skills?

189
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,560
