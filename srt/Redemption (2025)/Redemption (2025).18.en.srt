1
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,039
Wu, something's wrong.

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Wait.

3
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
It's a trap. Let's go.

4
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Mowen.

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,200
You don't deserve to learn how to set up a trap.

6
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
Come out!

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
Young Master and the others are ambushing snipers.

8
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
Let's go.

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Young Master.

10
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,280
Wu.

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,280
Get up.

12
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,840
Go!

13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,759
Let's go.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,280
Manman.

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
Manman.

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Don't do anything you'll regret.

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,360
Young Lady, bad news!

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Something happened to Young Master.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
Chu.

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Look.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,520
Manman went home.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,079
How did he get hurt so badly? Where's Wu?

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,920
We were ambushed by Mowen.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
In order to protect Young Master,

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,480
Let's go.

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
Wu.

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,040
I was too reckless

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
to find out the truth of my father's death.

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
I knew there was a mole in the Qin family.

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
Mowen is the mastermind.

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I thought...

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,280
I thought I could lure him to the station.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,440
Things have come to this. It can't be changed.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't blame yourself too much.

35
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
You were in a coma for three days.

36
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,480
but you escaped Mowen's hunt.

37
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,880
Why did you save me?

38
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
Because

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
our childhood friendship.

40
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,600
Am I right?

41
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,400
Gu Chi.

42
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,159
Even if you hide your identity,

43
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,480
but how can you hide

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
How can you hide it?

45
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,840
The Qin family sent an allergy medicine.

46
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
Guess

47
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
how I got it.

48
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,280
You mean

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,520
she gave it to you?

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,360
Mr. Gu is as smart as always.

51
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
You worry too much.

52
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,120
I won't be angry

53
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,080
I won't be angry

54
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
But Young Master Shen

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,680
I wonder when

56
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,840
so nostalgic?

57
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Or

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
you have another purpose?

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,480
I'll be frank with you.

60
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,760
I don't care what happened between you and her.

61
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
Manzhi.

62
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
is now my fiancee.

63
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,159
I won't allow anyone

64
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
to get any closer to her.

65
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
Fiancée.

66
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
If she's willing to marry you,

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,280
why would she care about a traitor like me?

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Gu Chi.

69
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
If you're sensible,

70
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,240
take these

71
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,320
and leave Yan City forever.

72
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
What if I say

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,000
I won't leave?

74
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
In a few days,

75
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
Manzhi will know.

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Mr. Gu of the Gu family

77
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,960
has been working for the Qin family for seven years.

78
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,760
You're already a traitor in her heart.

79
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,400
Now,

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,680
if I know

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,560
your grudge with the Qin family,

82
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
Guess.

83
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Will she choose her brother

84
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
or you?

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Now!

86
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,240
It's not too late.

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Get lost

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
Young Master Shen

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,600
I appreciate your kindness

90
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,400
I can walk by myself.

91
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,840
Do you know why...

92
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
Do you know why?

93
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
There are many rumors.

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
But how do I know

95
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,760
how can I be as clear as you?

96
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
You

97
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
and the whole Shen family

98
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,720
have nothing to do with this?

99
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
The Shen family is honest.

100
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,640
But what can I hide

101
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
from the world?

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,240
Gu Chi.

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,640
The back door.

104
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
Count the time.

105
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,240
Qin Chu Shi should wake up.

106
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,040
Good.

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
give the Qin family a target.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,520
You're brilliant, Young Master.

109
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,040
Lu Huai was killed by Young Master Qin.

110
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
he has completely severed Miss Qin's mind.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
A bunch of losers.

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,920
You can't even catch a traitor.

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,880
I want to see

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,560
whether they can

115
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,160
whether they can avoid it or not.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,440
Everything is fine, Su.

117
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,800
Please send her to the lake in three days.

118
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
Xiaowu's blood can't be wasted.

119
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,040
Mowen must die.

120
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,600
Brother.

121
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
What we want is Mok Moon's life.

122
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
not to die together.

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
Move.

124
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,480
Did Xiao Wu hesitate when he took the bullet for me?

125
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,280
If you die,

126
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,120
what's the point of Xiao Wu's sacrifice?

127
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Okay.

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll remember Mowen's life for now.

129
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
But the traitor

130
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,040
must die.

131
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,120
Go follow the newspaper boy

132
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,520
and see what Madam has told him.

133
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,080
Yes.

134
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,240
Why did you come out?

135
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,360
What should I do if I catch a cold?

136
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
I won't see you when I wake up.

137
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm flustered.

138
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
Let's go.

139
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's go.

140
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Madam.

141
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Young Master went out.

142
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
He brought a lot of people.

143
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Go to the lake

144
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,640
and ask her to come home quickly.

145
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,800
Tell her the situation has changed.

146
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,040
Go. Yes.

147
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,920
Miss.

148
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,400
The Qin and Mo families are looking for you in Yan City.

149
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
How dare you come to see me?

150
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Lu Huai is afraid of death.

151
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,240
But some things

152
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
are more important than life.

153
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,680
I said I'll kill you if I see you again.

154
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
Do you think I wouldn't dare?

155
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
I do have a grudge against the Qin family.

156
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,800
but I'm not doing this for Mo Wen.

157
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Miss.

158
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
You don't deserve to call me that.

159
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,480
This shot

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,920
for saving me in the big world.

161
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,040
This shot

162
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,520
teach me how to use a gun.

163
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,240
From now on,

164
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
you are no longer a member of the Qin family.

165
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
Since my brother suspected you,

166
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,040
I tried my best to protect you.

167
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
I even thought

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,280
if you could catch the shadow at the station,

169
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,720
and make up for your crime,

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,640
I'll take you back to the Qin family to accept your punishment.

171
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,680
The Qin family treats you well.

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,320
But what about you?

173
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,880
How can I tell you

174
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm Gu Chi.

175
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Our blood feud

176
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,520
can never be forgiven.

177
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Miss.

178
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
What you said

179
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,600
is true.

180
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,840
Lu Huai.

181
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I can't explain.

182
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
My life

183
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
on your account.

184
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,040
When Lu Huai fulfils his wish,

185
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,480
you can do whatever you want.

186
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,400
What a wish.

187
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Is your wish

188
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,640
related to the Qin family?

189
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,240
At this point,

190
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
I have only one question for you.

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,280
When you saw my rouge and old stuff that day,

192
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
when you saw my rouge?

193
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,360
Miss.

194
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,640
Madam asked me to tell you

195
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,240
something is wrong.

196
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Leave at once.

197
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,120
Two hours later,

198
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,520
if you haven't left Yan City,

199
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,640
I will kill you with my brother.

200
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
Let's go.

201
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
Those who betrayed the Qin family

202
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
never had a happy ending.

203
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,839
The moon shines on the moon
