1
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Who sent you?

2
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,520
Dead people don't need to know the truth.

3
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,380
Boss Mo asked me to finish you off.

4
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Mo Wen.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,880
Boss Mo.

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,720
Miss!

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,500
Drive faster! It's the young master.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
This Mo Wen is truly audacious.

9
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,039
Daring to attack the young miss.

10
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,360
Mo Wen didn't know Manman was in the store today.

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
His target was Zhou Liu.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,900
If it weren't for me...

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,570
Manman couldn't possibly suffer such an undeserved calamity.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't worry, Mr. Qin.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
The young lady's injuries are no longer serious.

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Thank you.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,420
Who told you to be here?

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Get out.

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
Young master.

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,480
Please let go.

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,960
Lu Huai, don't forget what I told you.

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,360
Go bring Zhou Liu back to the Qin mansion.

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
I want to hold the wedding earlier.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,720
Yes.

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,200
The original wedding announcement has already been sent to the newspaper.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,960
Should we still publish it?

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Publish it as planned.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,840
I want Mo Wen to be uncertain about my intentions.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Yes.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
Wait.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
Manman needs a maid to take care of her.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
You must carefully screen candidates these days.

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
Find someone trustworthy.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
I heard Manzhi was attacked. I'll go see her.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,620
Manman is fine.

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,220
Just some minor injuries.

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,120
It's not appropriate for a man like you to enter a young lady's room.

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Come.

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
Let's go downstairs for a drink.

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm glad Manzhi is alright.

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,480
I'll pass on the drink.

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,540
I have matters to attend to at Shen's.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,560
Shu.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
That's thoughtful of you.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,130
I thank you on Manman's behalf.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,500
No need for such formalities between brothers.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll be going now.

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Xiaoshun.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
The Qin family is looking for a maid for Manzhi.

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Find a way.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,530
Get someone with a clean background who follows orders.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,360
Make sure she gets selected.

54
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,420
Yes, young master.

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
If she had really died in this assassination attempt,

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
would I have felt the satisfaction of revenge?

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Lu Huai.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
You saved me again.

59
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,440
Um, I made some porridge.

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,370
I'll go get it from the kitchen.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
Before I found you,

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,140
I wouldn't let anything happen to me.

63
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Where is she?

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
This is the outer wall of the Gu mansion.

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
She couldn't have gone inside, could she?

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,440
If she ran into that wealthy household,

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,400
she's in for trouble.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
Damn brat!

69
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Stealing things,

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,360
just wait till I catch you.

71
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,880
I'll skin you alive.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,480
Hey!

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,250
It wasn't me. I didn't steal your money pouch.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
I know it wasn't you.

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
You wouldn't even dare to pick flowers,

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,420
let alone steal a money pouch.

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,000
Here.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
My favorite snack. It's delicious.

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,050
Wipe your mouth, little kitty.

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
And these too.

81
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,280
I don't like this style.

82
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,680
I was going to throw them away anyway,

83
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
so take them,

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,820
so those people won't recognize you.

85
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,480
Are you...

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,060
Are you the young master of the Gu family?

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
I've heard that Master Gu

88
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
is very strict.

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
If he finds out you gave me these clothes...

90
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't worry.

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm just a guest at the Gu household.

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,890
Master Gu has no authority over me.

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Go ahead and change. I won't look.

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm done changing.

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
Isn't it strange?

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,780
It looks so beautiful.

97
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,780
It would be perfect with just one more thing.

98
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,520
What is it?

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Come back tomorrow and I'll tell you.

100
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,320
Young master.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm here.

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,640
That thing you mentioned last time,

103
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
what exactly is it?

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,690
Come here first.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
Sit down.

106
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
Close your eyes.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,080
Done.

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,800
Your face looks like a little spotted cat. This is for you.

109
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
What's this?

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
This rouge is handmade by me.

111
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,960
There's no other like it in the world. It's for you.

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
I can't accept it.

113
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
This is a secret.

114
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Keep it safe and don't let anyone else know.

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,919
Okay.

116
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Shen Yeshu, is that you?

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
Due to special circumstances,

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,920
we can only hold a family dinner.

119
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
From now on,

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,860
Zhou Liu is a member of our Qin family.

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,880
Congratulations, brother.

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Sister-in-law.

123
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
Since you've acknowledged us,

124
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,280
can Chu and I call you Manman?

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,280
Yes.

126
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,200
I wish I had gone that day instead.

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Then you wouldn't have been hurt.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,130
This toast is to you.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
We're friends who've faced life and death together.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
You saved me once at Dashijie,

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
and now I've saved you once.

132
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
We're even.

133
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
You know.

134
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,160
I wanted to give you a grand wedding.

135
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Now I can only welcome you like this.

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,530
I'm sorry for the disappointment.

137
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,970
I never wanted a wedding ceremony.

138
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
I only wanted you.

139
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
Look at you two getting along!

140
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,840
Everyone's here!

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,200
Seven pairs and eight singles.

142
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,760
I lost again.

143
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,160
Why didn't you tell me about your assassination plan?

144
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,420
Do you realize I almost died by your hand?

145
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,240
My target was Zhou Liu.

146
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,640
You were just unlucky to get in the way.

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,520
Mo Wen, listen to me.

148
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,120
Use your brain before taking action next time.

149
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,240
If I had died,

150
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,770
dealing with the Qin family would have been impossible for you.

151
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
Wait.

152
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
The Shen family's spices will arrive at the dock soon.

153
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,960
I need the shipping schedule from Qin Chushi.

154
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,400
Miss.

155
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
Miss.

156
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Miss, your medicine.

157
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,410
Mr. Mo sent me to finish you off.

158
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,290
Miss, your scar removal medicine is here.

159
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
When I was hurt as a child,

160
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,480
my father would always buy me candied haws.

161
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,120
He would also ask Uncle San to perform puppet shows for me.

162
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,180
Miss, the young master has always remembered that.

163
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,980
It's a pity we don't have Uncle San's puppet shows anymore.

164
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
Miss,

165
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,680
Uncle San went abroad years ago.

166
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,220
There's been no news of him since.

167
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
By the way, where is Lu Huai?

168
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,960
He's waiting for you at the shooting range.

169
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,600
It's beautiful.

170
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Is this for me?

171
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Yes.

172
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,520
I'll teach you how to use the gun properly.

173
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
It's just pulling a trigger.

174
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,980
I've already learned how.

175
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,480
Shooting

176
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
is not as simple as pulling the trigger.

177
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
To protect yourself,

178
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,760
you need to hit the target with one shot.

179
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,840
Do you see that target ahead?

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,120
That red center is the enemy's heart.

181
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Got it?

182
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,260
Remember that?

183
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
I've got it,

184
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,060
but your aim is so good.

185
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,960
What if you're the one who wants to hurt me?

186
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,370
What would I do then?

187
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,410
Then it would be my destiny,

188
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,360
to die by your hand,

189
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
and I would accept it willingly.
