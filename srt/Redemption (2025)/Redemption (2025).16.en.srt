1
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
Since my sister-in-law married into the Qin Mansion,

2
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,760
this place has been vacant.

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,120
I'm sure you didn't expect this.

4
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,200
We're hiding here.

5
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,800
Yes.

6
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
You're a newly moved couple.

7
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
We just came back.

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,600
You two are so lovey-dovey.

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,440
Let's go.

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
I thought you were good at acting.

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,960
What?

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
How many days are you going to act as a couple?

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,240
You'll be embarrassed.

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
You must be joking.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
She sleeps in the master bedroom.

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Lu Huai will sleep on the sofa.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't worry.

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,079
When my brother reacts,

19
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,560
he will look for us all over the city.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
I hope it won’t be too soon.

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
And Shen’s.

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Even if the Qin family and Shen family come to us,

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,840
we would have left by then.

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,200
I hope we didn't cause you any trouble.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Miss.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,320
Are you going abroad

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
to find someone?

28
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
When my father passed away,

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Uncle Sanxing went abroad.

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Uncle Erbai is missing.

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Although the Qin family has retired,

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
we have many enemies.

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,800
Young Master has been protecting you well.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
because he doesn't want you to take the risk.

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
But even so,

37
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,960
are you still going abroad?

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
There must be something wrong.

39
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,720
My brother is in the light.

40
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,560
Those people are in the dark.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
If we don't find out the truth,

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
I won't be able to rest in peace.

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Why are you suddenly talking to me?

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
Tomorrow is your birthday.

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
I think you are not happy.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,840
My brother and I

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,040
are just siblings.

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
But my brother has never treated me differently.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Since I came to Qin Mansion ten years ago,

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,800
he treated me very well.

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Whether I'm playful,

52
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
or willful,

53
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,360
he always spoils me.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
Even if I come out now,

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,520
I know he won't blame me.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
He only cares about my safety.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,920
I hope he's blaming me.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,520
In that case,

59
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll make everyone think I ran away from marriage.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Miss.

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Don't be sad.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,720
Tell me when you come back.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
He will understand you.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Lu Huai.

65
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,120
Fortunately, I have you.

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
The Qin and Shen families are close.

67
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,680
If you refuse the Shen family for me,

68
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,920
he will definitely have a grudge against the Shen family.

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,680
If I run away, I can bear it alone.

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,280
When my brother saw this letter,

71
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
I've already left the banquet city.

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,840
When it's time to come back Manzhi will come back

73
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm not good enough as her brother.

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,440
I know Manman doesn't like her.

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,360
I allowed her to meet her.

76
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
I promised my father

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
to be good to her.

78
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Chu doesn't blame you.

79
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Don't be like this.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
It's okay.

81
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,640
My father had many enemies since he was young.

82
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
My birth mother

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
and my younger sister under the moon

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
were killed by others.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,400
When Manman first came to our house,

86
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,240
it was only this big.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
My father told me

88
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,440
she was a homeless girl

89
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
She was a thief

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
and a beggar.

91
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,600
It was because of me.

92
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
At that time, I swore

93
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,440
to be good to her.

94
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,560
So I didn't treat Manman well enough

95
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
That's why Manman left, right?

96
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,720
You're too impatient.

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Xiao Wu has sent someone to look for her.

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
I've been looking for her for so many days.

99
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
but there's no news.

100
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Did something happen to her?

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,880
No.

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
Lu Huai is still here.

103
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
She will be fine.

104
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
She'd better be safe.

105
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Otherwise,

106
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll let those people die with her.

107
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
Lu Huai.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
I made longevity noodles.

109
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,760
Today is your birthday.

110
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,240
You must try it.

111
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Where did you find the ingredients?

112
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
I borrowed it from my neighbor.

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
When you were asleep,

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
It's hot.

115
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
Slow down. I'll hold it.

116
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong?

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Have you tried it after you made it?

118
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
No taste.

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,799
No I remember

120
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,000
Try it if you don't believe me.

121
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,159
No problem.

122
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,120
How about putting some salt in it?

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll give you some longevity noodles.

124
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
and get some luck.

125
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,320
safe and happy.

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
May your wish come true.

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Young Master, it's getting dark.

128
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
Tell me.

129
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm no match for that guard?

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
Maybe Young Master...

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,680
Ms. Qin didn't run away from home because she ran away.

132
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Bao sent something over.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,880
I was delayed for a while

134
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,520
Siu-shun just got it

135
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,280
What did she give her?

136
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
A bottle of medicine.

137
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,480
It's for Lu Huai.

138
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
But Siu-shun has checked it

139
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Nothing unusual

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
It's for allergy.

141
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,640
We were in the same school.

142
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
It's fine that you stutter.

143
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,720
You can't even pass the exam?

144
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,320
Why did father

145
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,280
compare me

146
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
to compete with him.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,880
Shen's shop is not as good as Gu's.

148
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,880
They always say we’re the second best.

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
Okay.

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,080
Now they laugh at me that I can't even beat my son.

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll kill you.

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,520
I'll kill you.

153
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
How dare you wear the same clothes?

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,280
Do you deserve it?

155
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,080
Don't be stubborn.

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,600
How dare you disobey me!

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,560
I'll kill you today!

158
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Young Master.

159
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,560
It's really you.

160
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,080
Gu Chi.

161
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
This time,

162
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
I finally got you.

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,680
Prepare a gift for me.

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm going to the Qin Mansion.

165
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,800
to watch a good show.

166
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,560
Yes.

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
Manzhi took him away.

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,560
Did he find out Lu Huai's real identity

169
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,400
or just a coincidence?

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Is the person she's been looking for Gu Chi?

171
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,560
The water temperature should be right.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
You're really afraid of water.

173
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
No.

174
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,200
Lu Huai is not afraid of water.

175
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,480
But...

176
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,680
there must be a reason for being afraid of water.

177
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,840
But when you see water again,

178
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,800
you will think of today.

179
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,640
That's why I had a fever.

180
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
I kissed you too.

181
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

182
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,520
It was my lady who lost her mind at that time.

183
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
What if I said it would count?

184
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,800
Lu Huai has a low status.

185
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't deserve you.

186
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,640
I knew it. It's boring to joke.

187
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,720
I've raised you for so many years.

188
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
It's finally useful.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
How do you plan

190
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
to deal with Qin Manzhi?

191
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,160
Since we know the time she got on the boat,

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,640
then stay there.

193
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,960
She wants the evidence from Third Master.

194
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
It’s not that easy.

195
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
Everyone thought

196
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,120
everyone thinks it was Qin Shengfang.

197
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,240
it must always be the truth.

198
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,080
Well,

199
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,080
what do you plan to do with Lu Huai?

200
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,760
The Qin family is catching the mole.

201
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,600
We'll find him soon.

202
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,200
If we have Qin Man,

203
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
what's the use of Lu Huai?

204
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Who's coming out?

205
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,960
Miss.

206
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,520
What is this occasion?

207
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,000
How dare you show up here?

208
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
Consider it a punishment.

209
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,680
Lu Huai.

210
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm willing to die.

211
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,520
Manman, it's me.

212
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,720
The engagement banquet is about to begin.

213
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,360
Have you changed your clothes?

214
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,680
Lu Huai.

215
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Miss.

216
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,760
Miss.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Did you have a nightmare?

218
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,520
Lu Huai, I dreamed of you.

219
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,000
I dreamed of my brother.

220
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,520
I dreamed that at the engagement banquet,

221
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,680
at the engagement party.

222
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
It's okay.

223
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,560
Lu Huai is here.

224
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,000
Miss.

225
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
Miss.

226
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,640
After you return to the Qin family,

227
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,360
Young Master will never force you to marry Young Master Shen.

228
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
Don’t worry

229
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,040
I dreamed

230
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,360
I pointed a gun at you.

231
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,120
Miss, what are you thinking?

232
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Dreams are the opposite.

233
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,040
But I dreamed that you kissed me.

234
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,440
Maybe in other people's eyes, I ran away and eloped with you.

235
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,760
It occurred to me that

236
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,560
to make the rumor true.

237
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,240
The moon shines on the moon.
