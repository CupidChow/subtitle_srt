1
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
What's going on

2
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,840
Why are you in such a mess?

3
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,880
She has a fever.

4
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,920
Call the doctor first.

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,520
Don't worry. I'll arrange it.

6
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Chu and his men are out for business.

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
She should be back soon.

8
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,039
Okay.

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,160
Lu Huai.

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Remember,

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,880
you and Manman are not the same.

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,240
Miss.

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
Am I dreaming?

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,560
Why am I back at Qin Mansion?

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
You're not dreaming.

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
Lu Huai brought you back.

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
There are sweets in the medicine.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,560
It won't be bitter.

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Your hand is hurt.

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,960
It's burnt.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
It's okay.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,640
Then...

23
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,680
after that?

24
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Miss.

25
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,480
I was burning up.

26
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,240
I don't think he remembers anything.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
Nothing happened.

28
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Then, a butcher passed by.

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
and heard our call for help.

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,600
and saved us.

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,040
Manman, are you okay?

32
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,079
Have you forgotten what I told you?

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,079
Don't come into Miss's room when you're free.

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes.

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Young Master.

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,560
Brother.

37
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,760
It's not Lu Huai's fault this time.

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
We met a little beggar

39
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
we met a little beggar in the market.

40
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,079
She tricked me.

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,040
I knew

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
you heard the rumor

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
that the Shen family and the Qin family are connected?

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,160
I was upset.

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,600
But now you've seen Shen Panshu.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
What do you think of him?

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
What do you mean?

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,240
Shu is from a noble family.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,320
I know her well.

50
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
We know each other well.

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,200
Our families are innocent.

52
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
Even for my sake,

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
he won't dare to bully you.

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Brother.

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
I understand what you mean.

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,560
But I've been confused lately.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,840
Is it because of Lu Huai?

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
Brother, why are you so serious?

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm still young.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,280
I just want to be with you forever.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
and stay in Qin Mansion.

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
You

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,760
won't never get married.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,680
Manman.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,640
You're my sister from Qin Chu.

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
You deserve the best person in the world.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
But that person

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,680
is definitely not Lu Huai.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,600
Think about it.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
Getting engaged with Shu

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,000
is a good choice.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
You've been in the Qin family for many years.

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,960
but you haven't found it.

74
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,400
the contract signed by the Qin and Shen families.

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
Have you ever thought that

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,400
At this rate,

77
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,320
you'll be exposed anytime.

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,920
I know.

79
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,880
You know?

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Have you thought of a way out for yourself?

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Su.

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,640
I feel sorry

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,960
to drag you into this mess.

84
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,920
Now,

85
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
he treats you well.

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
Stop it.

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
Unless I can safely send you out of Qin Mansion.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Pour me a glass of milk.

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Miss.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,200
This is the maid Young Master arranged for you.

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,000
You can call me Bao.

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Didn't I tell you?

93
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Lu Huai is with me.

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
It doesn't mean that I won't follow you.

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,760
Lu Huai will protect you when you go out.

96
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,720
But in Qin Mansion,

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,840
just let Bao follow you.

98
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
Where is my brother?

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
I want to talk to him.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,840
Young Master.

101
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,320
In the study.

102
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
Miss.

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,600
Wait!

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Miss.

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,080
Young Master is in the middle of business.

106
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,200
There are important guests in the study.

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,720
I suggest you go there later.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
What guest?

109
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,320
The Qin family is a distinguished guest.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
But it's different this time.

111
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
What happened?

112
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,880
The ship was transported out of order.

113
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
The spices given to the Shen family on time

114
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,640
to the Shen Family on time.

115
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,960
As you know,

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,760
the Shen family and Qin family have always been friendly.

117
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,320
But

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
there was a big mistake this time.

119
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
I heard that Master Shen is very angry.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
You just said

121
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,440
this is Master Shen’s order?

122
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,440
The Shen and Qin families are close.

123
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,080
Everyone in Yan City knows it.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
But this time, the North Commander ordered Shen Ji.

125
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,400
If Shen Ji can’t deliver the goods,

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,920
the consequences will be unimaginable.

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,920
So this time I invited your steward

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
to ask for your help.

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,880
As long as the spice is solved,

130
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,200
I’ll give you

131
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll give you ten times the original amount.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,720
But Young Master Qin knows

133
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
this matter

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
can't be solved with money.

135
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,040
Young Master Qin may not know

136
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
the director of Huasheng

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
was my master.

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,280
Who should I

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
for his death?

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,559
What do you want me to do

141
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,840
do?

142
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
It's simple.

143
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
Kneel before me

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,320
and kowtow to my master three times.

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll help you with this.

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,840
Why is my master dead?

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,160
Young Master Qin is precious.

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,280
He doesn't even kneel.

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
Who are you?

150
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
How dare you make my brother kneel?

151
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,000
Qin Chu Shi, is this your attitude?

152
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,320
Young Master Qin.

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Calm down.

154
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
I was just kidding.

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,000
Young Master.

156
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,000
What should we do?

157
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Tell him to get lost.

158
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,280
Get lost!

159
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Manman.

160
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
Don't do this again.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,680
Wu.

162
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,080
Prepare the gift.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Go to Shen’s Restaurant with me.

164
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Why?

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,040
I have to do something

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,320
for my brother.

167
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,160
You don't have to follow me today.

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Take care if you're hurt.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,400
I asked Wu to buy some gifts.

170
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,320
On the other hand, it's about the little beggar that kept you waiting.

171
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,320
One side.

172
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,880
For the matters of the Qin family,

173
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
I haven't taken over

174
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280
the business of the Shen Family.

175
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,520
I can’t change my father’s mind

176
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
at this critical moment.

177
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,320
But

178
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,600
if you become a member of the Shen family,

179
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
Father

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,040
will never break off with the Qin family.

181
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,640
If you blame us,

182
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,120
he'll still take the Qin family's life.

183
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Even so,

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,680
you are still willing to marry the Qin family.

185
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,000
to marry the Qin family.

186
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,720
Little Stutterer, sing.

187
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
I'll let you go after singing.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,040
Sing!

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,160
I want to tell my dad.

190
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
What are you doing?

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay, sing a song.

192
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,840
I'll stop.

193
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,680
Hurry.

194
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
I stutter.

195
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,200
No no no no friends

196
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,840
You can laugh at me

197
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,520
with them.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,040
I hate kids chirping the most.

199
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,080
It's good to be quiet like you.

200
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,120
As long as you speak more,

201
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,920
more,

202
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,000
It'll be smooth soon.

203
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,200
Really?

204
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,320
Yes.

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
The parrots in Qin Mansion

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
learn how to talk.

207
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm not lying.

208
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Manman.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,840
Manman, where are you?

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,920
Coming.

211
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
I have to go.

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
Don't let anyone bully you again.

213
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,280
Okay.

214
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,360
Page book.

215
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
Like you said,

216
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,280
business and marriage can't be mixed up.

217
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,120
I’ll think about

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,280
I'll think about it.

219
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
This time, I won't just look at your back.

220
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,800
I'll stand right next to you.

221
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Alright.

222
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Don't worry.

223
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
Manman must have a reason

224
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
for her reasons.

225
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
I know what she wants to do.

226
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,680
Shu has feelings for her.

227
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,120
She wants to trade herself for the safety of the Qin family.

228
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,120
No.

229
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,520
I need to go to the Shen Family.

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,840
I worked so hard

231
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
because I wanted you to do whatever you want.

232
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,400
But in the end,

233
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,840
I ended up selling my sister.

234
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
It's not that serious.

235
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
Maybe Manman and Young Master Shen

236
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
love each other.

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Why not?

238
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
No.

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,200
I know Manman.

240
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,480
If she's kind to her,

241
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
she won't hesitate.

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't want you and Manman

243
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
to sacrifice for the Qin family.

244
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,080
I know what to do.

245
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,040
Stop solving any problems for me, okay?

246
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760
I can protect you.

247
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,400
Brother.

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,280
I know you care about me.

249
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
Mrs. Qin.

250
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,560
Look.

251
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,000
My sister is a crying baby.

252
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
You have no idea.

253
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
when you were not home,

254
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,600
your brother was walking around the house.

255
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,080
and almost broke the floor.

256
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,920
There's something wrong with the ship schedule.

257
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
There must be a mole in the Qin family.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Miss.

259
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
Come to my room.

260
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,440
But Young Master told me

261
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,360
you can come as you wish.

262
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,680
I saw it.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
You came out of his study just now.

264
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
It was the same last time.

265
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Are you the mole the Qin family mentioned?

266
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,640
Miss.

267
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,440
The way you hold a gun

268
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,160
is getting more standard.

269
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,440
I'll shoot if you come any closer.

270
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't think I dare not.

271
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,640
Of course you dare.

272
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,200
But Lu Huai

273
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,800
didn't deserve to die.

274
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
Third Master.

275
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
sent a letter from abroad

276
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
to Young Master's study by mistake.

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,960
Lu Huai went to get it.

278
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,319
Luckily, Young Master didn't find it.

279
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Lu Huai.

280
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,680
I was really scared just now.

281
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,560
I was afraid that you were the mole my brother mentioned.

282
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,600
I've never been afraid of anything.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,160
Luckily, you are not.

284
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,040
Lu Huai.

285
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,480
I swear

286
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
to you.

287
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,880
The moon shines on the moon.
