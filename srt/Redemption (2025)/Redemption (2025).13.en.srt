1
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,680
Father is seriously ill and unconscious.

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,760
He still refuses to mention it when he's awake.

3
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,039
If you want to know what happened back then,

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm afraid it won't go your way.

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Do you want me to come here in person?

6
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,880
Lu Huai.

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,800
What should I do with you?

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,200
We've finally gathered all the spices.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,479
Don't worry, Young Master.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,520
The spices have been sent to Shen's factory.

11
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,800
Anything else?

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
The newspapers outside

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,400
The headlines are about

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,800
about Young Master Shen and Young Master.

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,960
Chu.

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
Young Master Shen is here.

17
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,600
You came at the right time

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Everyone in Yan City is talking about Manman's wedding today.

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,760
Shu,

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Aren't you too impatient?

21
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,040
I misunderstood.

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,560
My parents were too happy

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,880
and spread the news.

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Right.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
I know her character.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
You won't spread

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
without a conclusion.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
Right?

29
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Of course.

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,640
But my relationship with Manzhi

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
is deeper than you think.

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll say the same thing.

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,240
My sister has to agree to it.

34
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,079
Manzhi, let's go.

35
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,560
About the spices,

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Qin Chu was lucky.

37
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
Boss, don't be angry.

38
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
Don't mention him.

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
Bad luck.

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Any news about Zhi Xiang?

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
I heard that Third Master is seriously ill.

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,560
Things have changed.

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Boss.

44
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,360
Qin Manzhi seems to be investigating Third Master.

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,159
She's investigating Zhi Xiang.

46
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Did she find out anything?

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Go.

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
Ask Lu Huai to find a way to stop his lady.

49
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,600
Don't let her investigate further.

50
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,400
Yes.

51
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,040
I solved the spices in the beginning.

52
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Father is very happy.

53
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't worry too much.

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,400
My brother worked all night

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
to solve this.

56
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
He's always very capable.

57
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Mr and Mrs.

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
You even brought your friends here today.

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm her fiance.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,120
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

61
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Sorry, sir.

62
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,640
Look at my eyes.

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,400
I want to customize a wedding dress for my fiancee.

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
Okay.

65
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,560
Too...

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Miss,

67
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
please come with me.

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Lu Huai.

69
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
Mr. Shen wants to see me?

70
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,840
Since you’re here,

71
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
pick a suit.

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll pay.

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Lu Huai is from Qin Mansion.

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
I can't trouble you.

75
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
There's no difference between us.

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,840
Your people are mine.

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
He'll come to our wedding too.

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
It’s not good to be too shabby

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,880
Young Master Shen is right

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,480
On your wedding day,

81
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,680
Lu Huai

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
must dress up.

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
I'll give you a hand when you're done.

84
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Ordinary.

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
suits your status.

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,040
You should know who you are.

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Do you really think

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
I love you?

89
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
Look.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Do you mind?

91
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
It's okay.

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,840
Don’t worry, Young Master Shen

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,920
You know what?

94
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
It suits you better.

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
Try it on.

96
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,640
No wonder everyone thought

97
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
everyone thought he was from some family.

98
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,039
He's no worse than a nobleman.

99
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,159
Oh my god. I can't even tell who the groom is.

100
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,080
Lu Huai, what's wrong with your suit?

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,520
Young Master Shen accidentally stepped on it.

102
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,560
Let me take a photo

103
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
I stepped on it.

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,040
But I...

105
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
didn't mean it.

106
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I don't have to target you.

107
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
Am I right?

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,640
The page book doesn't need to target Lu Huai.

109
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,960
But the suit was dirty.

110
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
so I threw it away.

111
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,240
Lu Huai, I'll buy you another set.

112
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
It's all my fault.

113
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,440
He asked me to buy a new set for Ziqiu Lu.

114
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,600
Forget it.

115
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Page book.

116
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm here today to tell you something.

117
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
Manzhi.

118
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
We finally reunited.

119
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
I still hope you can think about it.

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's talk later.

121
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,560
It's hard to make an appointment with the chef here.

122
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,640
I begged my father to queue for a long time.

123
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,160
I thought

124
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
you must be the most beautiful bride

125
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,000
you will be the most beautiful bride in Yan City.

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
Chinese wedding

127
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
or a western wedding,

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
it's all up to you.

129
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Are you okay?

130
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm fine.

131
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,000
I was too impatient.

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,280
Manzhi,

133
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
I really want to marry you.

134
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,400
Miss.

135
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
I sprained my ankle today.

136
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
It's better to apply some medicine.

137
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,360
Does it hurt?

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
I'll be gentle.

139
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
What if Lu Huai

140
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
I suddenly want to escape?

141
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,680
If you want to run away,

142
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
no matter where you go,

143
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,320
Lu Huai.

144
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
to the end.

145
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,000
Miss.

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,080
Miss, look

147
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
You and Young Master Shen are a perfect match

148
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,120
What do you mean?

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,560
Let bygones be bygones.

150
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
It's just fate.

151
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,320
Miss, you are...

152
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
This can't be too thick.

153
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,240
If you feel uncomfortable, you can ask Young Master to do it.

154
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,240
This is my own business.

155
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,240
I can't make you worry every time.

156
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
This is too bland.

157
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,320
Young master.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,160
Manzhi, why are you here?

159
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,760
Sit.

160
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,440
Ms. Qin.

161
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
You're finally here.

162
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
Our young master is so thoughtful.

163
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
He made dozens of different colors of rouge.

164
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,920
When the time comes,

165
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
when you get married.

166
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,720
I haven't found a suitable one yet.

167
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
You made

168
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,360
all these rouge yourself?

169
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,640
Not really.

170
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,800
I don't know how to make rouge.

171
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,800
I just want to give advice on the color.

172
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,360
Manzhi asked me here today

173
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,840
to tell me?

174
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Passbook.

175
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
I can't marry you.

176
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
Let's call off the engagement.

177
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
The moon shines on the moon.
