1
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,600
Did I wake you?

2
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,200
You're going back?

3
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,960
You're still the same.

4
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
You never stayed out.

5
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,880
I have something to deal with at Qin Mansion.

6
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,920
You think too much.

7
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
I didn't want to stay overnight with you.

8
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,360
I'm happy with the night of the Spring Festival.

9
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Your clothes are strange

10
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
It smells good.

11
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

12
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Nonsense.

13
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Did someone gossip in your ear?

14
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,720
It's not easy to be my sister-in-law.

15
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,840
But

16
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,000
it's not impossible for Sister Zhou.

17
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,960
What?

18
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,600
You think Miss Zhou is the most famous in the world?

19
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,880
No way.

20
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
What's wrong with a singer?

21
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
As the eldest daughter of the Qin family,

22
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,160
I slept on the street and became a beggar.

23
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Manman.

24
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400
I didn't mean that.

25
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
It's all in the past.

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,279
Don't ever mention it to anyone again.

27
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Okay?

28
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
I'll go back to my room.

29
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,840
Wait.

30
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
What were you doing

31
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,159
What did you do?

32
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
I went to Shen's Restaurant

33
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
to Shen's.

34
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,480
and ran into Mr. Shen.

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,880
and had a chat.

36
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
By the way, Young Master Shen

37
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
asked me to give this to you

38
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,560
They met.

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,960
Yes.

40
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,920
Okay.

41
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
Then why did you

42
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
come back later than Manman?

43
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,640
I just went to the company to see Young Master.

44
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,680
But you were not there.

45
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
I failed.

46
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,200
Plus, Lu Huai was walking.

47
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,120
It took a long time.

48
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,360
Come here.

49
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,880
Miss

50
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Didn’t you meet Young Master Shen?

51
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you need to act?

52
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,720
I've only met Young Master Shen a few times.

53
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,840
I'm not sure yet.

54
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,960
He's the person I'm looking for.

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Do you think

56
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
the top girl in the big world is pretty?

57
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,920
Answer me.

58
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not angry.

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,880
Beautiful.

60
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,159
But not as pretty as you.

61
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
Right.

62
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,400
Nose.

63
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,080
I don't mean to compete with Sister Zhou.

64
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,040
I think she's nice and pretty.

65
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
There's no reason why he doesn't like her.

66
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,600
The backstage is where girls get changed.

67
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,840
Young Master Qin.

68
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
You'd better come less.

69
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Lu Huai told me

70
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,400
you met Shu.

71
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Speaking of which,

72
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
when you were out there,

73
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
Later, I brought you back to the Qin Mansion

74
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
and held a banquet.

75
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Shu is here too.

76
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
You mean

77
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
he's here too?

78
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,480
The young master is here too.

79
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,640
Impossible.

80
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,960
If he comes,

81
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
I will definitely recognize him.

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,720
What?

83
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,000
fall in love with Seo so soon?

84
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,520
Brother.

85
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,400
Qin Chu was already the scapegoat.

86
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,760
Mr. Mo asked you to add more fire.

87
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,880
This time we got Steward Xu's letter.

88
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
There's something between him and Mak Moon.

89
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

90
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,240
to see what Mo Wen is up to.

91
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,000
It's Young Master.

92
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,480
This is today's newspaper.

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
First, the boat ticket.

94
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
Now it's Mr. Huang.

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
You know.

96
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,040
I don't like being forced.

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,040
How did you know I bought a ticket?

98
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,680
Didn't you tell me on purpose?

99
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,200
Are you so sure

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
I have to marry you?

101
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Of course not.

102
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Since the newspaper has been published,

103
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,400
everyone knows you have a close relationship with Mr. Huang.

104
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
You're right.

105
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,480
If it wasn't to make you happy,

106
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
he wouldn't have helped you.

107
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,320
Qin Chu,

108
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't go too far.

109
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Although I'm a singer,

110
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
not everyone can bully me.

111
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm not.

112
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Even if I marry Mr. Huang,

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
how can you explain to me?

114
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,440
I'm in no position.

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Right.

116
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm in no position.

117
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,960
Fine.

118
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,480
If you want to leave Yan City, I'll send you there myself.

119
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,520
If you want to be Mr. Huang's eighteenth wife,

120
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,640
I'll prepare a big gift for you.

121
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,480
Miss.

122
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Brother.

123
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Oppa

124
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,120
Why are you so drunk?

125
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
Joo Ryu

126
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Joo Ryu

127
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,640
What happened?

128
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Miss Zhou Liu

129
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,440
seems to go to Nancheng with Mr. Huang.

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,120
Zhou Liu.

131
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Lu Huai.

132
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
Lu Huai.

133
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Lu Huai.

134
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Miss.

135
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,360
What's wrong?

136
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,040
Hurry up.

137
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
Go now.

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,040
and invite Sister Zhou here.

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,560
Okay.

140
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,560
Sister Zhou, my brother

141
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
is very bad at coaxing people.

142
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,560
He may seem calm,

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,840
but he actually cares a lot.

144
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's not talk about this.

145
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,760
Actually, I'm here today

146
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,480
Brother, while Sister Zhou is here,

147
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,800
you should talk it out.

148
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Get out.

149
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Don't you understand?

150
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Get out!

151
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,280
Brother, Sister Zhou is my guest.

152
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,000
You can't kick her out.

153
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Young master, have some tea and calm down.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,720
Be careful.

155
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,560
Manman, are you okay?

156
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
I didn't mean it.

157
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
Actually, I'm here today

158
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
to send an invitation to Miss Manzhi.

159
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't mean anything else.

160
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Please don't vent your anger on others.

161
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm leaving now.

162
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
Wait, Miss Zhou.

163
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,920
What invitation did you say?

164
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
This is my last performance in the Great World.

165
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Welcome to watch

166
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,080
Handsome, let's dance together.

167
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,480
Someone invited you to dance.

168
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,560
Why don't you go?

169
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,720
I have my duty.

170
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
I can't leave Miss.

171
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,600
I allow you to leave.

172
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,960
But Lu Huai

173
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
can't dance.

174
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I'll teach you to dance

175
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,240
I'll teach you how to dance.

176
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,360
You're so clumsy.

177
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,960
You weren't like this when you were acting with me.

178
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,760
Yes.

179
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
It's my fault.

180
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I let you down.

181
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,160
Lu Huai.

182
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Change it immediately.

183
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,960
What's wrong?

184
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,680
Did Lu Huai do something wrong?

185
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
Others

186
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,280
dance like this.

187
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,360
It's okay.

188
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,040
Well done.

189
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,920
You danced well.

190
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,760
Of course, Miss.

191
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
You taught me well.

192
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,000
