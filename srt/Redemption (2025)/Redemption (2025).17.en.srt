1
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Being with you

2
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,520
to be with you.

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Miss.

4
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,800
Have a good rest.

5
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Lu Huai.

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,160
Miss.

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Where did you get this?

8
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,240
I accidentally got it when I was young.

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm just curious.

11
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
You never mentioned your childhood.

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,000
Why did you secretly keep this box of rouge?

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
A gift from an old friend.

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
He said

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,440
this is the one and only rouge in the world.

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
She is that little beggar.

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Qin Manzhi.

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,280
How could it be you?

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
Young Master, hide inside first.

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
The entrance is too small.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
I can't get through.

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
Young Master, hide inside first.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,079
What about you? I have my own way.

24
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't worry.

25
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Look over there.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,760
Is anyone alive?

27
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,640
Young Master, hide well.

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll call for help.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
I'll be back soon.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,880
It has been

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
for more than ten years.

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Miss.

33
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,560
Why do you still keep it?

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,680
Looking at the old things, missing the old ones.

35
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,760
I don't want to throw it away.

36
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Is it a coincidence?

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
How did he know I've been wearing rouge for more than ten years?

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,160
If Young Master knows that I've been looking for him for so many years,

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,040
I wonder if he will laugh at me.

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,520
Of course not.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
It's his blessing

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,360
is his blessing.

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
You asked me

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,680
why I was nice to that little beggar?

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
I saw myself

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,160
on her.

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Who would have thought...

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
the daughter of the Qin family

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
was once a beggar on the street.

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Yesterday passed away.

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Miss.

52
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
I won't be wronged anymore.

53
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920
What if someone

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,080
and the Qin family?

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Lu Huai.

56
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,840
I swear to protect you.

57
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Remember what you said.

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't let me down.

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,160
I never thought

60
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,520
that we would meet again like this.

61
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I thought you died in the fire.

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,200
But you became the daughter of the Qin family.

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
There are many people in the car.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
You must take good care of her.

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,640
Please give this rouge to her.

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,560
Tell her it's from an old friend.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,440
Okay.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,600
Boss, don't worry.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
I will return it to its owner.

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,680
and take you as my ancestor.

71
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
If she loses a hair,

72
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I'll punish you.

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
Forgive me for not being able to stand in front of you

74
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
as Gu Chi.

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,080
But I've got you out

76
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,160
I've got you out, so I won't send you back.

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
I couldn't find anyone in the south and the east.

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I'll take someone to the north of the city today.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Let's split up.

80
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
I'll send someone to the west of the city.

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Shu.

82
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm sorry for Manman.

83
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,680
I don't blame her.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Young Master, a farmer in the west of the city said he saw you.

85
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
Ouch!

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Be careful.

87
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,800
It's complicated in the west of the city.

88
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,560
Why would Manman go there?

89
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Yes, Young Master.

90
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
The person who sent the letter is not clear.

91
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm afraid it's a trap.

92
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
Why don't I go and check again?

93
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
It's been so many days.

94
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
I wonder how Manman is doing.

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,520
I can't wait any longer.

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Young Master, Mowen is in the west of the city.

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Find out the location.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't tell anyone.

99
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

100
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
Young Master!

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Young Master.

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,760
How is it?

103
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
We can't find him in the north of the city.

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Go.

105
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,440
Inform all newspaper companies.

106
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
The daughter of the Qin family eloped before marriage.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
I want everyone in Yan City to know

108
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,040
she owes me

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
I have to pay it back for the rest of my life

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Siu-shun will do it right away

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Manzhi

112
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
You can't escape.

113
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
Why are you in a hurry?

114
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
Where are you going?

115
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Xiaowu has news about Manman.

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
I need to go there.

117
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,760
Ask the kitchen to prepare some Manman's favorite dishes.

118
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,120
Chu.

119
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Madam.

120
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,280
A child sent it.

121
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
He wants you to come in person.

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,240
Did you bring someone with you when you went out?

123
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,520
He brought a lot of people.

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
That's good.

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,280
He should be safe with his men.

126
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,720
Manman.

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
I'll go buy something later.

128
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,120
One pan-fried bun, please.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Newspaper!

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
Be careful. Are you okay?

131
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,400
Are you Lu Huai?

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,680
Miss Liu asked me to tell you

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,560
this is a trap.

134
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,720
Don't expose your identity.

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Let's go. It's not safe here.

136
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,480
The train is leaving.

137
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Why did you bring me here?

138
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,680
There are many people at the station.

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
Be careful.

140
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,800
It's safer here.

141
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
You always want to buy me butterfly pastry.

142
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
What about you?

143
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,480
Do you like it?

144
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
Lu Huai is a rough man.

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,200
Forget about the butterfly pastry.

146
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,040
But I like the pan-fried buns

147
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
I like it.

148
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
I'll get going. Wait here.

149
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
Shadow.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,840
Ms. Qin.

151
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,520
I advise you to stop moving.

152
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
Our boss is waiting to see you.

153
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,040
Lu Huai.

154
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Are you crazy?

155
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,560
Boss asked you to stop Qin Manzhi from investigating Third Master.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,080
But you want to protect her to go abroad.

157
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,160
I told you.

158
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,600
Don't touch her.

159
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
Boss, you can't explain it.

160
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
I'll let you go first.

161
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Fine.

162
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
You should end your delusion as soon as possible.

163
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I gave you a chance.

164
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
You didn't cherish it.

165
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,600
You...

166
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,760
noticed it long ago.

167
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
The Qin family has a mailbox that I receive specially.

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,120
My letter

169
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
to my brother's study.

170
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
That day, I knew

171
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
you were lying.

172
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,120
A mantis catches a cicada.

173
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
The Yellow Bird is behind.

174
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
Miss.

175
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,200
Did you have fun?

176
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,360
It's you who set me up.

177
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,920
and made me...

178
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,440
and the entire Qin family look extremely ridiculous.

179
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,360
You risked your life to save me many times.

180
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,920
I thought you were worried about my life.

181
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Now that I think about it,

182
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
it was just a trick.

183
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,760
If I leave today,

184
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,920
We both know it.

185
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,080
But the shadow is waiting for me here.

186
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,200
You never

187
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
take me away from here.

188
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,400
It's not what you think.

189
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,040
I won't believe a word of a traitor.

190
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Get lost!

191
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,600
If Lu Huai hadn't protected you these years,

192
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
you would have been buried underground.

193
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,520
You?

194
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
You want to kill me?

195
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't force me to fight you.

196
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,040
Let them go.

197
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
You're so stubborn.

198
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,320
You've saved her several times.

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
I don't owe her anymore.

200
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,080
Qin Manzhi,

201
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,240
If you show mercy this time,

202
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,520
Lu Huai will use a gun to aim at my brother next time.

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Yes, we are even now.

204
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,080
Can you give me another chance to protect her?

205
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,520
Lu Huai.

206
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
Open your eyes and see

207
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,320
How did the person

208
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,280
What did he do to you?

209
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,840
Miss.

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,760
This is the farewell gift

211
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
you prepared for me.

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,960
I won't kill you today.

213
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,360
I'll take you back to the Qin family to apologize.

214
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
But she...

215
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,760
must die.

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,560
Ms. Qin, how dare you!

217
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,240
You're not capable.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Let's try then.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,480
I already know that Mowen is the second head of the Qin family.

220
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
Tell me where he is.

221
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
I can make you die more comfortably.

222
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,720
Dream on.

223
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,280
Listen to me.

224
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,280
What?

225
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,040
You want to use me to surrender to the Qin family?

226
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
You introduced me to Mo Wen.

227
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
If we break up,

228
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,080
he will still believe you.

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,880
Don't be silly.

230
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,480
It's not too late to go with me now.

231
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
Don't cut off your way back.

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
There's no turning back.

233
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,040
Let's go.

234
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,360
Leave no one behind.

235
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Wait.

236
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,480
Are you really going to kill Lu Huai?

237
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,560
Traitor!

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
Manman.

239
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,240
Let's go.

240
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
This shot missed.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,040
Next time we meet,

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
I won't spare your life.

243
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,040
The moon shines on the moon.
