1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,360
Miss.

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you remember?

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,880
The dress I had custom-made for you back then.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,320
I promised

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,450
I would make you the most beautiful bride in Yan City.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,380
Now the dress has arrived.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,360
Try it on.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Hurry and help Miss Qin get dressed.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,120
I'm sorry, Miss.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,280
I can't do it.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,300
I've never blamed you.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,240
Miss,

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,320
hold on.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,450
Madam will surely come to save you.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,039
Abo!

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,160
Abo!

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,240
Don't try to resist.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,440
The more you resist, the more you'll lose.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
Drive faster!

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
It's Madam.

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
I hope we're not too late.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Mo Wen.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,280
Where is Qin Manzhi?

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,520
That's none of your business.

25
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,920
Now

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,440
let's play a game.

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
This gun

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
has three bullets.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Each time you pull the trigger,

30
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,320
the cylinder rotates two chambers automatically.

31
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,520
You'll use this gun.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Each person gets one chance to shoot at the other.

33
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,600
Whoever survives

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,000
will be allowed to attend Miss Manzhi and Young Master Shen's wedding.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
How dare you treat Manman like this!

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
Mowen,

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,079
people like you belong in hell.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,440
Qin Chushi.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,360
The angrier you get, the happier I feel.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,180
Mowen, you play the part of a petty man

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,500
who's drunk with success perfectly.

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
My nephew is angry with me.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,360
I won't hold it against you.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
This time, the first move

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
is yours.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,640
You must make good use of this opportunity.

47
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,560
Make this traitor

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
die as he deserves.

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,010
Aren't you afraid I'll shoot you dead?

50
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,520
Unless

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,920
you want Qin Manzhi to die before me.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Begin.

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,690
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,080
But I never thought it would be in a place like this.

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,280
Manzhi.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
You look even more beautiful

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
in that dress than I imagined.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
I've done as you asked.

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Where are my brother and Lu Huai?

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,880
When the time comes,

61
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
you'll find out.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,920
You usually have quite a temper.

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,520
I didn't expect

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,570
you'd be so nice to your sister.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,120
Cut the crap and shoot!

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,880
The third bullet is jammed in the fourth chamber.

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,340
Statistically speaking, there's still...

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880
It's the Qin family's people.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Madam, the young master instructed us

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
to follow you.

71
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Given the current situation,

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
would you like to...?

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,680
Surround this house and search!

74
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Find them alive if possible,

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,640
or dead if necessary.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
Qin Chushi,

77
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,120
I've always wanted to ask you something.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,980
If you were given another chance,

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,409
on the day my family was massacred,

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,010
would you stop your father?

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
No.

82
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,570
The Qin family needed to rise to power.

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,060
There was no other choice.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,360
How brave of you.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,440
Lu Huai.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh no,

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Gu Chi,

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,880
what are you waiting for?

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,620
You think I'll let you manipulate me?

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
Kill me,

91
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,280
and you'll all die with me.

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,200
I've already made up my mind.

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Whether you shoot or not,

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,060
the Qin family,

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Qin Chushi,

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,960
what the Qin family owes you,

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
I'll pay it back.

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Brother.

99
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Manman.

100
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Manman.

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Don't cry.

102
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,080
Someone from our Qin family has to die.

103
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Save her.

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Qin Chushi.

105
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
Brother,

106
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,280
no!

107
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,280
Don't leave Manman behind.

108
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Let her go.

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,880
I know exactly what gun

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
you're holding.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,580
You only have one bullet left.

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
Even if you shoot,

113
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,159
it might be empty.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,159
But my gun

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
never misses.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Come back or I'll shoot.

117
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,320
Miss.

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Brother.

119
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
Brother.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
Qin Chushi.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Lu Huai.

122
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,320
Manman.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Where are you?

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
The nearby warehouse exploded.

125
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,660
This house won't hold.

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,680
Forgive me, madam.

127
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
We promised the young master

128
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
to keep you safe.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
Lu Huai.

130
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
Miss.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you

132
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,800
for saving me again.

133
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
It's bad!

134
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,210
Mo Wen chose this place deliberately.

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
The cellar is about to collapse.

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Let's go quickly.

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Brother.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,640
Brother.

139
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Brother.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Manzhi.

141
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,540
The young master is already dead.

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,360
He wants you to live on.

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,410
He wants you to survive.

144
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,240
Let's go.

145
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Manzhi,

146
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,120
stay here.

147
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
We couldn't share a life together,

148
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,040
but we'll share the same grave in death.

149
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,080
You go first.

150
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Miss, hurry and go.

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,880
Hurry!

152
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,680
Quick!

153
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Go!

154
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Now!

155
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
Gu Chi.

156
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Gu Chi,

157
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
give me your hand.

158
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
Give me your hand!

159
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,680
Miss.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,400
This is the first time

161
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,280
I've heard you call me by my name, Gu Chi.

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,840
It sounds nice.

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll call you that many more times in the future.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,720
Hurry up and give me your hand.

165
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,980
I've already decided.

166
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,040
Either I take you out of here,

167
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,640
or you take my body out.

168
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,200
But either way,

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,880
you will survive.

170
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,760
From now on,

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,020
you are part of the Qin family.

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,800
When I first entered the Qin household,

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
I hated myself.

174
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
Just a guard.

175
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,320
But...

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,120
But I've never regretted

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
becoming Qin Manzhi's guard.

178
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
I know.

179
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
I know everything.

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320
While there's still a chance, Lu Huai,

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
I forbid you to give up.

182
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,120
Qin Manzhi, you must get out of here.

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,920
Forget Gu Chi.

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,600
Forget Lu Huai.

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,680
Live well.

186
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,560
Start anew.

187
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
Gu Chi!

188
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,280
Gu Chi!

189
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't touch me.

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,680
It's alright, sister-in-law.

191
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,240
If you're tired,

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,560
you should rest.

193
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,840
I...

194
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,080
I can find my brother and Gu Chi.

195
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
They're gone.

196
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,680
That's impossible.

197
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
Gu Chi and my brother are waiting for me.

198
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm not tired.

199
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,520
I'm not tired.

200
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
I hate my own helplessness.

201
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,480
I couldn't save my brother,

202
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
nor could I save you.

203
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,180
You said you never regretted becoming my guardian.

204
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
But from this moment,

205
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,050
I suddenly regret meeting you.

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,600
I've lost you.

207
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
If it weren't for me,

208
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,760
at this very moment,

209
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
what would your life be like?

210
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,080
I imagined many endings, but never thought

211
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
I would never have my brother again.

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
And Gu Chi,

213
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
since I woke up,

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
has disappeared without a trace.

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Sister-in-law refuses to speak about what happened that day.

216
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,130
I arranged to meet the lady here at seven o'clock.

217
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,200
The time now

218
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,040
is just right.

219
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
I think

220
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll never see him again.

221
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,520
Miss,

222
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
I've finally waited for you.

223
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
You are...

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
A client paid me a large sum earlier

225
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,000
to take you to the train.

226
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,000
And instructed me to give this to you.

227
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,240
I originally planned to take the money and run.

228
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
But my wife said,

229
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
with such a large sum,

230
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,900
I should at least fulfill my obligation.

231
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,840
Rouge as new,

232
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
start over again.

233
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,920
So you

234
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,480
had already made new rouge for me.

235
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
You never

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
intended to take me away.

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
This isn't what you think.

238
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,440
Shut up.

239
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,680
I once hated you for using my trust,

240
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,400
until today I finally understand

241
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
that you were the one who always believed in me.

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,560
You never wavered,

243
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
never gave up protecting me.

244
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Gu Chi.

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,680
You always told me to start over.

246
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,360
But from now on,

247
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,000
through the long years ahead,

248
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,920
the one I'll think of is you,

249
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,520
but the one I meet won't be you.

250
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
My remaining life will be restless.

251
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,360
Rouge as new.

252
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Start over again.

253
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,690
I knew you were still alive.

254
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,850
The doctors wanted to give up on me many times.

255
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,970
But I thought of you waiting for me.

256
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
I didn't dare to die.

257
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:56,840
Yue Zijiao, Yue Zhenbai's love.
