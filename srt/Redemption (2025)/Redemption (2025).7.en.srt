1
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,160
Come on, SHA. Let's go.

2
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,760
Sister Zhou

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Have you really decided to leave?

4
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I bought this with my first reward in the opera circle.

5
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,920
I keep it with me for good luck.

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,320
Since you call me sister,

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,880
I have to accept it.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,000
Farewell.

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,960
Miss, don't move.

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
Don't look back.

11
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,280
There's an ambush behind.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
You go first.

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,280
Manzhi.

14
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
It's me.

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,400
Page book.

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Save Lu Huai.

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,720
Go save Lu Huai.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,520
Don't worry.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,680
My men will be here soon. Go save him.

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,079
Let's go.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Stop!

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,320
You're running fast.

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,880
Do you think the boy beside you

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,920
can protect you?

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
Who sent you?

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
If you offend the Shen family and the Qin family,

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm afraid it's not easy in Yan City.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,720
With your weak look,

29
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
We can't afford to offend you.

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,760
Don't move.

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,200
Manzhi.

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,360
You go first.

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
You go first.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
Go!

35
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
You think you can shoot?

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,720
Don't come near me.

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,240
I'll shoot if you come any closer.

38
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Lu Huai.

39
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
Lu Huai.

40
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,400
Miss, I'm late.

41
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
Miss, are you alright?

42
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,040
Lu Huai.

43
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
Young Master Qin, are you waiting for Miss Manzhi?

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,159
She just left.

45
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Young Master Qin won't leave yet.

46
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
Are you here to say goodbye?

47
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,800
I was waiting for you.

48
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,440
Did Mr. Huang kiss you like this?

49
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Do you know

50
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,080
You're in danger now.

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
You can't escape.

52
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,159
You changed your mind?

53
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
Never.

54
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,920
I wanted to marry you

55
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,560
I wanted to marry you.

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,960
I've made up my mind.

57
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Marry you.

58
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,920
Oh.

59
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,560
Didn't you say your life is not in danger?

60
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
Why are you shaking your head?

61
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,800
The old injury is getting worse.

62
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm afraid he won't recover.

63
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
He was injured before,

64
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
but he's been treated.

65
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,640
You're from the Qin family.

66
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,400
When did you become so hesitant?

67
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,440
The wound has salt.

68
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
It won't heal.

69
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
There's salt.

70
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Young Lady Zhen Zhu, I've been treating the Qin family for more than ten years.

71
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
I know

72
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,480
I know your temper.

73
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,720
There's something I can't say directly.

74
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
Is Manzhi asleep?

75
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
She seems to be in a bad mood.

76
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,440
She was sent back by Young Master Shen.

77
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,120
When she came back,

78
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
Lu Huai was injured.

79
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Lu Huai is injured.

80
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,280
You are ambushed again.

81
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,559
They're probably thugs wandering around the big world.

82
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,320
They're different from the last batch.

83
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,640
Are you okay?

84
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Brother.

85
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,360
Are you hiding something from me?

86
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,280
What can I hide from you?

87
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
How many shops do the Qin family have?

88
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
How much is it?

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,480
how much money you have.

90
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,200
You know that's not what I'm talking about.

91
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Forget it.

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
See what I brought you.

93
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Xu's Wonton Shop.

94
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
Didn't you always nag at me?

95
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
It's fine.

96
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
It's cold anyway.

97
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
I'll take you there next time.

98
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,400
Ask someone to sprinkle salt on Lu Huai's wound.

99
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
Was it your order?

100
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,040
So...

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
you're mad at me because of this?

102
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,360
Xiao Wu.

103
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Xiao Wu, bring the medicine kit.

104
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,280
So that's how you think of me.

105
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,360
My brother and I aren't siblings,

106
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
but for the past ten years,

107
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,760
I lived with my brother.

108
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
I know

109
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,920
what kind of person he is.

110
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,880
Since Lu Huai came to Qin Mansion seven years ago,

111
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,480
my brother has never been against him like this.

112
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
Why?

113
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,000
Manman has grown up.

114
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
After my father passed away,

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
you stopped me from getting involved in the Qin family.

116
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,440
You always told me

117
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,480
it was an accident that my father was in danger on the train.

118
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
wasn't it?

119
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
I know you hid it from me to protect me.

120
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,320
I also know that

121
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,080
my brother suspected everyone around me.

122
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,920
You don't have to believe me.

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,640
But today,

124
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,040
he almost died to save me.

125
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,120
If he was a traitor,

126
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
he has thousands of chances to kill me.

127
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll say the same thing.

128
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,480
Lu Huai is my man.

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
I'll punish him.

130
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss.

131
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
The salt on the wound

132
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
on the wound.

133
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
Lu Huai didn't do well enough.

134
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,000
It's self-punishment.

135
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Don't think that after what you said,

136
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
I'll think you're cleared of suspicion.

137
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,800
You worry too much.

138
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,080
Lu Huai.

139
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm loyal to you.

140
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,520
You're old.

141
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,160
It's not appropriate for you

142
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,320
to stay with Manman.

143
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
I will find a suitable maid to replace you.

144
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Lu Huai has been

145
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
since childhood.

146
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't want to.

147
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,640
If you don't want to,

148
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,160
get out of the Qin family.

149
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,520
Stop!

150
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,880
When you get better,

151
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
go to the big world with me.

152
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,200
Yes.

153
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,560
Young Master Qin, you are...

154
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,120
Here's a gift for you.

155
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Do you know Steward Xu?

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I've never met him before.

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
How do you know him?

158
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
He's the murderer who killed Mr. A.

159
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,200
I often see Wu.

160
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,440
Are you new here?

161
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,120
You look unfamiliar.

162
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,640
Really?

163
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,480
My sister's bodyguard.

164
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,840
Help...

165
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't let anyone

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
affect my relationship with Young Master Qin.

167
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,240
Why does he have the cigar for Shu?

168
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
Steward Xu made a good move.

169
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,800
It's my honor

170
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,640
to work with Young Master Qin.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,360
The show is just around the corner.

172
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,960
Wu said you wanted to see me.

173
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,200
How about cigar?

174
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,480
It took me three months to get it.

175
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
What?

176
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
This cigar

177
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,440
Steward Xu from Huasheng also has one.

178
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
My custom-made cigar.

179
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Only one box.

180
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
No similar one.

181
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
How did he get it?

182
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,880
Even the abbreviation of your name on the cigar is the same.

183
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,240
At the beginning,

184
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,160
Did the Shen family work with Huasheng privately?

185
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
I...

186
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Shu.

187
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,840
We've been brothers for years.

188
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
I only want you to be honest.

189
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't.

190
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
The Shen Family didn't either.

191
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,400
There must be a misunderstanding.

192
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
I brought the cigar back to China myself.

193
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
but I didn't give it to you myself.

194
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,520
We both don't know what happened.

195
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,600
You mean

196
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,920
someone did something?

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
Before you got it,

198
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
who touched this box of cigar last?

199
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,840
Mr. Shen asked me to give this to you.

200
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,160
Lu Huai.

201
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
The moon shines on the moon.
