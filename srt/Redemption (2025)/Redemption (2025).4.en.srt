1
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,080
Are you okay?

2
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,480
Just now...

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,720
was my illusion.

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,520
It's Lu Huai.

5
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,479
Why is he pointing a gun at me?

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
But if it wasn't Lu Huai,

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,240
who was the one who shot me just now?

8
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,680
Manzhi.

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,880
Are you okay?

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm fine.

11
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
But...

12
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,640
I think I saw Lu Huai there.

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,480
Are you hurt?

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,079
Wu.

15
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
Have you found out their background?

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,720
Young Master, it's Mowen's men.

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,600
Mak Moon?

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
I felt familiar just now.

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,880
I'm the second head who worked for my father.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,240
Manman.

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,840
You think too much.

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
The second head left Yancheng long ago.

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,079
We just have the same name.

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,640
Manzhi, did that person touch you?

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,200
No.

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
Sister Zhou.

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
Are you okay?

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm fine. I'm used to

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm used to it.

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Stop!

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
You've been following me.

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
I seem to have seen you somewhere.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
You're from the Qin family.

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
Since you're from the Qin family,

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
we are family.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
Why did you...

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,280
Mr. Mo said

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,680
nothing can go wrong this time.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm glad I followed you.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,079
Otherwise...

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
You think too much.

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,640
I'll shoot faster than him.

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,480
Mr. Mo wants to see you.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
Tell me.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
In order to save Qin Manzhi,

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
you almost let Mr. A go.

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
Should I tell Mr. Mo?

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Qin Manzhi can't die now.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Can't die?

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
or you don't want to leave me?

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,839
Wu.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Did you really not see Lu Huai just now?

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,920
It was an emergency.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
Xiaowu was worried about you.

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
I didn't notice the situation outside.

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,320
Is Lu Huai here?

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,760
if Lu Huai is here.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
Go back to Qin Mansion first.

59
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,880
Ouch.

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
The Qin family is here.

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't call me that.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,040
Shut up.

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,840
I'll cut your tongue if you scream again.

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,080
I didn't get rid of Qin Manzhi last time.

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,920
I left a pile of mess.

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Seven years ago,

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,760
I tried so hard

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,320
to send you to the Qin family.

69
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,280
Is this how you repay me?

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm different from your people.

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm not working for you.

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
We're working together.

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
If I get hurt,

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Qin Manzhi will suspect me.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Okay.

76
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,880
Lu Huai,

77
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
You are capable now.

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,840
You're no longer the little boy who kneeled and begged me.

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,400
What do you want from me?

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,480
Since Mr. A is dead,

81
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
someone will come to Qin Chu soon.

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,480
I need your help.

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,200
The shadow didn't say anything.

84
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
But my men

85
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,120
checked Mr. A's body.

86
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
He was stabbed to death.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
If you dare

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,320
to the Qin family,

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
I'll shoot you.

90
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,960
Eight years ago,

91
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
I told you

92
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,200
I told you

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
the Qin family and I

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
blood.

95
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,080
Revenge.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Young master, come with me.

97
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,320
Young Master, hide well. I'll go outside.

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll come back to you.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Gu Ji has no grudge against you.

100
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,840
How could you do this?

101
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,080
Thank you

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,280
Thank you.

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
Thank you.

104
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,640
You asked me to investigate

105
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,040
about the fragrance powder shop 20 years ago.

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
about the fragrance powder shop 20 years ago.

107
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,720
How are you going to thank me?

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,560
We're here.

109
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm getting off.

110
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,440
What you said at the cafe...

111
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,760
Really?

112
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I talked a lot in the cafe.

113
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,320
Which one do you want to know, Young Master Qin?

114
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Young Master Qin.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't be like this.

116
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
You used to call me Chu.

117
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,720
You also said

118
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,640
it was in the past.

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,880
You still care about what happened back then?

120
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
Young Master Qin, you're joking.

121
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I don’t remember.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,520
I didn’t leave you in the opera circle on purpose.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
Something happened to my family.

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,640
I was the only one in the Qin family.

125
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
I had no choice.

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,280
When the Qin family becomes famous again,

127
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Young Master Qin, have you ever thought of looking for me again?

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
I was just kidding.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,880
The earrings I dropped before

130
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,160
I found someone to make a pair of Manzhi.

131
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
It's exactly the same.

132
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
But even so,

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,760
they are no longer the same couple.

134
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
The butterfly pastry you want.

135
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
It's still hot.

136
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Is that you at the cafe today?

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,800
Yes.

138
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm worried about you.

139
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
and followed her.

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Then why did they leave?

141
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
I saw Young Master and the others coming.

142
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,920
I thought they would be fine,

143
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
so I left.

144
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
Besides,

145
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,840
the person you are looking for

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,280
Lu Huai might have found him.

147
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,880
Where is he?

148
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Lu Huai has been investigating some fragrance powder shops in Yan City.

149
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,440
There are only

150
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,240
Just a little.

151
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
After checking them one by one,

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
there are only three.

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,960
They are Shen’s.

154
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,280
Li Ji.

155
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
There's another one.

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
You don't have to check.

157
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
But the taste is not right.

158
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,880
If I have to compete,

159
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,000
only Shen Ji has the most similar taste in my memory.

160
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,840
What’s the third restaurant you mentioned?

161
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,720
Gu Ji.

162
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,840
The biggest fragrance powder shop in Yancheng.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,680
Miss, have you heard that

164
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Gu Ji?

165
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,840
Wasn't it burned down by a fire?

166
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,800
I heard it was revenge by enemies.

167
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
So you

168
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
think so too.

169
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,440
It doesn't matter how Gu Ji disappeared.

170
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,440
I only know

171
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,960
I'm not looking for Young Master Gu.

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,560
Okay.

173
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,400
Next time,

174
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,840
I’ll take you to Shen’s.

175
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
I heard that Mr. Shen

176
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,960
has returned to China recently.

177
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
You mean

178
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,440
you saw Lu Huai go into the room with her?

179
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,120
Keep watching.

180
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
Report to me if anything happens.

181
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes.

182
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,960
Do you need Xiaowu to keep an eye on Lu Huai?

183
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,240
Not for now.

184
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
Shu is back too.

185
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,400
Send him an invitation.

186
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,280
Tell him my cigar is out of stock.

187
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,160
Yes.

188
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,080
Anything else?

189
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,640
Mak Moon has been doing a lot lately.

190
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm worried

191
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,520
I won't be able to hide what happened back then from you.

192
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,280
She's only been back for ten years.

193
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
She suffered so much at such a young age.

194
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,280
[Manman was raised delicately after returning to Qin Mansion.]

195
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,840
[I must not let her know]

196
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,320
I can't let her know what my father did.

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,600
I'll do

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
I'll do it.

199
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,000
She's the moon.

200
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,960
I can't let her get any dust.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,200
Miss.

202
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,520
Stop drinking.

203
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
You can't drink.

204
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Don't drink too much.

205
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I'm happy today.

206
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,840
I want to drink.

207
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,400
The last cup.

208
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,880
I feel

209
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
I will meet the person I miss soon.

210
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,880
Congratulations.

211
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Lu Huai.

212
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
Do you have someone you miss?

213
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,680
You mean...

214
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
now?

215
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
Lu Huai.

216
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
to protect you.

217
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
So you

218
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
the person I miss.

219
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
The person I miss

220
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,440
is not someone I miss.

221
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Be careful.

222
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,040
I knew you would catch me.

223
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,200
The moon shines on the moon
