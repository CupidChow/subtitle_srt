1
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,520
Water.

2
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,200
Water.

3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,320
Water.

4
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,640
Since you got hurt because of me,

5
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,240
I'll get you some water.

6
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,120
Water.

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,759
Get up.

8
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,280
You've been hiding for a long time.

9
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,800
Unfortunately,

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,479
you didn't hide it well this time.

11
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,520
Young Master.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,039
I don't understand what you're talking about.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,560
The cigar Shu gave me is custom-made.

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
Only one box.

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,199
But I saw the same thing in someone else's hands.

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Young Master.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
Are you talking about me stealing?

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
The Qin family

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,079
is generous to me.

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,920
I don't need to be a thief.

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,320
A thief?

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
or are you trying to sow discord

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,680
my relationship with the Shen family.

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Young Master Qin,

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,520
You can suspect Lu Huai,

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
but you can't

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,840
to convict me without evidence.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
Don't forget who you are.

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,480
You have no right to ask me for evidence.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,720
I can sprinkle salt on your wound,

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
or kill you anytime.

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Brother.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,600
Why do you always hold onto Lu Huai?

34
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,960
Lu Huai is suspicious.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you have evidence?

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,360
From when Shu gave him the cigar,

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
to the Qin Mansion,

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
there was a long time between him.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,520
is enough for him to tamper with the cigar.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
This is the evidence.

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I told you the day before yesterday

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
Lu Huai is fine.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,840
You can't be unreasonable when you have a temper.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
He went to the company to see you that day.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,280
but you weren't there.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
he queued up to buy butterfly pastries for me.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Every one of them needs time.

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
It's just a cover.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
You can't touch him until you have no evidence.

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
You must protect him, right?

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
Can't you trust me?

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
At the beginning,

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Don't be angry with your sister.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,040
The cigar is made by Friy, the opium maker.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
Only one box in three months.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
In a short time,

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,320
in a short time.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
We'll find out

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,560
we'll know

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
if someone is stealing the dragon and turning the phoenix.

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,720
At the beginning,

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
I'll talk to him first.

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
Lu Huai.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Are you okay?

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,320
Miss.

66
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,680
Why do you trust me so much?

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,920
I chose you myself.

68
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Why don't I believe it?

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,400
Don't go.

70
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
Stay with me.

71
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,680
Lu Huai.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,080
When I was young, someone was alone and helpless.

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
when I was isolated,

74
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,040
you chose to trust me unconditionally.

75
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,840
I just think

76
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,480
you deserve to be treated like this.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,159
Thank you

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Thank you.

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,080
You're welcome.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
You promised me

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
He will investigate

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
about the cigar.

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,960
He won't be wronged.

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,800
Ziqiu Lu Huai.

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Back then,

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
my father held a banquet for me.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
I heard you were here.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
Yes, I did.

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,680
But

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
I made my father angry that day.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,920
As soon as I arrived,

92
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
I was kicked back.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,880
My brother said you came to the banquet.

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
You didn't even enter the door.

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,800
No wonder I don't remember.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,800
It's okay.

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,440
It's not too late for us to meet now.

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
Then...

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,040
go abroad later?

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
I liked running around when I was young.

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,120
One time, something almost happened.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
My father wanted to control my temper.

103
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,159
so he sent me abroad to study.

104
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Okay, that's it.

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
Take care with your brother.

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,080
You were the closest to him at first.

107
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
If you fight with him for others,

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
for others.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
Please verify it.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
Each cigar

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,760
was made by Master Friey.

112
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
That's right.

113
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,080
One is missing.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
I drew that one.

115
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,080
If there's something wrong with cigar,

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll find it at the entrance.

117
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
Lu Huai did go to the company first that day.

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Then he lined up to buy butterfly pastry for you.

119
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,280
We have witnesses.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,040
This is what you want.

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
You can do that?

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Time is limited.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,320
We can only make one.

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
to Steward Xu.

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Qin Chu was suspicious.

126
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,640
If he saw

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,920
the cigar that Steward Xu drew is from the Shen family,

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,240
He'll definitely hold a grudge against Shen Panshu.

129
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,800
But how can you guarantee that

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
Qin Chu

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,560
he would pick the one you made first.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
I've observed him.

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
Every time he smokes cigar,

134
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
take the one on the left of the box first.

135
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
If he loses his sense of taste when drinking,

136
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,280
it should succeed.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
But on the cigar you made,

138
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,360
on the cigar you made.

139
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,720
If you were found,

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
you'll be exposed immediately.

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,520
Yes.

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Then

143
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
we can only gamble.

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,800
At the beginning.

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
Why are you here so late?

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
About the cigar,

147
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,360
about the cigar.

148
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,320
Yes.

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,200
The cigar has never been switched.

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,440
But...

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,240
Steward Xu's cigar

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
is also true.

153
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,440
At the beginning,

154
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,280
The Shen family has been working with the Qin family for many years.

155
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,120
They're already in the same interest.

156
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,840
I have no reason to betray you.

157
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,640
If you don't trust me,

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,600
I'll persuade my father to sign the contract with you.

159
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,520
for 30 years.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In the past 30 years

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
all raw materials purchase and transportation of the Shen Family

162
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,880
to you.

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm just kidding.

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,480
Look how anxious you are.

165
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
I thought

166
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
the cigar incident

167
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,640
can cause conflicts between the Qin and Shen families.

168
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
so that Qin Chu would think that the Shen family

169
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
and traded with Huasheng directly.

170
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
I didn’t expect

171
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,320
it was easy to dissolve him.

172
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,320
My man is dead.

173
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
If you kill him today,

174
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,280
tomorrow,

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
kill me tomorrow?

176
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,000
I've seen a lot of coward like you.

177
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,360
Boss, what should we do next?

178
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,720
Qin Chu lost so many of my men.

179
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,360
I want him

180
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
pay the price.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Hello.

182
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,480
Hello.

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
Mr. Qin customized suits for the wedding.

184
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,360
We’re here to pick it up.

185
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Okay, wait a moment.

186
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,880
Wang.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
My brother has been cold to me these days.

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
I even came to run errands for him.

189
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
It's Lu Huai's fault.

190
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,680
You got

191
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
because of me.

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,080
He's the one who should apologize.

193
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
His young master wouldn't believe you.

194
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,680
Miss, this is our new style.

195
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,440
You can try it if you like it

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,280
He said I'm old enough to get married

197
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,840
You can try it in advance

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
This is the fitting room.

199
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll bring it to you later.

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,600
Sir.

201
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
Your fiancee is so pretty.

202
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
We're not that kind of...

203
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,600
I'll leave you two alone.

204
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,120
Miss.

205
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,320
Miss.

206
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
You said it was the best tailor shop in Yancheng.

207
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
You can't even make a button.

208
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,000
Lu Huai.

209
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000
I...

210
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,400
Have I gained weight?

211
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
No way.

212
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,160
Miss.

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,280
is the most beautiful.

214
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Lu Huai.

215
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
You are not young anymore.

216
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,640
Have you ever thought about

217
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,440
about getting married?

218
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,840
Lu Huai

219
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,520
All I want is to protect you.

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Don't be afraid.

221
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,760
Don't be afraid.

222
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,440
It's okay.

223
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,360
No bullets.

224
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Miss.

225
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Lu Huai.

226
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,480
I trust you.

227
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
There's an inside passage here.

228
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
Miss, you go first.

229
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,040
What about you?

230
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,400
Trust me. I'll be there soon. Trust me.

231
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,760
Let's go.

232
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
The moon shines on the moon
