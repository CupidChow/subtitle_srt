1
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
This is the seventh year since I sneaked into the Qin family as a bodyguard.

2
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
In order to escape from the marriage,

3
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,360
she often put on a show for Eldest Young Master.

4
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,039
Lu Huai.

5
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to sleep with you.

6
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Why?

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
Don't you want to?

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,759
Miss.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,360
This is not good.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,800
What's wrong?

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,960
You said you'd act with me.

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
If you can't,

13
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,920
I'll find someone else.

14
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
Kiss me.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Are you satisfied?

16
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,560
It's too late for you to regret.

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Lu Huai.

18
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,520
What are you thinking?

19
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
Hurry!

20
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Where are they?

21
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
You've been playing with only three weak shrimps for so long.

22
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,159
You're getting slower.

23
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
I made an appointment with my lady.

24
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,560
at 7 p.m.

25
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
It's just the right time.

26
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Come and help me.

27
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Are you sure

28
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,040
the person I'm looking for is in the Great World?

29
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,240
The world is famous.

30
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,040
I won't let you down.

31
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Put it on.

32
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Except you,

33
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,760
how many pieces have Mo Wen planted in the Qin family?

34
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
Don't you think you're smart?

35
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,280
Guess what?

36
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,480
You know me well.

37
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
But you don't know

38
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm not patient

39
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm very impatient.

40
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't think you can cover the world in Yan City.

41
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,880
Everyone knows that your father started a gang.

42
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
and did all the evil things.

43
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,040
and die without a full body.

44
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
Your father will end up...

45
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Young Master.

46
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
I found you.

47
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,400
She went to the Great World.

48
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
What are we waiting for?

49
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,159
Take her back to Qin Mansion.

50
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
Yes.

51
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,400
Ji-Young.

52
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
Brother can't hide it for long.

53
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Hurry up.

54
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,720
Yes.

55
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
He's not here.

56
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Keep looking for

57
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,800
who is handsome and in his 20s.

58
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,600
There's a journalist over there.

59
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Don't go.

60
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Hug me.

61
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Miss.

62
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
Play with me.

63
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,960
Hey, isn't this Miss Qin?

64
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
She likes to seduce men everywhere.

65
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,640
I heard you want to get the young master of the Shen family involved.

66
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Mr. Shen is from a clean family.

67
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
Why would he like the dirty things in the bandits' den?

68
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Stop it.

69
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Don't you know who her brother is?

70
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,280
Do you want to die?

71
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
People are watching.

72
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
What can she do to me?

73
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
You...

74
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I accidentally knocked over your glasses.

75
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
What should we do?

76
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
Let me buy you a drink.

77
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,280
You crazy woman.

78
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,320
Don't move.

79
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,679
I don't know how to use a gun.

80
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
If it goes off accidentally,

81
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

82
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Young Master, are you okay?

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,200
I didn't expect the Mo family to move so fast.

84
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Empty gun.

85
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,560
My lady will pay for all the expenses tonight.

86
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Have fun.

87
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,720
Thank you for earlier.

88
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
It's nothing.

89
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,880
I can't stand people putting cold guns behind my back.

90
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
You're so annoying.

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
I'll buy you a drink.

92
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
My name is Zhou Liu.

93
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,440
I'm the top star in the world.

94
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,200
What do you think?

95
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Do you want to drink with me again?

96
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
So what?

97
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm the notorious Qin Manzhi.

98
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
You haven't recovered from your cold.

99
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,600
Don't drink too much.

100
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Stay outside.

101
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
in case they come after us.

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
I can't leave you.

103
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,240
What?

104
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
I can't call you.

105
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,640
Yes.

106
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Why are you here alone tonight?

107
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
My brother...

108
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
He's so annoying.

109
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
I guess in Yan City,

110
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,160
in Yan City.

111
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,680
Lu Huai.

112
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,000
Go.

113
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,200
Stay here.

114
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,640
Press the wound.

115
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Don't let go.

116
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,520
Transfer the killer's target.

117
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
That's a good trick.

118
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,160
Right.

119
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,840
A singer's life is worthless.

120
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,720
Ms. Qin, we'll be sworn friends.

121
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,680
Why are you following me? It's dangerous here.

122
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
Just like Zhou Liu said,

123
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
Young Master ran away.

124
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,960
Let's not look for Miss first.

125
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
Manman.

126
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
How are you?

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Are you hurt?

128
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm from the Qin family.

129
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,200
This is nothing to scare me.

130
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,840
You're the best.

131
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
You don't have to follow me today.

132
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,160
Just walk home.

133
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,040
Yes.

134
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,640
Why aren't you driving?

135
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,480
This is my first time saving someone.

136
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,080
I know you are very angry and disappointed.

137
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
Miss.

138
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,760
Should we stop?

139
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
No.

140
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
You talk too much.

141
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
Drive properly.

142
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Yes.

143
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,680
Lu Huai. Who allowed you to kneel?

144
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,840
Only one of you can survive.

145
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,120
From now on,

146
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,160
you are a member of the Qin family.

147
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
The way back to Qin Mansion is long.

148
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
I still walked back.

149
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,520
Get up.

150
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,560
I was looking for her white moon,

151
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,240
while I was addicted to flirting with her.

152
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,280
but you can't forget the blood between the Qin family and me.

153
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,440
I thought you wouldn't come.

154
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
The moon shines on the moon
