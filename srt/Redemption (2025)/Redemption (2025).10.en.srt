1
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,400
You must have had a long day practicing shooting.

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Have a good rest.

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm leaving.

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,000
What if I say

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
I won't let you go?

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,360
Miss.

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you still need me to act?

8
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,200
I asked you here

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
not for acting.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Help me send this letter.

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
As soon as possible.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,479
Don't let my brother know.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,840
My father died a strange death.

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
But my brother didn't tell me anything.

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,440
Uncle Sanxing is the closest person to my father.

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
He should know something.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
It turns out

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,400
she knows nothing about the Qin family.

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
I understand.

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,000
Found it.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
You're back so early.

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,360
Having a sister-in-law is really different.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,960
Miss.

24
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,760
What are you doing in my study?

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
What happened?

26
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Nothing.

27
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,560
The earrings Manman gave me

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,520
The pearl dropped.

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,200
and rolled into the study.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
Lu Huai is here.

31
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
I asked him to help me find it.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,079
Look at you and Manman.

33
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,760
I found it.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,240
You're late.

35
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,640
Why are you back so early today?

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,320
I have a wife at home.

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm so anxious.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Come with me.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Yes.

40
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,440
You don't even look at

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,240
You don't even look at it.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,560
Why Miss Zhou?

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Miss, you misunderstood.

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,519
Misunderstanding?

45
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,000
I...

46
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
Do you and your sister-in-law need to act too?

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,680
When I pushed the door in,

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
how did you protect her?

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
Do you think I can't see it?

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,640
Miss.

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,000
Miss.

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
Lu Huai is also a guard of the Qin family.

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
I said

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,640
you can only be my guard.

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Get out.

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
You and Lu Huai were in the study this afternoon.

57
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,640
in the study this afternoon?

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
You still remember this?

59
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,200
What can I do

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,800
with a guard?

61
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Do you really not know or are you pretending not to know?

62
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,040
My heart is full of you.

63
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Did you buy these earrings with Manman?

64
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
Yes.

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
Help me fix it at the shop.

66
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Ma'am.

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm going out.

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm going out for some fresh air.

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,960
I've copied the schedule.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
and put it in the box.

71
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
Have you found the contract you want?

72
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,800
I can do it myself from now on.

73
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Qin Chu came back suddenly today.

74
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,200
If I hadn't gone to the study in advance, you would've been exposed.

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,600
It's too dangerous.

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,320
I saved my life before I came to Yan City. You are my brother.

77
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
It's not dangerous.

78
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Miss.

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you going to Shen's?

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
Why didn't you call Lu Huai?

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,520
When do I need to report to you about my decision?

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Xiaowu, drive.

83
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,360
As your bodyguard,

84
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,960
it's my duty to protect you.

85
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Lu Huai.

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Xiao Wu, drive.

87
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,760
Yes.

88
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,640
The wedding date on the newspaper is fake.

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Qin Chu took Zhou Liu to the Qin family.

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
We failed.

91
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,000
Besides,

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,200
Qin Manzhi is close to Shen Panshu.

93
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Qin Chu probably wanted to marry his sister to the Shen family.

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Rumors are true.

95
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,200
If the Shen family and the Qin family get married,

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,480
it'll be harder to deal with them.

97
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,160
To destroy their marriage,

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I have a good idea.

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Page book.

100
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,400
Which perfume powder do you think suits me?

101
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
This is Shen's new fragrance powder.

102
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,800
It suits you.

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Wu.

104
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
Come and smell it.

105
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
It smells good.

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,400
Miss.

107
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
This fragrance powder is combined with sandalwood and roses.

108
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,440
fragrant but not greasy.

109
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,760
Mysterious and tempting.

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
It suits your temperament.

111
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
There's nothing on the package.

112
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
He can smell everything.

113
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,280
Is there another person

114
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,520
is there another person like him?

115
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Did he ask you?

116
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,160
Wait outside.

117
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,840
Yes.

118
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I'll take this.

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
I'll ask someone to wrap it up.

120
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Forget it.

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,160
Why should I be angry with him?

122
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,680
Wu.

123
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
I think you like this.

124
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Buy it.

125
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,960
I'm a man.

126
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Manzhi.

127
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,040
Would you like to go to the lake with me?

128
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes.

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,240
You're here to buy perfume powder too?

130
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,040
Yes.

131
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,880
The new one tastes like Gu Ji.

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Don't mention Gu Ji.

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
I was burned down by my enemy.

134
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,520
The whole family died just like that.

135
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,720
But I heard that they are not enemies.

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,080
Gu Ji tried to fawn on foreigners with the formula.

137
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,080
Someone hated it.

138
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,960
so he burned his shop.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,960
Mr. Gu.

140
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
I’ve brought your sincerity.

141
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,400
We must get this formula.

142
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,400
Mr. Qin.

143
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
If you come to the store,

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
if you come.

145
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
If you come to persuade me to sell the formula,

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
you don't have to come again.

147
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Please reconsider.

148
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
We'll come again.

149
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,360
I didn't know you like the butterfly pastry here.

150
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,560
Little kitty.

151
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
Wipe your mouth.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
Little kitty, wipe your mouth.

153
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
Page book.

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,080
Can you tell me

155
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,440
your childhood?

156
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
When I was young?

157
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,640
I was naughty when I was a kid.

158
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,960
The number one fragrance powder shop in Yan City was called Gu Ji.

159
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I love to go there.

160
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,280
Gu Ji.

161
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
I've never heard of it.

162
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,160
Gu Ji was burned down by a fire.

163
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,680
I was shocked at the scene.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
I got sick at home.

165
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
After that,

166
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,480
my father decided to send me abroad.

167
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,600
Manzhi.

168
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,640
Manzhi, what's wrong?

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,560
I finally...

170
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,480
I finally found you.

171
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,680
Why did she react like this when I mentioned Gu Ji?

172
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,840
Who did she mistake me for?

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Don't you remember me?

174
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,080
The rouge you gave me.

175
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
I remember.

176
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,080
I just couldn't believe it.

177
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
How could it be you?

178
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,280
Miss

179
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,840
Young Master Shen is noble

180
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,040
How can I trouble you with such a trivial matter?

181
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,120
Manzhi is not an outsider.

182
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,160
I'll do it.

183
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
Be careful. She likes this scarf.

184
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,360
She'll get mad if you break it.

185
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,520
What's wrong?

186
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,800
Nothing.

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,960
Miss, it's getting late.

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
We should go back.

189
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,920
It doesn't matter. We have plenty of time.

190
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Well,

191
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,520
let's meet another day.

192
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay.

193
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
You seem to think of me as someone else's shadow.

194
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
If it's just a misunderstanding,

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I will make the misunderstanding come true.

196
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,800
Go and investigate Lu Huai.

197
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,320
Why did Young Master investigate a guard?

198
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
Because...

199
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
he looks like a person who should have died.

200
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
The moon shines on the moon
