1
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,120
Shadow.

2
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Shadow, how did your interrogation go?

3
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,000
Boss.

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,400
Are you okay?

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,320
I...

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
It's okay.

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Thank you.

8
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,400
No need to thank me.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't forget tomorrow's plan.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,600
Go with me today.

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,560
There's only one target to save Miss.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Kill Mak Moon.

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Yes.

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
The rest of you

15
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,040
From now on,

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,000
Wherever she goes that day,

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
wherever she goes.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,640
Understand?

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,360
Yes.

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
At the beginning.

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's go. Let's go.

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,480
Let's go.

23
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,840
Madam, Young Master asked me to give this letter to you.

24
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,840
I've never seen you as a sparrow in a cage.

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,280
After signing the divorce agreement,

26
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,079
From now on,

27
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
let's part ways

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,400
and live happily.

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,400
Did I

30
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,840
fell down somewhere last night?

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,840
The boss was lying on the sofa last night.

32
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
Maybe

33
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
fell down from the sofa.

34
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,240
You interrogated Lu Huai all night.

35
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,000
but he kept his mouth shut.

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,880
He won't say another word.

37
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
Make sure

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,120
before Qin Chu comes.

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Otherwise,

40
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,560
I'll take

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,200
you and Lu Huai.

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,880
Yes.

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,760
Mo, come out now.

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,560
Young Master Qin.

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Please.

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,360
Shu, wait for me outside.

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,440
If anything happens, bring someone in.

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,480
I don't dare to act rashly.

49
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Be careful.

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll take care of everything.

51
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,720
Long time no see.

52
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
My good nephew.

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,040
is quite like Qin Sheng.

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,880
How dare you mention my father?

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Young man.

56
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,400
You're very angry.

57
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm not here to chat with you.

58
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
I've brought what you want.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,800
Where's Manman?

60
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,320
What's the rush?

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,920
Let's

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Let's catch up.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
I've studied it.

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,080
Lu Huai's room is in the north.

65
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,320
There's a shade of trees.

66
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800
Mowen can't see the blind spot.

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,120
Let's go.

68
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,160
You go first.

69
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,480
Can you two stop doing this?

70
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,120
It's too late.

71
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,800
Lu Huai, go first.

72
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,080
Shadow is right.

73
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Lu Huai, you go first.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
If it's too late,

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll jump from here.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
You'll catch me, right?

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Lu Huai.

78
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,840
I will.

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,560
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,560
Let's drink together after we get out.

81
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,680
Bah!

82
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I won't drink with you.

83
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's go.

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,360
The thing you want is in the box.

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,960
As long as I see Manman,

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I'll give it to you.

87
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,240
Tell the shadow.

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
to invite Miss Qin

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
please come down.

90
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,400
Yes.

91
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
I heard that Lu Huai is here too.

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,320
Young Master Qin wants Gu Chi too?

93
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,360
He has another price.

94
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
I don't want him.

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
I want his life.

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
No problem.

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
By then,

98
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,440
to collect the body.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,920
You are...

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
I didn't expect things to go so smoothly.

101
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
We still have time.

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,200
Are you leaving or not?

103
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
Shadow.

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
You said you didn't celebrate your birthday.

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
We went out.

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,159
Lu Huai and I will celebrate your birthday together.

107
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,760
Okay.

108
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
I have nothing for you.

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
This is the ticket

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
for Lu Huai.

111
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Take them with you.

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's go.

113
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,120
Bad news, Miss Qin is missing.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
If I heard correctly,

115
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
your men said

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
Manman is missing.

117
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,880
What's the rush?

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I told you Qin Manzhi is here.

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,679
I'll invite her myself.

120
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,720
You traitor!

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
I picked you up from the pile of dead people

122
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,600
and raised you up.

123
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
How dare you betray me?

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,600
Is this how you repay me for raising you?

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,320
Where's Manzhi?

126
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,480
He must have escaped.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
All these years,

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,200
I've done so many things for you without conscience.

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,360
Enough.

130
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
But my boss has never remembered my birthday.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Manzhi remembers.

132
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Qin Manzhi.

133
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,280
I think I know why Lu Huai likes you.

134
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,360
Remember to pour a pot of wine in front of my grave.

135
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Shadow.

136
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
I will

137
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
for you.

138
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Brother.

139
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
Let's talk about

140
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
Let's talk after we escape.

141
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,680
I told you.

142
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,120
Miss Qin is safe.

143
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,480
You don't believe me?

144
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Who are you to bargain with me?

145
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,560
I...

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,480
I will always leave myself a way out.

147
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,320
My good nephew.

148
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Watch and learn

149
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,960
Young Master Shen

150
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,040
I’m here to talk business with you

151
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
Gu's fragrance powder recipe

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,720
Are you interested, Young Master Shen?

153
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
Sir,

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm afraid we came to the wrong place.

155
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,920
Please.

156
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,160
The formula Qin Sheng sold you back then

157
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
is missing.

158
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
That taste

159
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,840
is in my hands.

160
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,800
I guess

161
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,920
you must be the second head of the Qin family.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
You have a lot to do with the Qin family.

163
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
And I'm going to marry Manzhi.

164
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,680
If I cooperate with you,

165
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,360
how would Manzhi think of me?

166
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,960
If I say

167
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,800
I can solve

168
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
between you and Qin Manzhi.

169
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm all ears.

170
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Shen Panshu.

171
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
After Xiaowu died,

172
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,280
I trusted you so much.

173
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
but you betrayed me.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Qin Chu's fault was

175
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,200
you never treat me sincerely.

176
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
My marriage with your sister

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,080
will be beneficial to you and the Qin family.

178
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,640
But you hesitated

179
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
and even rejected me.

180
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,840
She said she would make the decision.

181
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
Shen Panshu.

182
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
Are you crazy?

183
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,640
You killed so many people of the Qin family.

184
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
You wish I could marry you.

185
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm crazy.

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,960
If I'm never in your choice,

187
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,880
I'll make myself

188
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,840
become your only choice.

189
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,160
Even if I have to choose,

190
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,400
the best choice I made

191
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,840
is to cooperate with Young Master Shen

192
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,160
Don’t touch me with your dirty hands

193
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
That's right.

194
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,200
I am

195
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,960
But compared to having you,

196
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,360
than having you.

197
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,880
I really love you.

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
You don't really love me.

199
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,880
You just enjoy

200
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,880
control everything.

201
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,600
Shen Panshu.

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,160
Lock someone up with your self-righteous love.

203
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
What kind of man are you?

204
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,320
I said I don't care what you think of me.

205
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
I just need it.

206
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Last time when I felt so good,

207
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I think...

208
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,360
I'd better watch you in the dungeon.

209
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
I've been thinking

210
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,720
how it would feel to kneel in front of me.

211
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,560
It feels so good.

212
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
Do you think you really won?

213
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,400
Am I wrong?

214
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,840
You're dying.

215
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
you're still so stubborn.

216
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,880
I knew it.

217
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,800
Could it be Mo Wen?

218
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
promised you the formula?

219
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
But have you ever thought

220
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,920
what if the formula he gave is fake?

221
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,640
Young Master Shen

222
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
He is sowing discord

223
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,240
and putting a cold knife in the back.

224
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,640
Isn't that your usual style?

225
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,200
You know very well

226
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,000
how my father died on that train.

227
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,720
He deserved it.

228
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
If foreigners can't do business,

229
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,160
they must vent their anger on them.

230
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm not the one who doesn't want to work with the Westerners.

231
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
Qin Sheng is dead.

232
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,320
But he...

233
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,360
saved you and Qin Manzhi.

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,800
What else do you want?

235
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Shut up!

236
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,240
Who are you to talk so much here?

237
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,760
Shen Panshu.

238
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,640
Everyone knows you are a gentleman of Yancheng.

239
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,800
You also claim that you love me.

240
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
But you'd rather work with such an executioner

241
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,360
than be honest with the Qin family.

242
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,720
If being honest is useful,

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
you wouldn't have chosen

244
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,880
He is Gu Chi.

245
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm not as good as him.

246
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,880
Now he's just a guard.

247
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm not as good as him.

248
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Manzhi.

249
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't mind if you hate me more.

250
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,359
The moon shines on the moon
