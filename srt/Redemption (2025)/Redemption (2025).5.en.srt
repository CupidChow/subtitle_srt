1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Lu Huai.

2
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Don't go. Stay with me.

3
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,240
But Young Master told me

4
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,480
Young Master.

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
How many times have I told you?

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,320
You're my bodyguard.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Besides, this is not the first time.

8
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,880
Brother.

9
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,400
Miss, are you scared?

10
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
Who told you that?

11
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
I was just dreaming.

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Don't go.

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm not leaving.

14
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll stay here with you.

15
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,720
Sleep.

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,079
You too.

17
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,800
Miss.

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,960
This is not proper.

19
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
Are you afraid that I...

20
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
No.

21
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,920
Do you think I'm weird?

22
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
In the past, every rainy night,

23
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,040
my mother would put me to sleep.

24
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,880
Then she passed away.

25
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,760
The person who made me sleep became a father.

26
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
But now,

27
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
he's gone.

28
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
I miss them so much.

29
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,880
Lu Huai.

30
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Do you miss your family?

31
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
If you let her do whatever she wants again,

32
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
don't know your place.

33
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
If you do it again,

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
don't blame me for abolishing you.

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,320
Lu Huai.

36
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,920
It tickles.

37
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,000
Miss.

38
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Tonight,

39
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
there's no thunder.

40
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,320
Just say it.

41
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
Last night,

42
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,920
Lu Huai stayed with you all night.

43
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
Manman grew up with him.

44
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,400
She treats him differently.

45
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
She's always messing around.

46
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,560
It seems

47
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,040
Manman's marriage can't be delayed any longer.

48
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,080
Young Master, the Great World is here.

49
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
Mr. A was assassinated and killed.

50
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,760
Mr. Qin is in a good mood.

51
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,120
to have fun here.

52
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
Mr. A is dead.

53
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
What happened?

54
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
Mr. A got off the boat early yesterday.

55
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,760
We didn't see him.

56
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Go.

57
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Go get Mr. Huang of Yaoxing.

58
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Don't worry, Steward Xu.

59
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,080
I've been working with the Qin family for years.

60
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,000
I will find out the truth.

61
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
Stop pretending, Mr. Qin.

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,240
You have to get in the way

63
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
you have to get involved

64
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,920
so that you can take advantage of it.

65
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
You know we want to avoid you

66
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
from you.

67
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
He was afraid that he would cut off your financial path.

68
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
That's why he did this.

69
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,080
Steward Xu, you have to be reasonable.

70
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,080
My family is in charge of purchasing all raw materials

71
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
transportation and canal.

72
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,240
from transportation and goods?

73
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Say no more.

74
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,920
You have to give me an explanation today.

75
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Wait.

76
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
Young Master Qin.

77
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,960
Mr. Huang of Yaoxing is also in the big world today.

78
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
You're making a scene here.

79
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,559
If he is unhappy,

80
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,799
There is indeed an important guest today.

81
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,880
Manager Xu, can you do me a favor?

82
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,160
Mr. Huang of Yaoxing

83
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,560
is not with the General in the South City.

84
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
What are you doing in the big world?

85
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

86
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,280
The world is a blessing to listen to music.

87
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,000
What? Can't I come?

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Mr. Huang, I didn't expect you...

89
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
Young Master Qin is young and promising.

90
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
The general values

91
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,360
is a young talent like you.

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

93
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay.

94
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Young Master Qin is indeed extraordinary.

95
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,760
He even tied the General's thread.

96
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Today,

97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,600
I was reckless about Mr. A.

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,360
Please forgive me.

99
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Let's go.

100
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,120
Steward Xu.

101
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,840
Don't worry.

102
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
I'll give you an explanation soon.

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Let's go.

104
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,040
I know

105
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Mr. Huang is not the one who helped me today.

106
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,640
but you.

107
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,840
You should go home.

108
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,560
We should go home.

109
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,800
I don't know what kind of fragrance powder she likes.

110
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,560
I'll pick some for her.

111
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
Lu Huai.

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,200
Gu Chi, the manager taught you how to distinguish incense.

113
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,560
Why did you run away?

114
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,960
Dad, there are only a few kinds of fragrance powder.

115
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,320
I can smell them.

116
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
You brat.

117
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,760
You don't study hard

118
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,040
because you have the talent to distinguish fragrance.

119
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
In the future,

120
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880
how can we make Gu's fragrance powder prosperous?

121
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Come here.

122
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,560
Father, I'm not going.

123
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,880
Stop right there!

124
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
What's wrong?

125
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,840
It might be an old injury.

126
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,600
By the way

127
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,440
I heard Young Master Shen is back

128
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Do you want to meet him?

129
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,640
Young Master is not here today.

130
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,200
Would you like to leave him a letter?

131
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,840
It's okay. I'll come another day.

132
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
What a coincidence.

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Not necessarily.

134
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,520
Miss is always lucky.

135
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Young Master.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
What a coincidence.

137
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,320
Miss Qin wants to see you.

138
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,240
Manzhi.

139
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Long time no see.

140
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,520
You know me?

141
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,680
I guessed.

142
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
Not many people surnamed Qin in Yan City.

143
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440
Nice to meet you.

144
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
Take this flower as a gift.

145
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,440
White roses.

146
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
He likes white roses too.

147
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Young Master Shen also likes flowers

148
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,520
How about

149
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,640
find a place to sit and talk?

150
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,640
Okay.

151
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
He asked me to bring something from abroad.

152
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,200
He urged me

153
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
to give it to others.

154
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Now is the right time.

155
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
Please help me.

156
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,480
Can I?

157
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,240
Miss.

158
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,200
Don't worry.

159
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll personally escort Manzhi home.

160
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Since you are in a hurry,

161
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
please help Young Master Shen.

162
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
Yes

163
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,040
Please.

164
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,320
Sir.

165
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,320
Do I need to follow Miss Manzhi?

166
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,360
Of course.

167
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,320
Miss Manzhi's preferences

168
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
and her every move

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,200
and her every move.

170
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
Don't expose your whereabouts.

171
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,320
Yes.

172
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,360
Why are you so reluctant to part with me?

173
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Thanks to you last night.

174
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Didn't you marry me?

175
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,600
Who told you that?

176
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,040
I just can't take it anymore.

177
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
The moon shines on the moon.
