1
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
Keep an eye on your wife and Lu Huai.

2
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,360
Remember to send a message.

3
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,039
Yes.

4
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,440
You've been here quite often lately.

5
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
You didn't even say goodbye to me.

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
without even saying goodbye.

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,800
As long as you don't have a clear heart,

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,480
I won't be able to live in peace.

9
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,360
Manman has grown up.

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
He has his own ideas.

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Don't push Manman too hard

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,240
because we're close.

13
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
I'll be angry with you too.

14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,759
Don't worry.

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,680
But

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
I have to remind you again.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
someone

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,039
is suspicious.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
You mean...

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,920
You're always smarter than me.

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,920
You should know who I'm talking about.

22
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,560
Father saved this for you.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
According to his order,

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,280
to save money regularly every year.

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
to be used by you in the future.

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,079
Shen Panshu is not you

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm glad and disappointed

28
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,120
Young Master.

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,640
The fire at Gu House that day...

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm glad you're not a member of the Gu family.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,960
That's why we met again.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,800
But why am I getting more and more afraid

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
to find you?

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Father.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
Since Manzhi returned to the Qin family,

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,360
my brother has been taking care of me.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Now,

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,920
I have to leave and do something for the Qin family.

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Miss.

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,160
Why are you here?

41
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
It's so cold.

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,360
in such a cold day.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,520
But Young Master told me

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,160
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
You must be kidding.

46
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Lu Huai.

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,440
Of course I won't leave you alone.

48
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,959
Are you sure?

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,399
Lu Huai.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
I never break my promise.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,480
Lu Huai.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,920
I told you before that I wanted to escape.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,400
I wanted to leave Qin Mansion.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,800
It's true.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120
No matter where you go,

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
Lu Huai is like a shadow.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
Why don't you ask me where I'm going?

58
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,240
When?

59
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,680
If you don't tell me,

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
I won't ask.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,200
But Lu Huai

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
to protect you.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm going abroad.

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,880
The sooner, the better.

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,320
But Young Master told me

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,040
the Shen family is your best choice.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
Are you sure

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
leave Young Master Shen?

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
How can a person with an unfaithful heart

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
is not the best choice.

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Yes.

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Lu Huai will buy you a ticket

73
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
when buying butterfly pastry tomorrow.

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Bao.

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,120
Who sent you here?

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Miss.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,240
Young Master asked me to keep an eye on you and Lu Huai.

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
If my brother sent you here,

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,200
you wouldn't have praised me.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm a perfect match for the page book.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
I don't like people talking about me.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
How could he let you mention the page in front of me?

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,120
At this point, Bao has nothing to say.

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
I didn't do my job well with money.

85
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Just accept your fate.

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
How much will the page book give you?

87
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll pay you double.

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
Miss.

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
You're not going to kill me.

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
You heard it.

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
I plan to leave the Qin family.

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
Go to my room and get the reward.

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
then leave Yan City.

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm not leaving.

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,240
No.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,080
If you don't leave,

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,000
my brother will punish you

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
he will punish you.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
You can't explain to the Shen Family either

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Siu-shun thought I was clever

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
So he bought me from the trafficker

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
But Young Master Shen and he never treated me like a human

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Although I'm illiterate,

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,560
but I know the word "righteousness".

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
You treat me sincerely.

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,760
Bao is willing to help you.

107
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,800
You know too much.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I can't keep you.

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,840
My Lady, my identity has been exposed.

110
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
If you don't accept me

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Siu-shun will kill me for sure

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
If you go out from the Qin Mansion, you'll be in trouble

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,040
you need someone to inform you.

114
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
I will do my job.

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,440
I won't trouble you.

116
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
If you insist on staying,

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
if you insist on staying.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
Thank you, Miss.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,280
In order to hide your identity,

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,560
you should keep in touch with the Shen family.

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,760
But what should I say

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,000
what should not be said,

123
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
what I shouldn't say.

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
Get out.

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

126
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
I just realized

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
what you mean

128
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
What does that mean?

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
I just feel...

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,360
Miss.

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
You're different

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
from before.

133
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm from the Qin family.

134
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,880
I've been drawing with you all these years.

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Can't you learn that?

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes.

137
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,600
Miss is from the Qin family.

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,640
Manman.

139
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Bao told me you wanted to see me.

140
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
Sister-in-law.

141
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,640
I've made up my mind.

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I won't marry Shen Panshu.

143
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
Okay.

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,760
I'll tell your brother for you.

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
I asked my sister-in-law

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
not for this.

147
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,799
There's another thing I need your help.

148
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm rich.

149
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Really.

150
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Two train tickets can be sold at this price.

151
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
Say it.

152
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,680
That person was in your hand.

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,360
when did you buy the ticket?

154
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Lu Huai.

155
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,880
Stop.

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
Let's go.

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,320
I've saved these years.

158
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,000
It should be enough for you and her.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
You know everything?

160
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Young Master Shen is very strange.

161
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
I hid the truth about Ding Xiang for you.

162
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,400
But Chu is suspicious. She will find you soon.

163
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,520
Luckily,

164
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
you and her are leaving soon.

165
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
No matter how Manman feels about you,

166
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
she's willing to take you with her.

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,880
at least it means she's serious about you.

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,480
Manman doesn't know.

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,800
But I should ask her.

170
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,600
the girl you met when you were young.

171
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,920
Have you really forgotten her?

172
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,440
Su.

173
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,400
She couldn't escape.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,920
She died in that fire.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,560
Shouldn't you be sleeping at this hour?

176
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Why are you so kind?

177
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,200
You even come to see me.

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,600
Don't say that.

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
You've been drunk these days.

180
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
Stop talking about me.

181
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,280
I barely see you.

182
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,160
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

183
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,440
Your birthday is coming.

184
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,800
I remember.

185
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,960
That's why we're all here to finish our work.

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
Did you prepare a birthday gift?

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm sure you'll like it.

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,240
Well said.

189
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
The gold jewelry you made last year was crooked.

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,760
What are you talking about?

191
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,520
It's gold even if it's crooked.

192
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
It will be fine this time.

193
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,760
Didn't you say it's too boring to hold it in Qin Mansion?

194
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,600
This time, I've booked the whole world.

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,040
Then I'll wait for you.

196
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,720
waiting for you to slap my face.

197
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
Miss, we can go now.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sister-in-law said

199
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,360
I'll take her and Xiaowu to the Great World tonight.

200
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,440
Sister-in-law will help us get him drunk.

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,560
Bao will help us stall the remaining guards.

202
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,120
Let's go straight out.

203
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,360
Just tell him we're going to the Great World to pick him up.

204
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,480
Miss.

205
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,560
If you regret it now,

206
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
you still have a chance.

207
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
I, Qin Manzhi,

208
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
never go back.

209
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
You were drunk yesterday.

210
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,120
and finally finished your work.

211
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
Why don't you sleep more?

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
Tomorrow is Manman's birthday.

213
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,480
I have to make sure everything is perfect.

214
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,520
You don't have to worry about my birthday.

215
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,080
I haven't celebrated it with you.

216
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
Oh.

217
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,520
As you know,

218
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,600
I promise you I'll be with you

219
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
every year.

220
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Miss is missing.

221
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Young Master.

222
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,440
The dress you brought Ms Qin here is here.

223
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,360
What are we waiting for?

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
Follow me to Qin Mansion.

225
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Call Chu Shi before you leave.

226
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
and talk about the delivery time of this batch of fragrance powder.

227
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Yes.

228
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,960
You mean

229
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
Miss and Lu Huai are missing.

230
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,680
They only left a letter.

231
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,920
Yes.

232
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,160
Yesterday, she said she would bring Lu Huai to the Great World to pick you up.

233
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,720
Then she didn't return overnight.

234
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,520
Did he stay out all night

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,600
or eloped with Lu Huai?

236
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,720
Shen Panshu, what do you mean?

237
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,440
Chu.

238
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
Calm down.

239
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,560
Because of our years of relationship,

240
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
I didn't fight you.

241
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,280
Watch your mouth.

242
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm sincere to Manzhi.

243
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,720
The Shen family is the same to the Qin family.

244
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Your father refused to sell the secret recipe to the foreigners.

245
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,400
The Shen family took over this hot potato.

246
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,480
It's between our parents

247
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
between us?

248
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,160
This punch

249
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,840
for Manman.

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,440
If you didn't push him too hard,

251
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,160
why would Manman run away from home?

252
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,160
Young Master Shen.

253
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Is this the attitude of your family?

254
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,800
When Qin Chu was young,

255
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
you trusted the wrong person.

256
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,480
Wu, what are you doing?

257
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,320
Manzhi refused to marry me in the way of running away

258
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,960
is a disgrace to the Shen family.

259
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
My father won't give up easily.

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
The Qin family

261
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,520
We must give the Shen family an explanation.

262
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
The moon shines on the moon
