1
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,600
Young Master asked for Lu Huai

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,730
because of what happened at Dashijie?

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,520
An assassin escaped from you that night.

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,800
I know your skills well after all these years

5
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
in the Qin family.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,720
There were too many people at Dashijie that day.

7
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,760
I was injured.

8
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,160
My aim was off.

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,010
Besides this incident,

10
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,240
is there something else affecting your performance?

11
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,880
Please punish me, Young Master.

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,960
Look up.

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,700
Manman is willful.

14
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,210
But if you let her have her way again

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,900
and show no restraint,

16
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,579
if there's a next time,

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,700
don't blame me for crippling your hands.

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
Yes,

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
young master.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,280
If Manman asks

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,040
why your hand injury has worsened,

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,300
what will you tell her?

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
Young master,

24
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I'll say Lu Huai was injured during field duty when encountering a fight

25
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,900
and accidentally got burned.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
Xiao Wu, come here.

27
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Are you going to deliver gifts to Miss Zhou again?

28
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Miss,

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Miss Zhou refuses them every time.

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
The young master said

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,250
to keep delivering until she accepts.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
That's easy.

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,560
This time, deliver a message from me to Miss Zhou,

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,090
and she'll accept the gift.

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
If the young master finds out...

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,280
You're Qin Xiao Wu,

37
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,240
you've grown up with my brother.

38
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,120
No matter how angry he gets, he won't blame you.

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
What

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
would I blame him for?

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,200
Brother, I want to go to the Great World too.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Haven't you learned your lesson?

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,560
Stay put at the Qin mansion.

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
With Lu Huai accompanying me, I'll be fine.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,050
Speaking of Lu Huai,

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I haven't seen him for a while today.

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,450
I hope his injury hasn't gotten worse.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Finally got rid of her.

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,080
Go to the Great World,

50
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,730
I'll visit the Shen family.

51
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,400
Young master, aren't you going to see Miss Zhou?

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,480
Just delivering the gift is enough.

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,340
I have other matters to attend to.

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,840
Mr. A will arrive soon.

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Yan City won't be peaceful in the coming days.

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
You have a fever.

57
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
Miss.

58
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
What happened?

59
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,840
I got burned during a fight outside.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,840
Stop lying to me.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,920
Actually, I got burned while brewing medicine.

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
I didn't have time to treat the wound.

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,050
And it became like this.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,610
You're still lying.

65
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,760
It's my fault.

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
I didn't do well.

67
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,780
I deserve punishment.

68
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
That day at Dashijie,

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
I let an assassin escape.

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,880
I've told you that you're my man.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,240
If punishment is needed, I'll be the one to give it.

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Take good care of your wound.

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
If your hands become useless,

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
even if my brother doesn't replace you,

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,840
I will.

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Having someone secretly send me a message

77
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
is too risky.

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,600
If I hadn't walked back that day,

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
I wouldn't have received the message at all.

80
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,890
Don't worry, Boss Mo has planned everything.

81
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
It's just that

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,400
you let me escape.

83
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,480
The Qin family didn't hold you accountable.

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,140
Of course I had to be punished.

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,840
I cut my own wrist

86
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,040
to avoid suspicion from the Qin family.

87
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,170
Boss Mo says he's changed his mind.

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,280
This time he's targeting the Qin family's business.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
We've received information that

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Mr. A will arrive in Yan City early tomorrow.

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Find an opportunity to kill him.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,770
This will create discord between the Qin and Shen families.

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Qin Manzhi knows everything

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
about what I carry on me.

95
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
Don't cause me any more trouble.

96
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,120
You've been undercover in the Qin family for seven years.

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
Do you really have

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,660
no feelings at all for Qin Manzhi?

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,960
You've been Mo Wen's puppet for ten years now.

100
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Do you have feelings for him?

101
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,480
You...

102
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,640
Throw it away.

103
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,200
Young Master Qin, was I not clear enough last time?

104
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,340
It doesn't matter.

105
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
Whatever you bet now is fine.

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll return double the amount to Dashijie later.

107
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Young Master Qin is quite shameless.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Yet he has such a nice sister.

109
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,240
You and Manman do get along well.

110
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
But compared to Manman, I think

111
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,880
our connection is much deeper.

112
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,410
Don't you agree?

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,440
It's okay.

114
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
We have plenty of time ahead.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,720
I told you that you don't need to follow me these days.

116
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,250
Alright.

117
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,360
The wound is much better after applying medicine.

118
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
It's not completely healed yet.

119
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,120
You stay at the Qin mansion first.

120
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,440
My brother will be with me today, so I'll be fine.

121
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,770
I'll do as you say, miss.

122
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,900
When I get home,

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,260
I want to eat butterfly pastries.

124
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Have you given all the instructions to my brother?

125
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
The young master said

126
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
he'll come after the business meeting.

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait outside.

128
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
When Sister Zhou arrives,

129
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,840
if you just stand here,

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,040
you'll frighten her.

131
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Xiaowu.

132
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,980
Are my words no longer effective?

133
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,960
Young master.

134
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,600
Look,

135
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,420
isn't that the top courtesan?

136
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,600
She has a great figure.

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Indeed.

138
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Miss Manzhi, we meet again.

139
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,690
I'm sorry about what happened at Dashijie last time.

140
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,420
So I wanted to thank you in person.

141
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,290
Isn't this the earring I lost that day?

142
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,160
You had someone make an identical pair.

143
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,920
Yes.

144
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,040
Do you like them, Zhou?

145
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
I thought someone like me

146
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
would just be a passing acquaintance to Miss Manzhi,

147
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,200
with no further connection after Dashijie.

148
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,200
No one likes to be friends with people from the Qin family.

149
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,760
But I like you, Sister Zhou.

150
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,320
So I had Xiaowu arrange this meeting.

151
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm so happy

152
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
that you came.

153
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,940
They're not fortunate enough to be your friend.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,930
Actually, I have an ulterior motive for coming here.

155
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,160
You want to ask about me and your brother, right?

156
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,680
Your brother and I are old acquaintances.

157
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
We crossed paths before,

158
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,800
but then lost touch.

159
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,960
That's all.

160
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
I see.

161
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,880
My brother seems to care about you a lot.

162
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
It's the first time I've seen him like this.

163
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,010
He was like this before too.

164
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Please don't be upset, Sister Zhou.

165
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,160
All these years,

166
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,420
my brother has never had any other woman by his side.

167
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,360
Actually, I invited my brother today too.

168
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,960
If you don't want to see him,

169
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,290
we can go somewhere else together.

170
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
Well, knowing his temperament,

171
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,220
he's going to be angry.

172
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,660
But he can't do anything about me.

173
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,680
Isn't that the star performer from Dashijie?

174
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,880
I've seen her before.

175
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,640
The girl next to her looks good too.

176
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
Beautiful ladies, let's have a drink together.

177
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,560
Take your hands off me.

178
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,760
How come the star of Dashijie

179
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,020
doesn't take clients outside Dashijie?

180
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,920
This girl's got spirit.

181
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,960
I like that.

182
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,460
Who do you think you are

183
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,400
that you dare touch me?

184
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
You piece of trash!

185
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Don't you know who I belong to?

186
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,440
