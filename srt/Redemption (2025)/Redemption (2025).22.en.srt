1
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,880
Long time no see, Lu Huai.

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
I should call you

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Mr. Gu Chi.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Yes.

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
A few years ago,

6
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,240
didn't burn me to death.

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,640
It's God's blessing.

8
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,880
Let me take revenge.

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Revenge?

10
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,720
You got the wrong person.

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,920
In that fire,

12
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
I was just following orders.

13
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,680
Your real enemy

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,360
is the Qin family.

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,520
Qin Manzhi's father.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,160
Qin Sheng.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,039
You mean

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,880
has nothing to do with you?

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
Back then,

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,000
someone took a liking to the secret recipe of Gu Family.

21
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,240
and sent me to purchase it.

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
Qin Sheng and I

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,320
visited us countless times,

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
was kicked out by your father.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,080
So...

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,199
So you killed people

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,160
and killed dozens of people in my family?

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
It was Qin Sheng.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Qin Sheng asked me to set the fire.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
And then?

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,760
he found the real buyer was a foreigner.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,720
He refused to be a traitor no matter what.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,600
and sold the secret recipe to the Shen Family.

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,280
and signed

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,560
a secret contract.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,440
The Qin family and the Shen family have been so popular these years.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,520
They rely on the secret recipe of fragrance powder.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
However,

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Qin Sheng didn't know

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
I secretly

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
has been deleted by me.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,120
So,

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
the last secret recipe

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,240
is in my hands.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,320
Alright, I've heard the story.

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
you can leave in peace.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,520
Mowen.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
Do you really think

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,880
you have the last taste of the formula?

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,360
You want to trick me?

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,800
would I believe it?

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,720
The last taste of the formula

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,200
will only be passed down from generation to generation.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
It never falls on paper.

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
Give me the last taste.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll spare your life.

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Dream on.

58
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,880
You...

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Give it to me.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
Give it to me.

61
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,880
You...

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,880
Shadow.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Boss.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,680
Take these two

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,720
upstairs.

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
Interrogate him.

67
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,840
Tell Lu Huai to tell me everything he knows.

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,720
Yes.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,520
Manman.

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Have you seen Manman?

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
Young Master.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Not long after you left,

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
after you left.

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,560
Not back yet.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
Send someone to find him.

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Yes.

77
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,000
Shu.

78
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Have you seen Manman?

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
I haven't seen Manzhi for days.

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
What happened?

81
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
The warehouse is a trap.

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,240
Mak Moon lured me there on purpose.

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
If I'm not mistaken,

84
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Manman

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
should be in Mo Wen's hands now

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
Siu-shun, gather some men

87
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,840
Even if you search Yan City

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
you must find the Manzhi for me.

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,760
At the beginning,

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
the Shen family will fight together with you.

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,560
If Mowen really has Manzhi,

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll go with you to save her.

93
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,240
Say it.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,600
What is the last fragrance

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
in the recipe?

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,240
Say it or not?

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Why?

98
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
No reason.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
I just don't want you to die.

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,880
The ticket is still valid.

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll find a chance to let you go.

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,840
I know what you want to say.

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
I just don't understand.

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Qin Manzhi is protected by his brother.

105
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,760
It's none of your business.

106
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,440
I don't know why.

107
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,320
I can't stand

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,480
get hurt.

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Are you going to tell me or not?

110
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,960
Hello?

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Mak Moon.

112
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,720
It seems

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,080
you already know I have Qin Manzhi.

114
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,520
Let my sister go.

115
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
No problem.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Take

117
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,960
the fragrance powder contract you signed with the Shen Family

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Address

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
The abandoned building in the suburb.

120
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
Tomorrow noon,

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
Don't play any tricks.

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
Otherwise,

123
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
I can guarantee

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,960
you can't even see a strand of Qin Manzhi's hair.

125
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Was Manzhi safe at the beginning?

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,160
Mak Moon asked me to save Manman with the perfume contract.

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
What do you think?

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,720
At this time,

129
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
at this time?

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,360
Saving Manzhi is more important.

131
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I'll go with you tomorrow.

132
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
When Qin Chu

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
bring me the fragrance powder contract.

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,520
The Shen family and Qin family

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,920
are under my control.

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,880
Boss.

137
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,240
Is this fragrance powder contract

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,920
really that good?

139
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Of course.

140
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
In the contract,

141
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,560
there is evidence that they purchased the formula.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
As long as it's exposed,

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
Back then, in the fire of the Gu family,

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,000
none of them can clear their name.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
The Shen family

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
must be afraid to die in the light.

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,720
He must obey me.

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,680
At Qin Chu,

149
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,280
I will never let him see the moon tomorrow.

150
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Boss, please drink.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You should come with us.

152
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,200
I'll take care of this.

153
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,640
Let's go.

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,440
Ms. Qin wants to use hunger strike to attract Mr. Mo's attention.

155
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,159
No one will spoil you.

156
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
None of your business.

157
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Do you know how many people can't eat?

158
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,680
but you're on a hunger strike here?

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
You're doing evil deeds for Mo Wen.

160
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
Why are you pretending to be kind?

161
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
I'll pretend.

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,760
I was born in a beggar's den.

163
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
with no name.

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,760
I've never celebrated my birthday.

165
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,520
For food,

166
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,160
I can be beaten.

167
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,920
I can fight with wild dogs for food.

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
With Mak Moon,

169
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
at least I can survive.

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,720
You're a rich lady.

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,320
you don't know the sufferings of the mortal world.

172
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
I take back what I said.

173
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,600
But I understand

174
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,680
I understand.

175
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,159
I was also a little beggar.

176
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,919
I've been through everything you said.

177
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
I used to hate my past.

178
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,720
But now that I think about it,

179
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,960
If I hadn't been a beggar,

180
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
I wouldn't have met him.

181
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,000
We have similar backgrounds,

182
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
But our fate is different.

183
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,400
Someone loves you and protects you.

184
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,160
when you were in danger.

185
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
And I

186
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,920
lick blood on the knife.

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
Ziran

188
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Alone.

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Qin Manzhi

190
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
I envy you.

191
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,200
You have a happy life.

192
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
I guess you have no regrets.

193
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
What do you mean?

194
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
I can save someone.

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
Lu Huai asked me to save you.

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
But you know,

197
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
with our friendship,

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
I will only save him.

199
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you for your honesty.

200
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,520
You made a good choice.

201
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
I will bring Lu Huai to you.

202
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
for the last time.

203
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,080
Lu Huai.

204
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,000
You shouldn't have come back to save me.

205
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
My reason tells me I shouldn't come back.

206
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
But I can't.

207
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,120
I can't stand by when you're in trouble.

208
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,640
Miss.

209
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,720
Hang in there.

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
The Qin family will come tomorrow.

211
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
Everyone will be downstairs.

212
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
The shadow will help us.

213
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
We can get out of here.

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
I believe

215
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
as long as we are together,

216
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
we can escape

217
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,160
we can escape.

218
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
This time...

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,040
Back then,

220
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
the fire

221
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
I...

222
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,840
I knew you should know.

223
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
But I didn't dare to admit it.

224
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,560
When I knew you were the young master,

225
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
I was so happy.

226
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,840
But I never thought

227
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,200
you're Gu Chi.

228
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Young Master, thank you for the rouge.

229
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Return it to its owner.

230
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
I always wonder

231
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,040
why our relationship

232
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,440
end up like this?

233
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,080
Everything that happened after you married into the Qin Mansion.

234
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,040
Are you really just acting?

235
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,360
I hate it when people lie to me.

236
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,760
But it was you.

237
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,320
I couldn't do anything.

238
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,280
I'm willing to live with you in pain.

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
But you...

240
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,880
Are you secretly counting the days

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
waiting for me to disappear from this world?

242
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,080
I've been thinking about the first time I saw you lately.

243
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,000
You're wearing a costume that doesn't fit you.

244
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,320
Your eyes are curved when you smile.

245
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,640
So pretty.

246
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
I swore then

247
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,720
I would never let your eyes cry.

248
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
In the end,

249
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
It's not what I want.

250
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,520
I've made up my mind.

251
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
There are so many grievances in this world.

252
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
Why do you need us?

253
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Don't meet people like me again.

254
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Qin Manzhi.

255
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
Haven't you eaten yet?

256
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
If she gets hungry,

257
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,880
Shen will definitely mess with me.

258
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,520
You knew it?

259
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
I didn't know how to face you.

260
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,880
But after what happened today,

261
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,040
I realized

262
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
nothing can overcome life and death.

263
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,160
I don't ask you to forgive the Qin family.

264
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
I just hope

265
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
cherish yourself

266
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,520
Live well.

267
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Shadow.

268
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,520
The moon shines on the moon.
