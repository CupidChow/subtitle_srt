1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,720
You've been hiding in the Qin family for seven years.

2
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,640
What did Mowen give you?

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,640
to make you work so hard for him?

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Old hatred of an old friend.

5
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,680
You really don't know what you're talking about?

6
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,520
What an old friend.

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,280
We have plenty of time.

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,800
I don't believe I can't open your mouth.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
Father.

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,600
The Qin family is still so arrogant.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,200
They don't even remember their sins.

12
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,120
Your brother is asleep.

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
There's no one in the room.

14
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Are you still mad at me?

15
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,079
Do you want to know if he's mad at you

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
or to know where Lu Huai is locked?

17
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Boss.

18
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,680
Is there any news from the third boss abroad?

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,440
He's dead.

20
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
Congratulations, boss.

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,360
After that,

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,160
no one can threaten you with what happened back then.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,120
Pour me some wine later.

24
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Back then,

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
the secret recipe deal with foreigners

26
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,520
is finally over.

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,000
What about

28
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
what about Lu Huai?

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
What do you plan to do with him?

30
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Whether he is loyal to me or not,

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
he's already abandoned.

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Since

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,840
has fallen into Qin Chu Shi's hands,

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,120
He will suffer.

35
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Someone is taking it out on me.

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,640
Why not?

37
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
What?

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
I raised you up.

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Are you going to help me

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,760
and plead for Lu Huai?

41
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
I was raised by my boss.

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm grateful.

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,560
I will never betray you.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Hurry up.

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,120
Pour me some wine.

46
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,040
Is Lu Huai really the young master?

47
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
If you are really the young master,

48
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
what happened

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
in these years?

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
Why did I end up like this?

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Those people saw me walking on a crutch,

52
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
they broke their promise.

53
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,400
The raw materials price we agreed on

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
is going to rise now.

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Wu.

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,160
Brother.

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,520
It's time for your medicine.

58
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,000
At this point,

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
I can't accept that Xiao Wu is gone.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
At this point,

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,840
I already know...

62
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,880
that Mo Wen was involved in his father's death.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
I'll take care of it.

64
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
Don't worry.

65
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,400
The Shen family alienated the Qin family

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,320
because I ran away from the marriage.

67
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
I know you want to protect me.

68
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,440
But Manman should shoulder the burden of the Qin family.

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
I think...

70
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,840
walk side by side with you.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
instead of staying behind you.

72
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
Manman has grown up.

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
If father knows,

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,000
he would be very pleased.

75
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
But it depends on your ability

76
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,280
depends on your ability.

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
This is the debt

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,760
after Hua Sheng changed the steward.

79
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,120
Seeing that I'm walking on a crutch,

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,440
I didn't return it on time.

81
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
If you can get it back,

82
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
I'll trust you.

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
My brother is a man of his word.

84
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Did you ask him?

85
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Why did the Qin family

86
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,960
ten years ago?

87
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
with a large sum of money?

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,800
The accountant said it was from the Shen Family.

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,400
Although the Qin family and the Shen family are two-sided partners,

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,760
they wouldn't have so much money.

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Ms. Qin.

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,200
Miss Qin.

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,400
Young Master heard that the Qin family's financial turnover didn't work.

94
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,360
so he asked me to send the bonus in advance.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Although the business of the Shen family is good,

96
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,720
but it won't be that much if we share it with the Qin family.

97
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,480
It's not a favor from you.

98
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
but the Qin family and the Shen family.

99
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,640
have been divided into half these years.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Why?

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
For personal reasons.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,360
Miss Qin, you should ask Young Master Shen.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Thank you.

104
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,040
Say hello to your young master for me.

105
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,520
It's cold outside.

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,080
Why don't you go back to your room?

107
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
Bao told me you were drunk.

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Your brother asked me to visit you.

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you feeling better?

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,520
I was feeling better

111
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,360
But he found out what Siu-shun said

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
He said the Shen Family

113
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,039
is up to no good

114
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,559
Bad intentions?

115
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
Maybe he's just worried

116
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
that I shouldn't know

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
that I shouldn't know.

118
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,680
Manman.

119
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
Please tell me.

120
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
No matter what happened to the Qin family,

121
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
my brother will always be Manman's brother.

122
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,720
One more thing.

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
I need your help.

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,520
What?

125
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,120
I want to know where Lu Huai is locked.

126
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,760
Miss Qin, please.

127
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,840
Isn't this Miss Qin?

128
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,240
I heard her brother is dying.

129
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
No wonder there's no news about the Qin family.

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,280
It turns out that evil has retribution.

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
It seems that Yan City

132
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,400
is no longer up to the Qin family.

133
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
That's right.

134
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,840
Miss Qin, please.

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
It's your Huasheng after all.

136
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
owes the Qin family money.

137
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Why can't you set a room?

138
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,600
There are too many people talking.

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Aren't you afraid of getting your ears dirty?

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Hey, girl.

141
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
I really have no money.

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,160
Otherwise, Young Master Qin wouldn’t have paid for it.

143
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,960
We're even poor now.

144
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
I can't even afford a room.

145
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,240
You...

146
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
What did I say?

147
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
The Qin family really can't do it.

148
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
Even Ms. Qin

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,560
to ask for money.

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,600
What are you doing, Ms. Qin?

151
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,920
What do you think I'm doing?

152
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,600
You...

153
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,360
How dare you kill in public?

154
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,120
I, Qin Manzhi, am arrogant and domineering.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,960
You've never heard of it before.

156
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
Don't think that everyone is afraid of you.

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
They are afraid of...

158
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,600
Please spare my life, Miss Qin.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
I'll talk to the higher-ups.

160
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Don't kill me.

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,160
On behalf of the Qin family,

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
on behalf of my brother,

163
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
on behalf of my brother.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,880
Idiot!

165
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,080
I didn't do what Young Master told me to.

166
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,880
How are we going to report this?

167
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,800
Shoot!

168
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
It's not just a trigger.

169
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
If you want to protect yourself,

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,640
if you want to protect yourself.

171
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,520
Do you see the target in front?

172
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
That heart

173
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,560
is the enemy's heart.

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
I hate the Qin family.

175
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,000
But I'm not doing this for Mo Wen.

176
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
My life

177
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,680
on your account.

178
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
When Lu Huai fulfils his wish,

179
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,520
you can do whatever you want.

180
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,520
Lu Huai.

181
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,720
What should I do?

182
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,760
What is your relationship

183
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
between you and Mo Wen?

184
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Lu Huai.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Lu Huai.

186
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,240
Lu Huai.

187
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,040
Lu Huai, do you hear me?

188
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
You can't die.

189
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,600
I have your life.

190
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,560
Miss.

191
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
I see you again.

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,800
It's nice.

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,080
Stop struggling.

194
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,880
It's useless.

195
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,960
Stop struggling. It's useless.

196
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I didn't expect

197
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,080
I couldn't even

198
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,680
even in my dream.

199
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Miss.

200
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,640
If you come here

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
to kill me,

202
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm willing to do it.

203
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,760
There was something

204
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,360
I didn't dare to ask you.

205
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,080
You told me in the apartment

206
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
the rumor was true,

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
is not necessarily impossible.

208
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,320
It's not impossible

209
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
is not necessarily impossible.

210
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,280
Is it your joke or the truth?

211
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,960
You haven't answered me

212
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,400
about the rouge that day.

213
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Forget it.

214
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
Does the past matter

215
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
is still important?

216
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,360
I hope

217
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,760
It's true.

218
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Just take it as a dream.

219
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
Lu Huai.

220
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,560
Didn't the doctor say

221
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
When will your leg

222
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
recover?

223
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,040
Maybe

224
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,560
in my life.

225
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
I never thought that when I was Qin Chu,

226
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
I would have to live on a crutch.

227
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,240
I've sent someone abroad.

228
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,760
When I was studying abroad,

229
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
when I was studying abroad.

230
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,080
I'll tie you up even if you tie me up.

231
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,800
Shu.

232
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,440
You don't have to thank me.

233
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Now the Qin family

234
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
all depend on Manzhi.

235
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
If Manzhi is willing to

236
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,640
even if I disobey my father,

237
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm still willing to marry Manzhi.

238
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
Everyone sees the Qin family

239
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,000
as the abyss.

240
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,960
If you don't hesitate,

241
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
When we met,

242
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,640
I stuttered too.

243
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,920
Without Manzhi,

244
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Shen Panshu wouldn't be...

245
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,000
Today's page book.

246
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,600
I appreciate

247
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
for Manman.

248
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,800
Manman is stubborn.

249
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,240
I can't decide her marriage.

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
I don't want to use Manman's marriage

251
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,560
for the wealth and wealth of the Qin family.

252
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,120
Shu.

253
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Do you understand?

254
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Of course I understand.

255
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,240
But I came to the Qin Mansion

256
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
I have my own selfish motive.

257
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,079
Just say it.

258
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,319
I heard

259
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,240
Ziqiu Lu Huai is locked up.

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
I want to see him.

261
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,359
After all,

262
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,040
he is the son of an old friend.

263
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
You're awake.

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,680
Good for you.

265
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,440
It was really a dream.

266
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
Everything is in vain.

267
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,160
will die.

268
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Why keep it a secret for Mak Wen?

269
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm not stupid.

270
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,520
If I told you where Mak Moon is hiding,

271
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
he would have been dead.

272
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
Young Master Qin.

273
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,080
The moon shines on the moon.
