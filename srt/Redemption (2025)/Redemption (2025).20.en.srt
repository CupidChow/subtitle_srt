1
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,680
Thank you, Young Master Shen

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
for letting me go.

3
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
and informed Qin Chu.

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,840
I gave you a chance.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
If you don't meet Manman,

6
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,160
would this be the result?

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,479
We were childhood friends.

8
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,880
But what about you, Gu Chi?

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,520
You knew that you had a deep grudge against the Qin family,

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
yet you still want to meet Manzhi.

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,320
and drag her into the abyss.

12
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,720
You told her?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I promised you

14
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,280
I won't tell her.

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
But...

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
I told Qin Chu Shi.

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Shen Page Book.

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,320
When we were young,

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,680
we attended the main school together.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
We had classes together.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,160
We have never resented each other.

22
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
No resentment.

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,960
Are you kidding me?

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Gu’s fragrance powder

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,440
will always be on Shen’s side.

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,040
Even in the academy test,

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
you were the one who won the championship.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,000
You're not as good as others.

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
Now you're blaming me.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Everyone

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,880
praised you

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
They call you

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,840
in Yan City.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
And me?

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,960
I was compared to you

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,280
I was compared to you.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm the only son of the Shen family,

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,960
but I was called Little Shen.

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,640
Why did I stutter when I was young?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Your father forced me.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
I was so scared that I couldn't say a word.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,960
Bao.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,800
Are you sure Young Master Shen and brother

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
went to the basement?

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,360
Yes

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,640
Siu-shun told me

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,960
to hold her off

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
When did that happen?

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Less than an hour.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
But if you go now,

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
Young Master will understand.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
you knew the place

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
You knew about it?

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,120
It's too late to think about this.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
Shen Panshu is meticulous.

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,480
I don't know what he'll do to Lu Huai.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,920
I hate you so much.

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
But I was forced to learn from you.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,440
But I was forced to copy you.

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
to dress up like you,

61
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,720
I learn how you eat.

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
The Gu family has roses in the garden.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
the Shen family will plant them.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
You are elegant and noble.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,280
and always high up.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,320
Have you seen

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,800
I've been living?

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200
Shen Page Book.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,280
Have you ever thought

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
everything

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
is your inner demon.

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,640
Look at you.

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
That's it.

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
Make everything

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
as if nothing happened.

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
When I was young,

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,920
I didn't get first place

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,279
because of the school test.

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
and cried.

80
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
You comforted me

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
to come again.

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
But there's no next time.

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
As long as I live under you,

84
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
what I think

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
will never be seen.

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm afraid

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Even without me,

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,000
no one will see you.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
I wish I could kill you myself.

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,760
But I won't.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
If Manzhi knows

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
you died in my hands,

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
she will hate me.

94
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Young Master asked you to find him in the lobby.

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
But he just came here

96
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
And Young Master Shen is still inside

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,360
It’s urgent

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,000
If it takes too long,

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
It's up to you.

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
Manzhi.

101
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,080
I like butterfly pastry.

102
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,840
I like white roses.

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
and rouge.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,200
I always thought

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
it was just a coincidence.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,560
Until I knew you were Gu Chi,

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,040
I realized

108
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,760
the person she was looking for

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,200
is you.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
But you don't want to tell her.

111
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,360
You don't want her to know either.

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
It's just that you have your own purpose.

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,040
It's just a coincidence.

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
Shen Panshu.

115
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
Your ability to reverse right and wrong.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
So from then on,

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,080
I thought the peach tree was stiff.

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
But...

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
don't think I dare not kill you.

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Miss.

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,840
If you let Bao send false messages again,

122
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
I can't help you.

123
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Miss.

124
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm in charge of the Qin Mansion now.

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Even if my brother knew I was in the basement,

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,840
So what?

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,520
Step aside

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,120
I heard Young Master Shen is here too

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
That’s why I came to see

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,240
Now you've disturbed me.

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Forget it.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Manzhi.

133
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,680
We meet again.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
I came to see you.

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
and

136
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,280
to see my old friend.

137
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,200
He's just a traitor.

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,280
Why are you still thinking about the page book?

139
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,440
I asked Bao to make a pot of Longjing tea in the garden.

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
Let's try it together.

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,400
Let's go.

142
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Longjing tea used to be good.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,000
People are just like Longjing tea.

144
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,880
It's clear that

145
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,040
The timing is wrong.

146
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,600
the taste will change.

147
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,880
But no matter what happens,

148
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,040
Longjing

149
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
It's Longjing.

150
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,960
Manzhi.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Many changes

152
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
during these days.

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,920
But my feelings for you have never changed.

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,760
The bitter fruit is not the fruit.

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,760
There are so many noble ladies in Yan City.

156
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
Why are you so obsessed with me?

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,920
No matter what I do,

158
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,640
no matter what I do?

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,440
Manzhi.

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
You have to choose me.

161
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
You can only choose me.

162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,760
Are you the young master of Gu House?

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,760
I heard that Mr. Gu is very strict.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
If

165
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
he finds out you gave me the clothes,

166
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,200
Don't worry.

167
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm a guest of the Gu family.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,240
Mr. Gu can't control me.

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,680
Because of your words, we accidentally...

170
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Lu Huai.

171
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Can we never go back?

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,160
It's getting late.

173
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
Go back and rest.

174
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,960
I won't ask

175
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,320
why I came to you.

176
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
Forget about Lu Huai.

177
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,880
Don't you understand

178
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
how I punished Bao today?

179
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,520
Brother.

180
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,640
Please.

181
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
What?

182
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
Beg me to let Lu Huai go.

183
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
and begged me to forgive him for seven years as an undercover in the Qin family.

184
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
He used you and my feelings

185
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
to be Mowen's lackey.

186
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Let him go.

187
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
But did the people behind him spare Xiao Wu?

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,960
and those guards who risked their lives to protect the Qin family?

189
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,920
But you know it too.

190
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,680
He...

191
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,840
He is Gu Chi.

192
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
Because he is Gu Chi,

193
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,000
That's why we can't let him go.

194
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
You and father

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you and father never told me anything.

196
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
But even so, I know

197
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,160
the fire in the House of Gu is not simple.

198
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
I can't interfere with father's decision.

199
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,280
But he did it for the Qin family.

200
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,840
But brother,

201
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,320
Gu Chi saved me.

202
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
If it weren't for him,

203
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
I would have starved to death in the famine.

204
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I know.

205
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,760
He's a traitor.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,080
A mole.

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,800
But without him,

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,080
without him.

209
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
Manman.

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,440
I can promise you anything.

211
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
But this won't do.

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,720
As long as he's alive,

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
the Qin family will never live in peace.

214
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
Do you remember

215
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
when you were little?

216
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,680
I didn't follow my father

217
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,200
I only held a pen in my hand.

218
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,840
Now my hands are stained with blood.

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,880
But you're different.

220
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
I hope you can

221
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
just cook tea and listen to operas.

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
Go to the big world when you're unhappy.

223
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,920
You can choose the young men in Yan City.

224
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,560
and live a carefree life.

225
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
Okay?

226
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,800
Don't cry.

227
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,520
Don't cry.

228
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Don't cry.

229
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,680
Don't cry.

230
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,840
It's time to make a choice.

231
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,440
Manman, are you looking for me?

232
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,320
Sister-in-law.

233
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,600
Help me figure out

234
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,120
how much these shops can be pawned.

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,200
Why do you suddenly start pawning?

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,080
Recently,

237
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,600
the money on Qin family's account can't be financed.

238
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
I thought

239
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,400
I can solve it myself.

240
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,080
These are...

241
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,600
These are...

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,280
are the dowries my brother and father saved for me.

243
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Sister-in-law.

244
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
What's wrong?

245
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,880
What's going on?

246
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,000
It turns out

247
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,520
Gu's secret recipe

248
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,440
fell into the hands of the Qin family

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
and sold it to Shen's.

250
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
That’s why the Qin family

251
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
had such a huge income back then.

252
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,440
Turns out

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,520
Gu Ji's fire

254
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
was really related to the Qin family.

255
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
I'll ask him with the contract.

256
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,280
Don't, sister-in-law.

257
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,240
Let Lu Huai go.

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,440
I want to save Lu Huai.

259
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Manman has finished his work.

260
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,320
I can finally drink with you.

261
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Do you remember?

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,600
Last time you were drunk,

263
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,200
when you were drunk last time.

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Your leg...

265
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,840
My legs are almost healed.

266
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,640
I can't always be crippled.

267
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,560
This toast

268
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,400
I wish we can continue our relationship.

269
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
This toast

270
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
to my wife.

271
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,760
to become the master of the opera circle.

272
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,000
to be the master of opera.

273
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,800
I know you mind the past

274
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,920
I hope this gift

275
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
can solve your problem.

276
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Let him go.

277
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,960
Miss.

278
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Get lost!

279
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,800
Miss.

280
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,040
Leave Qin Mansion first.

281
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
This is my brother's order.

282
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
It's the Young Master's order.

283
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,200
or you?

284
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
I can tell.

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
If you don't go with me,

286
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,520
Lu Huai.

287
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,080
I'm from the Qin family.

288
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,760
If only I knew nothing about your past.

289
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,760
I wouldn't have

290
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,920
even a hug makes me feel indebted.

291
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,520
Lu Huai.

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,760
Leave now.

293
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,480
You saved me again.

294
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,000
And I owe you last time.

295
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
I can't pay you back.

296
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,760
We can't settle our scores.

297
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,920
Chu.

298
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
Why are you so careless?

299
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
The moon shines on the moon
