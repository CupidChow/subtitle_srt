1
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,880
When did you find me?

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,360
I knew from the moment you entered.

3
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,160
Mrs. Qin, what role do you want to play today?

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,600
To submit to me.

5
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
What do you think?

6
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
It was me at the beginning.

7
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Shu.

8
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,079
It's late.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,480
at this hour?

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Tomorrow,

11
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,480
I want to borrow Manzhi from you again.

12
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
I want to take her for a walk.

13
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,079
No problem.

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
But you have to ensure Manman's safety.

15
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,600
If Manman loses a hair,

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,680
I won't forgive you.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,440
Of course.

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Let's put it this way.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,079
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

20
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Where is Lu Huai?

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,079
If you think he's in your way,

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
I won't let him follow you.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,560
No need.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,840
He's still Man Zhi's bodyguard.

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
Let him follow.

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,520
Is there anything wrong

27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,640
Is there any problem?

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Everything is ready.

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't worry, Young Master.

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
You told me

31
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,920
You told me the same thing.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
In the end,

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,160
It was Lu Huai who saved the damsel

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,160
I failed

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,640
Please punish me, Young Master

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Get lost!

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,760
Yes.

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,160
Sugar figures for sale!

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,040
Freshly made sugar figurines.

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Sir, buy a candy for her.

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,360
The sugar figurines are delicious.

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,520
Miss never owes favors.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,560
I'll take all of these.

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Thank you.

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,480
There's nothing between Manzhi and me.

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,760
It's hard to buy her beauty.

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
You've been a bad student at such a young age.

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,920
Apologize to me.

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,760
You have so much sugar.

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
So what?

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Kid.

52
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,760
This money

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
is from me.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
It's different from stealing.

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Don't do this again.

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,800
What's your name?

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Where do you live?

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Let these two brothers take you home, okay?

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,120
My mother is sick.

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,640
I want to eat almond pancakes.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
But I can't afford it.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,920
I thought I could give her some sugar figurines.

63
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
I can buy you almond pancakes.

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
But promise me

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,560
don't do such petty things again.

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Really? Can I ask him to buy it for me?

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,360
This...

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,560
Okay.

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,360
If this lady agrees,

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
I’ll buy it for you

71
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,040
Thank you, Young Master Shen

72
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Sister, I know where is fun here

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I'll take you there.

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Sure.

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
We're almost there.

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,159
My mother often brought me here.

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
I won't tell him about others.

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Thank you then.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You're welcome. Because you gave me candy.

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
Miss.

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,000
When did you

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
to strangers?

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
She's just a child.

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,320
I don't know if Lu Huai thought too much.

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
I always feel that

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
at this time.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
She's just a child.

88
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
What bad thoughts can she have?

89
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,280
There are many children in this world.

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,120
A lonely child like her

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
It's because the world is speculating about her.

92
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
they took the wrong path.

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Maybe Lu Huai

94
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,440
malicious speculation.

95
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,640
Come and play.

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,640
Be careful.

97
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Be careful.

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Stay away from the water, okay?

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,960
But I'm a good swimmer.

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,680
No matter how good you are,

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,320
don't go near the water.

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
If you are not careful,

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,040
you might drown in the water.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,720
Gu Chi, you must live.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Get up.

106
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Are you scared?

107
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Lu Huai.

108
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,480
Are you afraid of water?

109
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
Sister.

110
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
You're good at fighting.

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,280
be afraid of water?

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,320
By the way,

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
Are you not mad at me anymore?

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
I forgot what happened.

115
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,600
I want to go back.

116
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
I miss my mom.

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,320
Miss.

118
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,360
How about I send you back to Qin Mansion

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,480
before sending her back.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,960
Okay.

121
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,800
Can you go back with me?

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm scared.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,320
Let's give her a ride.

124
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,640
and then meet up with the page.

125
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,920
You're so nice.

126
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,960
Where did they go?

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,520
Young Master,

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
I think he's heading towards the suburbs.

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
I didn't dare to go far because you didn't come.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,560
Let's go inside and have some tea.

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,039
I'll boil water for you.

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,880
My dear sister.

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,320
I work with money.

134
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,160
Sorry.

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
The door won't open.

136
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,280
Let's go inside.

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Miss.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,680
Miss.

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,920
Something is wrong with the candle.

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,520
We were set up.

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,400
We were assassinated before.

142
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
This time, they just locked us up here.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Let me think of a way.

144
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,400
I don't know who he is,

145
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
but he locked us up here.

146
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,560
a man and a woman.

147
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
When the rescue arrives tomorrow,

148
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
the city will be in chaos.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,560
That's because

150
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,360
to ruin your reputation.

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Miss Qin.

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,760
has no good reputation.

153
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,960
They are...

154
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,280
They don't want the marriage between Qin and Shen families.

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't worry.

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
I will take you out.

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Don't catch a cold.

158
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
They underestimated your loyalty to me.

159
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
Lu Huai sent a message.

160
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,520
we have the schedule.

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,560
We have two happy events today.

162
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
Anything else?

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,240
Scar Liu just sent a message.

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,800
has locked Lu Huai and Qin Manzhi together.

165
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,040
Locked together?

166
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,600
I've made up my mind.

167
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,080
Instead of letting the Shen family marry the Qin family,

168
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
it's better for Lu Huai.

169
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
If Lu Huai

170
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
become Qin Chu's brother-in-law,

171
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,760
I can beat the Qin family.

172
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,800
Think of a way.

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,840
Lu Huai.

174
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Lu Huai, stop walking around.

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
It makes me dizzy.

176
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,680
Miss, hang in there.

177
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,440
You have a fever.

178
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,040
When I get out,

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,200
I will send someone to search them thoroughly

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,920
and let them know

181
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
our family is not to be trifled with.

182
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,040
What about that little beggar?

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
What should we do with her?

184
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
Take her to Qin Mansion.

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,920
and let Xiao Wu scold her.

186
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Let her know what the mortal world is.

187
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,000
All right.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,760
Take a rest.

189
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,640
Take a rest.

190
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,840
Let me think of a way.

191
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
Lu Huai.

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
What are you doing?

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,200
Hello, Young Master Shen

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
Hello, Mrs. Qin.

195
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
She went missing with Manzhi.

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
I want to ask her

197
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,600
if she has returned to the Qin Mansion.

198
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
She's already back.

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,240
She said she won't see you if she's tired today.

200
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll ask Manzhi to call you back tomorrow.

201
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
It's getting late.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,160
I was outside at first.

203
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
I won’t keep Mr. Shen.

204
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I won't bother you then.

205
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,160
Next time,

206
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,480
next time.

207
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay.

208
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,520
What happened?

209
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Why did Lu Huai and Manzhi disappear together?

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Feeling better?

211
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
Yes.

212
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,200
It's still cold.

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Hug me.

214
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
It's still cold.

215
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,040
Miss.

216
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,120
Excuse me.

217
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,000
Do you feel better now?

218
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,160
Is this

219
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
last time?

220
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
It doesn't hurt anymore.

221
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,080
I don't know why.

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,960
I just can't be happy.

223
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
I've already found

224
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,320
the person I love.

225
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,640
The moon shines on the moon
