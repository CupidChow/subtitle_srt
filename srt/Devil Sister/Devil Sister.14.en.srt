1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello, Irin?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,170
My company is about to start a YouTube channel.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,820
The first book we’ll feature is about pet behaviors.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,380
So I want an animal specialist to talk in the video.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,170
Where’s the vet for the show?

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,540
Ugh! What a hellish traffic!

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,690
Do you even know how to drive?

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,810
We will wait for the insurance to come here.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,210
Answer your phone, Tan. Damn it.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,350
When is it going to start?

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,010
I bet they ghosted.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,130
Good. She deserves it.

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,290
Totally.

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,810
Sorry I’m late.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,570
Cha, what are you doing here?

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,210
You’re filming the show today, aren’t you?

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,730
Tan is involved in a minor accident.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,170
So I’m here to cover up for her.

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,570
Is Tan alright?

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,970
She’s okay. Don’t worry.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,370
What is this kid doing here?

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,170
I’m here to help Irin with the show.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,810
I’m glad to see you here.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,610
You asked for his help?

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,840
Um...

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,570
I’m dressed up for today.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,970
The staff is ready.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,370
I’ll do my best today, Irin.

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,956
I asked Tan, his sister, to help

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,820
because I couldn’t reach the vet we had invited for the show.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,770
But she had an accident. So Cha will be helping us.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,680
Is he reliable?

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,350
People may criticize us for inviting a rookie as a specialist.

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,610
Our book should not be recommended by a rookie like him.

35
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,183
Why don’t you give me a chance?

36
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:13,219
If you don’t think I do well, then you can find someone to replace me.

37
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:19,125
Let’s give him a chance. It may turn out well.

38
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,819
I build this company with my own hands.

39
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,397
If the company’s reputation is damaged by it,

40
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:28,779
are you sure you can handle the consequences?

41
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,579
I’ll take the responsibility for it.

42
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:37,219
How?

43
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:42,019
Any ways that I can. I’ll do everything that you want me to do.

44
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,819
Don’t forget your words.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,893
Cha, are you sure that you can do it.

53
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,819
Did you read the book?

54
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:32,379
Don’t worry.

55
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,779
You cannot screw this up.

56
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:50,419
You know that I have high expectations for it, don’t you?

57
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,379
Trust me.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,179
What are you doing? Someone might see us.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,819
Can you give me a little support?

60
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,619
Give me some support.

61
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,019
I’m rooting for you.

62
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,463
Not that kind of support.

63
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,619
Too much.

64
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,019
You’re so demanding.

65
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,973
We will begin the shooting in 10 minutes.

66
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,977
Can you give me more time?

67
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,619
Sure.

68
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:12,019
Are you ready, Namcha?

69
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,097
Yes.

70
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,417
Let’s go.

71
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:50,419
It must be so comfortable that you fell asleep.

72
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:04,085
I’ll get a wheelchair for you.

73
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,979
It’s okay. I can walk.

74
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:16,777
Where is Grandpa?

75
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:21,434
He went to the office for a promotional video shooting for a new book.

76
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,979
Does he know that I’m being discharged today?

77
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,019
Yes.

78
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:34,819
But he chose work over me.

79
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,379
He visited me at the hospital only once.

80
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:42,019
His condition is not good.

81
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,807
Don’t overthink it.

82
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:49,219
No one wanted to visit me. Cha didn’t even...

83
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,179
Thank you so much.

84
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,419
For what?

85
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,979
You are the only one who is on my side.

86
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,619
How is your wedding with Irin?

87
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:07,179
I’m waiting until you are getting better before I go back and work on it.

88
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,016
What I like about this book is that it provides

89
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,419
correct information on how to raise different types of animals.

90
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,313
I haven’t found any books that

91
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,000
provide such thorough information as this one.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,712
This is a book for those who have just begun

93
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:25,247
to raise an animal or those who are raising one

94
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,411
but want to learn more about it.

95
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,411
Good.

96
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,551
He is not only good-looking but also smart.

97
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,005
We should produce more video clips like this one.

98
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,029
Does he have a girlfriend?

99
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,179
Yes, he does.

100
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,579
Don’t you have work to do? Why are you hanging out here?

101
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,179
Pong.

102
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,422
Yes.

103
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,742
When will I get to see the first draft of the edited video?

104
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:02,054
Around next week.

105
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:06,019
That’s great. The book will be released around that time.

106
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,325
How was I doing?

107
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,185
You did well.

108
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:14,379
It will make the editing much easier.

109
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,992
What about you? How was I doing?

110
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,419
You did alright.

111
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,819
That’s it?

112
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,219
Um, that’s it.

113
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:30,019
You should be very grateful to me for saving your life.

114
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,579
Let’s wait and see the number of views first.

115
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,842
It will definitely get a high number of views.

116
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:39,220
His good looks will have a positive impact on the number of views.

117
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,779
Excuse me.

118
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,819
He said I’m good-looking.

119
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,013
Yes.

120
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,379
Am I good-looking?

121
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,019
Everything went well. There was no problem.

122
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:09,579
Are you close with that kid?

123
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,997
I’ve known him since he was young.

124
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,779
Good if that’s your relationship with him.

125
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,995
Is there anything you want to say?

126
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,819
I should be the one who asks you that.

127
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,179
Is there anything you haven’t told me yet?

128
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:38,308
If it’s work-related, I have told you everything.

129
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,619
What about Jin?

130
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,908
When will you marry him?

131
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:42,965
Grandpa.

132
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,819
Why do you have to make things complicated?

133
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,219
Jin is a hard-working person.

134
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,779
He can help support your career advancement.

135
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:58,819
Don’t choose someone who will be a burden to the company.

136
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,219
I got it.

137
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:04,779
But I think it’s too soon to talk about marriage.

138
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,219
Are you going to wait until I die first?

139
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,779
Come in.

140
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,619
Jin hasn’t come back yet?

141
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,179
I haven’t seen him.

142
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,979
Why does he take so long to give Inn a ride home?

143
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,619
Why do you want to see him?

144
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:44,419
I want to talk to him about your marriage.

145
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,082
Grandpa, about that...

146
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:55,179
Grandpa, can I talk to you?

147
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,906
Grandpa.

148
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:01,219
Grandpa.

149
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,619
Grandpa, where is your medicine?

150
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,779
Is this your medication?

151
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,419
Irin, call an ambulance.

152
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,819
Okay.

153
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,607
Grandpa.

154
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,607
Call an ambulance.

155
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:21,649
Yes.

156
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,973
Grandpa, take a deep breath.

157
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,819
The ambulance will be here soon.

158
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,108
Grandpa.

159
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:34,779
Grandpa.

160
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,400
He will be alright.

161
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,820
He will be okay.

162
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:45,740
Aren’t you going to work?

163
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,019
I’ll wait until the housemaid is back.

164
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,579
Why do you care so much about me?

165
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,595
You should get some rest.

166
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:00,019
I have had enough rest during the past several days.

167
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,099
Do you have anything you want to eat?

168
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,979
I’ll tell the housemaid to prepare it.

169
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,019
Can you come closer to me?

170
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:14,419
Why?

171
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,819
Just do it.

172
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,179
Is this close enough?

173
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:32,379
You only cared about looking after me that your jacket got all wrinkled.

174
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,580
Done.

175
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,979
Thank you.

176
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,779
Hello, Irin.

177
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,579
Is he alright?

178
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,219
I’ll hurry and meet you there.

179
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,503
Inn, your grandfather is admitted to a hospital. I have to...

180
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,979
Are you going to break your word that you will keep me company?

181
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:36,019
A balloon angioplasty is not that dangerous. So don’t worry too much.

182
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:44,462
I can’t help thinking that people around me

183
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,779
always came across unfortunate events.

184
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:56,379
My father and mother, Inn, and now my grandfather.

185
00:13:56,893 --> 00:14:01,179
I can’t help that I’m the one who brings bad luck to the family.

186
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,317
Don’t think that.

187
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:05,979
It has nothing to do with you.

188
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,885
Your grandfather is old.

189
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:13,038
What happened to Inn and your parents were accidents.

190
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:16,819
Inn is now recovering and getting well.

191
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:20,379
Tan is fine. I am fine, too.

192
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,020
Tan?

193
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:31,219
I’m not sure if I am a good friend to her.

194
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,019
About our relationship?

195
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:39,371
It’s not your fault.

196
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,979
You are just not ready to tell her about us.

197
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,779
So stop blaming yourself.

198
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,442
You should go back to work.

199
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:52,903
Thank you so much

200
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,379
for taking care of my grandfather and the shooting today.

201
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,601
If you weren’t there, terrible things might happen.

202
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,579
You feel thankful to me.

203
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:08,379
You should stop blaming yourself. Do you hear me?

204
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,179
How can I stop my thoughts?

205
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,379
What are you doing?

206
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:37,219
Stay still.

207
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,619
Do you feel anything?

208
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,819
Goosebumps.

209
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,739
I want to tell you that you are the one

210
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:58,819
who makes me want to wake up every day.

211
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:04,779
You aren’t the person who puts other people go through bad things.

212
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,219
I always meet good things on every day that I have you.

213
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,419
I told you to not do something like this.

214
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,819
I don’t like it.

215
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:31,179
You told me that you can’t stop yourself from having those thoughts.

216
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:37,219
So I need to make good memories to replace those thoughts.

217
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:40,058
The only way to get rid of bad thoughts

218
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,179
is to replace them with good memories.

219
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,413
What should I do about those who are happy

220
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:51,619
while making other people feel miserable?

221
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,419
Inn, what are you doing here?

222
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:59,979
If I didn’t come, I wouldn’t have seen what you did.

223
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,871
You were just discharged from the hospital.

224
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,779
You should rest.

225
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:09,927
At this point, I think you can stop pretending that you care about me.

226
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,219
Everyone already knows what kind of person you are.

227
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:16,779
You only care about your feelings.

228
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:20,382
Stop talking nonsense.

229
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:25,131
Do you know why you never saw all the good things that Irin did for you?

230
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,619
It’s because you only care about yourself.

231
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,179
So you never paid attention to the good things other people did for you.

232
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:35,979
You are the most selfish person.

233
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:38,379
Stop talking to Inn like that.

234
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,615
You know that she is unwell.

235
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,419
You should be more considerate to her.

236
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,819
You, too.

237
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,082
You took her to the hospital

238
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:52,779
so you can play a role of a hero protecting her.

239
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,874
You let the sick person take up the matter

240
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:01,219
while you try to calm things down.

241
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,619
Do you think people can’t see through your plan?

242
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:10,819
Inn, you are so stupid that you keep letting him use you.

243
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,019
You do know that you are accusing me?

244
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:19,844
I can sue you for that.

245
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:21,149
That’s enough.

246
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:23,979
This is a hospital. You shouldn’t be arguing here.

247
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,779
Cha, you should leave.

248
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,146
Jin, you should take Inn to see Grandpa.

249
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,979
And I hope that you won’t take her around in the future.

250
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,742
I have never hated someone so much like this.

251
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:54,019
Why do I have to have a sister like her?

252
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,819
I think Namcha should be more careful.

253
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,219
He shouldn’t judge other people like that.

254
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,179
How could you fall for a guy like him?

255
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:08,451
You are his friend but he...

256
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,979
I’ll do everything to end their relationship.

257
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,779
Can you help me?

258
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,619
Do you trust me?

259
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,979
If we don’t hurry and take action, you will never get what you want.

260
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,179
What do I need to do?

261
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:47,979
We need to expose their relationship.

262
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,379
How?

263
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:56,419
You told me that you help them keep their relationship a secret.

264
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,379
What if it’s no longer a secret?

265
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,779
What would happen?

266
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,232
Namcha’s parents and Irin’s friends,

267
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,219
will they support their relationship?

268
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,419
Irin.

269
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,219
I told you to leave.

270
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,305
Stop walking away from me, otherwise,

271
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,419
I’ll follow you to see your grandpa.

272
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,219
None of these is your fault.

273
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:42,019
I will always be by your side. Do you hear me?

274
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,748
So stop running away from me.

275
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:50,379
No matter what happens, I will find you.

276
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,407
I will never let you go.

277
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,979
I got it.

278
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,054
You should go back to work.

279
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,185
He will be alright.

280
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,219
He will be okay.

281
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,019
How are you feeling?

282
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,579
Why is Inn here?

283
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:50,379
I want to visit you. So I asked Jin to take me to the hospital.

284
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:54,845
You should take care of yourself. You are not fully recovered.

285
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,419
You shouldn’t have come.

286
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:58,819
I’m worried about you.

287
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,379
I’ve been ill many times.

288
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:05,334
I have never seen you want anything to do with it.

289
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:07,179
Why did you come to visit me this time?

290
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:16,779
Grandpa, I have a favor to ask you.

291
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,890
It must be a big favor that you want me to help you before I die.

292
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,179
What is it?

293
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:34,819
I want to get married.

294
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,619
To whom?

295
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,019
Namcha.

296
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:49,219
You said there was nothing between you two.

297
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:55,179
He also made it clear that he doesn’t want you.

298
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,579
So why are you still holding on to him?

299
00:22:58,185 --> 00:23:00,248
But I want to be with him.

300
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,379
There are many guys out there.

301
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,515
Why are you holding on to him?

302
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:09,311
He can’t do anything. All he can be is a burden.

303
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,819
Because I love him.

304
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,936
I’ve had a crush on him for a long time.

305
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,779
Can’t you help make my wish come true?

306
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:22,585
I have never asked anything from you.

307
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:25,195
Can’t you help me on the matter?

308
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,619
Why all you think about is him?

309
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,125
Why don’t you think about other stuff?

310
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,760
Have you ever thought about the company?

311
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,819
Do you know if the company has a problem?

312
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:40,779
The company is the thing that will help you to have a good life.

313
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:44,402
Have you ever allowed me to do anything in the company?

314
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:46,819
You let Irin take care of everything.

315
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,677
About her marriage?

316
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,675
You can manage to have her marry Jin.

317
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:55,755
So why can't you arrange that for Cha and me?

318
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,132
So I have to admit that

319
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,979
this is the best thing the granddaughter that I’ve raised can do?

320
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,619
I’m dying but you never care about it.

321
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,019
If I was dead, what would you do?

322
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:09,579
You will be fine.

323
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,996
As long as the company is still running,

324
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,379
you will do anything to recover your health.

325
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:20,419
For you, the company is the most important thing.

326
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,219
How did it get there?

327
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,819
Why are you here?

328
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,655
I’m here to deliver the towel to you.

329
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,779
Please rate your satisfaction with my service.

330
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:55,179
Why did you do that? I was scared.

331
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,819
Crazy.

332
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:04,779
Please rate my service.

333
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,179
Stop joking around.

334
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:13,048
Please rate the service provided by this robot.

335
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,619
If I’m not satisfied with the service, what should I do?

336
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,617
Then I will hold your hand.

337
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:22,819
You will do it anyway. This is unfair.

338
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,219
That’s right.

339
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,419
Irin. Wait for me.

340
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,219
Let’s go out and have dinner.

341
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,619
I can’t. I have work to do.

342
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:43,663
No. You need to stop complaining.

343
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,579
But we barely see each other.

344
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,075
I see each other every day. What are you talking about?

345
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:50,868
We see each other often.

346
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:53,522
If we see each other often, we should always be together.

347
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:55,362
I have work to do.

348
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:58,757
Can I apply for a job at your company?

349
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,244
I don’t want to be a vet anymore.

350
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:02,379
I want to spend time with my girlfriend.

351
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,779
That’s too much.

352
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:09,579
I’m so happy that I thought I was dreaming.

353
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:13,219
I’m so happy that I’m afraid that I would wake up from this dream.

354
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,318
That hurts.

355
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,579
I did that to wake you up.

356
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,176
You did that to wake me up?

357
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:26,379
Cha, are you getting back on me?

358
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,819
Why are you running away from me?

359
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,383
I’m older than you. You can’t tease me.

360
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,579
I haven’t done anything.

361
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:35,564
Cha, stop it.

362
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:36,602
Cha.

363
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,179
I got you.

364
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,414
Let me down.

365
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,565
If I get wet, I’ll be mad at you.

366
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,986
So are you going to do what I ask you to?

367
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,257
Alright.

368
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:52,008
Are you sure?

369
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:54,019
Yes. Put me down.

370
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:59,604
Then tell me how much you love me.

371
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:02,019
Are you crazy? How can I say that?

372
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,453
It should be shown through my actions.

373
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,623
No one would say it.

374
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,179
But you said you would do whatever I asked you to.

375
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:11,274
I did but I can’t say it.

376
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:13,179
Cha, stop it.

377
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,579
I got it. I got it.

378
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:17,136
Are you sure?

379
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,397
Yes.

380
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:20,379
So how much do you love me?

381
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,557
I love you so much.

382
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,019
How much?

383
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:27,063
I don’t know how to describe it in words.

384
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,819
How much?

385
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:30,185
What?

386
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:32,594
Cha.

387
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:34,154
Okay, okay.

388
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,179
I love you as much as I could love someone.

389
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,979
Irin.

390
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,579
What if it’s no longer a secret?

391
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:20,653
Namcha’s parents and Irin’s friends,

392
00:28:20,677 --> 00:28:23,810
will they support their relationship?

393
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,540
How are you doing? Are you fully recovered?

394
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,241
I was discharged from the hospital several days ago.

395
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,819
I’m happy to see you are back and healthy.

396
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,400
I’m not that healthy.

397
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,134
Earlier, my inner organs were not healthy.

398
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,090
Now my external organs are also not healthy.

399
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,022
I don’t know what karma I did.

400
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:56,145
Don’t think that way.

401
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:58,957
Take care good care of yourself and you will get better.

402
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:03,524
It will be a while before Cha will get home.

403
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:07,262
He has a plan to expand the hospital.

404
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:10,170
So he has to contact many people about work.

405
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,379
It’s okay. I’m here to talk to you.

406
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,943
Where are your parents?

407
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:19,574
I think they aren’t home yet.

408
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,579
Why?

409
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,219
I want to talk to you about Cha.

410
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,019
Why? Did Cha do something that upset you?

411
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,419
Tell me. I’ll take care of it.

412
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,379
Do you know that Irin is dating Cha?

413
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:42,019
What?

414
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,819
Have Irin told you that she is dating Cha?

415
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,619
You didn’t know about it?

416
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:56,419
They have been dating since Cha attended the same high school as me.

417
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,770
Since high school?

418
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,379
Cha was only 15 -16 years old at the time.

419
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:04,779
Yes.

420
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,479
So I want to talk to you about it

421
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:11,979
because I’m afraid that it might become a problem later.

422
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:20,419
Are you sure that it’s not a misunderstanding?

423
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:31,881
It will be great if you move back to your house.

424
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,579
So we will live close to each other.

425
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,822
Both Inn and my grandpa are unwell.

426
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:37,657
They need someone to take care of them.

427
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,306
I’ll help you take care of your grandfather.

428
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,622
Don’t cause any more problems.

429
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:44,419
My grandpa will have a headache if he sees you.

430
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:47,979
I’ll do everything to win him over.

431
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,379
Don’t think that far.

432
00:30:58,585 --> 00:30:59,980
Irin.

433
00:31:00,878 --> 00:31:02,379
What’s wrong with you again?

434
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:07,179
Now we are back together.

435
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:10,819
What’s wrong if I call you by your name again?

436
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:14,379
I never said that we are back together.

437
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:19,179
Let my hand go. I have to pack my stuff.

438
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:31,179
If I can do this, it means that we are back together.

439
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,819
We are not.

440
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:39,635
We aren’t?

441
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,460
Um.

442
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,022
Then I’ll give you a peck kiss.

443
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,779
I want to see my will.

444
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,859
But I think you should wait until you get better before you do that.

445
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,979
Are you going to wait until I die first?

446
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:18,019
I wrote a will and gave it to your father. Go get it for me.

447
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:23,979
I want to take care of everything before I die.

448
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:47,979
Can you take a look at the details of my plan for the hospital?

449
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:51,622
Is it okay to create a budget like this?

450
00:32:57,462 --> 00:32:59,405
What’s wrong?

451
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,219
Why are you looking at me like that?

452
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,179
It’s not a good time. I’m going to bed.

453
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:14,379
Usually, you don’t go to bed this early.

454
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,419
Get out.

455
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,979
What’s wrong?

456
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,217
Are you mad at me?

457
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,779
Get out.

458
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:46,819
What’s wrong with her?

459
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,019
You were right.

460
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:56,419
About what?

461
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:59,979
I was stupid.

462
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:03,619
I don’t get it. What are you talking about?

463
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,302
Hypothetically, you have a best friend.

464
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:10,819
But that friend has been lying to you all your life.

465
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:13,595
What would you do?

466
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,198
I would stop seeing that friend.

467
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:17,141
If she has been lying all this time,

468
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,179
it means that she isn’t honest with you.

469
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,219
That’s right. I agree with you.

470
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,619
Don’t tell me that.

471
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,254
Irin, this way.

472
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:36,019
Tan, are you right?

473
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,419
You didn’t get hurt from the accident the other day, did you?

474
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:41,105
I’m leaving.

475
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:44,379
Why? You just got here. You haven’t drunk the coffee.

476
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:46,779
I don’t want to drink it anymore.

477
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,060
I’m sick of liars.

478
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,548
What’s going on?

479
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,219
Wait, Tan.

480
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:00,019
Are you mad at me?

481
00:35:03,457 --> 00:35:07,219
I think you know what you did wrong.

482
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,146
Then tell me. So we will be on the same page.

483
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:15,146
Calm down.

484
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:17,979
I had trusted you.

485
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,619
I told you everything.

486
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:28,819
But I had never thought that you would do this to me.

487
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,219
What did I do?

488
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,619
That’s right. What did she do?

489
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,019
So brazen.

490
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:40,819
Do you want me to tell you what kind of lies you had told me?

491
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,819
Why don’t you say it out yourself?

492
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,619
What lies?

493
00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:48,019
I don’t get it.

494
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,019
How long have you been dating my brother?

495
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:03,579
Since he was 15.

496
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:07,614
Look at your age gap. How could you do that?

497
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:12,019
There are many guys out there but you choose to date my brother.

498
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,180
Disgusting.

499
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:16,232
You need to calm down.

500
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:17,979
Please hear me out.

501
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:22,779
No, I’m not going to listen to anything from you.

502
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:32,253
You know how disgusting it is to do what you do.

503
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:34,253
So you are afraid to tell me.

504
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:41,979
I trusted you to take care of Cha for me.

505
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:45,619
I trusted you to block those girls who were approaching him.

506
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,419
But in the end, you date him.

507
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:53,979
If I didn’t find this out,

508
00:36:56,265 --> 00:37:00,019
I would be a fool that was deceived by you for the rest of my life.

509
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:08,379
How could you call yourself my friend?

510
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:13,179
Excuse me, please stop filming.

511
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:17,979
I’ve never had that kind of thought.

512
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:26,419
Drop your act.

513
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:29,979
Tan.

514
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:37,182
Did you really do that?

515
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,380
I’m sorry.

516
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,219
I’m sorry.

517
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:20,525
Damn it.

518
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,659
Dr. Namtan, did you see the news?

519
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,779
What are they doing here?

520
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:53,296
Are you two having fun to see me being a fool like that?

521
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:57,579
Don’t worry. I’ll help you talk to Tan.

522
00:38:57,994 --> 00:38:59,478
Where are you going?

523
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:00,300
I’m going home.

524
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,023
I saw you act like this several times.

525
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:06,542
You know that you can’t leave me.

526
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:10,650
No matter what happens, we will fight it together, won’t we?
