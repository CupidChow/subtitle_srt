1
00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:04,084
How long haven’t I come to drink at your condo?

2
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:08,379
Those who have ever dated someone from their close circle, drink!

3
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:09,828
Who did you mean?

4
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:10,871
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:13,755
The one you had a crush on but couldn't tell anyone about.

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,973
Namcha.

7
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:17,078
Why are you calling my name?

8
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:20,379
I answered your question from earlier.

9
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:23,979
I have a favour to ask you.

10
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,272
What is it?

11
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:27,047
I like Namcha.

12
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,752
You didn’t come to the meeting.

13
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:31,179
Leave me alone.

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,977
Thank you. Please come again.

15
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,878
It’s 9PM.

16
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:49,725
We’re closed.

17
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,579
Let me stay here for a while.

18
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,979
I don’t wanna go home just yet.

19
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,508
I’d love to,

20
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,075
but I can’t stomach anything right now.

21
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:21,311
Why?

22
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,779
What’s wrong?

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,179
Nothing.

24
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,779
I heard you went drinking at Irin’s place.

25
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:31,691
Yes.

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,322
Next time, invite me, too.

27
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:37,179
It’s been a while since I last caught up with Irin.

28
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:43,179
I bet you guys were wasted last night.

29
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,820
Well... just a little.

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,077
I doubt "a little"  would cut it.

31
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,096
When did drinking
at Irin’s ever result

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,934
in anything less
than being wasted?

33
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,185
That’s especially true for your sister.

34
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,151
She’s a loud drunk.

35
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,586
As for Irin, she’s a crazy drunk.

36
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:02,844
You can’t tell if she’s going to laugh or cry next.

37
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:07,179
And she loves showing off her stuff, that bird pendant thing.

38
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,103
Did she flaunt it at you this time, too?

39
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:10,909
Bird pendant?

40
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,720
What bird pendant?

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,580
It’s a necklace or something.

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,681
She said she’s so fond of it.

43
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,179
I do have a clip of that. I’ll show you.

44
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,087
Wait here.

45
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,924
Look!

46
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,900
Isn’t it pretty?

47
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:33,828
Yeah.

48
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,185
We heard it the last ten times you said it.

49
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,223
We know you like it so much.

50
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:42,404
Who said I like it?

51
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,379
I love it.

52
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,794
Very much.

53
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:51,579
You wear that all the time, don’t you?

54
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:55,494
Yeah.

55
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,379
Oh, what the hell?

56
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,779
Why are you crying?

57
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:07,659
I thought you were showing off your jewellery.

58
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,437
It really is the same one.

59
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,135
I have something I need to do.

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,042
I’ll see you around.

61
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:31,240

69
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:28,250
Hello.

70
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,979
Did everything go well?

71
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,583
I’m not so sure.

72
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:35,979
How come?

73
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:38,379
You got what you wanted, didn’t you?

74
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,979
I don’t know.

75
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,979
Maybe...

76
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:51,579
I still feel like this isn’t mine.

77
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,324
That’s why I...

78
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,179
I think you’re too nice.

79
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:58,195
Me?

80
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,979
Yes.

81
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:03,579
I’m about to steal my own sister’s man,

82
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,979
and you call me "nice" ?

83
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:09,285
I’m not buying that.

84
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,179
But isn’t that exactly why you’ve always lost at this game?

85
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:17,834
It’s because you’re not selfish enough.

86
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,177
This is a game.

87
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:26,379
There’s not a single game where you ask the winner why they want to win.

88
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:32,379
Everybody should know that the world doesn’t have a place for losers.

89
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:37,179
But I have been a loser my whole life.

90
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,779
But you’ve got me now.

91
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,143
You’re not alone anymore.

92
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,579
Instead of giving up before you even try,

93
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:51,106
why not think you also deserve what you want?

94
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:56,379
I think you need to allow yourself to be happy from time to time.

95
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:01,179
You’re right.

96
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,979
Even someone like me deserves to be happy.

97
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,379
I’ll try.

98
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:16,779
Thank you.

99
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:20,379
Nobody has ever said that to me before.

100
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,779
Just think of me as your lawyer.

101
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,779
I’ll do everything I can to make you win this case.

102
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,579
Thank you.

103
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:28,779
I know you saw me.

104
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:30,868
Open the door.

105
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,380
I need to talk to you.

106
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:37,742
If you don’t open the door, I’ll shout so loud the whole floor wakes up.

107
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,580
Talk to me.

108
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,302
What are you doing?

109
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:49,179
How did they let you up here?

110
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:11,979
I knew it.

111
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,678
What’s with you?

112
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,779
How did you get here?

113
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:20,216
Cha.

114
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,130
You need to leave, Cha.

115
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,456
No.

116
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,386
I have something I need to talk to you about.

117
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:27,157
Get out.

118
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,979
Or would you like to talk outside where everyone can hear us?

119
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,291
There’s nothing to talk about.

120
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,779
I think I’ve made myself very clear.

121
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,573
Liar.

122
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,779
Cha, stop being immature and listen for once.

123
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,345
Then...

124
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:50,379
Just tell me why you’re still wearing the necklace I gave you.

125
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,502
What do you mean?

126
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,785
I bought this one myself.

127
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,179
Are you out of your mind?

128
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:05,979
Liar.

129
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:08,917
Don’t assume.

130
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,979
This pendant is common everywhere, you know.

131
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,379
You think?

132
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,779
I don’t know if it’s common everywhere like you said.

133
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:33,579
But these are the ones I personally customised.

134
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,379
They’re definitely unlike anything else.

135
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,779
How so?

136
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,779
These are made per my request.

137
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,379
They’re magnets.

138
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,979
They’re meant to always fly into each other.

139
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,779
I’m sure they’re unlike any other pendants.

140
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:53,025
I know that now.

141
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,743
Then I must have mistaken it.

142
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,779
I have loads of necklaces. I don’t remember who gave me which.

143
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,081
I put it on by mistake.

144
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,093
You know what, I’ll never wear it again.

145
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,093
Don’t.

146
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,779
Can you wear it forever?

147
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,780
It makes me feel like...

148
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:20,379
We are what we were way back when.

149
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:29,979
But it’s over between us, Cha.

150
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,379
Stop bringing it up.

151
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:35,979
You know I haven’t moved on.

152
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,454
Then it’s time for you to.

153
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,979
There’s someone else who is right for you.

154
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,379
Someone like Inn.

155
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,659
Take care of her.

156
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:47,979
Go.

157
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:50,379
Can you stop telling me to be with Inn?

158
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,140
If you don’t want anything to do with me,

159
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,379
at least don’t tell me to get together with someone else.

160
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,023
But Inn—

161
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:01,179
Do you want me to call Inn right now?

162
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,668
I’ll tell her that it’s impossible between her and I.

163
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,309
Don’t.

164
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,379
Don’t ever do that.

165
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,979
Then stop saying that to me.

166
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,382
I want to take care of you.

167
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,779
No one else.

168
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,570
(Thank you for the meal.)

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,850
(Let’s do it more often.)

170
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:16,411
It’s all because of you that I’m so exhausted.

171
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:19,179
I don’t think I have enough strength left to go home.

172
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,179
Guess I have to sleep here.

173
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,712
Hold it right there.

174
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:25,179
Who even let you come in here? Get out.

175
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:27,336
Get up.

176
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,562
Go home.

177
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:30,281
You’re heavy.

178
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:34,395
But you’re the reason I am all tired out.

179
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,979
You said you’d come and then you didn’t.

180
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,779
And I even thought things would be better if I saw you.

181
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:42,644
Quit your acting.

182
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,379
Do you really think I’d let you stay over?

183
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,979
Today...

184
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:57,579
A dog died because of me.

185
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:04,779
It was all my fault.

186
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:08,379
I couldn’t save him.

187
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,380
That’s just what working is like.

188
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,779
Everybody makes mistakes.

189
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,179
It’s just real life.

190
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,579
You must have felt awful

191
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:37,179
when you were in that accident.

192
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:43,179
It was just a dog this time, and I felt horrible.

193
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,779
Had it been a man, I must have felt...

194
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,379
It was awful, wasn’t it?

195
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:59,979
I’m sorry I wasn’t there by your side that day.

196
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,474
Mistakes at work happen all the time.

197
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,379
Don’t think about it too much.

198
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:20,379
Even I myself haven’t come up with a way to increase the book sales, either.

199
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,743
I’ve tried everything.

200
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:27,579
People just don’t read as much as before anymore.

201
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:34,242
If they don’t read...

202
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:37,179
Why not make them listen?

203
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,779
Something to listen to while stuck in traffic.

204
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:43,179
I do that all the time.

205
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,979
Who is it?

206
00:15:58,607 --> 00:15:59,980
Good evening.

207
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,223
Is everything alright?

208
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:04,779
You texted us to come here.

209
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:08,591
Please, accompany this man downstairs.

210
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,780
He happens to be an uninvited guest.

211
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,802
I’m counting on you.

212
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:12,736
Yes, ma’am.

213
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:14,379
Irin?

214
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,515
Please.

215
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:19,935
Irin, let me stay for a while longer.

216
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,779
It’s almost midnight, you know. Please?

217
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,231
If he makes it difficult for you, feel free to call the cops.

218
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,736
Yes, ma’am.

219
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,579
Please, sir.

220
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:29,717
Irin.

221
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,179
Please, sir.

222
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,579
Let’s get you downstairs.

223
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,582
Be confident, Namcha.

224
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,979
You can’t be more ready than this.

225
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,179
Go for it!

226
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:58,305
You’re still here?

227
00:17:58,305 --> 00:17:59,979
I slept down here last night.

228
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,071
I’ll have you know.

229
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:02,260
Liar.

230
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
You’ve changed your clothes.

231
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:07,179
Still observant, aren’t you?

232
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:10,311
I should have called the cops on you.

233
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,917
What a hassle.

234
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,579
You’re so mean.

235
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,979
Is that news to you?

236
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,531
Happy Birthday.

237
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:26,379
I was going to tell you last night when it hit midnight.

238
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,779
But you chased me off so heartlessly.

239
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,179
Go home, Cha.

240
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,779
Someone is coming to pick me up. I don’t want him to see us.

241
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,179
Someone is picking you up?

242
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,779
Is it the same guy who dropped you off yesterday?

243
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:43,179
Go home.

244
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:47,924
I think we should celebrate your birthday.

245
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,768
Don’t you have work?

246
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,146
I’m off duty today.

247
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,714
I am not.

248
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,979
I’ll give you a ride to work.

249
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,737
I said someone is already coming to pick me up.

250
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,137
Call him and tell him to back off.

251
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,605
Cha, go home.

252
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:04,167
If he sees us and tells someone, it’ll be trouble, you know?

253
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,523
We’re just going to celebrate your birthday for a few hours,

254
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,236
it’s nothing.

255
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,477
Cha, Cha.

256
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,779
Hide.

257
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,979
Hurry up.

258
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,779
Let me go.

259
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,179
Don’t show your face, you hear me?

260
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:46,779
But if you do, why shouldn’t I?

261
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,690
(I have something to do with a friend. Don’t come pick me up.)

262
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,779
Good riddance.

263
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,623
Why are you looking at me like that?

264
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:33,579
Where should we celebrate your birthday?

265
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,179
I don’t care where.

266
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:55,924
Where is Irin?

267
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:59,979
She didn’t say, only said she’d take the morning off.

268
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:03,579
She never takes days off.

269
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,779
How nice! Now I’m refreshed.

270
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:36,585
The water is deep around here,

271
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:41,293
perfect for releasing big fish like silver barbs or shark catfish.

272
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:43,179
I’ve prepared them for you.

273
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:46,299
What? Isn’t it okay to release any types of fish into the river?

274
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,671
It’s not.

275
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:51,277
Each aquatic animal lives in its distinct natural habitat.

276
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,979
If you release them into the wrong environment, they could die.

277
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,579
Instead of saving their lives, you’ll only be killing them.

278
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:02,207
Eels, for example, should be released into shallow waters.

279
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,152
Because they live in swamps.

280
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,429
Or mudfish and catfish,

281
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,874
if you release them into a river with strong tides,

282
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,733
they might not withstand the current and eventually die.

283
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:17,374
Then I have been doing it wrong my entire life.

284
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:19,102
Now I feel sorry for them.

285
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,311
Don’t worry.

286
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:22,779
With me by your side, you’ll never do it wrong again.

287
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:25,564
Who says anything about letting you stay by my side?

288
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,779
I only come here because you made me.

289
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,579
Adorable turtles, aren't they?

290
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,749
They’re cute.

291
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:54,373
Time to get into the water, little guys.

292
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,921
Miss, you can’t do that!

293
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,579
You can’t release them here.

294
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,979
What are you talking about?

295
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,038
These are tortoises.

296
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:04,297
They’re not meant for deep water.

297
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:07,179
If you release them here, they won’t make it.

298
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,805
Look at their feet.

299
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,171
Those aren’t webbed feet for swimming.

300
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:14,277
If you release them right here, they’ll drown.

301
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:17,435
Oh, he’s a vet.

302
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,299
Is that right?

303
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,016
Thank you for telling us.

304
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:26,379
Then where should I release them?

305
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,779
We can just leave them here at the temple.

306
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,899
You can’t, actually.

307
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:33,645
If you leave them here, they could get run over by cars,

308
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,979
or starve to death.

309
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:40,779
How about this? You can contact some turtle lover pages on Facebook.

310
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,579
Or you can send them to my hospital and I’ll handle the rest.

311
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,379
Here.

312
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,902
I don’t think we have time for that.

313
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:57,579
Can you please take care of it?

314
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,136
See?

315
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:05,142
You had to lecture them, didn’t you?

316
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,179
Now we end up with these tortoises.

317
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,545
We’re helping them.

318
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,979
It’s good to do charity on your birthday, you know.

319
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,454
I wish you only happiness and no misery.

320
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:43,179
I also wish for...

321
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,779
What are you doing?

322
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,179
Closing my eyes to make a wish.

323
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:50,988
Why are you making a wish?

324
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,779
That’s for me to do.

325
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:53,634
Silly.

326
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,114
Be generous and let me do it, too.

327
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:58,779
Did you make any senseless wishes?

328
00:24:58,844 --> 00:24:59,845
I won’t tell you.

329
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,800
It wouldn't come true otherwise.

330
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:09,074
Hey, you haven’t made any wishes. It’s your birthday.

331
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:11,979
There’s nothing I wish for.

332
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:14,866
That’s not right.

333
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:17,979
You have to at least wish for something.

334
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,629
Fine.

335
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:23,448
Then I wish for these tortoises to get off the table right now.

336
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,205
Just leave them be.

337
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,161
If we put them on the floor, someone could step on them.

338
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,979
The inside of the car is too hot for them, too.

339
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:42,380
Here.

340
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:45,063
I have a present for you.

341
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,579
(Voucher for meals with me for the rest of our lives, free of conditions.)

342
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,457
(Redeem whenever.)

343
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:58,331
(Once redeemed, refusal is not possible under any circumstances.)

344
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:00,320
This is so low-cost.

345
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,379
What do you mean, "low-cost" ?

346
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,779
It lasts a lifetime, you know.

347
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:07,179
I won’t ever need it.

348
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,706
How can you just throw it away?

349
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:12,902
That’s not nice.

350
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,902
Keep it in here.

351
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:23,696
I know you don’t care for special occasions.

352
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:27,579
You probably won’t even celebrate with anyone like usual.

353
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,979
But I still want you to remember today.

354
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,205
You’re such a nag.

355
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:38,011
Like an old man.

356
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,038
It’s time to go. I have to work.

357
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:43,440
And one more thing, these tortoises are really chowing it down.

358
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,579
Don’t even think about chewing on my bag.

359
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:54,748
You want some cake, tortoises?

360
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,379
Enough!

361
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,179
Please, come in.

362
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:09,154
I haven’t seen Irin all morning.

363
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,705
Where has she gone?

364
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,705
Didn’t you pick her up this morning?

365
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,579
I think she had something to do with a friend.

366
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,115
Which friend?

367
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,979
She’s only got a few friends and they’re all probably working right now.

368
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,779
She didn’t tell me anything else.

369
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,579
Can you look up the animal hospital’s contact number?

370
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,770
Thank you.

371
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,379
Hello. This is The Wisdom Animal Hospital.

372
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,977
Is Dr. Chonnawee in today?

373
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:08,506
Dr. Namcha is off duty.

374
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,780
But Dr. Namtan and Dr. Chanin are in.

375
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,579
Thank you.

376
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,179
Namtan, Irin’s friend, is working.

377
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:27,579
But the one who isn’t working today is Namcha.

378
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,244
She really must be with him.

379
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:38,382
Slow down, Inn.

380
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:43,179
Maybe Irin is with another friend.

381
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:46,779
She doesn’t trust people.

382
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:49,179
She will only let someone she trusts go with her.

383
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:55,179
I told her I like Namcha, and she still does this to me.

384
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:57,385
Please, calm down, Inn.

385
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,739
That might not be the case here.

386
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,379
Let’s not jump to conclusions.

387
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,979
I need your help.

388
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,379
With what?

389
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,475
Where have you been, Irin?

390
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,853
Inn.

391
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:46,721
You startled me barging in here like that.

392
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,179
You came in late.

393
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,979
If there is no meeting, I don’t actually need to be here.

394
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:55,600
Why are you asking?

395
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,362
I was just late.

396
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,979
Maybe I asked because I was worried about you.

397
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:04,779
Fine. Tell me what you need to say.

398
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,411
It’s your birthday, isn’t it?

399
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:09,579
I thought you had a date with someone.

400
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:13,179
You know I’m not the type to do that with anyone.

401
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,322
You’re right.

402
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:17,979
I was thinking the same thing.

403
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,185
What's this?

404
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:28,085
Your birthday gift.

405
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,979
I made it especially for you.

406
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,979
Do you like it?

407
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,570
(This will was written by Miss Intira Bannasorn. In case of death, all assets shall fall to Miss Irin Bannasorn.)

408
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,050
(Signed by Jintapanu Pongpun)

409
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:55,179
What is this, Inn?

410
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,223
It’s my will, of course.

411
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,223
Jin helped me write it.

412
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:02,379
I am ready to give up everything I have to you.

413
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:04,779
I don’t want anything else.

414
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,179
There is only one thing I want.

415
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,382
Inn, have you lost your mind?

416
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,179
This isn’t something to joke about.

417
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,579
I am not joking.

418
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:17,979
I really am ready to give you everything.

419
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,776
I will ask for one thing in return.

420
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,979
Namcha.

421
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:28,779
Promise me you’ll let me have this.

422
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,579
Don’t do this again.

423
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,210
I never want anything that belongs to you.

424
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,579
Remember that.

425
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:09,579
How could you help Inn write such a thing?

426
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:11,979
She asked for my help.

427
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:17,979
Did you not think it strange she wanted to give that as my birthday gift?

428
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,451
I didn’t know she would do that.

429
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:23,979
She only asked for my help.

430
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,077
I know she hasn’t been the healthiest.

431
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,979
So I didn’t think it was strange for her to write a will.

432
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,200
What are you so mad about?

433
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,979
That Inn is ready to give you everything she has?

434
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:39,579
Isn’t it nice that your sister loves you that much?

435
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:41,579
I think it’s a good thing.

436
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,379
But you shouldn’t have taken it so lightly.

437
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:47,275
I don’t think it’s uncommon.

438
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:50,379
What is it with you?

439
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,579
Just know that I won’t accept it.

440
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,616
What are you looking at?

441
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,179
Don’t you have work to do?

442
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:16,779
It’s been weeks and there’s still no solution to our sales issue.

443
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,179
Don’t poke your noses in other people’s business.

444
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,977
If they don’t read...

445
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:27,482
Why not make them listen?

446
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,497
Something to listen to while stuck in traffic.

447
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:31,410
I do that all the time.

448
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:37,048
Look up information on audio books, podcasts, YouTube videos.

449
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,779
Cost, copyrights, and how to go about them. I want everything by tomorrow.

450
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:57,579
Hello?

451
00:33:58,768 --> 00:33:59,979
Oh.

452
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,379
Picking up Irin’s car, isn’t it?

453
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,979
I happen to be busy at the moment.

454
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:09,579
I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.

455
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,579
Bye.

456
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:33,579
What is this, Inn?

457
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,979
It’s my will, of course.

458
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:37,979
Jin helped me write it.

459
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,779
I am ready to give up everything I have to you.

460
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,179
I don’t want anything else.

461
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,579
There is only one thing I want.

462
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:47,152
Inn.

463
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,931
I will ask for one thing in return.

464
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:50,379
Namcha.

465
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,179
Promise me you’ll let me have this.

466
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,179
Irin.

467
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,179
We’re here.

468
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:08,118
When will they finish repairing my car?

469
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,582
Is there even that much to be done?

470
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:12,345
I just talked to the garage today.

471
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,644
They said there are many issues and they’re waiting for spare parts.

472
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:20,379
Once there are any updates, I’ll let you know as soon as possible.

473
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:22,779
Wait.

474
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,379
Happy Birthday.

475
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,899
How did you know it’s my birthday?

476
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,005
Did Inn tell you?

477
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:40,779
Did you forget I’ve worked for your grandfather for a long time?

478
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:44,259
Even if...

479
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,779
you never even noticed I existed.

480
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:51,579
I hope you like my present.

481
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,677
Oh, Cha?

482
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,731
What are you doing here again?

483
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,979
We already met this morning.

484
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,404
It’s your birthday.

485
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:27,579
I don’t want you to be alone.

486
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,954
Stop coming here.

487
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,954
What if someone sees you?

488
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:36,834
So...

489
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:38,379
Who gave you this?

490
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,779
That’s my business.

491
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:45,579
Don’t tell me it’s that lawyer guy.

492
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,179
Yes.

493
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:51,579
Do you have a problem with my gift?

494
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,380
You dropped this in the car.

495
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,183
I’m here to return it.

496
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,179
Thank you.

497
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:07,179
I didn’t think I’d see you here, Dr. Namcha.

498
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,382
I want to marry you,

499
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,777
but more than that, I want you to be happy.

500
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,263
Be happy, huh?

501
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,251
Are you busy tomorrow?

502
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:26,647
Can you come see me at home?

503
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:28,034
Where have you been all night?

504
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:30,454
Sleeping with someone you’re comfortable with

505
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:32,851
is so much better than sleeping alone.

506
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,416
Cha brought a girl home.

507
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,979
Does her family even know about this?

508
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:37,269
Where have you been all night?

509
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:40,066
You’re a girl and you’re out all night with a man?

510
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,477
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?

511
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:44,189
You don’t remember what you did last night?

512
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:48,130
I hope what we did makes everything easier.
