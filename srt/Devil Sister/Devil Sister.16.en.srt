1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,370
How could you keep it a secret for this long?

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,592
That’s your best friend’s little brother.

3
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,662
Is it that entertaining to make a fool out of me?

4
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:09,579
You know about Irin and me?

5
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:10,651
How did you find out?

6
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,037
It doesn’t matter how.

7
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,074
What matters is why you lied to me.

8
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:16,779
Do you still think of me as your sister?

9
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,669
Adoption.

10
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,761
Irin isn’t his real granddaughter.

11
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,050
If you think he’s going to give the company to Irin, you’re wrong.

12
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,189
Get out of my company.

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,594
You have no right to have a say in this place that will never be yours.

14
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,450
You killed my parents.

15
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,334
You’re bad luck.

16
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,330
Get out!

17
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,179
Irin, why don’t you answer my calls?

18
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,077
Where is Irin?

19
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:04,090
If it’s not about Irin, have you ever thought of coming to see me?

20
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,414
Where is Irin?

21
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,260
I don’t know.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,619
She’s probably dead.

23
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:13,179
That would be great. So I don’t have to see her again.

24
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,960
Stop talking badly about your sister.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,219
The more you talk, the clearer I can see your true nature.

26
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:24,019
I’ll tell you one thing. That woman is not my sister.

27
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:24,844
She is just…

28
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:28,819
You said you are close to her.

29
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,219
Why do you ask me about her whereabouts?

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,451
Tell me where is Irin?

31
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,020
Inn is not fully recovered.

32
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,419
You had never visited her.

33
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,819
Now you’re stressing her out.

34
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,379
I think that’s selfish. Don’t you think?

35
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:49,179
I think you should get some rest.

36
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:17,979
Why did you stop me from telling him the truth?

37
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,619
It’s no use to tell him now.

38
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,451
Why not?

39
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:27,579
If he knew, he would realize Irin is nothing and doesn’t deserve him.

40
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:32,379
You’re his friend. You know that he doesn’t listen to anyone.

41
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:37,179
If you told him now, he would look at you more negatively.

42
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:43,219
I think you should focus on your recovery first.

43
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,619
Thank you.

44
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,182
You are the only one I have.

I should feel happy now, shouldn’t I?

53
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:32,379
I found out the woman that I’ve been hating is not my sister.

54
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:36,019
I found out that my grandfather is giving all his assets to me.

55
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:41,979
I found out that the woman that I hate doesn’t have anything that I have.

56
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,619
I should be smiling.

57
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,019
So why aren’t you?

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,419
I don’t know.

59
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,619
I’ve never been happy in my entire life.

60
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:01,179
So I don’t know how to be happy.

61
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:08,379
Even good things like this happened, why am I still crying?

62
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,579
Okay.

63
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,379
From now, I’ll be happy.

64
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,179
I won’t care about other people’s feelings.

65
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:43,219
Why? Why are you crying if you are happy?

66
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,019
You get everything that you want.

67
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,579
Before your grandfather is discharged and comes home,

68
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,979
Is there anything you want to do?

69
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,619
I’ll take you to do it.

70
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,800
Did you tell Tan about Irin and me?

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,579
Can you tell me who Tan is?

72
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,945
I don’t know her.

73
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,331
Don’t play dumb.

74
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,019
Only you are capable of doing a terrible thing like this.

75
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:27,579
From what you said, I can sue you for defamation.

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,379
Inn was the only one who knew about my relationship with Irin.

77
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,172
For all these years,

78
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:37,179
it had been kept a secret until you came into the picture.

79
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,419
So what else could it be?

80
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:43,219
If it’s the truth, you should not be worried about it.

81
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,383
Or you think it’s an inappropriate relationship.

82
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:46,777
So you don’t want anyone to find out?

83
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,179
It’s the truth.

84
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,579
But Irin and I didn’t do anything wrong.

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,219
Those who tried to intervene between us are the ones who did wrong.

86
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,619
You shouldn’t talk to someone older like this.

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,579
I don’t do this to adults who act respectfully.

88
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:08,379
Some adults don’t have the immaturity that people their age should have.

89
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,779
I have no reason to respect them.

90
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:14,555
Where is Irin?

91
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,819
I told you I don’t know.

92
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,379
If you love her that much, why didn’t you watch over her?

93
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,674
Watch over her?

94
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,051
In the same way that you watch over Inn?

95
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,819
You have no right to say that. You are the one who hurt Inn.

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,619
Is it because of me or because you want Inn’s inheritance?

97
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,419
When Irin doesn’t choose you, you turn to cling to Inn.

98
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,982
If you don’t know the truth, you should stay quiet.

99
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:46,779
I admit that I don’t know everything.

100
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:49,179
But I’m not stupid.

101
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:52,819
I can see your true nature.

102
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:58,779
When I’m done solving these problems, I’ll have Irin fire you.

103
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,182
Did my words hit your weak spot?

104
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:05,979
A backstabber like you can’t handle it?

105
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,379
I haven’t done anything to you.

106
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:16,819
I warn you. Stay away from Irin and me.

107
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,619
I will never let you cause us any trouble again.

108
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,419
Dr. Namcha is here.

109
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,019
I came to see Irin.

110
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,327
Irin hasn’t come into the office.

111
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,819
When will she come?

112
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,219
I don’t know.

113
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,349
She may never come into the office again.

114
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,780
Why?

115
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,456
The company’s executive might be changed.

116
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,379
What happened?

117
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,019
Nothing.

118
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,419
I don’t think Irin will come into the office in the next few days.

119
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:05,980
How is that possible? She is a workaholic.

120
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:09,619
Something must have happened.

121
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,285
Miss, what happened?

122
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,844
I think you should ask someone else.

123
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:20,379
I’m just an employee. I don’t want to talk about it.

124
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,149
Hello, professor.

125
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,619
I got the email that you sent the first three chapters.

126
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,179
I heard that you moved to Chantaburi.

127
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,179
Chantaburi? That’s right.

128
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:50,422
You drove all the way here.

129
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,819
What would you do if I wasn’t home?

130
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,047
I think you won’t leave your house for long.

131
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:58,779
Look at those cows and chickens.

132
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:03,579
If their owner weren’t here, what would they do?

133
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,444
Those who raise animals are always like this.

134
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,047
They can’t leave home for long.

135
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:09,619
You’re smart.

136
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,819
Did you come to see the car’s owner?

137
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,379
How long has she been staying here?

138
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,146
Since this morning.

139
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,019
What happened in Bangkok?

140
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,817
There are some problems.

141
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:31,219
She has a problem with her friend.

142
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,779
But it’s not a big deal.

143
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:36,320
If she only had a fight with her friend,

144
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,419
she wouldn’t have run away this far.

145
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:40,819
I don’t think that is all.

146
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,779
She has been staring into space since she got here.

147
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,020
Get out of my company.

148
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,579
You have no right to have a say in this place that will never be yours.

149
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,345
You’re just a child someone picked up.

150
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,730
How dare you took everything from me!

151
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,019
Why did you run away to cry alone?

152
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:27,579
How did you come here?

153
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,219
I told you that you can’t run away from me.

154
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:33,619
I knew everything that happened.

155
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:36,019
How did you know it?

156
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:39,579
Tan told me.

157
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,979
How did Tan know it?

158
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,619
You had a fight with Tan, didn’t you?

159
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:47,402
Oh.

160
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,419
Is there something else?

161
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,619
Do you know how much I am worried about you?

162
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:41,979
This is where you want to come?

163
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,379
Why?

164
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,019
I thought you would ask me to take you somewhere far.

165
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,965
When I was young, I never got to play anything like this.

166
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,819
I always spent my time in the hospital.

167
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,324
When I wanted to play, my family always stopped me.

168
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,478
They were worried that something might happen to me.

169
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,019
You must have felt bored.

170
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,979
Why do I hate my life so much?

171
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,977
I’ve never got to do what I want like Irin.

172
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:14,419
She’s not even their real daughter.

173
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:17,979
So why don’t you do it now?

174
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,952
But this is a playground for kids.

175
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,819
There are no signs saying this is for kids only.

176
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,219
I don’t think so. It’s embarrassing.

177
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,619
I’ll play with you.

178
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,019
I won’t let you feel embarrassed alone.

179
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,379
Let’s go.

180
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:27,416
Maybe I don’t deserve him.

181
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,979
That doesn’t sound like you.

182
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,379
That’s true.

183
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,714
Maybe I’m not the person you think I am.

184
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,579
I don’t want you to be such a loner.

185
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,376
If you stopped acting like this,

186
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:45,619
I would be happy because I knew that you finally got to be happy.

187
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,419
I don’t think I should enjoy happiness too much.

188
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,580
Why?

189
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:55,219
Because I will feel even more miserable if I lose it.

190
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:59,104
If you know that the happiness you are having

191
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:02,419
is the last one in your life,

192
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,700
Are you still able to enjoy it?

193
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:08,379
Have you ever watched fireworks?

194
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,109
Why do I need to watch them?

195
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,613
It’s a waste of time.

196
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,562
I don’t waste my time watching the thing

197
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,819
that appears in the sky for a few seconds.

198
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,578
Then how would you see the beauty of fireworks

199
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:22,779
that only appear for a few seconds?

200
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:30,702
If we get to see the beauty that we can never keep,

201
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:34,779
For me, I’ll choose not to see it in the first place.

202
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,179
That’s a shame.

203
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,629
So are you going to spend your life under the dark sky?

204
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,219
Why don’t you let yourself live in the light?

205
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,619
Although the light may last only briefly,

206
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:50,419
it will show you the beauty in this world.

207
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,016
I’ll open it for you.

208
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,182
I never thought it would be this fun.

209
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:37,220
Do you feel unwell?

210
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,779
No, I feel great.

211
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,419
I’ve never seen you this happy.

212
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,979
Thank you.

213
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,779
Without you, I wouldn’t have had a chance to do something like this.

214
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,782
Why are you with me?

215
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,579
If I weren’t with you, where would you want me to be?

216
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:14,379
What about Irin?

217
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,019
You like her so much, don’t you?

218
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,579
What about you?

219
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,219
Do you wish that Namcha was here instead of me?

220
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,179
He would never come.

221
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:38,379
JN	Then how could I let you be alone?

222
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,700
If I take everything that should be mine from Irin,

223
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:49,219
are you still going to be by my side?

224
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,779
We have a deal.

225
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,579
I’ll do anything so you will win.

226
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,219
Namcha will be yours.

227
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,019
Then you will marry Irin.

228
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:18,019
Don’t cry.

229
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,579
I’ve promised you that you will be happy.

230
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,819
Do you really feel okay now?

231
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,219
Yes. I told you that I’m here for work.

232
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,604
If you are here for work, do you have to stay here until this late hour?

233
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,179
It’s urgent work.

234
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:49,219
Did you get any sleep?

235
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,619
You look tired.

236
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:55,179
If you stopped asking me, I would have gone to sleep already.

237
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,379
Do you want me to sleep in the room with you?

238
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:06,693
Irin.

239
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,422
Can you turn off the light?

240
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,019
Irin.

241
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,419
Quiet. I’m trying to sleep.

242
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:40,779
Don’t do this.

243
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:44,419
Irin that I know is not this kind of person

244
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,979
You would have told me to sleep outside.

245
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,619
Tan can’t stay mad at someone for a long time.

246
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,179
Things will get better soon.

247
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,855
She loves you so much.

248
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,379
She will stop being mad at you soon.

249
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,219
I’ll go and sleep outside.

250
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:15,619
Don’t.

251
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,980
Irin.

252
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:04,779
Irin.

253
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,979
Irin.

254
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,020
What?

255
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,752
Why are you calling for me? I’m surprised.

256
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:20,419
I didn’t see you so I thought you were running away from me again.

257
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,979
Do you think I have many places I can run away to?

258
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,309
Am I having an illusion?

259
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,419
Are you cooking breakfast?

260
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,765
Why?

261
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:37,219
It’s not that hard.

262
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:40,779
Do you really make it by yourself?

263
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,072
I just watch the instructions from a video on Youtube and follow them.

264
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:46,506
It’s not that hard.

265
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,980
It’s super easy.

266
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,445
You didn’t burn the egg.

267
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:55,219
Of course. I’m good at everything.

268
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,097
I believe you.

269
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:11,979
Did you make this for me?

270
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:13,622
If you don’t want to eat it, I can throw it away.

271
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,357
I’ll eat it.

272
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,779
I’ll eat it all.

273
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:30,019
Rice porridge and omelet. This is an unconventional dish.

274
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,579
I have never seen anyone eat it before.

275
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,219
How is it?

276
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,482
It tastes great.

277
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:48,019
Really?

278
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:50,419
It’s really delicious.

279
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,819
Is it that good?

280
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:56,222
Let me try it too.

281
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:59,626
No. You made it for me.

282
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,179
How can you take it from me?

283
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,684
That’s too much.

284
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,219
This is the first time that you cook for me.

285
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,619
How can I share it with you?

286
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,019
This is a premium dish.

287
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,419
You can’t take it from me.

288
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,608
Is it that good?

289
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,608
Yes.

290
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:29,979
Is it that good?

291
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,379
It’s so salty.

292
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,779
How did he eat it?

293
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,674
You told me to take you to buy some clothes.

294
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,869
But this is where you want to come?

295
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,579
There are only food stalls here.

296
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,979
There are cloth shops too.

297
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,379
Follow me.

298
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,868
See? There are many chic clothes.

299
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,619
That’s true. Let’s check them out.

300
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,456
The t-shirt is cute.

301
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:18,565
Him only.

302
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,771
These are t-shirts for couples.

303
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,579
Here.

304
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:23,579
They are pretty.

305
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,466
Does it look good?

306
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:29,466
Look! Hats.

307
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,179
Try it on.

308
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,094
I cover my face.

309
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,379
Put it on me nicely.

310
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,019
Let’s eat that.

311
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:47,980
Do you want to eat it?

312
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,779
Cha, can you take photos of me?

313
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:54,376
Here?

314
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:55,445
Yes.

315
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,579
I barely see you take photos of yourself.

316
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,219
I want to have photos of me as a memory. I can’t do that?

317
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:04,331
Are you ready?

318
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,019
Yes.

319
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,522
Are you ready?

320
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,853
I didn’t say that I want photos with you.

321
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,379
If you ask me to take photos for you, this is what you get.

322
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:21,579
Come to think about it. We barely have photos together.

323
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:26,331
Irin.

324
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:29,437
I got it. Take the photo.

325
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,253
Cha.

326
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:34,253
Cha.

327
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:35,979
What did you do?

328
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,220
Come back here.

329
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,379
How could you do that?

330
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,619
Be careful. Are you sure you still can run?

331
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:50,290
(Is it alright to expect our love to last?)

332
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,770
(Hope I’m not wrong to set expectations)

333
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,779
(And they don’t set me up to fail)

334
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:10,779
I’ll never forget what happens here.

335
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:13,179
Me, too.

336
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:19,219
Can I ask you something?

337
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:23,647
You usually don’t ask me anything.

338
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,179
Why do you want to ask today?

339
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,980
So can I ask you?

340
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,619
Sure.

341
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,819
Will you marry me?

342
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:49,179
Are you crazy? No one is joking about that.

343
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:53,979
Do I look like I’m joking?

344
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,619
You know I love you with all my heart.

345
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,979
I don’t want to wake up and worry that you will run away from me again.

346
00:26:06,386 --> 00:26:08,854
Where should I go to look for you?

347
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,779
Will we see each other again?

348
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,579
I no longer want to think about those things.

349
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,779
I may not have anything great that can surprise you.

350
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,419
But I think you know,

351
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:33,619
that you’re the only one that I want to spend the rest of my life with.

352
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,419
When we go back, I will talk to your grandfather.

353
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:43,219
I promise that I’ll take care of everything.

354
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,780
Stop talking about it.

355
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:01,179
Where is it?

356
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,934
You’re proposing to me, aren’t you?

357
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,934
You should give me something.

358
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,619
Where is the ring?

359
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,019
Where is the flower?

360
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,419
Yes, I have.

361
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,379
Here.

362
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,610
[COUPON FOR HAVING MEALS WITH ME FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.]

363
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,610
What is this?

364
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:33,619
Why?

365
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:36,619
There’s only one coupon like this in the world.

366
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,579
You can use it any time.

367
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,219
I will always say yes without any conditions.

368
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:48,019
So this is the downside of dating a younger man.

369
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:51,579
You’re acting like a child.

370
00:27:53,717 --> 00:28:00,019
Think about it. This is more valuable than expensive items.

371
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,257
It’s okay.

372
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,167
If you don’t want it, I’ll take it back.

373
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,779
How could you take it back? You already gave it to me.

374
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,377
At least, I got something.

375
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:28,610
So what is your answer?

376
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:50,419
(Is it alright to expect something from us?)

377
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,380
Jin is not here yet?

378
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,994
I haven’t seen him.

379
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:02,051
But Jin told me to clean the working room.

380
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,819
Because your grandfather is coming home.

381
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,379
Grandpa shouldn’t come home so soon.

382
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,779
Inn, what did you say?

383
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:13,985
Did Jin tell you that he’s coming too?

384
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,579
He didn’t say anything.

385
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,979
Why don’t you call Jin?

386
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,032
It’s okay.

387
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:21,619
You can go and do your things.

388
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,980
In the end, you leave me like others do.

389
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:33,619
Are you talking about me?

390
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,082
I didn’t think that you would come here today.

391
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:41,742
I was running errands for your grandfather.

392
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:44,379
He will come home tomorrow.

393
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,019
Actually, you don’t have to come today.

394
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,419
It’s already evening now.

395
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,819
I don’t have any place I want to go now.

396
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,379
If you don’t have any place you want to go.

397
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,457
Can you come with me?

398
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,019
Where?

399
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,819
Did you see that meteor?

400
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,219
Where? I wasn’t looking.

401
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:12,019
Then come closer to me.

402
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,777
You can see it clearly from here.

403
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,579
So we can make a wish together.

404
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:17,216
How old are you?

405
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,216
Do you still believe in making a wish on a meteor?

406
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,435
It may come true.

407
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,179
It doesn’t cost us anything to do it.

408
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,826
If a meteor could make a wish come true,

409
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,219
The meteor shower would make everyone happy.

410
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:41,979
You are so childish.

411
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:46,779
I’m not childish.

412
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,893
If you let yourself do something childish, you may feel happy.

413
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,979
If you don’t believe me, why don’t you try it yourself?

414
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,379
No.

415
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,268
Come here and sit next to me.

416
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,582
Come on.

417
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,222
Alright.

418
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:19,219
See? My wish has come true.

419
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,779
I made a wish that you would come and sit next to me.

420
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:27,355
Didn’t you make two wishes?

421
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:28,819
What is your other wish?

422
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:33,620
I won’t tell you.

423
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,968
Here you are.

424
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:43,219
Why do you suddenly want to go camping?

425
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:49,497
This is a dinner reception for our wedding.

426
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:52,245
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

427
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:55,219
But in the afternoon…

428
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:57,619
Stop talking nonsense.

429
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,785
Whatever. Do whatever you want.

430
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,779
I won’t be your third wheel anymore.

431
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,819
Why don’t you have dinner with us?

432
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:06,783
Just let an old man like me go to bed.

433
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:09,619
I’m not in the mood for watching stars and camping.

434
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,066
Enjoy.

435
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:22,779
Did you see the star?

436
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,579
Did you see it?

437
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,066
You’re smooth.

438
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:45,580
What are we doing here?

439
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,219
Look there.

440
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:54,019
A meteor shower.

441
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:57,579
Did you take me to watch it?

442
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,979
I think you never saw it.

443
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,779
Yes, I never saw it.

444
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:10,819
If you watch it from someplace dark, you will see it clearer.

445
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:16,779
But if you don’t look up to the sky, you won’t see it anyway.

446
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:30,022
We won’t have a chance to do something like this anymore.

447
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,019
I hope that you will be happy with the man that you love.

448
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:46,819
You, too.

449
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,779
Can you do me a favor?

450
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:56,419
What is it?

451
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,420
I’m sorry.

452
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:19,219
I just want to know what it feels like.

453
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,419
How are you feeling?

454
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,377
Let’s take a photo, shall we?

455
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,619
Its beauty only lasts for a few minutes.

456
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:20,419
What do you mean?

457
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,882
I mean the sparklers and the meteors.

458
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,300
Their beauty only lasts for a short time.

459
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,779
Then it becomes dark again.

460
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:32,419
Then I’ll light another one.

461
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:33,776
It’s okay.

462
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,979
Its time is up.

463
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:45,579
If it’s dark, we can simply put lights on.

464
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:50,379
It’s not that hard.

465
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:58,819
Let’s go home together tomorrow.

466
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:01,222
We should go see Tan.

467
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,779
She won’t be mad at us for long.

468
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:09,579
I’ll tell my parents about us.

469
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:13,008
And your grandfather, too.

470
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:15,619
Do you think things would be that simple?

471
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,071
It doesn’t seem to be that hard.

472
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:22,819
We got married today.

473
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:28,782
You’re just a child.

474
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,005
If life is that simple, it wouldn’t be called life.

475
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:34,819
I’ve been waiting for you for seven years,

476
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,222
I won’t let you run away from me again.

477
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:43,179
What if things don’t go the way you have hoped for?

478
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,979
What could go wrong?

479
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,779
If your parents and Tan don’t accept us.

480
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:58,819
I’ll show them how much I love you.

481
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,379
One more thing, I’m not a kid anymore.

482
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:06,019
I don’t need to follow their orders.

483
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,019
You’re a child indeed.

484
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,379
If you call me a child one more time, I’ll make you pay for it.

485
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:15,714
You are a child indeed.

486
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:16,546
Am I a child?

487
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:17,977
Yes.

488
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,093
Cha.

489
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:21,906
Cha, what are you doing?

490
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,779
Am I a child?

491
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,635
Put me down right now.

492
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,619
Stop joking like this.

493
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:31,179
You’re cute when you smile.

494
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,579
I won’t do it. It’s tiring.

495
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:34,822
But I like it.

496
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:46,819
I love you.

497
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,219
You know it, right?

498
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:04,575
Everything about us is coming to an end.

499
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,295
Just like fireworks, its most beautiful moment

500
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,819
only lasts for a short time.

501
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,380
So does our happiness.

502
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,385
She already left for Bangkok.

503
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,712
Left for Bangkok?

504
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,579
Why did she do this again?

505
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:30,765
At first I thought I should go and stay away from this family.

506
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,482
But when I thought about it again,

507
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:35,757
it would be better if I stay and torture you.

508
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:36,669
That would be fun.

509
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:38,299
Irin.

510
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:40,614
Tell me where have you been?

511
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:42,770
Did you spend all this time with a woman?

512
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,097
Did you go with Inn?

513
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:45,622
Not Inn.

514
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,474
I went with Irin.

515
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:49,182
How can you date her?

516
00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:50,797
Do you know how older she is than you?

517
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:52,819
I want to get married.
