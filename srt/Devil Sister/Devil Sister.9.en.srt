1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,640
Wait, Irin.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,920
The gift that I want to give to you.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,840
For what occasion?

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,970
For giving a chance to date you.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,010
Irin agreed to date you?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,990
Yes.

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,530
I told you I hate defeat.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,680
Just tell me why you’re mad at me.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
If you’re going to act like this, then leave.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,220
Irin and I agreed to open up and see each other.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,830
Why don’t you get it?

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,450
I don’t want to talk to or see you.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,690
Get out.

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,250
Then you are giving her a ride every day?

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,190
Yes.

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,060
What’s the matter, Tan?

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,310
Irin’s got a boyfriend.

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,220
Irin’s boyfriend? What about him?

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
She agreeds to introduce him to us.

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,010
What?

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,530
Try to keep him away from other animals for now.

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,420
It’ll reduce his stress and therefore his stomachache.

23
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,979
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,010
Don’t forget to let him sit in the sun once a day.

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,190
Turtles love sunbathing.

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,190
It’s also good for his health in the long run.

27
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,160
Yes.

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,100
if we make Irin introduce Mr. Handsome, aka Jin, to us?)

37
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,820
(Why not? It’s totally not out of bounds.)

38
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,290
(What was she thinking

39
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:13,180
not letting her best friends take a proper look at her man?)

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,420
(IKR? Irin is always so secretive. I don’t like that.)

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,380
(Alright. I’m on it.)

42
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,380
What’s up?

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,296
Hey, Irin.

44
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,142
When’s a good time for you to meet?

45
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,877
Why are you asking?

46
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:41,860
I just want to talk to you at my cafe.

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,383
I was drunk last night. I forgot what we even talked about.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,361
Well, when would be a good time for you?

49
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,641
Why don’t you bring Jin along, too?

50
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,315
Are you chummy with him or what?

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,860
Why would I bring him?

52
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,020
Hey!

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,518
Whoever you’re dating has to pass your best friends’ standards.

54
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:06,260
Are you seriously going to keep everything to yourself?

55
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Fine. I’ll think about it.

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,020
What is there to think about?

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,940
Listen, if you don’t let us help and then you make a bad decision,

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,260
isn’t it exactly us that need to be your shoulders to cry on?

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,008
Why are you so secretive? Aren’t we your friends?

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,780
That’s not what I meant.

61
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,260
If not, then just bring him along.

62
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,020
You hear me?

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,850
Fine. I’ll ask him.

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,890
Now we’re talking.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,780
(I got it.)

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh, Inn.

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,380
Please, have a seat.

68
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,940
Everything’s going so well.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,979
Have you decided when the wedding’s going to be?

70
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:07,083
I’m not in a hurry.

71
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:09,380
I want to take this slow.

72
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,380
I thought you wanted to marry her as soon as possible.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Irin isn’t all too agreeing.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,708
I need to give her some time.

75
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,892
But you should just hurry up and tie the knot.

76
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:27,380
This isn’t doing me any good.

77
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:31,340
If you don’t marry her soon, Namcha will never leave Irin alone.

78
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,979
You said you’d help me.

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,706
Inn, I want you to see the broader picture.

80
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:41,213
It’s nice to have things going your way,

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,635
but think of it in the long run, too.

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,595
If I hastily married Irin

83
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,979
when she hasn’t even seen the good in me yet,

84
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,979
it didn’t guarantee she wouldn’t go back to Namcha again.

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,979
Marriage isn’t everything.

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,979
But I want this to be over.

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,979
Irin has been happy with everything for far too long.

88
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,979
Why do you hate your own sister so much?

89
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,020
Look at my life.

90
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,979
What is there to be proud of?

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,980
It’s all Irin’s fault.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,979
Without her, my life would be better.

93
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,979
At least, nobody would compare me to her.

94
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,979
Saying she’s prettier.

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Smarter.

96
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,220
Better in every way.

97
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,979
You’ve got it all wrong.

98
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,700
I think you’re very pretty.

99
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,380
Be confident.

100
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,979
You’re just as pretty as your sister is.

101
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,979
I mean it.

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,380
You’re just as pretty as your sister is.

103
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,457
What’s up, Tan?

104
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,380
Oh, it’s about Irin’s boyfriend.

105
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,860
Irin’s boyfriend?

106
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,020
What is it?

107
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,140
She agrees to introduce her boyfriend to us.

108
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
What?

109
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,380
What’s with you?

110
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,700
How could she?

111
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,620
That man has no right getting to know you all.

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,620
I won’t accept it.

113
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,380
What are you rambling about?

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,740
Are we even talking about the same thing?

115
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,060
No way. I’ll go, too.

116
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,220
Go where?

117
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
Go meet that man.

118
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,100
I’ll go with you.

119
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,380
I won’t allow it.

120
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,780
What’s with the blowup? Go if you want. I totally don’t mind.

121
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,380
You’re out of it, man.

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,540
Please, come in.

123
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,860
Are you free on Saturday?

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,700
Why?

125
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,979
If you are, I want you to go somewhere with me.

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
Where?

127
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,979
You’ll know when the time comes.

128
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,979
Thank you.

129
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,380
For what?

130
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,380
It’s the first time you invite me to go somewhere with you.

131
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,979
Please, come in.

132
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:57,106
Why was Irin here just now?

133
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,103
She wants me to go somewhere with her.

134
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,979
Finally, she’s starting to think of me.

135
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,038
Thank you, Jin, for meeting up with us.

136
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,875
Don’t thank me. I don’t know what to say to that.

137
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,942
Why, we do have to thank you.

138
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,980
Irin had never brought a boyfriend to meet us before.

139
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,085
True.

140
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:38,600
You’re her first boyfriend, I’ll have you know.

141
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,580
Boyfriend?

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,979
Irin has never said you’re her boyfriend.

143
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, does the daily ride to-and-from work part not count?

144
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,979
If we’re seeing each other, labels don’t matter.

145
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:01,940
Well, but you gotta put a label on it at this point.

146
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,380
You don’t normally say something like that.

147
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,860
What boyfriend?

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,380
Any acquaintance can do that.

149
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,314
Acquaintance?

150
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,580
This exclusively qualifies as “boyfrined” behavior, kid.

151
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,620
It does not.

152
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,820
He’s just an acquaintance.

153
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,561
It’s not surprising Namcha would think that.

154
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:33,979
Kids his age would call someone he sleeps with a friend.

155
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,700
I don’t get kids these days, to be honest.

156
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,500
Who are you talking about?

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
No one in particular.

158
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,460
But I know what you mean.

159
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I don’t understand kids these days, either.

160
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,660
True.

161
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,977
You wouldn’t happen to do something like that, would you?

162
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,380
I would never.

163
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,660
Anyone who knows me knows.

164
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,875
If I were to do something like that,

165
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,856
I would have done it a long time ago.

166
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:11,380
Well then. I believe you.

167
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:17,594
But you sure took your time before snatching her away.

168
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,780
She’d been single all this time.

169
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,771
Just because someone meets her early on,

170
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:28,013
doesn’t mean he’ll win her heart.

171
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,977
Isn’t that right, Namcha?

172
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,620
Love has nothing to do with speed.

173
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,760
You know The Tortoise and the Hare?

174
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,979
Even though the tortoise walks much slower, he wins at the end.

175
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:51,007
Don’t you think you’re too quick to judge?

176
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,180
The hare might just be determined enough to win the game back.

177
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,979
Don’t get so reckless now.

178
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:04,275
That guy’s got a big mouth.

179
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:07,115
Irin hasn’t even made her decision.

180
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,900
He really thinks he’s secured a wedding, huh?

181
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,979
You’re not a kid anymore.

182
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,979
When you lose, you shouldn’t make a ruckus, you know.

183
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:27,979
People would call you immature otherwise.

184
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,380
I haven’t lost.

185
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,915
The game isn’t over.

186
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,140
I don’t think so.

187
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,843
You know very well Irin is going to marry me eventually.

188
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,780
Nobody defies her grandfather’s wish.

189
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,380
How can that be?

190
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,940
Her grandfather just gave me permission to date Irin.

191
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,380
Are you sure that’s what he said?

192
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,979
You could’ve… misunderstood.

193
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,380
I’m sure.

194
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,620
Between what her grandfather said to you and to me,

195
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,380
let’s see which one is right.

196
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,979
Irin doesn’t love you.

197
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,979
Are you brazen enough to insist on marrying her?

198
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,380
And how can you be sure Irin loves you?

199
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,211
If she did, she wouldn’t agree to go out with me, would she?

200
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,979
The truth is the truth.

201
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,979
Irin and I are dating.

202
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:41,791
And soon enough, we will be married.

203
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,431
Then just know this.

204
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,979
As long as I am here,

205
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:49,979
I swear to you…

206
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:53,380
You will never get to marry her.

207
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Safe ride home, alright?

208
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,364
Careful on the road.

209
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,977
I’m leaving, then.

210
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,601
Tomorrow…

211
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,580
No. I’d rather have my car back.

212
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,305
Please, talk to the garage for me.

213
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,434
Did Jin give you a ride home?

214
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,979
Yeah.

215
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,060
Why didn’t he come in?

216
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,979
Did he know I’m home?

217
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,979
Go and ask him yourself.

218
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,380
What’s with you?

219
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,103
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

220
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,979
Lovers’ quarrel is normal, you know.

221
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,982
But she acts like she doesn’t care about me,

222
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,937
even when I’ll do anything for her.

223
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,340
She acts like I don’t have feelings.

224
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,804
It’s freaking infuriating.

225
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,340
And even then, I still want to see her.

226
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,860
I want to run to her even now.

227
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,648
Why is it like that?

228
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,979
When you still want to do something that you know to be unreasonable,

229
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,874
it’s because of one thing.

230
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,509
Love.

231
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,979
Why don’t you try not doing it?

232
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,942
What do you mean?

233
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,256
Have you ever noticed how you get used to something

234
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
you experience every day?

235
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,979
It’s become normal for you to have it.

236
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,512
Give her a taste of what it feels like to not have that.

237
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:51,380
Now she’ll know if it means anything to her at all.

238
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,979
What if it means nothing to her?

239
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:59,979
Then you stop wasting your time.

240
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,020
Oh, since when did my car come back?

241
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,900
Mr. Jin left it here this morning.

242
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,318
Where is he?

243
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,380
He left the car here and went back in a taxi.

244
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,130
You slept with another woman. How could you not know that?

245
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,260
Are you talking about Inn?

246
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,977
But there really was nothing.

247
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,540
It’s not surprising Namcha would think that.

248
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,515
Kids his age would call someone he sleeps with a friend.

249
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,979
I don’t get kids these days, to be honest.

250
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,474
You wouldn’t happen to do something like that, would you?

251
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,380
I would never.

252
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,414
Anyone who knows me knows.

253
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:29,456
If I were to do something like that,

254
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,290
I would have done it a long time ago.

255
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,820
Why isn’t he here?

256
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,979
His car isn’t here.

257
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,380
Did he go to work?

258
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,380
Hello?

259
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,170
Which book’s copyrights?

260
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,060
Really?

261
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,980
That one?

262
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Great. If the book’s famous, maybe it will improve our sales.

263
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,380
We should contact Prof. Worrapod to translate it.

264
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,380
Have you tried reaching him?

265
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,380
No response?

266
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
I’ll do it myself.

267
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,324
Are there any more patients today?

268
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:07,922
No.

269
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,352
Great. Let me take a little break.

270
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,660
I’m getting hungry.

271
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,340
Will you be having lunch now?

272
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,220
It’s alright. I’m good.

273
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,980
One cup is good enough for me.

274
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,380
If I get hungry again, I’ll find something to eat.

275
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,220
You’re taking such good care of yourself.

276
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,620
Are you in love or something?

277
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,620
Hey, tortoise.

278
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,887
Do whatever it takes to walk as slowly as possible. You hear me?

279
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,820
Don’t you dare win.

280
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,760
Rabbit. Little rabbit.

281
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,900
Head to the finishing line, go!

282
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,980
Walk as fast as you can and win this.

283
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,500
Rabbit. Rabbit! The tortoise is closing in on you!

284
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900
Tortoise, why are you so fast?

285
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,540
The tortoise is getting ahead of you, rabbit.

286
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,380
Rabbit, get to work.

287
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,980
Go.

288
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,977
Rabbit, you’re winning this race.

289
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:19,411
Don’t you come here, tortoise.

290
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,380
Is Dr. Namcha alright?

291
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,791
I wonder.

292
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,860
Whatever is this for?

293
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,260
Yay!

294
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,594
Good job, rabbit. You did it!

295
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,979
Good job, rabbit!

296
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,939
Let’s just go.

297
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,804
- We won! - Yeah.

298
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:42,420
Good thing I take great care of you.

299
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,500
Am I right, Patthama…?

300
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,660
What are you doing?

301
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,380
I’m… feeding them.

302
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,780
What are you doing here?

303
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,460
I’m here to visit the tortoise we picked up at the temple.

304
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,380
I heard you haven’t found him a home yet.

305
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,979
If you want to be with him so much, then stay with him.

306
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:11,020
Rabbits just aren’t cute enough for you, are they?

307
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,675
Why would you come?

308
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,979
I am mad at you, you know.

309
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:50,580
I’m leaving.

310
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,540
I only came here to see the tortoise.

311
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,780
Sure.

312
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,380
Once we find him a home, I’ll notify you through Dr. Namcha.

313
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,380
Please.

314
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,365
There’s no water.

315
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,875
Make up with me.

316
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:17,380
Beg me.

317
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:21,380
Why won’t she try to make up with me?

318
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,380
Irin?

319
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,979
Irin, are you alright?

320
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,979
You’re not mad anymore?

321
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,530
Did you come here just to give me a hard time?

322
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,660
No. I told you I came for the tortoise.

323
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,979
I happened to be in the area.

324
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,660
How long are you going to play with my feelings?

325
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,380
Haven’t I been hurt enough?

326
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,979
You’re here to get my attention, aren’t you?

327
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:13,979
You’re about to marry someone else, why do you bother with me anymore?

328
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,979
It’s hard as it is for me to get over you.

329
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,979
I’m sorry, then.

330
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:32,561
Let go, Cha.

331
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,540
Someone might see us.

332
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,980
Yeah, I’ve just finished my workout. I’m heading to the cafe.

333
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,380
A girl gotta take good care of herself, you know.

334
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,380
Isn’t that Cha?

335
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,860
Who’s the girl?

336
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:12,700
You came to me.

337
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I won’t ever let you go again.

338
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,260
And I won’t ever let you date that dunce.

339
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,460
I’m possessive, you know.

340
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,860
Enough, Cha.

341
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,284
Stop doing this.

342
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:27,071
You already have someone.

343
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:29,780
What do you mean? Who do I have?

344
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,180
I don’t have anyone.

345
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,979
I only have you.

346
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,979
What… does that mean?

347
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,380
She said she was getting married.

348
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,979
Then what was that with Cha…

349
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,979
What was it? I’m so confused.

350
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,060
(Namtan)

351
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,380
Are you going back to your place?

352
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,165
I have something to do out of town for a bit.

353
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,660
What thing?

354
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,300
I’m visiting Prof. Worrapod to ask him to translate a book for us.

355
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,380
I heard he moved to some farm in Chanthaburi.

356
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,602
Do you need to ask in person?

357
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:01,940
I can’t get through on the phone. Maybe there’s no cell service.

358
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,508
Oh, I won’t be in the office tomorrow.

359
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,248
What is it?

360
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:19,979
Are you home? Can I come see you?

361
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,979
I’m working.

362
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,980
Are you busy? Can I come see you at the hospital?

363
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Well… A little busy.

364
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:31,475
Are you?

365
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,980
I’m home alone. I’m bored.

366
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,979
It’s the weekend. Isn’t Irin home?

367
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
She said she’s going out of town.

368
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,164
Out of town? With who?

369
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,915
Alone, probably.

370
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,780
Get back to work. I’m not bothering you anymore.

371
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,380
But tell me when you’re off work, alright?

372
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,380
Sure. I’ll tell you.

373
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,979
Going out of town alone?

374
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,380
What if something happens on the road?

375
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,380
It sure is quiet today, isn’t it, Doctor?

376
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,060
Did Dr. Namtan’s friend already leave?

377
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,660
She did.

378
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,820
She called ahead to ask if you were in today.

379
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,820
When I told her you were, she said she’d be here as fast as she could.

380
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,380
I was confused.

381
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,580
She’s Dr. Namtan’s friend.

382
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,020
But when I told her you’d be here while Dr. Namtan wouldn’t,

383
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,220
she was so relieved.

384
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:41,380
I was wondering why she didn’t call Dr. Namtan or you on the phone.

385
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,380
Good afternoon, everybody.

386
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,982
Oh, there isn’t a single person here to see you today, Doctor?

387
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,979
I happen to treat animals, not people, so…

388
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,780
Oh, you jest.

389
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,402
Some people do want to see you, you know.

390
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,380
At least, there’s one right here.

391
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,924
True.

392
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:15,120
There is one.

393
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,380
Am I right, Patthama…?

394
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,380
What seems to be the issue today?

395
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:34,020
Oh, honey. No need to act dramatic.

396
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,820
I’m only here to buy some vitamins today.

397
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,660
Does your school train all dogs to be this great, Ploy?

398
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,125
Of course!

399
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:45,380
My school is the best at making them dramatic— Oops!

400
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:49,420
I mean, making them talented.

401
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,274
They’ll be even more adorable.

402
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,882
To train a dog to be such a drama queen,

403
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:59,859
I’m sure you yourself have to also be…

404
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,530
I think it would be absolutely amazing if we work together.

405
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,380
Work together?

406
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,260
Here.

407
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,060
Great.

408
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,979
I need a favour.

409
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,370
Oh?

410
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,980
Are you okay?

411
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,293
What happened?

412
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,629
Is something wrong with the dog?

413
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:46,220
Cha?

414
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:48,370
I think she got run over.

415
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,002
Let’s take her to the hospital.

416
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,980
You will be alright, little doggo.

417
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,979
Poor you.

418
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,478
Action is really talented.

419
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:29,979
I’ll make sure we get to work together in the future.

420
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,623
Will you?

421
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:33,165
Perfect.

422
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,980
I have to go for now.

423
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,204
Oh, Patthama.

424
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:37,945
- Yes? - Tan is coming in to cover for my shift.

425
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,062
I’m counting on you.

426
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:40,345
Of course.

427
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,615
Action.

428
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,634
You absolute darling.

429
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,360
Oh!

430
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,770
Fake blood.

431
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:55,305
Everything's alright now. Let’s get going.

432
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:56,722
Go where?

433
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:59,124
Give me the key. I’ll drive.

434
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,626
Go.

435
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,979
Just get in.

436
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:09,980
Wait, where are we going?

437
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,979
Didn’t you have something to do in Chanthaburi?

438
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:17,635
Wait… Does that mean…

439
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,423
I can’t let you drive alone, can I?

440
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:21,423
It’s dangerous.

441
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,979
But the dog…

442
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,888
Don’t tell me that dog just now was that Acting dog or something.

443
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,979
Action. Her name’s Action.

444
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,385
But her acting really was great.

445
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:47,580
Cha, did you lie to me?

446
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,222
If I didn’t do that, would I ever have gotten in this car?

447
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,775
Cha.

448
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,555
Let’s call it even.

449
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:59,057
You lied when you were coming to see me this morning, too.

450
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,979
It’s been a while since I saw the sea.

451
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:51,398
Yeah.

452
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,979
We should stay for a few days, don’t you think?

453
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,480
As if I’d let you.

454
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,869
I wasn’t even willing to let you come in the first place.

455
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,979
Who’d ever let you come alone?

456
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:05,536
What would you do if your car broke down in the middle of the road?

457
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:07,288
If it's my time to go, I would've died a long time ago.

458
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:09,265
I wouldn’t be here today.

459
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:10,897
Hey.

460
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,979
If you say something like that again, I’ll flick you once more.

461
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,979
What are you, superstitious?

462
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,681
It hurts.

463
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,979
I told you I want to be like this parrot.

464
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:37,979
He only has one mate for the rest of his life.

465
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:43,004
If one of them were to die, how could the other go on living?

466
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,979
Pull up the car right here.

467
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:51,764
I think this is the house.

468
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,979
You said that several houses ago.

469
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,742
I’m just following the GPS.

470
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,979
Did you give him a heads up you’d be calling in?

471
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:09,651
No.

472
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,797
What?

473
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:13,675
I couldn’t get though to him. That’s why I came.

474
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:16,568
If I could talk to him on the phone, why would I come at all?

475
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:19,979
Won’t he just chase us off?

476
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,979
I don’t know.

477
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,979
Hey.

478
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,979
Hey, wait.

479
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:32,924
Hey.

480
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:33,979
Wait.

481
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:35,979
Irin.

482
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,274
If you’re so scared, just wait in the car.

483
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,979
I’m here to protect you.

484
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:45,979
Protect yourself.

485
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,328
Hello!

486
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:51,979
Is this Prof. Worrapod’s house?

487
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:55,979
Is anyone home?

488
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,791
What are you doing here?

489
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,303
Who let you in?

490
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:03,310
Hello, Prof. Worrapod.

491
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:05,545
I’m Irin from Bannasorn Group.

492
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,554
Do you remember me?

493
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,573
Go away. I’m busy.

494
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:11,170
But I’ve got a perfect book for you.

495
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,979
I don’t care. Leave!

496
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,905
My grandfather said hello!

497
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:19,881
What the hell?

498
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:23,979
That’s so rude. We’ve come all this way.

499
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,562
And we’re not rude at all?

500
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,081
We are literally trespassing.

501
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:29,982
Namcha!

502
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,284
Did you hear that?

503
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:38,807
Hear what?

504
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:43,979
Namcha? Where are you going?

505
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:52,379
For me, she’s still the same Irin I fell in love with.

506
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,450
Even if she wants to chase me away,

507
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,994
I still don’t want her to be alone.

508
00:36:56,994 --> 00:37:00,041
It seems like Namcha is really into you.

509
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:04,678
Maybe it’s too late for me to accept that kind of love.

510
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,922
Have you ever thought about getting married?

511
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,979
I want it to be like this all day.
