1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello!

2
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:04,671
Is this Prof. Worrapod’s house?

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,711
It’s like a god sends you to help me.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:09,698
I planned that I would no longer take any translation jobs.

5
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:12,850
What is your relationship with the publishing company?

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,629
Are you her boyfriend?

7
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:14,656
- Yes. - No.

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,073
A young man like you must be approached by many women.

9
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:19,666
Why does it have to be her?

10
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,665
Have you ever thought about marriage?

11
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,480
What about the promise that you gave me?

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,421
What promise?

13
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,071
That you will give another chance to the rabbit.

14
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,010
Yes.

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,538
I’ll take your translation job offer.

16
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:35,560
I made a wish that we would be together like this forever.

17
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,960
No matter where we are.

18
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,930
When we go back to Bangkok,

19
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,920
everything must come to an end.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
Enough, Irin.

21
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:05,520
Just pretend what happened here never happened.

22
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,621
Why do you have to pretend

23
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:31,920
what happened here never happened when we’re back?

24
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,363
Why does it have to be that way?

25
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,320
Let go. I’m going to bed.

26
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,720
I can’t let you go.

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,921
Not until you answer me.

28
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,920
Why do you have to pretend what happened here never did?

29
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:03,120
Because when we’re in Bangkok, we both have partners.

30
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,406
What do you mean?

31
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:07,920
Who do you have? Who do I have?

32
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,320
You want me to spell it out?

33
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,108
I have Jin.

34
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,960
You have Inn.

35
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,360
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
You know Inn and I are just friends.

37
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,803
Friends?

38
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:24,720
Do friends sleep with each other?

39
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,087
Oh, I forget.

40
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:31,678
You kids have different types of friends.

41
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,229
Friends you hang out with,

42
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,013
and friends you sleep with.

43
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,760
What are you even talking about?

44
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:39,151
Inn and I?

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,893
You can sleep here for now.

46
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,360
Go home in the morning.

47
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,760
What about you?

48
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,560
Won’t you sleep with me?

49
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,520
Hey.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Quit that right now.

51
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,551
We’re friends.

52
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:13,911
I get it now.

53
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,320
Is this about Inn sleeping over at my house?

54
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:23,053
Nothing happened that night.

55
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,509
Inn was drunk.

56
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,320
If I took her home, your grandpa would just scold me.

57
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,720
So I let her sleep in my room.

58
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,967
But nothing happened.

59
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,256
I’ll swear it if you want.

60
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,160
I slept outside just like I do right now.

61
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,960
And that was the only time.

62
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,360
There’s nothing more to that.

63
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:57,120
There’s not a single second where I think of Inn more than just friends.

64
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,760
Really, I’ll swear it if you want.

65
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:05,000
But Inn might not think the same way you do.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,541
That’s her problem.

67
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,520
If I don’t think of her that way, then nothing is going to happen.

68
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:18,720
As for that lawyer, I never think of him as your guy anyway.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
Why not?

70
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,760
Because you’re my girl.

71
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:27,964
I belong to no one.

72
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:29,560
Let go.

73
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:37,920
We’re not done talking.

74
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:41,826
I have nothing else to talk to you.

75
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,960
But I do.

76
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,760
About what happened today,

77
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,223
I won’t ever let you pretend it never happened.

78
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:54,720
Neither will I.

79
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:03,160
I’ve been waiting for so many years to be close to you like this again.

80
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,720
I won’t ever forget today.

81
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,560
Cha.

82
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:21,120
Not everyone’s life is as easy as yours.

83
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,557
Not everyone gets to do what they want to do,

84
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:27,160
or have what they want to have.

85
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:30,720
Then let’s go through it all together,

86
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,360
all these tough times.

87
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,760
I promise you this.

88
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:40,320
I’ll never let go of your hand.

89
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,720
Just like this.

90
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,991
Pechaya “Min” Wattanamontree

91
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,231
Metawin “Win” Opas-iamkajorn

92
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,591
Kanyarat “Piploy” Ruangrung

93
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,071
Suphakorn “Pod” Sriphotong

95

Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

97
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,103
Drive carefully.

98
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,789
Safe trip back, alright?

99
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,720
Thank you for agreeing to translate the book for my publishing house.

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,549
I'm sure the readers will be thrilled.

101
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:58,581
Don’t rush me like that.

102
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,920
You know how busy I am every day.

103
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:05,506
I know. Just send me your rough draft.

104
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:07,960
You can contact me if you want anything.

105
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,862
Give me some time.

106
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,141
Of course.

107
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,886
If there’s a chance, can I bring Irin here again?

108
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,324
Sure.

109
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:20,998
If you’ve got any issues with your animals, call me any time.

110
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,520
Thanks for that.

111
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
Sure.

112
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:28,320
Once you’re back to your world,

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,960
I hope you’re happy, like you have been here.

114
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:38,766
I promise to take good care of her.

115
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,983
Good day.

116
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:16,841
Are you alright, Inn?

117
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,720
I didn’t see you at the office.

118
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,120
He betrayed me.

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
They betrayed me.

120
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,560
Who do you mean?

121
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:36,760
Irin and Cha.

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,160
They betrayed me.

123
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,422
Please calm down.

124
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,915
Tell me what happened.

125
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:46,360
Some sister she is.

126
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,760
I hate her.

127
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,902
Where should I put these?

128
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,120
Just leave them on the table.

129
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,720
Well, where should we go next?

130
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:15,120
Go home.

131
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:18,074
You’re getting rid of me already?

132
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:21,160
Two days aren’t enough for me.

133
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:24,720
Don’t you forget you disappeared for seven years.

134
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:27,920
Don’t you have to work?

135
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,416
Are you going to make someone else cover for your shifts every time?

136
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,859
You’re not a kid anymore.

137
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:35,560
How can you take care of anyone acting like this?

138
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,960
I can take care of you.

139
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,638
Did you forget that I helped you with your work when we were there?

140
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,496
But think about it.

141
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:50,287
Now that we’re back to our normal lives, who do you ever help?

142
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,360
Tan is covering for you right now.

143
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,320
That’s...

144
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,120
Why are you suddenly so serious?

145
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,548
Because this is real life.

146
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:09,160
You can’t go around indulging yourself like this.

147
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,560
You’re not a child anymore.

148
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,120
But you didn’t have to be so serious.

149
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:21,160
Okay. I’m going.

150
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,960
Where are you rushing off to?

151
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,920
You’ve already disappeared together for two whole days.

152
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:37,960
Inn, have you been here long?

153
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:41,370
I can’t get in touch with you.

154
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,920
So I came to your place to see you.

155
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:51,120
You told me, didn’t you, that I can come here any time I want?

156
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,555
Inn, calm down.

157
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:55,920
Listen to me.

158
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:00,720
Cha?

159
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,649
What’s wrong with you?

160
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,520
Can’t you just talk nicely?

161
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,160
Talk nicely?

162
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:13,960
I waited to talk to you for days.

163
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:17,520
You said you’d call me after work.

164
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,920
Did you?

165
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,720
Why am I always the one being forgotten?

166
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:29,520
Does anyone here ever even care about me?

167
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,761
You were off together all happy and content.

168
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,197
Did you even think about me?

169
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,899
Inn, I’m sorry.

170
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,191
Please, calm down.

171
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:42,760
Listen to me. I can explain.

172
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,647
I’ve been hurt enough.

173
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,720
So much for being calm.

174
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,062
In your entire life, what have you ever done for me?

175
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,763
Never!

176
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,560
Not even what I asked of you. You never did.

177
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,010
All you ever care about is yourself.

178
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,594
You’re selfish.

179
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,760
I shouldn’t have been born as your sister!

180
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,160
Inn.

181
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:12,518
Inn.

182
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,583
Hold it.

183
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,123
I won’t let you go.

184
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,760
How can you just stand there and call her names?

185
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:23,545
Don’t you know how much she loves you?

186
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,960
If she did, she probably wouldn't do this to me.

187
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,176
I’ve only ever seen other sisters give things up for their little sisters.

188
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,320
But all mine ever does is take everything for herself.

189
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,415
It’s not about giving something up for someone.

190
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,360
Everyone has their own life.

191
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,383
It’s about time you act like a grownup.

192
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:46,320
Not waiting for someone to do something for you all the time.

193
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,360
You don’t know anything so stay silent.

194
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:57,551
But I won’t just stand by and watch you sully the name of someone I love.

195
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,520
Then you can both choke to death on your happiness!

196
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,506
Just remember this.

197
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:15,120
You’re the one who ruined our family.

198
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:15,927
Inn.

199
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,886
Inn.

200
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,010
Inn!

201
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,398
Don’t rush it.

202
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:21,160
She’s angry right now.

203
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,223
She won’t listen to you no matter what you say.

204
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:27,120
Wait for her to cool down.

205
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:09,163
What happened between you two?

206
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:15,120
Can you tell me?

207
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,760
Go home.

208
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:22,311
And from now on, don’t bother me anymore.

209
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,960
Please, don’t ever see me again.

210
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:28,152
Irin...

211
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:30,760
I said go!

212
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,918
How can you just stand there and call her names?

213
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:27,118
Don’t you know how much she loves you?

214
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:32,315
If she did, she probably wouldn't do this to me.

215
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:35,293
I’ve only ever seen other sisters give things up for their little sisters.

216
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:39,120
But all mine ever does is take everything for herself.

217
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,992
It’s not about giving something up for someone.

218
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:46,235
It’s about time you act like a grownup.

219
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:49,960
I won’t just stand by and watch you sully the name of someone I love.

220
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:22,946
Inn?

221
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,960
Inn, open the door.

222
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,520
Miss Irin, she hasn’t come home.

223
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,394
She hasn’t?

224
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,118
Yes, Jin?

225
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:42,760
Irin, has the hospital called you?

226
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,581
Called me about what?

227
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,320
Inn was in an accident.

228
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,720
She’s in the OR right now.

229
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,063
How is she?

230
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,720
The doctor hasn’t told me anything yet.

231
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,517
Are you Miss Intira’s relatives?

232
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:07,432
Yes.

233
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:10,983
Do you have anyone who has the same O blood type as her?

234
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,681
Mine isn’t O, but can I help?

235
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,477
I have the same blood type.

236
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,520
This way, please.

237
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,360
Thank you.

238
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,920
If you weren’t here, I wouldn’t know how to help her.

239
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:59,215
I really am a bad sister.

240
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:01,960
I can’t do anything for her at all.

241
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,320
Don’t worry.

242
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,560
Everything will turn out alright.

243
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,320
The patient is safe now.

244
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:30,964
Thank you.

245
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:32,881
Thank you, Doctor.

246
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,946
Excuse me.

247
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,315
Thank you.

248
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,548
Thank you so much.

249
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:51,160
I’m happy I can put a smile on your face.

250
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:16,391
(Irin)

251
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:40,551
(Namcha)

252
00:20:55,581 --> 00:21:00,391
(Namcha)

253
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,160
Hello?

254
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:17,560
Who is this?

255
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,111
It’s Jin.

256
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,520
Why are you answering Irin’s phone?

257
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Because I’m with her.

258
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:29,560
Where?

259
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,151
What are you to doing?

260
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,120
Why isn’t she answering the phone?

261
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,970
Slow down.

262
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,320
Irin can’t come to the phone right now because she’s sleeping.

263
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:43,893
Where are you?

264
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,360
I’ll go pick her up right now.

265
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,760
I don’t think so.

266
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,320
She’s busy.

267
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:54,720
She won’t go with you.

268
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:58,360
Then just tell me where the hell you are.

269
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,760
The hospital.

270
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,385
I’m here to see Miss Intira Bannasorn.

271
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,517
Which room is she in?

272
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:13,920
A moment, please.

273
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,120
We need to talk.

274
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,447
I’m not here to see you.

275
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:25,320
Move.

276
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:27,638
Let go.

277
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,520
Let go of me.

278
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:31,920
I said let go.

279
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,560
I told you I have nothing to say to you.

280
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,342
I do.

281
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:42,760
Did you know why Inn was in an accident?

282
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,903
Because of you.

283
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,560
What did I have to do with it?

284
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,960
How are you so dumb?

285
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:55,920
Don’t you know why Irin and Inn are fighting?

286
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:59,425
Yeah, I’m dumb.

287
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:00,561
I don’t know why.

288
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,345
Enlighten me.

289
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,360
Because of you.

290
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,920
How can you not know Inn likes you?

291
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,960
Let me ask you something.

292
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:19,920
If all someone you like did is hanging around your sister,

293
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,056
how would you feel?

294
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,503
Do you understand now

295
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:28,360
why Irin doens’t want anything to do with you?

296
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,783
Go home.

297
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,560
And from now on, don’t bother me anymore.

298
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:39,120
Please, don’t ever see me again.

299
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:47,560
I ask that you cooperate from now on.

300
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,120
Leave Irin alone.

301
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,520
You’re the reason two sisters are fighting.

302
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,160
You’ve caused enough damage for their family.

303
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:04,360
How is Inn?

304
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,760
She’s safe now.

305
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,160
Irin is with her at the hospital.

306
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:16,360
Did the doctor say anything about a long term effect?

307
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,597
I’m not sure.

308
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:20,597
I’ll ask them.

309
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:24,720
She’s an unfortunate child.

310
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:29,520
Her health is never great, and now this.

311
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:35,560
If Irin’s at the hospital, find someone to replace her.

312
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:39,120
If all she does is stay there, things could get rough at the office.

313
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,760
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:47,560
One more thing, thank you for giving your blood to my granddaughter.

315
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:51,120
If you weren’t there, things could turn out worse.

316
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,760
I’m happy to help.

317
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,160
But I’m wondering about one thing.

318
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,720
Irin is her sister.

319
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:04,360
Why can’t she give Inn her blood?

320
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:07,920
Many siblings are like that.

321
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:10,320
It’s not uncommon.

322
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:15,120
Don’t go wondering about something that’s not your concern.

323
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:23,044
Once Inn’s conscious, call me.

324
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:24,472
I’ll visit her.

325
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,963
Yes.

326
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:01,920
Inn?

327
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,148
You’re awake.

328
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,760
How are you feeling?

329
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,326
Nurse?

330
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,508
Yes?

331
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,271
The patient’s awake.

332
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,360
A moment, please.

333
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,238
Are you thirsty?

334
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,182
Have a sip.

335
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:29,775
Inn.

336
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:31,920
Get out.

337
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,809
Inn, what’s wrong?

338
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,560
I said get out!

339
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,120
Lay down, Inn. Relax.

340
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,520
Leave me alone.

341
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,160
Get out.

342
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:49,960
I said get out.

343
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,960
What’s happened?

344
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,760
I’m leaving her in your care.

345
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,358
Honey.

346
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,955
Cha hasn’t gone to work yet?

347
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,955
His car’s still parked out front.

348
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:06,760
Yes, he’s upstairs.

349
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,160
He’s getting really spoiled.

350
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,986
All he does is ask someone to cover for him when he’s gone all day long.

351
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,050
Does he think this is childsplay?

352
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,050
I’m getting sick of him.

353
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,825
You know how competitive our business is.

354
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:22,946
And our best doctor is being lured to another hospital.

355
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:25,960
Can you calm down?

356
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,520
I’ve just heard from the maid at our neighbor’s that Inn was in a car crash.

357
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:31,474
Cha’s girlfriend?

358
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:32,293
Yes.

359
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,047
How is she?

360
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,720
I don’t know the details.

361
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:40,360
I feel sorry for Anon.

362
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,160
Last time there was a car accident, it took her parents’ lives.

363
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,960
It did.

364
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:54,058
I can just hope that Inn is alright.

365
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,372
Where are you going?

366
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,120
To the hospital.

367
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:06,538
How’s Inn doing?

368
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,933
I think she’s safe now.

369
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,720
Aren’t you going to work today?

370
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:15,871
I have something to do.

371
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,871
I asked Tan to cover for me.

372
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,920
Hey, Cha.

373
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:23,114
How many times has she covered for you?

374
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:27,120
Don’t you think she’s got her own things to do, too?

375
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:32,025
Inn was in an accident.

376
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,320
I think it’s alright if he wants to be with her.

377
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,428
But he said she’s safe now.

378
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:39,120
Don’t you think you should be more responsible at work?

379
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,520
You were gone to who knows where for many days.

380
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:45,733
Do you want our partners to think of you as an imbecile?

381
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,560
Honey.

382
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:53,520
I don’t care what you do outside of work.

383
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:55,920
But that’s not the case here.

384
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,706
Be more professional.

385
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,349
Do you understand?

386
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,960
Yes.

387
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:11,560
Tan.

388
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:13,960
Come home and rest.

389
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,360
Cha will go to work normally.

390
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,231
If you want to do something or go somewhere, do it after work.

391
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:27,120
From now on, I’ll call in to check up on you at the hospital.

392
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,320
Cha.

393
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,120
Don’t be mad at your dad, darling.

394
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:55,920
You know we have more and more competitions nowadays.

395
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,720
And there’s a lot to do at our animal hospital, unlike a small clinic.

396
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,826
Our partners aren’t happy.

397
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:05,087
There’s a rumor that

398
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:10,320
someone wants to pay your uncle to move to a new hospital.

399
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,960
Try to understand your father.

400
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:21,160
Is Inn really better now?

401
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,308
Do you want me to go see her?

402
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:24,501
No.

403
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,798
I’ll go.

404
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:28,118
I have something to talk it out with her.

405
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:30,760
I won’t let things stay this way.

406
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,160
What’s wrong?

407
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:35,560
Nothing you need to worry about.

408
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,360
I feel bad for her grandfather.

409
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,760
Another car accident.

410
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,720
You’d better get to work, or your dad would make a fuss again.

411
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:51,120
Yes.

412
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:54,582
Drive carefully.

413
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:55,920
Yes.

414
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:15,120
How are you feeling?

415
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:22,320
Do you know how much you scared me when I heard the news?

416
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:27,120
You got off work early today.

417
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,760
I tried to finish everything early to come here.

418
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,160
You saved my life.

419
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:37,960
The nurse said a relative gave me their blood.

420
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:41,520
Is it you she was talking about?

421
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:46,320
Why do you think it’s me?

422
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:51,120
The only person who could give me his blood is Grandpa.

423
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,760
But I don’t think he could.

424
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:58,320
That only leaves you who must have been there.

425
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:01,960
That’s all the people in my life.

426
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:07,920
But Irin was there when you were in the OR.

427
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:11,560
She wasn’t born to do something for others.

428
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,681
That’s why her blood type is different from the rest of us.

429
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,678
Does that mean...

430
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:22,320
Irin is the only one in the family with a different blood type?

431
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:24,720
Yes.

432
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,059
Can we stop talking about her?

433
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,760
I don’t want to hear her name.

434
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:47,560
Don’t bother.

435
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:49,960
Just lie down.

436
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,398
How are you feeling?

437
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,398
It hurts, Grandpa.

438
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:58,320
How reckless of you to crash.

439
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:01,960
Good thing you’re not badly injured.

440
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:07,309
Did you take care of the car?

441
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,346
Yes, sir.

442
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,560
I’ve claimed it with the insurance. The car’s at the garage.

443
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:16,360
What about Inn’s responsibility at work?

444
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,920
I’ve already assigned it to someone at the office.

445
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,320
Good.

446
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:25,960
Now Inn can rest.

447
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:30,760
We’re lucky it wasn’t you in that bed.

448
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:34,320
At least there won’t be that much trouble at work.

449
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,834
Don’t dawdle here with your sister too much.

450
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,320
Jin will find someone to take care of her.

451
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:52,360
Let Jin know if you need anything else. He’ll take care of it.

452
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,335
I’m getting tired just from talking.

453
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,366
Are you alright?

454
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,126
I should probably have a doctor examine me.

455
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:07,921
I don’t breathe right.

456
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:23,000
See?

457
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:28,361
See what your reckless driving does to a poor old man?

458
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,736
I think I should...

459
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:37,960
I should see a doctor.

460
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,520
Yes. I’ll go with you.

461
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,320
Rest well, alright?

462
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,121
Yes. Yes.

463
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,520
She’s well now.

464
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:07,920
I’ll keep you updated.

465
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,019
How are you?

466
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:19,920
Are you alright now?

467
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:27,120
Let me snap a photo for your owner.

468
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,920
Let’s do a selfie.

469
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:44,666
Props to your camouflage, buddy.

470
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,360
Who left you here?

471
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:51,538
I was cleaning his enclosure.

472
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:53,560
So I let him sit outside for a bit.

473
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:55,960
What’s wrong with him?

474
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:58,360
Something to do with his bones.

475
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:01,175
The owner probably wasn’t careful about his food.

476
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:04,320
I think so. Probably only feed him vegetables.

477
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,720
Poor him.

478
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,982
He’s a master of camouflage in the wild,

479
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:13,920
but he’s now in danger because of a negligent owner.

480
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:19,921
It must be nice if humans can camouflage just like him.

481
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,360
Wouldn’t that be funny, Doc?

482
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:25,748
People act like chameleons all the time.

483
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:28,320
They act one way with one person.

484
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:33,120
And they change colors when they’re with someone else.

485
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:36,760
Just get everyone in troubles.

486
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,160
I freaking hate that kind of person.

487
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:42,720
And you know the scariest part?

488
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:48,760
Most people actually believe them.

489
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:52,320
From how she looks, I think she’s better physically.

490
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:55,960
But what worries me is...

491
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,360
Her heart.

492
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:03,160
Why? Did Inn tell you something?

493
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,720
No. It’s my observation.

494
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:13,920
You don’t look so happy yourself.

495
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:29,305
If there’s something you need to talk, you can tell me.

496
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:31,920
If I can help, I am always here.

497
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:39,120
Thank you, but I’m fine.

498
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,118
Sure.

499
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,720
I understand.

500
00:38:49,379 --> 00:38:54,720
But I want you to know that I want you to be happy.

501
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:59,518
If you need my help with anything, let me know.

502
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:33,120
We need to talk.

503
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:36,720
What is it?

504
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:40,269
Do you like me?

505
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:41,853
What’s wrong with you?

506
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:45,120
I am in this condition, you won’t even bother to pretend to care?

507
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,920
You’re better now, aren’t you?

508
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:53,520
Had I died,

509
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,120
you wouldn’t have felt a thing, would you?

510
00:39:58,206 --> 00:40:00,720
What does it matter what I felt?

511
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:03,378
You should know one thing, though.

512
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:05,520
There’s one person who doesn’t want you to die.

513
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:07,920
Who?

514
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,520
Irin.

515
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,357
You should how much Irin loves you.

516
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:17,206
Can you shut up about her already?

517
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,604
Why must I?

518
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:19,810
She’s your sister.

519
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,810
I said shut up!

520
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,720
Then tell me why.

521
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,720
Yes.

522
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:33,120
I like you.

523
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,268
For the longest time.

524
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,335
Are you happy now?

525
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,320
Then stop liking me.

526
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:42,720
It’s impossible between us.

527
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,520
How much more are you going to hurt me?

528
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,520
Get well soon.

529
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,120
What do you think you’re doing speaking to my granddaughter that way?

530
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:10,004
Why are you here?

531
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,720
I’m here to tell you something you should know.

532
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:15,623
We live next doors, but we’ve never talked.

533
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:16,803
What does that matter?

534
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,443
I want to get to know you more.

535
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,271
I didn’t know what kind of a person you were back then.

536
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,293
This is Cha, from next door.

537
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,326
Does Irin have a boyfriend?

538
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:24,721
Why’d you ask?

539
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,757
It’s alright.

540
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,321
I’m here.

541
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:30,576
I’m here with you.

542
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:35,520
No matter how may times you’ve cursed me off, I’ll be here.
