1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,302
What’s up, Tan?

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:04,117
She agrees to introduce her boyfriend to us.

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:05,785
Irin has never said you’re her boyfriend.

4
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:07,979
Irin and I are dating.

5
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:10,795
And soon enough, we will be married.

6
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,100
Then just know this.

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,979
As long as I am here, you will never get to marry her.

8
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,093
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

9
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,970
But she acts like she doesn’t care about me,

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,841
She acts like I don’t have feelings.

11
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:23,979
Give her a taste of what it feels like to not have that.

12
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,773
Now she’ll know if it means anything to her at all.

13
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,416
Am I right, Patthama...?

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,087
You came to me.

15
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:31,979
I won’t ever let you go again.

16
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,503
Let go, Cha.

17
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:34,669
Someone might see us.

18
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,222
It’s the weekend. Isn’t Irin home?

19
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,137
She said she’s going out of town.

20
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,597
Didn’t you have something to do in Chanthaburi?

21
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:43,379
I can’t let you drive alone, can I?

22
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,930
It’s dangerous.

23
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:45,985
Did you hear that?

24
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,343
Hear what?

25
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:49,332
Namcha? Where are you going?

26
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:52,019
Push, sweetie. Push!

27
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,235
Push a bit harder.

28
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,431
Professor.

29
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:02,641
Professor, is it delivering a baby?

30
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,328
How did you get in here?

31
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:08,019
I’m a veterinarian. I think I can help you.

32
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,309
Is it a bred heifer?

33
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:11,285
Yes.

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,280
Did its water break?

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,748
Yes.

36
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:16,211
Did it break for more than one hour?

37
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,133
I think so. It’s been more than one hour.

38
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,765
More than one hour?

39
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,066
There’s a high risk that

40
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,523
the calf could be dead while

41
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,604
it’s still in the womb due to the lack of oxygen.

42
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:25,850
What should we do?

43
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,697
We need to help pull it off.

44
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:30,585
Wait a sec. Keep checking on the mother.

45
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:32,788
Cha, don’t let it die.

46
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,752
Calm down, sweetie.

47
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,979
Let’s do it.

48
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:44,019
Alright.

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,930
I found the leg.

50
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,690
Get it out.

51
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,638
Good.

52
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:55,979
Push, sweetie. Push harder.

53
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:04,020
My baby.

54
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,629
It looks healthy.

55
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,189
What do we do next?

56
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:12,761
Since it’s a young mother, you can monitor them from a distance,

57
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:14,588
and see if it knows how to take care of its baby.

58
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,949
Don’t let other animals get closer to them.

59
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,898
Wait for the mother to lick its baby

60
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,660
to stimulate it to stand up and drink the milk.

61
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,258
But if it can’t milk the milk from the breast,

62
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:26,272
you need to pump the milk and feed it.

63
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,466
Breastfeeding is very important in early life.

64
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:31,699
It will help the baby to grow up healthily, just like humans.

65
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,979
What about the placenta?

66
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,005
It should come out in the next six hours.

67
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,832
What a relief!

68
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:42,395
Without you, the baby could have died in the womb.

69
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,980
You’re welcome.

70
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,774
It’s like a god sends you to help me.

71
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,112
I’ve moved here for a little over a year.

72
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:56,872
This is my first time seeing a cow delivering a baby.

73
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:57,768
Right.

74
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,019
If you weren’t here, I would have been in big trouble.

75
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,755
You’re welcome.

76
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:06,777
You are from the publishing company but you brought a vet along with you.

77
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,777
It’s like you can predict the future.

85
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,020
I planned that I would no longer take any translation jobs.

86
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,951
But this work is perfect for you.

87
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:56,019
My grandfather will agree with me.

88
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:01,146
How is your grandfather doing?

89
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:04,019
He’s doing well though he’s as strong as he used to be.

90
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,979
That’s because he’s older.

91
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,475
Yes.

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,059
Do you want to talk to him? I can call him...

93
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,333
No, thanks.

94
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:17,979
Anon will have no influence over my decision.

95
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:25,503
What is your relationship with the publishing company?

96
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:28,308
You are her boyfriend?

97
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,700
- Yes. - No.

98
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:33,697
Your answers are different. What does that mean?

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,742
She won’t accept me to be her boyfriend.

100
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,617
Are you crazy?

101
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,185
How can you tell him that?

102
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:49,979
Young people often waste their time on nonsense stuff like this.

103
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,479
When you get older, you will realize that

104
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:55,711
you shouldn’t make things complicated.

105
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,665
Just do whatever you want.

106
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,044
If you like someone, you just tell him.

107
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,019
Time is precious.

108
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:08,019
You’ll never know how long you will be together.

109
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,925
You’re so right.

110
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,629
It’s not hard to get your happiness.

111
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,001
I don’t get why you have to make things complicated.

112
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,979
Unfortunately, my happiness is not you.

113
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:24,019
It’s someone else.

114
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,632
If it’s not me, then who is it?

115
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:26,890
That lawyer?

116
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,906
I think I should leave. I’ve taken too much of your time already.

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,130
Did you book a hotel? It’s already dark.

118
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,088
Do you have a room for us?

119
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:48,019
We didn’t book any hotel.

120
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:52,019
We didn’t book a hotel but I think it wouldn’t be hard to find one.

121
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:56,019
You can spend the night here. I have a room available.

122
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:01,238
The road is isolated. You could get lost.

123
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,819
It’s alright.

124
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:04,957
That’s a good idea.

125
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:08,019
I can help you check on the mother and baby cows in the morning.

126
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:10,968
How can we sleep here?

127
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:13,247
I don’t mind.

128
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,125
Let’s think of it as a chance for me to repay you for saving my cows.

129
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,051
If you want to repay us,

130
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:25,979
why don’t you accept this translation job instead?

131
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,019
Then do whatever you want.

132
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,730
How could you say that to him?

133
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,730
He might never accept the job ever.

134
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,620
Okay.

135
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,782
We are going to spend the night here.

136
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,010
No.

137
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,814
You can take your time thinking about the job offer.

138
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:49,979
You can give us the answer whenever you are ready.

139
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,302
That’s a good idea.

140
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:56,607
This young man is a good man.

141
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,935
Don’t you see that?

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,413
If he wasn’t with you today,

143
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:04,019
I might have already refused your job offer.

144
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:08,019
Because of him, I will reconsider it.

145
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,318
While I’m reconsidering it,

146
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:17,979
can you promise me that you will reconsider it too?

147
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,226
But...

148
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:23,555
Or should I refuse your offer now?

149
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,979
No, no, no.

150
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,682
I’ll reconsider it.

151
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,979
That’s all.

152
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:37,515
I’ll get your room ready.

153
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,608
If you don’t keep your promise, I’ll tell him about it.

154
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,602
Big mouth!

155
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:56,019
What are you looking at? Go get the bags.

156
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,979
This is your room.

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,019
I’ll go take a shower now.

158
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:18,819
Wait.

159
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,417
You have only one room available?

160
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,558
I’m living here alone.

161
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,558
Why would I need many rooms?

162
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:29,160
But there are two of us.

163
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,595
Then you need to make up how you will sleep tonight.

164
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:35,008
But...

165
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,841
We should go out and get a hotel room.

166
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,979
How could you do that?

167
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:47,056
What would you do if he refuses the job offer?

168
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:50,019
You already promised him. You should keep your promise.

169
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:54,019
Let’s say that you are doing this for your company.

170
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:57,321
Don’t tell me that you’ve planned this with him?

171
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,232
Tell me the truth.

172
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:03,979
I can’t help that everyone thinks I’m cute.

173
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,019
You should have seen it, too.

174
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:12,880
Come on. Let’s sleep together.

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,979
Pervert.

176
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,028
Get out.

177
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,975
How can I go out? There are dozens of mosquitoes outside.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,648
Get out.

179
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:20,611
Ouch.

180
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,358
What would you do if he refuses your job offer?

181
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,358
Or should I go and sleep outside?

182
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,979
I’ll go and sleep outside.

183
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,979
He said he would call me after work.

184
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,979
Does his phone run out of battery?

185
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,287
When you get older, you will realize that

186
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,668
you shouldn’t make things complicated.

187
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:17,979
Just do whatever you want.

188
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:19,979
If you like someone, you just tell him.

189
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:23,979
Time is precious.

190
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,979
He must be bitten by mosquitoes many times.

191
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:15,979
A young man like you must be approached by many women?

192
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,979
Why does it have to be her?

193
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:23,979
I think she must be quite headstrong.

194
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,909
No.

195
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:32,706
From her appearance, people tend to think that she is like that.

196
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,979
But for me, Irin is kind and sweet.

197
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:47,419
She’s acting like that because she needs to take care of her sister,

198
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,979
on behalf of her late parents who passed away many years ago.

199
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,241
She also has to step up and manage the company instead of her grandfather.

200
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,979
So she doesn’t really show her soft side to anyone.

201
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,454
For me,

202
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,365
she is the same woman

203
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,205
that I’ve fallen in love with seven years ago.

204
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,130
So that’s the reason.

205
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,342
That’s why I want to be by her side.

206
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,352
No matter how hard she tries to get rid of me,

207
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,584
I don’t want to let her be alone.

208
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:29,979
I want to be by her side whenever she turns around to look back.

209
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:35,309
I want to help her in any way that I can.

210
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:41,979
I thought you were immature.

211
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,979
But you aren’t like that.

212
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,834
That’s why I have a favor to ask.

213
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,850
Can you translate this book for her?

214
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,801
Why?

215
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,979
From what I heard, the company’s sales aren’t good.

216
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,428
She is trying to find a way

217
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,982
to increase the sales so the company can keep running.

218
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,979
If you agree to help her, it would be great.

219
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,801
Did she ask you to tell me that?

220
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:13,762
She would never do it.

221
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:19,259
Since I’ve known her, I’ve never seen her asking for help from anyone.

222
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,602
I came to talk to you because I really want to help her.

223
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:03,979
Did he already fall asleep?

224
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,970
How could he fall asleep so fast?

225
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:51,592
You said you are a grown-up.

226
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,979
How did you get drunk after a few drinks?

227
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,903
Did you really fall asleep?

228
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:01,979
You’re pretending, aren’t you?

229
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:27,979
I have a gift for you.

230
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,205
Open it.

231
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,880
Do you know what these necklaces mean?

232
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,305
Parrots usually have one mate for life.

233
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:47,537
You know that I will always be with you

234
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:51,979
in the same way that parrots never leave their mate.

235
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:55,263
This one is for you.

236
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,417
This one is for me.

237
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,417
Let’s break up.

238
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:04,681
I think you are...

239
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,979
From tomorrow on, don’t contact me.

240
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,743
Why?

241
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,048
Why don’t you get what I said?

242
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,760
Why? If you don’t tell me why, you can’t go anywhere.

243
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,385
I’m sick of you.

244
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,842
You’re overbearing.

245
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,979
Is that reason enough for you?

246
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,623
There’s nothing to worry about.

247
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:26,775
I think they are healthy.

248
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,410
You can let it live and grow up naturally.

249
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:31,712
For the mother cow,

250
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:35,278
I suggest you buy supplements for breastfeeding cows.

251
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,945
So it can produce a lot of milk.

252
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,970
Thank you so much.

253
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,828
You’re welcome.

254
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,934
Can I collect eggs from the hen house?

255
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,979
I want to use them to cook breakfast.

256
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:51,834
Sure. Please make yourself at home.

257
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,280
Why are you laughing

258
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,957
Nothing.

259
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:59,217
I guess you must have fallen into a deep sleep last night.

260
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:02,571
I slept outside. So there were many mosquitoes.

261
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,571
Why did you sleep outside?

262
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,979
There was no way that Irin would let me sleep in the room with her.

263
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,705
You could get sick from sleeping outside.

264
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:14,705
It’s alright.

265
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:17,979
Thank you so much for putting a blanket over me.

266
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:21,120
I didn’t do that.

267
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,582
You didn’t?

268
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,362
Then who did it?

269
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:30,315
I guess it was the same person that drew rabbit whiskers on your face.

270
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,451
Rabbit whiskers? On my face?

271
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:43,450
I saw that there were many mosquitoes.

272
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:46,515
How could you draw on my face?

273
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,979
It’s a punishment for those who didn’t get a shower.

274
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:51,979
Am I right, Professor?

275
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,930
I’m not a kid anymore. How could you draw on my face?

276
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,979
I’m going to clean it out first.

277
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:03,979
Have you reconsidered the job offer?

278
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,979
When did I have time for it?

279
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:09,062
I have many things to do.

280
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:12,746
If you are in a hurry to have the answer, you should hire someone else.

281
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,216
Because I can do that for you.

282
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,856
No, no, no.

283
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:17,960
I’m not in a rush.

284
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,979
What about the promise that you gave me?

285
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:23,979
What promise?

286
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:27,979
That you will give another chance to the rabbit.

287
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,939
But I don’t think I...

288
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:37,346
Namcha seems to like you a lot.

289
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,413
I don’t think so.

290
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:41,979
He’s still young and has a long way to grow up.

291
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,979
In the future, he may find someone he likes more than me.

292
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:51,979
From your words, it sounds like puppy love is a bad thing.

293
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,979
Don’t you know how great pure love without conditions is?

294
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,979
An old man like me is longing for it.

295
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,979
But my time to search for it had passed.

296
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:11,979
I hope you won’t let it slip away like me.

297
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,328
But we can’t always have what we want.

298
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:21,979
Maybe my time to receive that kind of love has passed.

299
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,672
I’ll tell you something.

300
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:31,202
I built this house because I want to escape from the hectic world.

301
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,536
You don’t need to force yourself to do anything that you don’t like when you are here.

302
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,980
Why don’t you try and live life differently here?

303
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:39,980
Do you understand what I said?

304
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:45,105
I think you will be stuck here for a while.

305
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,031
Because you need an answer from me about the job offer.

306
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,979
Unfortunately, I can’t think of anything right now.

307
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:59,219
So I can’t give you any answers.

308
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:23,979
Let’s follow your heart.

309
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,977
What do you want to eat? I’ll cook it for you.

310
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:37,207
What’s wrong?

311
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,979
What do you want to cook for me?

312
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,979
Tell me what you want to eat. I’ll cook it for you.

313
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,693
Professor asked me to go into the plantation with him.

314
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:52,693
Do you want to join us?

315
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,979
(Sometimes it’s nice)

316
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,850
(You look like you’re into me)

317
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,979
(Sometimes it’s a strike and you push me aside)

318
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:24,570
(What you’re afraid of)

319
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,028
(I don’t get it honestly)

320
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:32,151
(What I’m afraid of is there’s someone else beside me)

321
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:35,394
(Just please tell me)

322
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,386
(I’m tired of guessing)

323
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,851
(What secret you’re hiding)

324
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,065
(in your heart)

325
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:45,355
(You won’t tell me)

326
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,979
(I’m tired of listening to the silence you’re giving)

327
00:23:52,296 --> 00:24:01,943
(Is it alright to expect something from us?)

328
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:12,795
(Is it alright to expect our love to last?)

329
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:27,979
Wow, the car has a big capacity.

330
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:31,085
Yes, it can carry a lot of stuff.

331
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,263
Let me help you.

332
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,979
Thank you.

333
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:00,610
Look, there are a lot of fruits.

334
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,302
The tree is full of fruits.

335
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:20,967
Irin, try this one. It’s delicious.

336
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,386
Stop it.

337
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:25,977
Get away from me.

338
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,333
It’s really delicious.

339
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,817
Get away from me.

340
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:31,979
The buildings are cute.

341
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:34,860
I should take photos of them.

342
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
They look vintage.

343
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:00,792
Irin.

344
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:03,979
Let’s go.

345
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,979
Khanom Phing Boran looks yummy.

346
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:13,979
Do you want to taste it?

347
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:15,970
What are you doing?

348
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:17,382
Khanom Ping (Ping in Thai means "lean on")

349
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:19,903
It’s Kanom Phing, not Ping.

350
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:21,979
Silly.

351
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:31,518
Tofu sheets.

352
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:32,251
Do you want to buy it?

353
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:33,832
Mala flavor.

354
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:35,394
Mala flavor is spicy.

355
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,943
I’ll buy the three-flavored one.

356
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:41,979
- How is it? - Good

357
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,835
Have you ever thought about marriage?

358
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,823
I told you not to...

359
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:29,804
I know that you’re interested in this kind of thing.

360
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:31,231
But...

361
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,979
Stop talking nonsense.

362
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:43,108
Then, can I take a look at your necklace?

363
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,991
What necklace?

364
00:27:44,991 --> 00:27:47,069
The necklace that I gave you.

365
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:49,069
I didn’t wear it anymore.

366
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,788
What are you doing? Let me go.

367
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,788
Let’s make a wish together.

368
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,909
What wish? Let me go.

369
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,979
This.

370
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:21,979
I wish that these necklaces will always be together.

371
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,644
What did you wish for?

372
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:47,644
I won’t tell you.

373
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:50,871
My wish is...

374
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,943
I don’t want to know.

375
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:55,979
What’s supposed to be a secret, you don’t need to tell me.

376
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,970
Just keep it a secret.

377
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,979
The sunset sky is beautiful.

378
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,708
Um.

379
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:15,979
I want it to look like this all day.

380
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,302
If it looked like this all day,

381
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,979
we might not think it was as pretty as we feel now.

382
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:27,979
It’s beautiful because it can only be seen for a short time.

383
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,977
That’s true.

384
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:35,979
We should be happy with what we got.

385
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:41,200
When we get back, we won’t be able to have it anymore.

386
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:55,405
Earlier, I made a wish that we would be together like this forever.

387
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,373
No matter where we are.

388
00:29:57,373 --> 00:30:01,979
I told you not to say your wish out loud, otherwise, it won’t come true.

389
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:04,205
Hurry and take your words back.

390
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,459
Alright.

391
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:07,228
I take my words back.

392
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:19,979
So you also want it to come true?

393
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,979
The sky is pretty.

394
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:09,860
(Just please tell me)

395
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,979
(I’m tired of guessing what secret you’re hiding)

396
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,080
(You won’t tell me)

397
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,979
(I’m tired of listening to the silence you’re giving)

398
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:42,745
Did Irin get back yet?

399
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:45,610
I haven’t seen her since this morning.

400
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,302
What happened?

401
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:03,979
Why are you so quiet?

402
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:07,084
Did you have a fight?

403
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:13,405
No, we didn’t have a fight.

404
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,632
Today is just a really good day.

405
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:23,120
What about you?

406
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,465
Yes.

407
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:29,979
This is how things should be.

408
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:33,979
I’ll take your translation job offer.

409
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:35,779
Really?

410
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,945
Thank you so much, Professor.

411
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,768
You don’t have to thank me.

412
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:41,735
You should thank Namcha.

413
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,508
He tried to do everything that he could to help you get this job done.

414
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:49,980
If he didn’t come with you, I probably wouldn’t accept your job offer.

415
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:57,687
Then I’ll wash the dishes today.

416
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:59,979
Do whatever you want.

417
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:11,605
(Tan, I can’t reach Namcha. I’m worried about him.)

418
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:20,000
(He went out of town. The phone signal may be poor.)

419
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,444
(He went out of town? To where?)

420
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,695
(He told me that he was going to Chantaburi.)

421
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,882
(He left the other day. So he would probably be back today.)

422
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,632
It’s the weekend. Isn’t Irin home?

423
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:34,697
She said she’s going out of town.

424
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:37,979
Out of town? With who?

425
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:40,146
Alone, probably.

426
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:41,979
I saw her putting the bag in the car.

427
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:09,137
How could you do this to me?

428
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:11,979
How dare you do this to me?

429
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,508
Silly, how could you fall asleep?

430
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:25,979
When we go back to Bangkok, everything will come to an end.

431
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,607
This is enough, Irin.

432
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:37,979
Just pretend what happened here never happened.

433
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,761
Because you are my woman.

434
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,761
I belong to no one.

435
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:19,979
There is not a single second that I think of Inn more than a friend.

436
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:24,091
You two went to have a happy moment together.

437
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,982
Have you ever thought of me?

438
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:29,813
Have you never known how much Irin loves you?

439
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,980
From today on, stay away from me.

440
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
I told you to leave.

441
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,712
The patient has lost a lot of blood.

442
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:41,979
Do you know anyone who can donate type O blood?

443
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,890
My blood is type O.
