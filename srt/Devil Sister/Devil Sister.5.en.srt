1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:02,722
What’s wrong?

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:04,777
It seems like you need to call a mechanic.

3
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:05,872
What happened?

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,629
Why is this man sitting in your car?

5
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,826
Her grandpa always asks me to take care of things in this house.

6
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:12,428
Why are you acting overzealously?

7
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,894
Go home, Cha.

8
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:17,251
I think you are self-centered and have empathy for no one.

9
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,642
How dare you say that to me?

10
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:22,721
Hello, sis.

11
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,979
Do you want me to tell you about his childhood stories?

12
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,902
Cha used to run naked...

13
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,780
Don’t.

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,505
You are playing together like siblings, aren’t you?

15
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,979
Yes, like siblings.

16
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,724
What?

17
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,979
It’s exactly what I’ve thought.

18
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:46,934
What?

19
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:49,979
Hey! Someone may see us.

20
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,515
Here is the car.

21
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,558
This car?

22
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:58,008
So this is the reason why you didn’t let me drive you to the condo.

23
00:00:58,336 --> 00:00:59,964
Why are you still here?

24
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:02,090
I’m the one who gave you a ride here.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,974
How could I let you leave with someone else?

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,534
If you wanted to ride with Namcha,

27
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,485
you should have done that from the beginning.

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,979
You shouldn’t have secretly met up with him like this.

29
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,875
Did you two come together?

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,980
That’s great. Then you should go together.

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
So it won’t be a problem.

32
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,213
Are you still denying what I’ve told you?

33
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,328
About you and Inn.

34
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,351
Stop talking nonsense.

35
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,512
I came here to meet my friend, Ploy.

36
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:36,622
Namcha came because they know each other.

37
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,979
This car is Ploy’s, isn’t it?

38
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,840
Yes, but we’re...

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,979
So stop judging me and making me a bad person.

40
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,979
Let’s go, Ploy, my bestie.

41
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:55,979
I have many things I want to talk to you about in the car.

49
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:03,979
Did I go to the café to pick her up?

50
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,970
Did I...?

51
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,097
Irin, what are you doing here?

52
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,097
I came to see you.

53
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,482
See me?

54
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:17,404
I ran into her at Paeng’s café.

55
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:19,922
Her car broke down. So I asked her to come here.

56
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:21,050
Your car broke down?

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,554
Then you can go home with me.

58
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:23,468
But you need to wait for a while.

59
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:27,979
I need to clear my work and examine the patients first. Okay?

60
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:28,928
I should...

61
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,979
She can wait.

62
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,157
She said she hasn’t seen you for some time.

63
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,814
So she has many things to talk to you about.

64
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:40,346
Oh? Then you go wait in my room.

65
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,208
We can talk after I finish examining the patients.

66
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,734
Sure.

67
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,722
The owner of Action, the result is out.

68
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:53,457
He’s healthy and has no health problems.

69
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:57,979
Congratulations. So you don’t need to come to the hospital often.

70
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,768
Is he really healthy?

71
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:03,182
Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with the test?

72
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:06,108
Action is really healthy.

73
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,979
As you see, he’s healthy.

74
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,620
From now on, you don’t need to waste your time coming here.

75
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,979
Then excuse me. Please take care of it.

76
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:19,979
I’m off now.

77
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:29,888
Doggie, why are you barking at me?

78
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,423
Do you want to be hit?

79
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,152
That’s rude, Baby.

80
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,865
Quiet.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,850
Good job.

82
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:55,737
Did you come back from giving Irin a ride?

83
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,591
I didn’t give her a ride to the condo.

84
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,318
Why?

85
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:01,979
She told me to give her a ride to a café.

86
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,979
It seemed like she had an appointment with someone else.

87
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,979
An appointment?

88
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:11,788
With whom?

89
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,979
Why don’t you guess?

90
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,410
I don’t know much about her friends.

91
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:21,850
But this is someone you know.

92
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,979
Namcha?

93
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,509
They wouldn’t leave together.

94
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,979
Instead, they had secretly met each other outside.

95
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,979
How many times have they lied to me like this?

96
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,979
Can I honestly ask you if you like Namcha?

97
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,863
Why are you asking me that?

98
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:56,669
If that’s so, we should work together.

99
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,822
If I get to marry Irin,

100
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,979
you are the one who will benefit the most from it.

101
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,979
What do I have to do?

102
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,195
Are all these animals sick?

103
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,459
Yes.

104
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,802
I have to constantly check on them.

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,488
Sometimes, the assistants didn’t know their conditions as much as I do.

106
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,979
Their job is to provide food based on the written instruction on each cage.

107
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,979
I feel sorry for them.

108
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:45,979
Do you really have to do that?

109
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,654
It’s just a baby.

110
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,979
It didn’t have a chance to live its life yet.

111
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,979
Aren’t you too cruel to it?

112
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,342
To raise an animal,

113
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,979
you need to create a living environment to be as close as its natural habitat.

114
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:09,979
If the animal is a predator, you have to let it hunt.

115
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,405
Tan went out to examine a patient.

116
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:17,400
So I came in to take over for her.

117
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:25,979
Do you want to try feeding it?

118
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,979
No, it’s too cruel.

119
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,979
This is just its nature.

120
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:37,896
What nature?

121
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,780
If you keep feeding it like this, rats and worms would be run out of the market.

122
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,979
Then the food chain will be imbalanced.

123
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,463
These prey are raised to be their food.

124
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:53,522
Just like we do pig and chicken farming to be our food.

125
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:59,438
If you think this is cruel, I think humans are the worst.

126
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,567
Animals eat other animals. It’s not a big deal.

127
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:08,545
Can I buy the other rats? I’ll release it. I don’t want to see them die.

128
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:11,979
This is its nature.

129
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,854
You have never lost someone you love.

130
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:25,979
So you can say that this is a natural thing.

131
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,979
Death is always cruel.

132
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,979
I’m sorry.

133
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:58,718
I forgot about that.

134
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:05,979
I’m alright.

135
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:15,979
Don’t go. Just stay with me.

136
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:19,503
I don’t want you to go and cry with someone else.

137
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,979
You can do that with me only.

138
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:51,979
What are you doing?

139
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:55,979
Bird. Cha is feeding the bird.

140
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,979
That’s right.

141
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,979
I’m feeding the bird.

142
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,979
Why are you sitting like that? It’s like you were a kid playing around.

143
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:14,113
Let’s go and talk in my room.

144
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:15,640
I don’t have any case to examine right now.

145
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,320
Let’s go.

146
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:22,247
Why did she need to come in at that moment?

147
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,979
Birdie, you know how I feel, don’t you?

148
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,453
How long haven’t I come to drink at your condo?

149
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,437
Several months.

150
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,979
Really?

151
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:43,979
Cha, you have never been here, haven’t you?

152
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,325
If I didn’t ride with you to work this morning,

153
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:52,153
I wouldn’t have had the chance to come here.

154
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,297
You have never told me anything.

155
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:59,690
That’s great. You should know this place.

156
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,392
If Irin needs help but I’m busy, you can come to help her.

157
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:05,392
I’m happy to do that.

158
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,979
It’s my turn.

159
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,979
Those who are in love at the moment, drink!

160
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,090
What?

161
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:23,930
You are in love?

162
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,979
With whom? Why didn’t I know about it?

163
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,354
Why didn’t you tell me? Why?

164
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:35,469
That’s enough.

165
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,469
It’s my turn now.

166
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,023
Alright.

167
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:43,979
Those who have been heartbroken, drink!

168
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,979
Irin, you have been heartbroken?

169
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,868
Cha, you too?

170
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,346
Why had I never known about it?

171
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,979
How would you know it? You’d never cared about me.

172
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,980
Who broke your heart?

173
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:14,595
Who was he?

174
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,305
Calm down, bro.

175
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,979
It’s your turn now.

176
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,470
Those who have ever had a crush

177
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:23,134
on someone but couldn’t tell anyone,

178
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,980
drink!

179
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,055
I have someone in my heart as well.

180
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,979
Let’s drink, drink, drink.

181
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,979
My turn.

182
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:45,979
Those who have ever dated someone from their close circle, drink!

183
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,979
What?

184
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:05,979
You two have so many secrets.

185
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,979
I need to go to the bathroom.

186
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,979
I’ll be right back.

187
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:25,979
Watch your step.

188
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,979
Whom did you talk about?

189
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,331
What do you mean?

190
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:37,979
The one that you had a crush on but you couldn’t tell anyone.

191
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,979
When I said that, why did you drink?

192
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:45,160
Why do I have to tell you?

193
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,847
Tan

194
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,979
Go check on her and see if she’s alright.

195
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,965
Can you walk?

196
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:31,979
Yes. I’m not that drunk.

197
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,979
Go.

198
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:39,105
Tan.

199
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:41,979
Tan.

200
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,408
Why are you sleeping here?

201
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,447
Tan.

202
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,979
Get up and go to sleep in the room. Come on.

203
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:53,977
My turn.

204
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,979
The game is over.

205
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,979
Get up.

206
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,975
You should go to sleep in your room.

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,705
You will get a backache if you sleep here.

208
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:25,979
You are old now.

209
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,979
Who is old?

210
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:29,979
Nothing.

211
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,429
Come on.

212
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,429
I heard it.

213
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,545
You should go to bed.

214
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:41,205
You have to wake up early tomorrow, don’t you?

215
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,402
Namcha.

216
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,979
Why are you calling me?

217
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,675
I didn’t call you.

218
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,979
I answered your question from earlier.

219
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,979
Whom did you talk about?

220
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:05,979
What do you mean?

221
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,472
The one that you had a crush on but you couldn’t tell anyone.

222
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:15,979
You are so cute.

223
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,979
Please don’t die.

224
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,371
Are you that drunk?

225
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,979
Don’t go get drunk with anyone else.

226
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,657
You didn’t take a shower?

227
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,979
Why are you wearing the same dress as yesterday?

228
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,979
I unintentionally fell asleep.

229
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,979
Did someone visit here?

230
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,979
Do I need to tell you who visited my condo?

231
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:19,979
Why can’t you tell me?

232
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,979
Why is it such a big secret?

233
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:31,979
It’s not a secret but I have no reason to tell others about it either.

234
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,530
Namcha was here, wasn’t he?

235
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,231
I guess the lawyer told you everything.

236
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,186
Did he tell you that there was someone else besides Namcha?

237
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,979
Did you get back with Namcha?

238
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,979
I told you it was nothing.

239
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,979
It’s good to hear that.

240
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,370
I have a favor to ask you.

241
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,090
What is it?

242
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,277
I like Namcha.

243
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:05,979
I want you to help me.

244
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:09,979
Can you help me?

245
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,979
Why don’t you tell Irin that you like Namcha?

246
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,005
Why are you talking about it?

247
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,268
Why do I need to do that?

248
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:21,979
All this time, you’ve never told her about it.

249
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:23,979
What good comes out of it?

250
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,979
You just need to tell her how you feel.

251
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,979
Trust me.

252
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,439
If you tell her,

253
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:41,979
no older sister dares to steal the guy that her baby sister likes.

254
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,948
You are her baby sister.

255
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,948
You have the advantage of it.

256
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:48,948
Trust me.

257
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,979
What do you think? Can you help me?

258
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,943
Since I was born, I have never asked anything from you.

259
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:09,979
I’m only asking for your help to make my wish come true. That’s all.

260
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,979
I’m so full.

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,979
Hello, Irin.

262
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,438
Um.

263
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,201
Are you calling me to talk about what happened last night?

264
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,979
What are you talking about? I don’t get it.

265
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,005
Please don’t die.

266
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,023
Are you free this evening?

267
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,450
Do you want to have dinner with me?

268
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,663
I’m free. I’d love to do that.

269
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,290
Where and what time should I meet you?

270
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:11,979
Let’s meet around 7 pm. I’ll send you the location details later.

271
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,979
Sure.

272
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:43,979
I’m good now. I can eat some more.

273
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:06,915
Can you ask Namcha to go out and have dinner with me?

274
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:11,091
Why don’t you ask him yourself? It’s just a dinner.

275
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:13,979
I don’t have a gut to do that.

276
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,982
He often refused me when I asked him.

277
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,979
If you ask him, he might not refuse the offer.

278
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:31,757
I did what you told me to do.

279
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:33,979
It was great.

280
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:41,979
I told you.

281
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:47,240
I should have asked for your advice about this sooner.

282
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,130
From now on, I’ll ask you before I do anything.

283
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,979
If I get what I want, you will get what you want too.

284
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:45,979
I must have drank a lot last night. I can’t remember anything.

285
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:49,979
You are so cute.

286
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:53,122
Please don’t die.

287
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:09,979
It can’t be true. I didn’t say something like that, did I?

288
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,770
(See you this evening. I’ll be waiting for you.)

289
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:33,982
Did I say it?

290
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:37,979
Saywo.

291
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:39,979
	Saywo, hang on.

292
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,251
Saywo.

293
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:42,634
What are her symptoms?

294
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,854
I’m not sure if she’s pregnant.

295
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:47,614
She was trying to push something out.

296
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:49,979
Then she stopped and laid motionless.

297
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:51,817
Saywo.

298
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:53,912
Has she had a birth control injection before?

299
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:56,942
Yes, around two years ago.

300
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:59,373
But I stopped giving her the injection a few months ago.

301
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,619
It’s possible that she might get pregnant

302
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:02,980
after you stopped the injection.

303
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,940
There could be a problem with her uterus.

304
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,345
Birth control injection in animals is very dangerous.

305
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,651
It can be fatal.

306
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,471
What?

307
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:15,386
She needs to have surgery right away.

308
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,783
Sure, doctor.

309
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,120
Please take good care of her.

310
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,238
Saywo.

311
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:22,860
Saywo’s owner, please go wait outside.

312
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,980
Yes.

313
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:33,979
Her condition is not good. She needs surgery immediately.

314
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:35,979
I’ll do it.

315
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:39,762
But I’m the first one who examined her. I’ll do it.

316
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:41,946
This is not a job for a newbie.

317
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,778
I don’t want our hospital to be known as

318
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:46,080
the hospital where no animals survive after being admitted.

319
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,979
But I also have a veterinary medicine degree.

320
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,223
If I don’t do it today, when will I get another chance to do it?

321
00:25:50,223 --> 00:25:52,715
This is not the time for you to show off.

322
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:55,979
That’s not his intention.

323
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,407
I just want to do my job as best as I can.

324
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,979
Just let him do what he wants.

325
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,979
If something happens, he will take the responsibility for it.

326
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,672
He hasn’t come out yet?

327
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,979
No.

328
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,979
Cha, how is it?

329
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:05,980
So?

330
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:13,029
Do you want me to call and inform its owner?

331
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,979
No. Cha will do that.

332
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:17,979
Yes.

333
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:41,979
How are you?

334
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,979
I shouldn’t have done the surgery.

335
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,979
If I let him do it, things wouldn’t end up like this.

336
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:57,370
But from what I saw, it wasn’t an easy case.

337
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,979
It’s normal for us to encounter something like this.

338
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,585
But I should have done better.

339
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,979
I should have done better.

340
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:11,487
This is just the beginning. You will go through many things from now on.

341
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,979
You will get used to it.

342
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,979
Don’t be too stressed about it.

343
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:25,979
An animal can mean a lot to its owner.

344
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,911
If you are viewing it that way,

345
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:34,098
it’s not surprising why the rate of veterinarians suffering from depression is high.

346
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,872
You did your best.

347
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:39,979
You need to accept the result.

348
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:43,856
Next time, you have to do better.

349
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:47,979
That’s all you have to do, about anything.

350
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:52,490
One lesson you will learn to become an adult

351
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:57,979
is learning to accept reality and fix it.

352
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,979
Do you get it?

353
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:05,979
When you feel better, you should call its owner.

354
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:11,979
I want you to make the call yourself because it would be better for you.

355
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,146
Come on.

356
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,213
I’m applying for a new job.

357
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:29,979
I think this company may go out of business within two years.

358
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:31,574
It’s not doing well right now.

359
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,204
Really?

360
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,418
When you say something about the company,

361
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,979
you should be respectful to the place you are working for.

362
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,877
I’m not close to the president like you.

363
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:46,942
All you need to do is a little bootlicking.

364
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:49,979
Then you get promoted ahead of others.

365
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,979
We don’t have that kind of luck.

366
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:57,945
If you stop gossiping about others or the company,

367
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,579
you will have plenty of time to improve your work.

368
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,805
If you spend time gossiping about those who have better performance

369
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,979
or complaining when things don’t go your way,

370
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,979
Who would want to promote you?

371
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,105
How is my car?

372
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,979
It will take around 3 - 4 days to fix it.

373
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:21,001
Why does it take that long?

374
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:23,979
Your grandfather told me to give you a ride during the meantime.

375
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:27,979
So you can share the details of my personal life with Inn?

376
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,909
That wasn’t my intention.

377
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:35,979
She asked me about it. I only told her what happened.

378
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:41,979
You no longer have to run an errand with Inn this evening, do you?

379
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,979
No.

380
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:47,299
Then I’ll wait for you and get off work together.

381
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:51,982
Excuse me.

382
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:29,955
Inn, where is Irin?

383
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,979
She has urgent work to do. So she asked me to come instead.

384
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:37,106
Why didn’t she call me or postpone the dinner?

385
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:40,909
I don’t know. She just told me to come instead.

386
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,979
What should I order?

387
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:51,118
What was she thinking?

388
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,198
It’s not a big deal.

389
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:58,909
I haven’t had dinner with you for some time.

390
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:07,386
Oh, flowers.

391
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:13,982
Don’t touch it. This is not for you.

392
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,979
I saw Irin left with Jin.

393
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,979
I guess it’s urgent. Maybe it’s about their wedding.

394
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:27,346
Their wedding?

395
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:31,979
You know that my grandpa wants Irin to marry Jin.

396
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,979
They might go do an errand about it.

397
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,979
I like Namcha.

398
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:05,979
I want you to help me.

399
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,109
Can you help me?

400
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:37,348
Why are you still here?

401
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,348
I’m waiting to give you a ride home.

402
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:41,951
You are so...

403
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:43,979
How could I let you go home alone?

404
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:50,226
You don’t need to take my grandfather’s order that seriously.

405
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:51,979
Because I won’t tell him about it anyway.

406
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,706
Why do you think that I do this because it’s his order?

407
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,979
If it isn’t, then what is your reason?

408
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:03,358
Let’s go to the car.

409
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,287
Are you hungry?

410
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:07,287
No.

411
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,979
Instead of throwing it away, you could give it to me.

412
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:27,040
Why would you want something that isn’t yours?

413
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,979
Because I like it.

414
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,517
Then you shouldn’t like something that isn’t yours.

415
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:38,607
Otherwise, you won’t be able to be happy.

416
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:40,703
Bear that in mind.

417
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:43,979
What do you mean?

418
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,210
I mean what I said.

419
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:51,979
Drive home safe.

420
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:27,979
It’s okay because I want it.

421
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,979
I don’t care if it belonged to someone else before.

422
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:57,979
I’ll come to pick you up tomorrow.

423
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,979
Wait.

424
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,979
I noticed that you haven’t eaten anything today.

425
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:17,671
And I know that you won’t go and have dinner with me.

426
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:22,909
So I order some food for you in case you may feel hungry at night.

427
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,979
How did you know that I didn’t have lunch today?

428
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:29,979
Take it.

429
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:33,979
If you feel hungry at night, you won’t be able to fall asleep.

430
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,979
You blew me off to go with him?

431
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:55,979
How could you do that to me?

432
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:00,493
Are you crazy?

433
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:03,005
What are you doing here? I’m totally surprised.

434
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,979
Why didn’t you come to our meeting?

435
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,970
You should go home. It’s late.

436
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:13,979
You didn’t go to our dinner so you can go with him?

437
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,979
Stop talking nonsense. I’m tired.

438
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:23,980
Irin.

439
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:25,980
Why did you blow me off?

440
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,450
I had work to do.

441
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,444
Then why didn’t you tell me that?

442
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,717
There are many ways for you to let me know.

443
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,979
You could have called me and said you couldn’t come.

444
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:39,979
I felt like you fooled me and set up the meeting for someone else.

445
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,708
Stop talking nonsense.

446
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,650
I only had work to do. So I told Inn to go instead.

447
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,979
You two are friends. So it shouldn’t be a big deal.

448
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,924
I don’t believe you.

449
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,834
What exactly are you trying to do?

450
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,979
If you don’t believe me, so believe whatever you want.

451
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:59,979
Cha, stop acting like a child.

452
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:05,979
I won’t let you go anywhere until we talk this through.

453
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,659
Cha, we are not dating.

454
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:13,257
If you want to take care of someone, you should go take care of Inn.

455
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,474
Stop being nosy about my life like a kid.

456
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:17,121
I don’t have time for it.

457
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:19,730
But I don’t want to take care of anyone else.

458
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,120
Listen to me.

459
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,755
I don’t want anyone to take care of me.

460
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:31,294
I need to follow my grandfather’s order and get married anyway.

461
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,294
So you should leave me alone.

462
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:37,979
If you follow me again, I’ll call the security guard.

463
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,468
Today is your birthday.

464
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,271
So I thought you would have a special date with someone.

465
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:22,868
I wish you all happiness and freedom from all the things that make you sad.

466
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:24,191
This is your birthday gift.

467
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,650
I intend to give you this.

468
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,560
What is this, Inn?

469
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,722
I didn’t want anything. I only want one thing.

470
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:31,145
Don’t you think that this is ridiculous?

471
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,717
I didn’t know that Inn would do that.

472
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:35,979
This is not something she can joke about.

473
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:37,453
I need to talk to you.

474
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:39,253
Why are you still wearing the necklace that I gave you?

475
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,678
There’s no longer us, Cha.

476
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:42,933
You need to stop talking about it.

477
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,979
I want you to remember today.
