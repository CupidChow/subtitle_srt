1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:02,614
How long has she been here?

2
00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:04,060
Since this morning.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,410
She has been staring into space since she’s got here.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,096
Get out of my company.

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,896
You’re just a child someone picked up.

6
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,837
You’re crying alone again.

7
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:16,573
I told you that you can’t run away from me.

8
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:20,222
Maybe I don’t deserve him.

9
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,120
Have you ever watched fireworks?

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,725
I don’t waste my time watching the thing

11
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:25,326
that appears in the sky for a few seconds.

12
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,325
Then how would you see the beauty of fireworks

13
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,019
that appear in the sky for a few seconds?

14
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,720
Everything between us is coming to an end.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,995
Just like fireworks, its most beautiful moments

16
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,379
only last for a short time.

17
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,779
So does our happiness.

18
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:30,019
Irin.

19
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,419
Are you really leaving?

20
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:35,376
Yes. I have a lot of things I need to take care of back there.

21
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,619
And Namcha...

22
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,515
We came separately.

23
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,533
We’re not going back together anyways.

24
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,819
Does he know you’re leaving?

25
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,219
He will when he wakes up.

26
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:56,419
Thank you for letting me stay here, Professor.

27
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,819
But it’s time for me to...

28
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:01,219
face the music.

29
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:07,179
Facing the music doesn’t mean you have to leave someone behind.

30
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,579
You know that?

31
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:15,619
The firework has already vanished.

32
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:19,085
But thank you so much

33
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,819
for letting me have some good moments for the last time.

34
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:27,619
I’m off.

35
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,540
Drive carefully.

00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,918
Would it be better for you to take a rest, sir?

44
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:25,065
I’ve been in bed at the hospital for days on end.

45
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,619
You want me to stay bed-ridden at home, too?

46
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,019
I want to be in this room.

47
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:33,579
Yes.

48
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,219
Where are the girls?

49
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,779
Don’t they know I’m coming home today?

50
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:46,368
Inn.

51
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:47,794
How are you feeling, Grandpa?

52
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,117
I am as you can see.

53
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:51,619
Where’s Irin?

54
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,179
Why are you asking about someone like her?

55
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,819
Why are you talking like this?

56
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:02,994
You just wanted someone to help take care of the company for me, right?

57
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,019
It’s not like you were planning on leaving that place to her.

58
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,648
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,788
I think I should help you to your room.

60
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:13,906
Let’s finish talking.

61
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,580
Since we’re already on the topic.

62
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,623
Inn.

63
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,579
What is this all about?

64
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,429
Irin is not your real granddaughter.

65
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,619
She’s not even my sister.

66
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:32,419
You were just using her for the good of the company.

67
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,979
Who said that?

68
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,419
Who do you think you are

69
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,979
to pry into other people’s family matter?

70
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,779
Don’t hurt Jin, Grandpa.

71
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:58,819
It was all my fault.

72
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:03,604
If you want to get angry at someone, let it be me and me alone.

73
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,019
I couldn’t accept that you were using Irin.

74
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:10,819
As for Inn, she was never happy with anything.

75
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,062
Some grandfather you are.

76
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:18,019
You’ve never done anything for your own granddaughter.

77
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:21,579
You used Irin.

78
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:25,219
Same goes for me, doesn’t it?

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,542
You only wanted me to marry Irin

80
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,840
to keep all your interests intact, didn’t you?

81
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,346
I’ve never met such a fool in my life.

82
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:40,997
Get out!

83
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,997
No.

84
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,579
I won’t let him go anywhere.

85
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,774
I am your granddaughter.

86
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:50,379
I should have the right to make decisions about this family.

87
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:55,179
I am not your obedient slave, Grandpa.

88
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,605
I’ve been putting up with this for far too long.

89
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,785
Both of you, get out of here.

90
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,420
Get out!

91
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,579
Are you hurt?

92
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,995
It’s alright.

93
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:33,619
I’m never listening to him again.

94
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:42,706
Can you do me a favor?

95
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,380
What is it?

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,979
He knows how busy it is at the hospital, and where has he gone?

97
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:08,047
Customers are asking for him.

98
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,619
Calm down, honey.

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,179
Can you contact him?

100
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:16,819
I’ll try calling.

101
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:25,182
His phone’s turned off.

102
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,774
Maybe there’s no service.

103
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,774
Maybe he’s driving.

104
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,379
What?

105
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,019
Is there still a place with no cell service in this day and age?

106
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:38,419
There might.

107
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:43,219
But should he just disappear like this right now?

108
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,748
He knows our hospital is gaining business.

109
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:49,179
He should be here to help us make the best out of it.

110
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:53,677
He really isn’t mature at all.

111
00:07:53,677 --> 00:08:00,019
Honey, it is because of Cha that the hospital is doing better.

112
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:05,413
Don’t worry, Dad.

113
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:08,315
I’ve already come up with special offers for our customers.

114
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:12,500
Tan, I think you should get him back here as soon as possible.

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,419
Do you understand?

116
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,308
Yes.

117
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,979
Irin?

118
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,179
I bet she’s just preparing breakfast for me.

119
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,219
Oh, Professor?

120
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,201
I thought you were Irin for a sec.

121
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:00,019
Do we look alike or something?

122
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,579
Well, where is she?

123
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:07,219
Is she making breakfast?

124
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:12,019
Have you tried her food?

125
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,734
Why?

126
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:17,979
If she ever offers you her food, bring it to me.

127
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,560
I’ll save you the trouble.

128
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,619
She’s not cooking.

129
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,179
Then where is she?

130
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,579
She’s gone.

131
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,054
Gone?

132
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,274
Where?

133
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:33,800
She went back to Bangkok.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,802
What? Went back to Bangkok?

135
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:38,641
Why didn’t she tell me anything?

136
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,819
I wouldn’t know.

137
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,782
Why did it turn out like this again?

138
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,162
Hello, Irin.

139
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:10,780
Do you have any luggages for me to carry?

140
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,543
No.

141
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,179
Is Grandpa back home?

142
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,503
Yes, he is.

143
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:16,136
Is Inn here?

144
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,979
Yes. So is Mr. Jin.

145
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:21,579
Good.

146
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,779
Why did you do this?

147
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,179
What did I do?

148
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,979
You didn’t tell me I’m just some adopted kid.

149
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,579
What good would that do?

150
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,997
It’d be the truth.

151
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:53,979
So I wouldn’t have to feel like a fool and live a lie like this.

152
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:58,407
When your parents took you in, I didn’t agree with them.

153
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,979
Then they had Inn.

154
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,614
I didn’t think I would

155
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:07,179
pay you any mind because you weren’t even mine to begin with.

156
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,277
But look how it was.

157
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,580
Inn was in and out of the hospital more often than she went to school.

158
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,484
She doesn’t know left from right, unlike you.

159
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,979
So I gave you a chance.

160
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:20,379
It was only right.

161
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,105
Did you raise me, or even your real granddaughter, just to utilize us?

162
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,179
Is that all?

163
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,979
Whoever can’t be useful don’t get to have a shot at life.

164
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:39,579
Is this what a family should be like?

165
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,282
I’ve built this company from scratch with my own two hands.

166
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,579
It is everything to me.

167
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:50,379
I won’t let anyone destroy it so easily.

168
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,787
You should even thank me for raising you

169
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:59,979
better than any orphan ever deserves.

170
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:07,179
Who do you think gave you all of this?

171
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,755
Everything you have...

172
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:11,979
The car you drive.

173
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,379
The house you sleep in.

174
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,379
The job you have.

175
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:19,179
It is all because of me.

176
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,440
It’s more than any abandoned child would ever dream of.

177
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,579
And is there anyone your age who is already made a chief executive?

178
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,672
Did you plan to use me for the rest of my life?

179
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,579
Use you?

180
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,014
I gave you all the rights a granddaughter of mine should have.

181
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,579
You have a great salary.

182
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:45,579
When I give this company to Inn, you’ll be like one of our employees.

183
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:49,179
Any companies would do this.

184
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:53,604
Or would you like to seize all the things that belong to me?

185
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,674
That’s exactly what ‘being used’ is.

186
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,281
Had you told me I was just an employee,

187
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,188
I wouldn’t have worked my brain off like this.

188
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:05,979
I would have just quit the job when I got too tired.

189
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:10,096
But I thought of this company as the heart of our family.

190
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,602
That’s why I put everything into it.

191
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:15,379
You have everything planned out.

192
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,362
I bet there isn’t a single second

193
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:22,779
where you think of me as your actual granddaughter.

194
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,579
Grandpa...

195
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,865
Let me correct that.

196
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,379
Mr. Anon.

197
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,979
Since you said I was just an employee,

198
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:43,179
then from this moment forward, I quit.

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,718
I quit being a part of your family.

200
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,412
And I resign from every position in your company.

201
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,177
It’s Irin’s car.

202
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,094
Is Irin here?

203
00:13:59,094 --> 00:13:59,977
Yes.

204
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,845
Has she been here long?

205
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,005
For a while now.

206
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,179
What’s going on?

207
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,477
I raised you.

208
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,478
All the opportunities you have in your life are possible because of me.

209
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,379
And you’re going to be such an ungrateful child?

210
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,780
You’re smart.

211
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:27,579
You must know what you’re doing is going to do you more harm than good.

212
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:31,179
I am aware.

213
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:34,339
But I don’t want to work for someone so insincere,

214
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,179
someone who would use family connection to take advantage of me.

215
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:44,379
So you’re going to leave this company to work for someone else?

216
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,850
You think you can do that?

217
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,551
I’ll send a letter to every company to never hire you.

218
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,179
It wouldn’t be difficult for me to do.

219
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:59,980
And you have no right to take even a sigle penny from me.

220
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,112
How will you live?

221
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,979
The condo you live in is in my name.

222
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,379
Where will you stay?

223
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:20,894
Go ahead.

224
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,979
If you want to leave this place so much, do it.

225
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:27,579
Just don’t forget that I built this life up for you,

226
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:32,268
and I can just as easily tear it apart.

227
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,499
Why would you even consider letting her stay?

228
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,597
Chase her off.

229
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:39,294
I hate her guts.

230
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,979
Why should she stay in our family?

231
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:45,579
Don’t poke your nose into my decisions.

232
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,179
Can you work like she does?

233
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:53,979
If no, then just stay silent.

234
00:15:58,426 --> 00:15:59,979
You, too, Jin.

235
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:05,979
If you ever think of leaving, no other companies will take you.

236
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:11,979
I have given you orphans all these opportunities.

237
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,579
Don’t even think about working for someone else.

238
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:21,945
What a shame I’ve looked up to you.

239
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:27,579
In the end, you’re just a selfish geezer on his death bed.

240
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,179
I won’t let it end like this.

241
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:19,180
I won’t let the Bannasorn Group end because of this.

242
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,179
You shameless bitch!

243
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:29,979
You know you don’t belong in this family and you dare showed up here?

244
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,943
Get out of my house.

245
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:35,979
Shame on you.

246
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:39,579
I was planning to stay away from you lots.

247
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,179
But on second thought, I might stay after all.

248
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,711
It would be so fun to see someone so tortured.

249
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,448
Irin!

250
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:50,379
Don’t do this.

251
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,108
But I hate her.

252
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,285
Get off my face.

253
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:55,616
Calm down.

254
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,579
Can we just talk it out?

255
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,179
You won’t take my side?

256
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:04,779
Excuse me.

257
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,179
What will you do now?

258
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:32,379
I can’t believe we’re in the same position.

259
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,779
I bet it’s much worse for you.

260
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,490
I have to go for now.

261
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,402
Where are you going to go?

262
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,087
You’re coming with me.

263
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,811
Cha, I’m begging you to stop.

264
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,179
It’s time you leave her alone.

265
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,579
Don’t you know what she’s been through?

266
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,979
This doesn’t concern you.

267
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,251
How could you run away from me again?

268
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,594
I told you you can talk to me.

269
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,607
Don’t run away from me.

270
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,379
We’ve slept together.

271
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,440
You need to come with me.

272
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,379
I’ll tell everyone we’re getting married.

273
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:15,570
Cha.

274
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,777
Enough.

275
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:20,315
You need to learn to have some decorum.

276
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,253
You really don’t know what she’s going through, do you?

277
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:24,767
How could I not?

278
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,379
It’s about my sister, isn’t it?

279
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,779
I am going to talk it out with her.

280
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:33,231
Is that it?

281
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:35,979
You don’t even know about the things that matter.

282
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,579
What are you saying?

283
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:41,977
I’ll talk to you later.

284
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,379
I’m busy today.

285
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,263
You should be more considerate of other people sometimes.

286
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:08,988
Consider what they’re going through.

287
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,779
Don’t think only of yourself.

288
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,179
You’ll be a nuisance otherwise.

289
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,303
Even if I don’t know what she’s going through,

290
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,075
I am the only one who is by her side.

291
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,915
If you know so much but can’t do anything for her at all,

292
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:25,915
then it doesn’t matter.

293
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,779
I will marry Irin no matter what.

294
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:34,671
Have you asked everyone else before making that decision?

295
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,179
You think marriage is about two people?

296
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:40,779
This is real life, not a soap opera.

297
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:44,379
We’ll see.

298
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:08,016
I told you to stop acting like a brat.

299
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,573
You disappeared without a word.

300
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:13,179
You know how busy it is at the hospital.

301
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,579
When are you going to act like a proper adult?

302
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:22,481
He’s back now so...

303
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,640
You spoil him too much.

304
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,379
That’s why he acts like this.

305
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:31,179
Tell me where you’ve disappeared to.

306
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,779
Dad.

307
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:45,909
What?

308
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:47,979
I want to get married.

309
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,579
What do you mean, Cha?

310
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,179
You’re still too young.

311
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,401
What the hell’s gotten into you?

312
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:08,379
Did you disappear because of a woman?

313
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,980
You can say that.

314
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,579
What woman?

315
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,945
Don’t tell me you knocked her up.

316
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:21,579
It’s not like that.

317
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:24,337
I really love her.

318
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:26,379
Have been for a very long time.

319
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,410
You two know her.

320
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,179
Is it Inn?

321
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,579
It’s not Inn.

322
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,179
It’s Irin.

323
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,779
How can you date her?

324
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,179
She’s way too old for you.

325
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:53,314
That isn’t a problem at all.

326
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,314
It’s 2022.

327
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,579
Why do you want to marry her?

328
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,545
Don’t ask.

329
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,179
I won’t allow it.

330
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,903
Forget about it.

331
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:08,379
If it’s because of the age difference, then you’re just unreasonable.

332
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:10,779
Don’t be foolish.

333
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:14,379
If it was Inn you want to marry, I wouldn’t even stop you.

334
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,979
Because she is Anon’s actual granddaughter.

335
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,278
What are you saying?

336
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:23,586
Irin is his granddaughter, too.

337
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,454
His granddaughter?

338
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:27,579
She’s just a kid they picked up.

339
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:30,137
What are you saying, Dad?

340
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:32,654
Irin? A kid they picked up?

341
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:34,880
I let you be friends all this time

342
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:38,114
because we don’t lose anything by that.

343
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:43,179
But marrying someone who has nothing to her name, you can forget it.

344
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:50,379
Is what Dad said true, Mom?

345
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:58,779
They took Irin in because they couldn’t conceive at first.

346
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,379
But eventually they had Inn.

347
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:05,979
Now that they have their flesh and blood,

348
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:10,779
why would they care about some orphaned child?

349
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,780
Irin never told me any of this.

350
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:20,379
I think nobody ever bothers to even tell her.

351
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,016
Now you know.

352
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:27,579
I forbid you to marry someone without a penny to her name.

353
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,979
I don’t care who.

354
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:34,779
Even if I love her so much?

355
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,755
Love is nonsense.

356
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:45,051
Shouldn’t you be worrying about what you would do once I die?

357
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:49,179
I don’t even trust you to take care of the hospital.

358
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,797
And now you want some burden to join the family?

359
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:55,179
You should look for someone you can rely on.

360
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,779
That’s more important than love.

361
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:04,779
Then did you marry Mom for money?

362
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:05,980
Cha.

363
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:11,979
It’s you who needs to stop talking nonsense.

364
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,379
I’m not you.

365
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,979
I make my own decisions.

366
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:22,779
I’m just telling you this, not asking for permission.

367
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:27,579
I’m not a child that would just follow orders anymore.

368
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,979
Let’s all stay calm here.

369
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,820
Cha, please.

370
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,779
You should stop, too.

371
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:37,179
He really isn’t a child anymore.

372
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,179
Listen to him.

373
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,862
Listen to him?

374
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:43,179
Did you hear a word he said?

375
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:45,761
I can’t believe my own child would turn out so stupid.

376
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:49,179
I can’t believe my own father would be like this, either.

377
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,733
Cha.

378
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,380
Namcha.

379
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,779
Cha!

380
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,807
Cha, honey.

381
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,582
Cha.

382
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,179
You need to stop babying him.

383
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,979
Everything I said was true.

384
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:13,623
Yes.

385
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,579
Of course, it was.

386
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:21,391
One more truth here is that you never care how our children feel.

387
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:23,979
You don’t even listen to them.

388
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:58,779
How is Irin?

389
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,179
I can’t get through to her.

390
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,176
Why is it like this?

391
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:08,379
How long has she known about this?

392
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,979
She never told me anything.

393
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,588
That’s just how she is.

394
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:19,179
She keeps everything to herself.

395
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:25,179
Had Inn not told me, I wouldn’t even know you two were dating.

396
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,380
You can go.

397
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,179
Are you here to yell at me again?

398
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:58,549
Just say what you want to say.

399
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,602
Don’t waste my time.

400
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,979
Am I your only granddaughter?

401
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,379
Don’t ask the obvious.

402
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:13,179
I need you to do something for me.

403
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,579
What is it?

404
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:19,179
I want to marry Namcha.

405
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,487
Is this all you think about?

406
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:31,179
Why not spend your time on something that matters?

407
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:35,979
If I don’t marry him, Irin might.

408
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,985
You’re going to let someone else

409
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,979
rather than your own blood marry a good man?

410
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,721
He will be alright.

411
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:50,379
He will be okay.

412
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:55,697
Please.

413
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,579
Please, help me, Grandpa.

414
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:27,528
What did you pester Grandpa with again?

415
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,528
What are you doing here?

416
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,942
You have been wishing me hell.

417
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:37,179
I bet you’re happy my life is ruined now.

418
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:39,579
Yes.

419
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,573
This family wouldn’t have turned out this way without you here.

420
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:49,179
Without you, Dad, Mom, and even Grandpa, would love me.

421
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:55,179
So that’s why you hate me so much.

422
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:59,979
If I could kill you, I would have.

423
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,161
Do it.

424
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:08,380
Go ahead.

425
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,979
If you hate me that much, just do it.

426
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:21,579
Or are you only adept in back-stabbing?

427
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:27,579
I won’t let you hit me twice.

428
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:29,838
We’re no longer sisters.

429
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,379
I won’t just let you have your way anymore.

430
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,664
And let me assure you,

431
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:38,379
if you even lay a finger on me, I’ll make you pay for it.

432
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,379
It’s a shame.

433
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:55,179
All this time,

434
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:59,979
I really thought of you as my sister.

435
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:07,180
Tell me honestly. How long have you hated me?

436
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,379
Since always.

437
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,368
What you’re facing right now

438
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:22,780
is no compare to how I felt for being your sister.

439
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,653
Even if you died right now,

440
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:29,979
it wouldn’t even make up for everything I lost.

441
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,192
It was you who ruined my life.

442
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,179
It was you who killed my parents.

443
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:45,579
Everything I’ve done doesn’t even come close to how bad I feel.

444
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:51,579
That’s why you don’t deserve to have anything left.

445
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,379
It’s only right

446
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,779
that I take everything back from you.

447
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:05,979
Thank you for telling me honestly.

448
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,779
I can finally get out of your life without worries.

449
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:16,323
I will follow your wish for the last time and get out of here.

450
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:22,779
Think of this as my amends for taking everything from you.

451
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,779
Come in.

452
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:16,779
The company’s book sales while you were in the hospital, sir.

453
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,779
Thanks.

454
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,379
I knew you’d be smart enough to stay.

455
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,179
Nobody else would give you such an opportunity.

456
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:37,179
Did Irin go to the office?

457
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:40,779
It seems she didn’t.

458
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,379
Stupid.

459
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,382
She will come back, no matter what.

460
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:55,791
Get me an appointment with Namcha’s parents.

461
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,582
What is it about?

462
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:03,580
Marriage.

463
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,379
Cha.

464
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:17,979
Aren’t you going to work? Your dad will give you another earful.

465
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,779
Honey.

466
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:32,379
You can tell me everything.

467
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:40,779
Tan texted me.

468
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:46,779
Irin moved out of her place.

469
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,579
And she’s never coming back to her house.

470
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:56,379
I feel like...

471
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:58,779
I’m dying.

472
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:04,779
It hurts every time she runs away from me.

473
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:14,379
This is just like seven years ago when she left me.

474
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:21,579
It’s going to be just like last time, isn’t it?

475
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:31,179
It pains me every time she’s hurt.

476
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:37,179
It feels as if it is my very own pain.

477
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:45,579
I just want to be by her side.

478
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:50,555
Why does she never let me?

479
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:53,980
Why won’t she let me?

480
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,779
It’s alright, honey.

481
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:03,579
It’s alright, Cha.

482
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,459
What do you think?

483
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,564
An acquaintance of mine is leasing this place.

484
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:35,574
It’s perfect.

485
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:37,179
I’ll sign the contract right away.

486
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,791
You’re not going to look around?

487
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,979
No. I don’t want to waste my time.

488
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,379
Here.

489
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,779
In case you need it.

490
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,179
Thank you.

491
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:57,265
It’s alright.

492
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,315
I understand how you feel.

493
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:02,379
If there’s anything I can help you with, I want to.

494
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:09,579
But... are you really not going back to the company?

495
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:13,179
You know your grandfather will make good on his words.

496
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,779
I’m not going back.

497
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:19,179
I want to start over.

498
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:22,779
I’ve been indebted to him for far too long.

499
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,579
If you...

500
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:31,179
If you need my help with anything, you can always tell me.

501
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:39,579
But why are you inviting us over today, Mr. Anon?

502
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,579
I want to talk to you about marriage...

503
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:52,779
between my granddaughter and your son.

504
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:05,979
Congratulations.

505
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,379
On what?

506
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:10,779
You get what you want.

507
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:14,379
I don’t understand what you’re talking about.

508
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,979
You’re getting married, just like you wish.

509
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:22,493
Your grandfather has talked to Namcha’s parents.

510
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:23,980
Has he?

511
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:28,906
From now on,

512
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,379
you will be happy just like you want to.

513
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,180
What about you and Irin?

514
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,367
Don’t worry about me.

515
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:47,979
My life is not going to be worse than what it is right now.

516
00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:58,837
Thank you for inviting us here.

517
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,179
I’ll talk to Namcha.

518
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,004
I’ll bring him here to have a word with you later.

519
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:04,868
Thanks.

520
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:08,379
I hope you understand about my health issues I just told you about.

521
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,779
I do.

522
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:14,379
I’ll explain it to Namcha.

523
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,780
How could you agree with him?

524
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,302
What do you think of our son as?

525
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:27,188
I’ve thought it through.

526
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:29,979
It will benefit no one but you.

527
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:34,779
You never care about other people’s feelings.

528
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,179
What’s the matter?

529
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:39,622
Nothing.

530
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:42,647
What did you talk to them about?

531
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:43,908
What you asked me to.

532
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:45,908
Did you really talk about my marriage?

533
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:47,808
What is it?

534
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,179
I want you to get married.

535
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,542
You two will finally give me your blessings to marry Irin?

536
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,887
I want you to get married only to someone I approve of.

537
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:58,779
And I’ve chosen the perfect girl for you.

538
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,179
If that is true,

539
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:04,426
I won't do what you ask me to.

540
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:05,671
Ever.

541
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,370
What if Namcha doesn’t agree?

542
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,779
I’d like to see, too,

543
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:14,379
what that kid would do.

544
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:16,779
Then you can marry her yourself.

545
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:19,179
Because I won’t.

546
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:32,379
Tell your grandfather to cancel the wedding.

547
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:35,765
If he’s made up his mind, I can’t do anything about it.

548
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,379
You know how he is.

549
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:41,081
But you know Irin and I are in love.

550
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:43,179
Why won’t you understand?

551
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:45,585
And I am in love with you.

552
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:47,979
Have you ever cared about that?

553
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:52,654
Whatever.

554
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:54,363
If you still think of me as a friend,

555
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,847
then you need to stop all this nonsense.

556
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:59,094
What about my feelings?

557
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:01,005
Why must I be the only one here disappointed?

558
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:03,579
Why must I sacrifice?

559
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:07,179
If you won’t do it, then I will.

560
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:13,179
I came here to talk to you in hopes that we could still be good friends.

561
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,779
You’re asking too much.

562
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,980
Irin, where are you?

563
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:33,579
I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

564
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:37,179
You said you’d stay with me.

565
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:52,779
Cha?

566
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,586
How did you get here?

567
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:55,998
You can’t run from me.

568
00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:58,970
I told you I am here for you.

569
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:01,259
The wedding will happen as soon as possible

570
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:03,262
before something embarrassing happens.

571
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:04,779
But I’m not in love with Inn.

572
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:08,379
It’s time you act mature for other people’s sake.

573
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:11,023
You can’t always have it your way.

574
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:13,179
I’m getting married tomorrow.

575
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,127
I promise you,

576
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:19,179
no matter what happens in the future, I’ll be there.
