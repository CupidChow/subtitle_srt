1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:02,140
If you can stay healthy for the next two months,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,785
I’ll let you do a simple exercise.

3
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,013
That’s good.

4
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:08,351
I have a friend who likes exercising.

5
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:10,013
Excuse me.

6
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:12,859
Did you see the man who came here with me who was sitting over there?

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:16,299
He said he had an urgent business.

8
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,297
From now on, I won’t back down for you anymore.

9
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:25,819
You brought this on yourself.

10
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:29,841
Irin, where are you?

11
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,179
She went to the office alone.

12
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,459
Are you happy now?

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,625
Irin.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,339
It’s alright.

15
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:41,730
You’re safe now.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,339
I’m not fragile like that.

17
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,365
But you shouldn’t be alone right now.

18
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:46,020
Why not?

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,922
Because of PTSD. You could have a post-traumatic event stress.

20
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:55,568
(If you have recurring nightmares about something, you have to tell me.)

21
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:57,859
(See you at the park tomorrow.)

22
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,565
I didn’t expect you to come here as I’d told you.

23
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:12,226
What? What did you tell me?

24
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,779
I always come here to work out.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,792
What?

26
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,699
Why isn’t the jogging mode working?

27
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:26,619
Come.

28
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:31,539
I’ll take a look at it.

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,213
Do you really need to do this?

30
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:38,580
I can take it off and give it to you.

31
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,659
You don’t need to take it off.

32
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:50,059
The motion sensor is probably broken.

33
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,619
What are you doing?

34
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:26,979
Inn, what are you doing here?

35
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,465
I want to exercise.

36
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:32,059
The doctor said I can do some light exercise now.

37
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,619
That’s good. It means that your health is better.

38
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,406
If I didn’t come here, I wouldn’t know that

39
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,859
you and Namcha came here to exercise together.

40
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:48,579
Who exercises together?

41
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:51,943
I saw him fall down. So I walked to check on him.

42
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:53,943
When did I fall down?

43
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:56,979
I’m just sitting down.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,099
Why are you sitting there?

45
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,859
I sat down to play with the dog.

46
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,299
Am I your playmate?

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,419
What are you doing?

48
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:34,059
I should go since you already have a friend to work out with.

49
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,659
I need to pack my stuff to stay at my condo.

50
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,579
Irin.

51
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:44,499
Did you ask Irin to meet you here?

52
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,171
If I could, I would be great.

53
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,499
Don’t you see that she’s always trying to avoid me?

54
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,816
Why are you smiling?

55
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,620
What happens?

56
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:00,734
Nothing.

57
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:04,339
Can you walk with me for exercise?

65
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,060
Let me help you.

66
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:50,118
No, thanks.

67
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:52,099
Why not?

68
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,322
It’s nothing.

69
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:56,486
I just don’t want to owe someone for no necessary reason.

70
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,659
It’s normal for us to ask for help from others.

71
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:09,699
No one would think you are weak.

72
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,565
What’s wrong?

73
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:31,779
Let me take a look.

74
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,099
It seems like you need to call a mechanic.

75
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:00,601
Can’t you fix it?

76
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,601
I don’t want it to be a big deal.

77
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,379
I’m a lawyer, not a mechanic.

78
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,906
I’ll call a mechanic for you.

79
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:14,897
It would be hard to find a mechanic today since it’s Sunday.

80
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,917
Most of the garages are closed today.

81
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,299
Then get the car fixed as soon as possible.

82
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,828
How is the exercise?

83
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,740
Namcha is a great help.

84
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:30,339
I think I should go exercise with him often.

85
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,760
What happened?

86
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Why is this man sitting in your car?

87
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,808
My car broke down.

88
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,798
Did you call a mechanic?

89
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,798
I’ll take care of that.

90
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:53,819
Her grandpa always asks me to take care of things in this house.

91
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:56,299
Then I’ll give you a ride to your condo.

92
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,805
That’s also my job.

93
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:01,579
Why’s that?

94
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,579
I’ve known Irin for many years.

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,470
I think giving her a ride should be done

96
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:12,004
by someone she is close to and trusts.

97
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,155
Do you have a car to give me a ride?

98
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,259
Yes, I have. My car is…

99
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:29,019
My car is parked at your office.

100
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,939
Why is your car parked at her office?

101
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:39,299
I mean it is parked at the hospital.

102
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,256
Aren’t you going to give me a ride?

103
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,645
Then we should hurry. So you can take care of the mechanic.

104
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:48,534
Then I’ll go with you.

105
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,986
At the park, you said you had to hurry

106
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,324
to come home because you needed to go to work?

107
00:07:55,936 --> 00:08:00,419
I’ll take your suitcase to my car.

108
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,419
I’ll help you do that.

109
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,019
This is my duty.

110
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,699
Didn’t you say you needed to hurry to go to work?

111
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:16,579
I know my schedule well.

112
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,420
Good.

113
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,539
Then have fun at work.

114
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,930
Why are you acting overzealously?

115
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,819
Go home, Cha.

116
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,819
Let’s go. I don’t want to waste time anymore.

117
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,099
Why did you raise your voice at me?

118
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,804
Do you want me to turn around and go back?

119
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,819
Why do we have to do that?

120
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:53,248
Since we left, you keep looking at the side mirror.

121
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:57,219
So I thought you might forget something at home.

122
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,219
Your duty is to drive.

123
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,210
You don’t need to think for me.

124
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,939
You’re not hard to read.

125
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,219
And you think you are hard to read?

126
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,032
You hope that you will get to marry me.

127
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,032
I…

128
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:21,280
Do you like my granddaughter?

129
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,475
Why did you ask me that?

130
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,819
I’m old.

131
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:32,463
I’ve seen almost everything.

132
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:35,074
Why wouldn’t I be able to see this?

133
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,940
Am I right?

134
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,614
Yes.

135
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,259
I’ve liked Irin since the first time I met her.

136
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,865
Do you want to marry my granddaughter?

137
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:55,154
What do you mean?

138
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,459
Your father had been good to me.

139
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:07,379
I wanted to repay him but I had never had the chance.

140
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,379
Then he passed away.

141
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,859
If there’s anything I can do for you, I’m happy to do it.

142
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:20,219
Unless you are not that interested in my granddaughter.

143
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,142
I don’t know if I’m that interested in her.

144
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,779
But I’ve never felt this way before.

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,779
I’d always been good at controlling my feelings.

146
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,179
But every time that I’m with Irin,

147
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,779
I have no control over my feelings.

148
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:51,659
That’s enough.

149
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,619
Irin is not easy to be with.

150
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,739
If I have you taking care of her, I will feel much relieved.

151
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:09,739
I think you are self-centered and have empathy for no one.

152
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,739
You always have to get what you want.

153
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,857
You are hard to work with.

154
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,779
How dare you say that to me?

155
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:24,259
If someone judges you like this, you don’t like it either.

156
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:31,099
In the same way, I also don’t like that you are judging me.

157
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,979
I know that you are different from the things I’ve said.

158
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:43,459
You don’t need to act like a mean person to get rid of me.

159
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:48,813
I want to get to know you better.

160
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,939
Do you think you are so smart?

161
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:55,619
I’m not a kid who will listen to your lecture.

162
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,961
You don’t like to be with someone who lectures you.

163
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,979
So you like to be with someone younger.

164
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,979
What are you talking about?

165
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,579
Your neighbor, Namcha.

166
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,139
What do you mean?

167
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,779
You like him, don’t you?

168
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:17,019
Stop talking nonsense.

169
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,139
But it seems like Inn also likes him. Am I right?

170
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,099
Did Inn tell you that?

171
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:35,179
So is it true?

172
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:40,543
Mom.

173
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:41,834
Mom.

174
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:43,020
Mom.

175
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:44,979
Mom.

176
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,979
Mom, how are you?

177
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:52,379
Irin, are you alright?

178
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,819
I’m fine.

179
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,899
Irin, please take care of your sister.

180
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,198
No, Mom.

181
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,139
You need to stay with us to take care of us.

182
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,416
Please hang on.

183
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:11,422
Promise me that you will stay with us.

184
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:24,899
Mom.

185
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,180
Mom.

186
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:28,059
Mom.

187
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,059
Mom.

188
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:31,491
Mom.

189
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,281
Mom.

190
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:36,985
Mom.

191
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,054
- No. - Please wait outside.

192
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,891
Mom.

193
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,918
Mom.

194
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,808
- No. - Please wait outside.

195
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,771
Mom.

196
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,789
Mom.

197
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,407
Mom.

198
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:51,855
Mom.

199
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,078
Please wait outside.

200
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,078
Mom.

201
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,448
Mom.

202
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,937
- Mom. - Promise me, Irin.

203
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,620
Please take care of your sister.

204
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,374
She’s a poor kid.

205
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:19,939
You need to raise her well.

206
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:25,601
You need to sacrifice for her.

207
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,499
Mom.

208
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:55,545
Mom.

209
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:06,099
Mom.

210
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:10,903
Inn.

211
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,066
Inn.

212
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,202
Are you going to the memorial ceremony

213
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,579
for the 100th day of our parents with me?

214
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:18,579
Yes.

215
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,579
Okay, I’ll wait for you.

216
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,450
(Why does Namcha have to like Irin?)

217
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,819
(Why does Irin always take everything from me?)

218
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,268
Why do you barely contact me lately?

219
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:25,004
You didn’t answer any of my messages.

220
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:29,340
I’m busy with my thesis.

221
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:38,619
I’m glad that you came to see me today.

222
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:51,539
You know that I’m very worried about you, don’t you?

223
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,539
If something is bothering you, you can always talk to me.

224
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,905
I’ll help you.

225
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,137
I think we should…

226
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,699
I have a gift for you.

227
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:14,739
Open it.

228
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,739
Do you know what these necklaces mean?

229
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:28,739
Parrots usually have one mate for life.

230
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,423
You know that I will always be with you

231
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:38,767
in the same way that parrots never leave their mate.

232
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:51,539
This one is for you.

233
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,539
This one is for me.

234
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:57,539
I’ll put it on right now.

235
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:07,539
Let’s break up.

236
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,485
I think you are…

237
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,979
From tomorrow on, don’t contact me.

238
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,001
Why?

239
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,139
Why don’t you get what I said?

240
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:28,933
Why?

241
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,499
If you don’t tell me why, you can’t go anywhere.

242
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,502
I’m sick of you.

243
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,499
You’re overbearing.

244
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,499
Is that reason enough for you?

245
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,899
I’m thinking about moving out to the condo.

246
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,785
Why?

247
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,219
I’m busy with my thesis.

248
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:14,539
The condo is closer to my university.

249
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,062
Are you going to live there alone?

250
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:21,974
Yes but you don’t have to worry.

251
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,939
I want to practice how to be independent.

252
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,337
You don’t want a granddaughter

253
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:31,619
who can’t do anything to run your company, don’t you?

254
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:35,152
Do as you want.

255
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,152
You’re almost graduated.

256
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,179
Can I go live with Irin?

257
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:41,634
I don’t want to…

258
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,056
You should stay home.

259
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:46,099
It’s closer to your school.

260
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,939
You won’t feel lonely and there are people to take care of you here.

261
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,902
One more thing, I need you to take care of grandpa for me.

262
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:58,459
You want Inn to take care of me?

263
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:02,205
It’s more likely that I’m the one who takes care of her.

264
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,379
So what is it?

265
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,059
What do you mean?

266
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,739
About you and Inn like the same guy.

267
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,512
Does your grandfather know about that?

268
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:44,179
You need to stop talking nonsense.

269
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,739
Otherwise, I’ll have my grandpa fire you.

270
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,139
You’re just an employee. Don’t forget it.

271
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,499
If you keep being nosy about your boss’s business, you might lose your job.

272
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:01,408
I’m not a kind or soft-hearted person.

273
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:02,779
Do you want to get a taste of it?

274
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:28,779
Hello, Dr. Namcha.

275
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:30,779
Hello.

276
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,059
Is Action sick again?

277
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:40,968
No, he’s here for a health checkup today.

278
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:45,019
Dr. Namcha, you look so handsome today.

279
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,094
Rat. That’s a rat.

280
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,499
It’s not a rat. It’s a sugar glider.

281
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,478
It’s similar to a squirrel.

282
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:01,819
Sugar glider?

283
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:11,539
Oh, it looks kind of cute.

284
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,259
If you think it’s cute, do you want to try feeding it?

285
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:22,259
If you want to try it, I can teach you.

286
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,859
Yes, I want to try it.

287
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:41,339
How do I look? Do I look pretty, baby?

288
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:46,699
You are so sweet. I always look pretty.

289
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,727
This is the food.

290
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,459
You can feed it one by one. It doesn’t eat that much.

291
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:05,939
I’m so excited. I’ve never fed a squirrel before.

292
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:09,798
Please try it.

293
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:17,448
Those are worms.

294
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,575
Give it a try.

295
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,278
No.

296
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,339
I don’t think so.

297
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,979
What are you afraid of?

298
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:32,809
Worms are food for many animals

299
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:36,985
such as birds, fish, frogs, or some insects.

300
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,602
They contain high protein.

301
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:40,739
If you buy them, you can store them for a month.

302
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:48,899
So why doesn’t the squirrel eat fruits instead of eating worms?

303
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:54,682
Because some animals need different kinds of nutrients just like humans.

304
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:57,539
If you want to raise an animal, you need to

305
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,865
study what they like or don’t like to eat.

306
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,739
You can’t raise animals without knowing anything.

307
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:04,594
Do you want to try it?

308
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,386
Please sit here and wait for a while.

309
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,179
You can go in when I finish feeding it.

310
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:30,897
There’s no worm in this room, isn’t it?

311
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:32,776
No.

312
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,737
Okay, that’s wonderful. Thank you.

313
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:42,379
So handsome. So cute.

314
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,201
I want to be his wife.

315
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:15,019
Why did you tell me to drive here? This is not your condo.

316
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:18,481
Do you think I would let a stranger drive me to my condo?

317
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,859
I guess you don’t know me that well.

318
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,619
Please open the door. I need to get my suitcase.

319
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:37,779
You don’t need to follow me inside.

320
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,828
I’ll wait to give you a ride to your condo.

321
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:40,819
That’s okay.

322
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,181
Don’t waste your time because I won’t ride with you anyway.

323
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:03,179
Please wait a moment.

324
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,339
Please take care of this.

325
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:09,922
Why didn’t you tell me that you’re coming?

326
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:14,029
I also have my share in this café. I can come whenever I want.

327
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,792
Why did you bring a suitcase with you?

328
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:16,743
My car broke down.

329
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,299
Where?

330
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,659
It’s nothing. I already took care of it.

331
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:25,299
I stopped by here in hope that someone will give me a ride.

332
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,666
Don’t you see that the café is packed with customers?

333
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,164
I see it.

334
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:32,582
Can’t I just stop by to chit-chat with you because I miss you?

335
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,379
Sure, then take a seat. Why are you still standing?

336
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,860
How are you doing?

337
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:46,859
I’m busy because I’m working on increasing the sales of the publisher.

338
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:51,899
Don’t be too stressed out, otherwise, your PTSD can get worse.

339
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:57,219
Did it already get worse?

340
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,219
I had some nightmares.

341
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,419
Did you go to see the doctor?

342
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:06,678
It’s okay. It will get better.

343
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:10,899
I don’t want your condition to be like back then.

344
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:14,899
I know. I’m still doing fine. Don’t worry.

345
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,699
What’s up, Tan?

346
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,699
Do you want me to deliver you a coffee?

347
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:30,653
This is the bill for today.

348
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,902
The bill is 3,150 baht. It’s 1,150 baht short.

349
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:51,299
I won’t pay it because you lied to me.

350
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,657
So you need to take responsibility for the rest of the bill.

351
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:56,690
What did I lie to you?

352
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,205
You said that Dr. Cha doesn’t have a girlfriend.

353
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:02,059
He doesn’t have a girlfriend.

354
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:05,859
Then who was the woman that left with him the other day?

355
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:07,859
The other day?

356
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:11,828
Oh, that woman.

357
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,696
I think she’s Dr. Namtan’s friend.

358
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:17,299
I’d never seen her visit here before.

359
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:20,859
She’s definitely not Dr. Namcha’s girlfriend.

360
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,859
Are you sure?

361
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:25,339
Absolutely.

362
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:33,259
Your answer is very satisfying. Keep the change.

363
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,900
You need to wait about two hours for the blood test result.

364
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Great.

365
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:47,755
While I’m waiting, do you want to grab a drink with me?

366
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:54,804
What is Irin doing at your café?

367
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:57,779
I’m on my shift. I can’t go.

368
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,140
So? Can you go with me?

369
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,859
Sure but I can’t stay for long.

370
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:07,960
It’s okay. No problem.

371
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,699
I’ll have Action stay here.

372
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,339
I’m thinking about seven years ago

373
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,979
when your PTSD was so bad that

374
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:17,979
you couldn’t drive and needed to see a doctor.

375
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,899
It won’t get that bad, will it?

376
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:24,285
No, I’m much better now.

377
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,779
I can drive by myself though I still have nightmares sometimes.

378
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,779
But it’s much better.

379
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:33,954
That’s good.

380
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,139
All your friends were worried about you back then.

381
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:40,139
I don’t want to be like that again either.

382
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:43,263
I don’t want old things to come back into my life.

383
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:47,819
Am I considered one of the old things in your life?

384
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:54,740
Cha, did you come to pick up Tan’s coffee?

385
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,539
Yes, I also stop by to drink coffee as well.

386
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,499
Why are you here alone?

387
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,065
I thought you were with someone else.

388
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,420
Cha, have a seat.

389
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,379
Thank you.

390
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,023
Cha, do you want to have your usual drink?

391
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:19,259
Yes.

392
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,407
What about you?

393
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:23,777
Can I see the menu first?

394
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,099
Yes.

395
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:30,099
Cha, I’ll get your coffee.

396
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,099
I’ll be right back, Irin.

397
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:37,524
Hello, sis.

398
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:41,182
Did I introduce myself last time?

399
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:45,924
I’m Ployjan. You can call me Ploy.

400
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:50,419
Do I need to know you?

401
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:55,499
Sis, you didn’t properly introduce yourself the last time.

402
00:33:55,499 --> 00:34:00,037
So I misunderstood that you were Dr. Cha’s girlfriend.

403
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:06,699
But Dr. Cha said that you are just his senior at school.

404
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:12,220
From the collagen level on your face, I guess you are much older than him.

405
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,210
Are you already in your 30’s?

406
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:18,460
Your senior?

407
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,859
It’s true, isn’t it?

408
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,897
Yes. I know Cha well, so well.

409
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,900
Cha is a junior that I’ve seen since he was young.

410
00:34:31,484 --> 00:34:38,019
Do you remember that you used to run naked in the garden when you were young?

411
00:34:40,115 --> 00:34:43,810
Do you want me to tell you about his childhood stories?

412
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,111
Cha used to run naked…

413
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:47,111
Don’t.

414
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:48,934
It’s nothing.

415
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,934
Stop talking.

416
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:55,614
We are always playing like this. You don’t have to be surprised.

417
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:57,220
We are close.

418
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,979
You are playing together like siblings, aren’t you?

419
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,979
Yes, like siblings.

420
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:14,659
Dr. Cha, next time we should go to another café

421
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,677
where we can have a private conversation.

422
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:18,050
Why do we have to come here?

423
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,008
It’s full of old people talking about the past here.

424
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:26,539
But Cha likes to talk about old things.

425
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:30,011
Am I right, Cha?

426
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,417
Umm…

427
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,714
Yes.

428
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:38,780
See?

429
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:44,746
I have to go now. Tan is waiting for me.

430
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,491
How did you get here?

431
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,250
He came with me.

432
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,309
Let’s go.  We should hurry back

433
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:54,137
Next time, we should go to a café with just the two of us.

434
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:57,299
Can I go with you? I want to go see Tan.

435
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,379
No.

436
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:03,379
Sure, you can.

437
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:06,099
Ployjan is very generous.

438
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,299
Of course.

439
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,280
I’ll visit you again later.

440
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,939
Sure.

441
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,736
This is Tan’s coffee.

442
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:24,659
Thank you.

443
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:33,202
Ploy.

444
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:35,059
Please take the suitcase with you.

445
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:38,419
Good luck.

446
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,859
What?

447
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,822
It’s exactly what I’ve thought.

448
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,822
What are you doing? Someone may see us.

449
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,779
Did you come back from giving Irin a ride?

450
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,339
I didn’t give her a ride to the condo.

451
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:15,459
Why?

452
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,419
She told me to give her a ride to a café.

453
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,419
It seemed like she had an appointment with someone else.

454
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,419
An appointment?

455
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:26,797
With whom?

456
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:28,859
Why don’t you guess?

457
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,699
I don’t know much about her friends.

458
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,779
But this is someone you know.

459
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,459
Namcha?

460
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,299
If you’ve been heartbroken before, drink!

461
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:06,139
You two have so many secrets.

462
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,379
I’ll be right back.

463
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:18,779
Watch your path.

464
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:23,909
Who did you think about?

465
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:26,779
Why do I have to tell you?

466
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:02,099
You’re so cute.

467
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:05,419
I have a favor to ask you.

468
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:06,856
What is it?

469
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:08,139
I like Namcha.

470
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:15,259
No older sister dares to steal the guy that her baby sister likes.

471
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,981
If I get to marry Irin,

472
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:20,460
you are the one who will benefit the most from it.

473
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,619
I saw Irin went out with Jin.

474
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:29,059
You know that my grandpa wants Irin to marry Jin.

475
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:32,242
You did your best.

476
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:34,242
You need to accept the result.

477
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,046
One lesson you will learn to becoming an adult

478
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:41,459
is learning to accept the reality
