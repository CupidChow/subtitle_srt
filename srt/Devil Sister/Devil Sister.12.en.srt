1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,610
Does anyone here ever even care about me?

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,143
You were off together all happy and content.

3
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:07,870
Did you even think about me?

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,580
Then you can both choke to death on your happiness!

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,610
Don’t worry.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,010
Everything will turn out alright.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,770
Do you like me?

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,030
Yes, I like you.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,610
For the longest time.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,010
Are you happy now?

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,410
Then stop liking me.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,970
It’s impossible between us.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,610
What do you think you’re doing speaking to my granddaughter that way?

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,170
What do you mean?

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,710
Grandpa, I think...

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,660
You are dating my granddaughter.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,610
Then how could you say that to Inn?

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,010
I’m not dating Inn.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,500
But...

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,810
If you two have problems, you should talk about them later.

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Don’t you see that Inn is seriously injured?

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,610
You should leave.

23
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,420
You can’t leave yet.

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,370
What did you mean by what you just said?

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,570
I’m not dating Inn. We’re just friends.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,890
There’s no way that I will date her.

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,640
What about what you told me last time?

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,730
What I said to you last time, I was talking about...

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,810
I think we should let Inn rest. She doesn’t look okay.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,810
Inn, is it true, what Namcha just said?

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,210
Is it true?

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,500
Grandpa, I’m begging you.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,530
Please stop talking about it for now.

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,810
Please go home.

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,590
I have something I need to tell you.

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,170
I don’t want any further misunderstandings.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,610
I...

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,810
Get out!

39
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,210
Get out, all of you!

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,500
Otherwise, I’ll kill myself.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,410
Get out!

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,970
I think we should leave.

43
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,770
I hope you understand what I said.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,010
Inn told me that she was dating Namcha.

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,410
How come things turn out like this?

53
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,970
I don’t know either.

54
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,370
Kids these days are like this.

55
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,260
Their relationship is always on-and-off.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,700
If something upsets them, they usually make a big deal out of it.

57
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,550
They aren’t patient.

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,550
You don’t need to worry about it.

59
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,370
I think they will make up in a few days.

60
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,170
Inn is still hospitalized.

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,330
This is not okay.

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,210
How can she date someone unreliable?

63
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,010
How did his family raise him?

64
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,400
Why did he grow up and become like this?

65
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,810
I guess he doesn’t take his work seriously as well.

66
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,810
I think so.

67
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,610
It’s a relief that he was not my grandson.

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,240
Stay away from this kind of man.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,880
He’s not diligent and also gets other people off the track.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,010
Tell Inn to stop seeing him.

71
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,960
Why did you tell him that?

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
Tell him what?

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
About Namcha.

74
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,210
You shouldn’t say things that mislead my grandpa about him.

75
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,010
I think I didn’t say anything that is not true.

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,216
I saw you are working hard for the company

77
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:11,970
but he seems to be playing around.

78
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,120
I’m not even sure if he is still working.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,230
To be honest, I think he’s not the right man for you.

80
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,810
Thank you for your advice.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,610
But I think you should mind your own business.

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,570
Why are you smiling?

83
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,970
What is so funny about what I said?

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,170
I think Inn is right about you and Namcha.

85
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,570
What do you mean?

86
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,361
I just wanted to see

87
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:52,770
if you would be upset if I talked negatively about Namcha.

88
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,690
This is what I saw.

89
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,770
You know that people usually protect what they love.

90
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,570
But I’m not someone who gives up easily.

91
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,210
I’m going to prove to you how sincere I am to you.

92
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,770
Sincere?

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,970
Those who are sincere don’t talk behind other people’s backs like this.

94
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,010
I don’t know what kind of things you said to other people about me.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,810
Twisting things from wrong to right or right to wrong.

96
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,610
I guess this is what people in your occupation are trained to do.

97
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,000
Don’t call the truth a gossip.

98
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,370
If what I said is untrue, it’s your job to prove it to others.

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,010
That’s unfair.

100
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,293
Someone says bad things about me

101
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:03,610
but I’m the one who has to prove that it’s untrue.

102
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:09,570
What about the person who bad-mouths me and damages my reputation?

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,970
What kind of responsibility does he take?

104
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,014
I wouldn’t feel anything if those words

105
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:22,810
came from a jealous or competitive child.

106
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,613
Instead, they came out of the mouth of

107
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,925
a man who has claimed to be an adult.

108
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,170
I think you can no longer call me a child.

109
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,850
I never thought that you would want to

110
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,430
defeat me so much that you took the low road.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,410
That’s enough.

112
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,780
You should leave.

113
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,970
That’s too many problems already.

114
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,660
But I need to talk to you.

115
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,570
But I have nothing to say to you.

116
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,970
But I have.

117
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,610
You can’t force Irin to do what you want.

118
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,600
Do you want me to say it here?

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,810
Say it in front of other people.

120
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,370
Or should I say it when your grandfather is present?

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,010
Cha, I’m begging you.

122
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,570
Then come with me to talk.

123
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,240
You don’t need to go anyway. I’ll get you out of here.

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,630
You have gone through many stressful things today.

125
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,170
You don’t need to listen to him.

126
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,370
I need to talk to him.

127
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,570
What?

128
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,210
I was so worried about you.

129
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,770
Cha, let me go.

130
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,410
You must feel terrible.

131
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,810
Cha, let me go.

132
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,770
It’s alright. I’m here for you.

133
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,570
No matter how hard you try to get rid of me or run away from me,

134
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,210
I’ll always be by your side.

135
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,210
So stop blaming yourself.

136
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,770
It wasn’t your fault.

137
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,240
Help me.

138
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,210
Help me.

139
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,770
I’m in here. Anyone, please help me.

140
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,420
Help me.

141
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,010
She always pretended to be sick.

142
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,740
She kept making excuses to avoid working on group homework.

143
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,004
If she keeps taking advantage of others like this,

144
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,513
she should change to homeschooling.

145
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,170
Are you alright?

146
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,210
Don’t cry.

147
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,370
Are you going to eat it all by yourself?

148
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,010
I thought you like to do things and go anywhere alone.

149
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,970
Next time, don’t go anywhere alone.

150
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,320
Then who should I go with?

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,010
No one wants to be my friend.

152
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,970
Then don’t go anywhere without me. Okay?

153
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,410
Good.

154
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,450
Try it.

155
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,370
You’re so stingy.

156
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,379
- Give me some more. - Stop taking my snack.

157
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,780
Why did you come home so early? I thought you had a tutorial class today.

158
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,050
I feel a bit unwell.

159
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,610
Are you alright?

160
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,000
I’m alright.

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,060
Did mom and dad know?

162
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,810
I don’t think we need to tell them. I’m feeling much better now.

163
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,370
Hello, Irin.

164
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,170
Do you remember Namcha? He lives next door to us.

165
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,570
Namcha?

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,310
You’ve grown up so abundant that I can’t recognize you.

167
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,850
I haven’t seen you for years.

168
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,250
I was studying overseas as an exchange student.

169
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,570
I remember that Tan told me about it.

170
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,970
But I always remember you.

171
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,720
Alright. Then I won’t bother you anymore.

172
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,610
Okay.

173
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,800
Does Irin have a boyfriend?

174
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,910
I don’t think so. I’ve never seen her like any guy.

175
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,410
Why did you ask?

176
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,570
Nothing.

177
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,570
How are you feeling?

178
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,800
I was shocked after Irin told me that you are admitted to the hospital.

179
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,170
Why did you two come together?

180
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,860
He wants to visit you. So I gave him a ride.

181
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,370
How did he know that I’m in the hospital?

182
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,770
Where did you two meet?

183
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,410
He went to see you at our house.

184
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,610
Your IV drip is almost empty. I’ll go tell the nurse.

185
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,010
I’ll let you two talk.

186
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,220
What happened? Why did you end up in the hospital?

187
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,370
My condition suddenly got worse.

188
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,010
Where were you yesterday? I tried to call you but I couldn’t reach you.

189
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,440
Are you feeling better?

190
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,210
I think I will be discharged tomorrow.

191
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,610
That’s good.

192
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,010
Why? What do you want to say?

193
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:17,970
I have a favor to ask you.

194
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,370
What is it?

195
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,730
It’s about Irin.

196
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,370
Why? Did Irin do something bad to you?

197
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,160
It’s not like that.

198
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,210
Then what is it?

199
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,010
I like Irin.

200
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,970
I want you to help me so I can date her.

201
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,070
Then why are you...

202
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,140
I have had a crush on her for a long time since I was young.

203
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,970
The more I get to know her, the cuter I think she is.

204
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,770
Can you help me?

205
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,370
Can you give this to Irin?

206
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,130
Why don’t you give it to her yourself?

207
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,010
Please help me and give this to her.

208
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,170
Irin, this is from Namcha.

209
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
Thanks.

210
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:19,210
Do I have to be dead to get your attention, Namcha?

211
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,810
What are you doing?

212
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,120
What are you doing, Inn?

213
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,210
I should have died.

214
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,440
When will you stop hurting yourself?

215
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,570
Your condition isn’t bad enough?

216
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:28,770
Why should I live? No one wants me to live.

217
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,410
I do.

218
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,210
I won’t let you go anywhere.

219
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,100
I’ve always been defeated all my life.

220
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,410
I don’t want to lose anymore.

221
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,610
Trust me.

222
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,410
I’ll help you win.

223
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,610
I have never lost in my entire life.

224
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,010
I can’t do this.

225
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,810
You know that Inn...

226
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,010
I can’t hurt her feelings.

227
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,570
What about my feelings?

228
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,210
Don’t you care about me?

229
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,570
I’m sorry.

230
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,610
Even though you run away from me like the last time,

231
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,010
it doesn’t mean Inn will get what she wants.

232
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,220
It’s true that Inn will feel hurt.

233
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,010
But it’s not my fault that I don’t love her.

234
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,570
It’s neither your fault.

235
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,970
Inn is an adult.

236
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,610
She needs to find her own way to be happy.

237
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,410
She shouldn’t expect other people to sacrifice themselves for her happiness.

238
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,970
You also have the right to be happy.

239
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,620
I will never let you run away again.

240
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,410
What happened?

241
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,370
Let’s go talk outside.

242
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,320
Suicide?

243
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,930
Yes.

244
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,770
Luckily, I found her in time. So nothing bad happened.

245
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,380
Don’t worry.

246
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,070
The nurse has dressed her wound.

247
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,010
I also told the hospital to send a psychologist to see her.

248
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,220
I feel bad for Inn.

249
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,396
How hopeless she must have felt

250
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:49,210
to decide to hurt herself to make people aware of her existence?

251
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,770
I feel sorry for her.

252
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,130
Did Inn say that to you?

253
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,810
Yes.

254
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,570
Her mental is very weak right now.

255
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,770
I’m worried that she might attempt to do it again.

256
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,410
We might not be lucky like this time.

257
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,810
It’s true that Inn will feel hurt.

258
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,610
But it’s not my fault that I don’t love her.

259
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,010
It’s neither your fault.

260
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,370
Inn is an adult.

261
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,010
She needs to find her own way to be happy.

262
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,691
She shouldn’t expect other people to sacrifice themselves for her happiness.

263
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,570
You also have the right to be happy.

264
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,610
Why do things have to turn out this way?

265
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,170
Why?

266
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,760
What should I do?

267
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,610
Let’s go!

268
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,610
Are you crazy?

269
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,120
You cannot ride motorcycles on this road.

270
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,460
Don’t think about running away.

271
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,220
I’ll call the police to arrest you.

272
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,170
There are many CCTV cameras around here.

273
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,530
Are you alright?

274
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,100
Why did you do that?

275
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,220
If you jumped like that, you would get hurt.

276
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,380
Are you alright?

277
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,460
I’m alright.

278
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,830
How would you be alright?

279
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,970
This is the real world, not fiction. You shouldn’t play the hero here.

280
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,100
I already got hurt. Do you need to scold me too?

281
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,830
Yes. How could you do that without thinking?

282
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,240
There are many other ways to help me.

283
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,170
It’s the media’s fault. They present the wrong way to help people.

284
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,860
Don’t do anything like this again. It’s very dangerous.

285
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,980
Do you hear me?

286
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,380
Why are you laughing?

287
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,670
If it was other girls, they would have thanked me for it.

288
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,280
But you...

289
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,930
What do you mean?

290
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,690
Are you criticizing me? Why are you so rude to me?

291
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,770
You are very cute.

292
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,970
Cute? I’m seven years older than you.

293
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,570
I think you should go see a doctor and take a look at your wound.

294
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,570
I’m alright. I’ll be fine because you are treating my wound.

295
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,570
You’re talking nonsense.

296
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,370
I mean it.

297
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,997
We are living next door

298
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:50,370
but we don’t have many chances to talk to each other.

299
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,770
Does it matter?

300
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,570
I want to get to know you better.

301
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,060
Cha, why didn’t you call and tell me that you would come to see me?

302
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,970
I...

303
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,170
What happened to your arm?

304
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,770
Does it hurt?

305
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,210
Irin.

306
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,730
Cha.

307
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,980
What a coincidence?

308
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,930
Can I join you?

309
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,570
Sure.

310
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,650
How is it?

311
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,020
Irin.

312
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,570
Irin, can I ride with you?

313
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,510
Cha, did you get the tickets?

314
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,570
Yes.

315
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,100
Why did you book seats in the front row?

316
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,000
Do you want to taste it?

317
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,250
(Irin)

318
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,770
I won’t let you run away from me again.

319
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,170
I’ll fix this problem myself.

320
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,570
She’s so stupid.

321
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,580
Why did she hurt herself for a guy like him?

322
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,470
I think Inn is pitiful.

323
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,930
She’s pathetic.

324
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,340
I have only one granddaughter and she is acting like this.

325
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,970
How would I trust her to run the company?

326
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,920
Only granddaughter?

327
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,770
What do you mean?

328
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,970
Nothing. I said it wrong.

329
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,780
What did he say?

330
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,570
I’m not sure if Namcha knows about it.

331
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,570
Good. That’s good.

332
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,170
Don’t let him know what Inn did.

333
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,050
But I think he should know what kind of impact his action caused.

334
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,460
Do you want my family to feel embarrassed?

335
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,170
Do you want other people to know what my granddaughter did?

336
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,570
Alright.

337
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,170
Are you going to visit Inn at the hospital today?

338
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,500
No. I would be upset if I went.

339
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,170
She has a psychiatrist taking care of her.

340
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,200
Yes.

341
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,570
Hello.

342
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,490
Irin, are you still at the hospital?

343
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,570
No, I’m at the office now.

344
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,470
Today, I have a meeting about a new project.

345
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,380
Did you get any sleep?

346
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,770
What’s going on?

347
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,370
I thought that you were still at the hospital.

348
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,770
So I thought I would go and pick you up.

349
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,250
I thought you didn’t get much sleep. I didn’t want you to drive.

350
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,970
If you are not busy today, can you go and take care of Inn for me?

351
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,770
I don’t want to leave her alone at the hospital.

352
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,370
Sure, I’ll take good care of her. Don’t worry.

353
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,570
Thank you.

354
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,970
Irin.

355
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,800
Yes.

356
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,680
Please take care of yourself.

357
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,600
I don’t want to see you feel too stressed.

358
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,910
Thank you.

359
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,370
I have to go to work now. I’m hanging up.

360
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,770
Alright.

361
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,440
Please take care of yourself.

362
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,970
I don’t want to see you feel too stressed.

363
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,970
How did you get in?

364
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,210
I opened the door and walked in.

365
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,170
Do you want me to call the police and have you arrested for trespassing?

366
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,970
Call the police? But this is not your house.

367
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,570
One more thing, I always come to this house.

368
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,970
No one seems to have a problem with it.

369
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,770
I think you are the problem here.

370
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,819
I’m pretty sure that

371
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:23,970
I have never caused problems to anyone like you did.

372
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,020
Really?

373
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,970
Then what did you say to Irin last night?

374
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,890
Suicide?

375
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,530
Yes.

376
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,370
Luckily, I found her in time. So nothing bad happened.

377
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,180
Don’t worry.

378
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,800
The nurse has dressed her wound.

379
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,970
I feel bad for Inn.

380
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,770
Her mental is very weak right now.

381
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,570
I’m worried that she might attempt to do it again.

382
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,370
We might not be lucky like this time.

383
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,208
You said all those things to stress her out

384
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,570
so she would end her relationship with me.

385
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,970
But today you said you are worried about her.

386
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,030
You also act like this when you are with her grandfather.

387
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,840
When you are with him, you pretend to be a gentleman.

388
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,370
But you talked negatively about me behind my back.

389
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,720
I guess you are acting like this with everyone.

390
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,770
You are acting like a chameleon that keeps changing its colors.

391
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,920
Your words keep changing when you are with different people.

392
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,330
I think you have too much prejudice against me.

393
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,370
Only children would act so petty like this.

394
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,170
Even if you tell anyone about it, no one will listen to you.

395
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,570
Really?

396
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,170
I’m not surprised that you would deny it.

397
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,959
But I believe that whether it’s a big or small deal,

398
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:57,570
people will use the same mindset to judge it.

399
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,859
I’ll wait for the day when the things that you did

400
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:03,570
will turn into big problems.

401
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,970
I don’t think that day would ever arrive.

402
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,890
I think you should be the one who needs to be careful.

403
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,970
What you did might turn into a big problem.

404
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,770
What are you doing here?

405
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,370
I’m asking you what you are doing here.

406
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,380
I came to see you.

407
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,329
Has no one taught you that you need to make an appointment

408
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:30,520
before going to see someone?

409
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,570
It’s rude to not do so.

410
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,820
I have the truth that I need to explain to you.

411
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,720
You should spend your time talking to me to do your work.

412
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,170
It’s almost time for your shift, isn’t it?

413
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:49,170
Is your father okay that his only son doesn’t show up at work?

414
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:57,570
You told me that I should respect and follow the tradition.

415
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,610
So I’m here to tell you what I think you should know.

416
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,570
I didn’t know what kind of person you are

417
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,970
I hate a loser like you.

418
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,810
Whatever.

419
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,970
Since you weren’t dating Inn, I don’t want to have anything to do with you.

420
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,300
You should stay in your place and away from my granddaughters.

421
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,300
If your family didn’t teach you about this, I would do it myself.

422
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,370
A fresh graduate should pay attention to their work to secure their job.

423
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,570
They shouldn’t pay attention to nonsense stuff like you.

424
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,170
Stop getting other people off their track.

425
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,170
But I think some adults are not much better than me.

426
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,345
He falls for other people’s words

427
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,270
and believes that I’m like what he’s heard.

428
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,450
Namcha!

429
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,770
I’ll take you to your workroom.

430
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,570
A kid like him might not understand what you said.

431
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,970
This is such a waste of time.

432
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,970
Grandpa, please wait and see.

433
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,770
I’ll prove to you that I’m different from what he has told you.

434
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,300
Hey, baby.

435
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,770
What are you looking at?

436
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,570
I’ll give you all the details and advice you need.

437
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,020
Sure.

438
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,555
PJ Professional Dog Training

439
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,935
will provide training both at home and at our facility.

440
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,330
(Your brother is meeting with a girl.)

441
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,570
Hello, Irin. What’s up?

442
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,100
Are you calling to scold me about my brother?

443
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,380
No, it’s not about that.

444
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,370
Did you talk to Cha about the woman?

445
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,570
Yes.

446
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,970
What did he say?

447
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,970
Um...do you want to talk to him? He’s here with me.

448
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,970
What?

449
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,770
Sis.

450
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,360
Take a look at this.

451
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,440
This is the project I want to do with our hospital.

452
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,650
How can you be sure that it will work?

453
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,640
I’ll do everything I can to make it work.

454
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,330
So people would stop calling me an incompetent kid.

455
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,510
Irin wants to launch the book and make it the talk of the town.

456
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,980
I’m sorry for being late.

457
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,330
I won’t risk my company with a kid like him.

458
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,374
If you hate me that much,

459
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:29,970
you should speed up your recovery and compete with me.

460
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:37,170
If you can beat me, I will give you whatever you want.

461
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,930
Don’t forget your promise that you will give me anything.

462
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,570
You can cry as much as you want.

463
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,970
I’m here for you.

464
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,770
When you are with me, you can do whatever you can.

465
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,770
But please don’t run away from me.
