1
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,762
Irin is here!

2
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,294
Irin is here!

3
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,850
Grab the documents. Get ready for the meeting.

4
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,017
Oh, shoot.

5
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,017
Hurry!

6
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,447
Good morning, Miss Irin.

7
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,019
What's with all this procession?

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,525
Had there been burglars inside, they'd have stolen everything.

9
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,426
What are you all standing there for?

10
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:08,912
Get to work.

11
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:09,979
Yes, ma'am!

12
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:12,019
Hurry up.

13
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,820
What's that smell?

14
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,780
It's lavender, ma'am.

15
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,019
It's known to help relieve stress.

16
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,019
I don't like lavender.

17
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,251
You don't have to show up tomorrow.

18
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,979
You're fired.

19
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,437
Hey!

20
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,290
Pechaya "Min" Wattanamontree

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,890
Directed by Ekkasit Trakulkasemsuk and Pantip Vibultham

27
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,019
Action isn't quite well.

28
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,019
Poor baby.

29
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:37,237
Oh, Action gets sick a lot, doesn't she?

30
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,573
Right on Doc's schedule, no less.

31
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:42,525
Yeah, anyone can see right through her ruse.

32
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,751
Erm...

33
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,235
Is the doctor in?

34
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,235
Yes.

35
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,825
Hello, Miss Ployjan.

36
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,019
Is this the patient?

37
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:04,832
Erm, the name's Action.

38
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,000
Why are you in so early today, Doctor?

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,019
It's normally Dr. Namcha's shift at this time.

40
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:14,019
Oh, Dr. Namcha will be late today.

41
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:15,979
I'm covering for him.

42
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,019
Sorry. I've got a call.

43
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,434
Yes?

44
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,980
You'd like to visit the dogs at my farm?

45
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:33,665
Right now? Are you sure?

46
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,311
Of course.

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,604
Okay.

48
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:45,786
Love in Lavender Field is a forbidden love story between a man and a woman.

49
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,282
I gave you a week, and this is what you came up with?

50
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:52,842
Didn't you know our company doesn't publish love stories?

51
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:59,250
I think the audience that can increase our sales right now is fiction readers.

52
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,019
Fiction is currently popular online, too.

53
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:07,994
Romance fiction,

54
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,715
the thing that makes people delusional and nonsensical.

55
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:17,487
You want us, the publishing house known for documentary and history, to publish that?

56
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,979
Which part of your brain did you use to come up with that?

57
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,986
I think it's interesting.

58
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:27,325
We can open a minor publishing house to specialise in novels for young people.

59
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:29,448
It'd be a great opportunity for the new generation,

60
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,979
and we'll gain a new audience, too.

61
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,004
Don't forget why our grandfather built the Bannasorn Group.

62
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:43,208
Then, can you give us some ideas about what you want?

63
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,321
So our team can work based on that.

64
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,537
I pay you people to think for me.

65
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:52,490
If I have to do everything myself, why should I still hire you, then?

66
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,979
Wouldn't it be better if you all just quit?

67
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:01,976
The team still has some other ideas.

68
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,979
Will you hear them out, Irin?

69
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,364
If they're novels, this meeting is over.

70
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:11,979
This publishing house has no policy to intoxicate readers with such nonsense.

71
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,514
Doctor!

72
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:29,573
You're here, Doctor?

73
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,637
Sorry. I'm in a hurry right now. Can you hold this for me?

74
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:32,786
Sure thing.

75
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,580
What do you have here, though?

76
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,102
A snake. He was hit by a car.

77
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:38,411
Huh? Come again?

78
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,979
It's a snake.

79
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:43,536
Snake!

80
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,640
You take care of this one, Cha.

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,979
I'm not adept with reptiles.

82
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,019
But from the look of it,

83
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,008
I don't think there's much you can help him with.

84
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,979
I'll handle it.

85
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,201
It's alright now.

86
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:11,920
I'll save you.

87
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,008
Work with me, okay?

88
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:58,019
You're awake.

89
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:05,773
What happened?

90
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,580
You were screaming as if that snake was biting you.

91
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,478
Snake! That's right!

92
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,382
Dr. Cha is currently working to save him.

93
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,528
Save?

94
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:18,771
Why must he?

95
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,979
That's a snake!

96
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,518
What if that thing bit Dr. Cha and he died?

97
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:26,257
Dr. Cha is a vet.

98
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,312
It is his job to save all kinds of animals.

99
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:30,663
You were saying he might get bitten and die?

100
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,728
That's a corn snake. They're not venomous.

101
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,019
Got it?

102
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,979
The operation went well.

103
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,019
I think he'll make it.

104
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,825
Lucky for him only the bone in his lower part broke.

105
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,931
But we'll have to keep a close eye on him.

106
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,979
Well, are you feeling better now, Ployjan?

107
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,979
I am still very much startled.

108
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,019
I really must apologise.

109
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:02,019
I didn't think you'd be so scared that you passed out.

110
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:10,019
Don't tell me you had to carry me all the way over here?

111
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,616
I asked a staff member to do that.

112
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:19,979
But don't worry. Our staff is very strong.

113
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:35,745
I... I still feel a little dizzy.

114
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,745
My head hurts.

115
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,642
Are you okay?

116
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:42,832
No.

117
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,832
I'm not okay at all.

118
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,721
Very dizzy.

119
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:58,020
Hello.

120
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,979
Are you busy right now, Irin?

121
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:02,019
I'm sort of busy being fed up.

122
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,306
I need a favour.

123
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,623
What is it?

124
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,019
It's about my little brother.

125
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,266
You have a vaccination appointment tomorrow at 1PM.

126
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,266
Alright.

127
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:22,019
Help! My dog's been poisoned.

128
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:23,085
Poisoned?

129
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,574
Yes. It doesn't look good, either.

130
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:25,364
Come here.

131
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,733
Take him to the OR quickly.

132
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,037
- Yes.
 - Let's go.

133
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,195
This is an emergency case, right?

134
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:36,195
Yes.

135
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,019
I'll handle it.

136
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:42,019
Namcha, I think you should focus on the vaccination.

137
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,979
I've got this.

138
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,862
How could you greenlight it, Inn?

139
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,674
You know our readers don't read that kind of stuff.

140
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,758
You need to be sharper.

141
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,979
How can you become a good boss otherwise?

142
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,019
I'll handle this case.

143
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:02,019
A poison case like this is quite tricky.

144
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,515
After all, I am more experienced than you.

145
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,555
Get your act together, Inn.

146
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,865
You can't keep letting them have it easy.

147
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,837
Learn to be firm.

148
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,647
Do you even understand what I'm trying to tell you?

149
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,647
I may be a new graduate.

150
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:19,234
But I'm not inexperienced.

151
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,445
Come on now. Just trust me.

152
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,979
I've never given this hospital a bad name, have I?

153
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:28,678
I won't let this company fall while I'm running it.

154
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,000
Alright, then.

155
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,320
Wait, you brought the snake to your office?

156
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,742
Bold, aren't you?

157
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:18,019
I think he's all better now.

158
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,028
If he's better, then let him go home.

159
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:23,789
You don't have to act so disgusted, you know?

160
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:26,019
He's adorable.

161
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,019
I'm not disgusted. I just don't want to be near him.

162
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:32,908
He doesn't exactly look friendly.

163
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:39,979
Don't people love to judge something that is different from us?

164
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,980
Humans think we are...

165
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,019
better,

166
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:48,454
cooler,

167
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,979
than what isn't like us.

168
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,004
We act as if...

169
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:03,979
those different beings don't have a heart, or feelings.

170
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:10,019
I can't decide if I feel more sorry for him that he got hit by a car,

171
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:14,019
or that people despise him so much.

172
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,979
That's not what I meant.

173
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:23,691
Can you not take this so seriously?

174
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,019
I'm just scared of him is what I meant.

175
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,478
Then you don't need to worry.

176
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:31,979
I think he's more scared of you than you are of him.

177
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:37,004
Once he's well enough, I'll let him go.

178
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:39,979
Don't worry about that.

179
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,019
I already gave Action the vitamins she needed.

180
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,955
Thank you.

181
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,734
Dr. Cha, I have something I'd like to ask you.

182
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,148
Can I?

183
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,737
Sure.

184
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:12,802
There are many puppies at my farm that need to be vaccinated.

185
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:17,139
So I'd like to know if this hospital does home visits for these vaccine jabs?

186
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,139
We do.

187
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:22,019
I'll ask the staff to give you the details.

188
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:27,066
Doctor, wait.

189
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:35,994
I'd like to know if you'll be the one doing the home visit?

190
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,845
Dr. Cha doesn't do that kind of thing.

191
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:43,091
Because I don't allow it.

192
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,979
Irin, why are you here?

193
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:49,979
Who are you?

194
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:03,666
You want a piece of me?

195
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,979
I bite back, you know.

196
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:14,650
You're free to take your dog back.

197
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,979
And I will do the same with my man.

198
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,019
Dr. Cha is my man.

199
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:31,979
If you don't believe me, ask Dr. Cha if he really is.

200
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:35,979
No response.

201
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,897
That means yes.

202
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:42,602
Excuse us.

203
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,019
Let's go.

204
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,194
What?

205
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:52,690
Who's that?

206
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,503
You're jealous.

207
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,954
I am way older than you.

208
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,954
Show me proper respect.

209
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,979
You're totally jealous.

210
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,019
Don't be so full of yourself.

211
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:19,979
I am not anything like that.

212
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,979
If you're not, why did you do that?

213
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:26,922
Tan asked me to.

214
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,922
She doesn't like that woman.

215
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:31,454
You're too naive for a girl like her.

216
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:33,105
She's a tool.

217
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,105
Stay away from her.

218
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,795
Don't you dare scare me with that.

219
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,979
I'm not lying.

220
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:15,979
Well, since you're here, let's grab lunch.

221
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:18,619
Aren't you working?

222
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,681
We're not too busy today.

223
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,794
There are only vaccine appointments anyway.

224
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,794
Any doctor can do that.

225
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,804
No.

226
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,019
I've already got plans with your sister.

227
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,506
No problem.

228
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,922
Just call her and cancel it.

229
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,979
I know you can do that.

230
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:39,979
Namcha. Don't get so chummy with me.

231
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,019
Let's go.

232
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,437
Cha.

233
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:46,844
Hmm?

234
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:47,979
Cha!

235
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm hungry.

236
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:55,979
I am so hungry, Irin.

237
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,019
Hurry up.

238
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,297
What a troublesome kid.

239
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:09,297
I knew I shouldn't have come see you.

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,019
I wanted to see you, though.

241
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,004
Just eat your lunch so we can get back to work.

242
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,303
And hold your tongue.

243
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:21,105
I don't want to work anymore.

244
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,505
Let's go to the cinema.

245
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,394
Are you insane?

246
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,918
It's still working hours.

247
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,918
Be mature for once.

248
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,019
If it is working hours,

249
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,204
how come you came to see me at the hospital?

250
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,979
Did something happen at work?

251
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,019
How did you know?

252
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,546
I can tell, of course.

253
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:45,819
I'm an adult.

254
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:49,232
And I just graduated with a First Honour degree, too.

255
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:52,799
Did you get to operate at all since you graduated?

256
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,979
Or all you do is take vaccination cases?

257
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,019
Did Tan tell you that?

258
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:07,979
I was just teasing.

259
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,019
I'm tired of being treated like a completely clueless kid.

260
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Let's break up.

261
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,217
You're too young to understand what life is like for adults.

262
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:27,979
I'm tired of you treating me like a completely clueless kid.

263
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,019
I'm graduating from college.

264
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,979
You're only a high schooler.

265
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,574
You have a whole life ahead of you.

266
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,339
You'll go through a lot more things.

267
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,395
And?

268
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:41,200
What does that matter when you're the only one I like?

269
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:47,979
See?

270
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,979
This is exactly something a kid would say.

271
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:53,979
One day you'll grow up.

272
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:58,019
And when that day comes, you won't even remember anything about us.

273
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,019
What if I never change my mind when that day comes?

274
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,979
Why are you looking at me like that?

275
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,019
Nothing.

276
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,019
You're not even listening to me.

277
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,765
I am.

278
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:23,611
I was just thinking that it's not a bad thing to be treated like a kid.

279
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,019
If it were me, I'd be happy with that.

280
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,106
Why?

281
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,346
Isn't it nice?

282
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,522
You don't have to give up something for someone.

283
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,896
When you make a mistake, they let you off easily because you're young.

284
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,019
And there is no responsibility.

285
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,005
I envy that.

286
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:46,019
Let's order some ice cream.

287
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,588
This place has your favourite flavour, rum raisins.

288
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,420
You remember that?

289
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,773
How could I not?

290
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,645
There's not many people who like that flavour...

291
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,019
'Cause it tastes like glue.

292
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,730
Still better than your favourite, mint chocolate.

293
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,365
It tastes like toothpaste.

294
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,019
We should meet more often.

295
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,705
Cha is just having lunch with me.

296
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,414
Oh, just that.

297
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:30,019
You two disappeared together so I got worried.

298
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,736
I'll drop him off back there soon.

299
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:34,515
I'm a busy woman myself, you know.

300
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,408
So I won't let him lounge around, either.

301
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,893
Good to hear, then.

302
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,696
I don't want him building a bad reputation around here.

303
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:44,271
My uncle already barely trusts him with anything.

304
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:49,178
He thinks Cha isn't qualified to take over this hospital from Dad.

305
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:52,005
So I want him to be on his best behaviour.

306
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,542
Is that why you asked me to get rid of that woman so she doesn't distract him?

307
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,603
Correct.

308
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,979
I want him to focus on work right now.

309
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:04,620
If there's a rumour about him and a customer reaching my uncle or dad,

310
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,019
it'll be a disaster.

311
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:07,924
Not only a disaster for them.

312
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:10,019
For your brother complex, too, I'm sure.

313
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:12,743
I'll admit that.

314
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:16,214
That's why I only trust you to do this for me.

315
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,019
Sure.

316
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,454
Oh, I'm hanging up.

317
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,019
I'll take him back now.

318
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:24,662
Who was that?

319
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,780
Just work. It's time to go.

320
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,979
Here.

321
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,715
I just bought the tickets.

322
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,977
Let's watch a movie.

323
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,977
You said you were going to the toilet.

324
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,970
Here.

325
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,019
I said no movies.

326
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,597
Why are you acting like we've never done this before?

327
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:45,681
We watched loads of movies together when we were dating.

328
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,343
Don't ever bring that up.

329
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:49,254
It's long gone.

330
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,075
Why can't I?

331
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,697
You were keeping it a secret back then, too.

332
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:56,977
It's been many years since then, and I still can't talk about it?

333
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,208
I don't understand you at all.

334
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,804
It's not even a big deal.

335
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,133
It doesn't matter how long it's been. We can't let anyone know.

336
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,133
Keep that in mind.

337
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,979
Get back to work.

338
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:23,979
You're mad at me, Irin.

339
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:27,948
I told you to respect me properly.

340
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,019
I'm seven years older, you know.

341
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,597
Yes, ma'am.

342
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,019
You're not gonna tell me off?

343
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:25,001
As long as nobody sees.

344
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:51,979
Do you want to get back together with Namcha?

345
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,979
Inn, when did you get in?

346
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:58,019
A while ago.

347
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:02,019
You were distracted with that photo album.

348
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:05,558
It just popped up when I was cleaning.

349
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:07,308
This is nothing.

350
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,851
Grandpa said it's time for dinner.

351
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,979
Inn.

352
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:18,019
Don't tell anyone about this.

353
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:20,722
I know that.

354
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:23,004
You've told me that since I was young.

355
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,979
Have you met him recently?

356
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:29,800
Who?

357
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,771
Namcha, of course.

358
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,019
Him? How could I meet him?

359
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,460
You know I'm staying at my apartment.

360
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,979
I only come home on weekends.

361
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:45,005
I've got my hand full with just trying to up the sales for our company.

362
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,542
That's good, then.

363
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:51,939
If you were home all the time, it would get really awkward for me.

364
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:54,019
His house is right next door,

365
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,002
and Namcha and I are friends.

366
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,019
Oh, Cha?

367
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:37,980
You're out jogging often lately.

368
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,191
Are you looking for something?

369
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,789
Oh, nothing.

370
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,019
What were you doing with Irin's car just now?

371
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:54,019
Just unloading some stuff.

372
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,979
I was just about to give you this.

373
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,019
What is it?

374
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,522
Well...

375
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,980
Is Irin home today?

376
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:19,951
Whose car is this?

377
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,019
It belongs to grandpa's lawyer.

378
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:29,004
I've also got something for your parents, too.

379
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,487
Why'd you hit me?

380
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:39,979
Pay attention.

381
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,866
Give me that. I'll give it to them.

382
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:45,028
No.

383
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:47,979
I'll hand it to them myself.

384
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,019
Up to you, then.

385
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,145
Let's go to your place.

386
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:56,145
Wait.

387
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:58,019
Shouldn't we have dinner first?

388
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:02,019
It's dinner time, isn't it?

389
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,183
You want to have dinner at my house?

390
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,155
Can I?

391
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,155
But I don't want it.

392
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:15,979
Give this to Irin, please.

393
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:19,327
This is why you called me out here in the dark of night?

394
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:20,977
Pretty please. Help me out.

395
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,093
We're friends, aren't we?

396
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,093
You have to hand it to her.

397
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,890
(Think of this guy as me. Take good care of him.)

398
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,605
Well, did Irin mention me at all today?

399
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,019
Why, did you just meet?

400
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:14,287
Just tell me if she talked about me.

401
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,968
No.

402
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:20,019
Why would she talk about you when she's about to get married?

403
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:21,979
What?

404
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:23,290
What did you just say?

405
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,979
Where's Inn gone?

406
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:29,979
She went to the Chaiwat's with Mr Namcha.

407
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:32,392
I thought she was going to have dinner with us.

408
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,755
Inn usually hangs out at their place.

409
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,714
Grandpa.

410
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:40,019
She doesn't seem to care about work as much as you.

411
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,019
Sit down.

412
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:51,685
How are you?

413
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,011
I'm the same as usual.

414
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:56,019
What about you? How was your trip to the hospital?

415
00:30:56,342 --> 00:31:00,795
Nothing new. Just aches here and pain there any old people have.

416
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:02,795
But it's nothing serious.

417
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,807
Inn said you wanted to see me.

418
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:09,979
Yes.

419
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,977
Take a seat.

420
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,657
I don't mind standing.

421
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:21,004
If I say take a seat, you take a seat.

422
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:23,044
Yes.

423
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,770
Maid.

424
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:27,532
Bring another set of cutlery for Jin.

425
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,979
Yes, sir.

426
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:33,404
Do you have a boyfriend now?

427
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:41,522
When would I have time for that?

428
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:44,019
Our company is as busy as it gets.

429
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,979
You know, with what's going on and stuff.

430
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,518
Don't be such a workaholic.

431
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,979
Aren't you thirty-something this year?

432
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,685
Grandpa!

433
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:53,601
I am only 31.

434
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,019
Women don't get married so early these days.

435
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,979
Those women don't have any visions.

436
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,872
You shouldn't be like them. What if something happened to you?

437
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,804
What would become of my company, then?

438
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,620
I've only got you.

439
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,800
You've got Inn.

440
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,171
What can she do?

441
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:10,782
She's too soft.

442
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,782
I never expect anything from her.

443
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,893
It's gotta be you.

444
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:20,019
Get married and have kids.

445
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:23,866
Grandpa, technology is advanced nowadays.

446
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:28,904
Women can freeze their eggs if they plan to have children when she's older.

447
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:29,776
In case it's...

448
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,943
Oh, don't trust "technology" so much.

449
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:35,271
I never trust any of it.

450
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:36,854
Remember this.

451
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,982
You should let things happen naturally.

452
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:40,800
But Grandpa...

453
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:44,019
You can use that tone with anyone else.

454
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,029
But don't you dare raise your voice at me!

455
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:48,019
This isn't the office.

456
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:49,979
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,004
Jin is a good man.

458
00:32:56,397 --> 00:33:00,019
He's looked after you and me for many years.

459
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:04,019
Our company runs smoothly thanks to Jin.

460
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,979
And he likes you.

461
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:12,019
I'm sure Jin will take good care of you.

462
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:19,236
What are you saying?

463
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:21,870
Tell me who Irin is marrying.

464
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,425
You're not gonna welcome your guest with a nice glass of water?

465
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,558
Tell me first.

466
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,019
But I'm thirsty!

467
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,019
Fine.

468
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:49,835
Irin is getting married to Jin, Grandpa's lawyer.

469
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,019
What?

470
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,000
Why'd you do that?

471
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,721
When did they even start dating?

472
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:00,019
I don't know.

473
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,022
Is he the guy who was at your house just now?

474
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:05,022
Yeah, I guess.

475
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,266
No way.

476
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:09,979
Irin doesn't want to get married.

477
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:13,525
It doesn't matter if she does. Grandpa wants her to.

478
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:15,525
She will never agree to it.

479
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:18,352
Irin may be fearless with everyone.

480
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:21,979
But this is grandpa's order. Nobody defies him.

481
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:32,019
Don't you have anything smaller?

482
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,397
Don't stay here, then.

483
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,020
Why don't you go change at home?

484
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,918
I don't want to go home right now.

485
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,285
I don't want someone barging in there throwing tantrums about Irin's marriage.

486
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:45,285
My family would be a mess.

487
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:47,330
Why would I do that?

488
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,979
It's useless.

489
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:51,754
I know, right?

490
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:53,979
You broke up 7-8 years ago.

491
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:56,019
Why would you care?

492
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,371
Are you done?

493
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,019
Go home.

494
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,445
What are you wearing?

495
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,979
It's Cha's.

496
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,019
Does it look bad on me?

497
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:29,241
Have a safe trip home.

498
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:32,019
Let's talk again later.

499
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,013
Of course.

500
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,730
I'll call you.

501
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,730
Sure.

502
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,980
Goodbye.

503
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,979
Looks like they get along well.

504
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,625
If there's something on your mind, you can talk to me.

505
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,026
Is this about love?

506
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:28,830
Am I too immature, Mom?

507
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:29,654
Irin.

508
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,247
You don't feel sorry for the dogs?

509
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:33,502
Dogs aren't that dumb.

510
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:38,019
There is this one dumb dog still waiting for you over here, though.

511
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:41,905
When will this stuff leave me alone?

512
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,303
Give me back my wallet.

513
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,209
You'll have to tear it off of me.

514
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:46,916
I'm not good with that.

515
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:47,863
Give it to me.

516
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:48,665
Give it.

517
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,979
Give it!

518
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:51,700
Where did Irin go?

519
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,485
She went to the office alone.

520
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:54,890
You happy now?

521
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,161
You fired me and you didn't even remember my face or name!

522
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:01,325
It's your fault for making me want to kill you.

523
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:03,155
Irin, where are you?

524
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:07,979
It's okay to kill someone that everyone hates.

525
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,610
Irin!
