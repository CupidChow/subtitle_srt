1
00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:02,668
You shouldn’t say things that mislead my grandpa about him.

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,214
He’s not the right man for you.

3
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,577
I wouldn’t feel anything

4
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:10,134
if those words came from a jealous or a competitive child.

5
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,319
That’s enough.

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:16,819
Do I have to be dead to get your attention, Namcha?

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:20,379
I should have just died.

8
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:22,794
When will you stop hurting yourself?

9
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:24,093
I can’t do this.

10
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:25,626
I can’t hurt Inn’s feelings.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,782
What about my feelings?

12
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:29,782
Don’t you care about that?

13
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:32,379
That’s about all.

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,019
What do you think, Irin?

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,979
Irin?

16
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,195
What did you say?

17
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,401
We wrapped our presentation.

18
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,419
Do you have any opinions?

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,219
Well, we’ll stick with what you said.

20
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,019
Which book would you like to be featured in the first video?

21
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:03,096
It has to be our current bestseller.

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,979
The book about pet, then.

23
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:07,219
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:13,179
Who would you like to be the guest in the first episode?

25
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:16,819
Some specialist on pets.

26
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:19,924
The book is about pet behavior, isn’t it?

27
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:22,493
It would be great if the guest was some good-looking vet.

28
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:25,179
I’m sure that will get people’s attention to our channel.

29
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:26,419
True.

30
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:32,379
We’ll gather profiles and photos of some vets for you to select, Irin.

31
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:37,477
Can I get that by the end of today?

32
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,866
The book is going to be out next week, after all.

33
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:44,582
Also, only include the people who can be on the show.

34
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,965
I don’t want the names of the people who can’t.

35
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:48,837
They’d only turn us down later.

36
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,251
Today?

37
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,490
The end of today is only in a few hours.

38
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,490
The book will be out next week.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,945
We have to let them read the book,

40
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,137
make plan, film the video, and then edit.

41
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,179
You think we can make it in time?

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,019
Who are you looking for, Doc?

43
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,290
Did Ploy come today?

44
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,117
Ploy… our regular?

45
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,600
Yes.

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,896
I haven’t seen her today.

47
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,779
Do you need something from her?

48
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:33,235
Can you please check when Ploy would come in?

49
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:36,973
Dr. Namcha, Miss Ploy never has appointments.

50
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,779
Every time she’s in here, she’s a walk-in customer.

51
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,179
Hi!

52
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,238
Oh, Doctor!

53
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,022
Hello.

54
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,619
I haven’t seen you in a while. You’re on duty today? I’m so happy.

55
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:55,179
What’s wrong with Action today?

56
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,579
Action is sick.

57
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,815
Look at him. He’s so distressed, my baby.

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,179
Does that mean you can’t talk to me about our partnership later?

59
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,121
Of course, I can. I’ve never been more available.

60
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,219
Please, look after him for me.

61
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,779
Is Action alright now?

62
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:20,007
Action is in his best shape.

63
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,346
Action.

64
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,509
Turn around.

65
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,779
Yes!

66
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,437
See how healthy he is?

67
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,579
I’ll leave him in your care.

68
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:39,619
Should we get going?

69
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,288
Hi, baby.

70
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,379
What are you looking at?

71
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:52,779
Huh?

72
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,419
And then…

73
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,090
And we also train…

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Look, baby.

75
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,028
Alright.

76
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:30,422
Let’s get you something to eat.

77
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,379
Sit down.

78
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,921
Here.

79
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,125
You want it?

80
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,419
Go on.

(Jin)

89
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,743
I’ve been eating the same things for days.

90
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:04,819
Isn’t there something different?

91
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,219
Wait a moment, please.

92
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:40,820
You might want to eat that before it gets cold.

93
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,219
Yes, Irin?

94
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,779
How’s Inn doing?

95
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,656
She’s stable.

96
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,379
She can at least stomach food now.

97
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,254
Is that so?

98
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:14,419
I’ll be off work late today so I think I’ll be there at night.

99
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:16,819
Then you don’t have to come.

100
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,242
You should rest.

101
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:20,029
I don’t want to see her.

102
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,779
If she comes here, I’ll really die.

103
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,419
But I’m worried about her.

104
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,819
There’s nothing to worry about.

105
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,219
Once she takes her meds, she’ll be sleeping.

106
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:33,822
You should go home after work.

107
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,019
I’ll take care of things on this end.

108
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,722
Thank you.

109
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:40,331
If there’s anything Inn needs, let me know.

110
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,979
I’ll get right to it.

111
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,822
She won’t come, will she?

112
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,822
She won’t.

113
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,674
Tell her not to visit me ever again.

114
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:00,109
I don’t want to see her.

115
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,651
All the better if it’s for the rest of my life.

116
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,522
Please calm down, Inn.

117
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,979
You two are sisters.

118
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,779
If it was my choice, I wouldn’t have chosen to be born into this family.

119
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,219
Don’t get so cross, now.

120
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,619
Put on a little smile, alright?

121
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,819
You should eat before it gets cold.

122
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:15,146
Did you contact the vets we were talking about?

123
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,201
We haven’t been able to get anyone to agree.

124
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:21,121
Some of them didn’t answer the call and some turned us down.

125
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:26,419
It’s hard for them to give us answers when it's urgent.

126
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:31,219
Do you guys not have any connections?

127
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:32,980
No.

128
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,779
I don’t.

129
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:36,857
I really can’t count on you.

130
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,419
I’ll take care of it.

131
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,019
Tan, you must help me.

132
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,620
(Your little brother is here with a girl.)

133
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,619
(What girl? That’s probably his friend.)

134
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,019
(If it’s a friend, why would they go alone?)

135
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:22,819
(True. If they’re not familiar, how do they look so close?)

136
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:27,619
(Doesn’t matter. He’s a grownup. Just let him be.)

137
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:32,419
(How could you say that? He’s your brother.)

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,219
(You want him to date whoever he meets? What kind of sister are you?)

139
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:38,644
(What the hell?)

140
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:41,890
(You letting out your frustration from work on us?)

141
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,619
Hey, can you take a look at this?

142
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,405
What is it?

143
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,579
The project we could do at the hospital.

144
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,121
It looks interesting.

145
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:06,447
Pet hotel, all-rounded service, and a training school?

146
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:10,819
I don’t think I’ve seen any hospitals with such a full-option service.

147
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:16,779
You do know, though, that if this were to happen,

148
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:20,419
there would be much more trouble than there is right now?

149
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,979
And more importantly, if anything bad were to happen,

150
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,379
we would be responsible for it.

151
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:30,019
Yeah, I’m aware of that.

152
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,819
Then let’s present this at the meeting.

153
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,020
Well, did you go out with a girl?

154
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,819
Me?

155
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,685
Did Paeng tell you?

156
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,779
I don’t know. Did you go or not?

157
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:58,143
Hey, you know me.

158
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:01,219
I only went to her cafe to talk about the project.

159
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,619
Alright, then.

160
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,419
Why’d you ask?

161
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,407
Nothing. Just try to behave.

162
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,379
Someone’s not happy with you.

163
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,108
Who?

164
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,019
Irin. Who else?

165
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,459
Jin is always at the hospital lately.

166
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,979
And now you’re out with another girl.

167
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,349
Did Irin really get mad about that?

168
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,057
No. I assumed.

169
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,145
It’s just the way it’s supposed to be, isn’t it?

170
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,985
If you’re not messing about, then it’s alright.

171
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,711
Hello, Irin?

172
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,222
What’s up?

173
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:51,619
Are you calling to tell me how bad a sister I am?

174
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,029
My company is about to start a YouTube channel

175
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,884
to talk about our new releases.

176
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:03,373
I want to invite specialists to discuss the books.

177
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,802
That sounds interesting.

178
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:09,536
I think that’ll get more people to read.

179
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,551
I think so, too.

180
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:13,476
That’s why I need a little favor.

181
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,617
What favor?

182
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:20,294
The first book we’ll feature is about pet behaviors.

183
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:24,048
So I want an animal specialist to talk in the video.

184
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,611
You want me?

185
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:29,979
Why not ask someone who is a genius or really famous?

186
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,619
You’re the perfect choice.

187
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,642
Is that so?

188
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,602
Fine.

189
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:39,863
When’s a good time for you?

190
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,980
It’s kind of urgent.

191
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,782
Any time is fine.

192
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,782
I’ll ask someone to cover for my shift.

193
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,019
Thank you.

194
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,785
Of course, bestie.

195
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,579
It’s no problem.

196
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:57,619
Oh, so… did you talk to Cha about that girl?

197
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,019
Well…

198
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,971
Why don’t you just talk to him? He’s here.

199
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:04,819
What?

200
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,604
Oh?

201
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,582
Looks like she hung up.

202
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,979
What’s the rush?

203
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,893
Damn that Irin…

204
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,179
Did Irin really ask about me?

205
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:26,682
Yeah.

206
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,819
Why’d I lie?

207
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:33,619
And what does she need a favor with?

208
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,877
She said she’s doing some kind of show.

209
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,597
It’s a book promo.

210
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,979
And there’s a book about pets, or something.

211
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,749
Why didn’t she tell me anything?

212
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,179
Is Irin your friend or what?

213
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,360
What are you still sitting here for?

214
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,500
Get back to work.

215
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,220
Bye, then.

216
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:59,730
How carefree…

217
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:17,979
Pen.

218
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,379
Pen!

219
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,019
Pen!

220
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,979
Are you alright, Anon?

221
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,357
Oh, I’m alright.

222
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,318
Do you need me to call someone?

223
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:36,019
You look really pale.

224
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:38,419
No. I told you I’m fine.

225
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,552
Oh, by the way.

226
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,622
Does your son tell you anything?

227
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:47,112
Namcha, you mean?

228
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,179
Of course.

229
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:51,179
No, nothing in particular.

230
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:52,817
Is something the matter?

231
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,262
I think you’d better ask your son.

232
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,186
And take good care of him.

233
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:01,179
Don’t let him get anywhere near my granddaughter again.

234
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,420
Why not?

235
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,979
I told you to ask him, didn’t I?

236
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:12,019
If it comes from me, it’ll be like I have a big mouth.

237
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,819
What’s wrong, Mom?

238
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:44,189
Did you do something to them, Cha?

239
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:46,779
Anon seems to be really displeased with you.

240
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,419
Is this about Inn?

241
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,031
It’s nothing.

242
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:53,896
How can it be nothing?

243
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,603
He seems really displeased.

244
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:58,779
He even said not to get close to his grandkid again.

245
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,797
Don’t pay any mind, Mom.

246
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,422
It’s really nothing.

247
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:07,219
He sounded very cross, though.

248
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:09,005
Did he?

249
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:13,179
What do you think, Dad?

250
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,979
Now that it takes shape, it looks rather interesting.

251
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:24,019
I think the building at the back can be renovated into a pet hotel.

252
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:28,819
Have a swimming pool, grooming service, and exercise center.

253
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:34,170
We can open a department for exotic and aquatic animals at the hospital.

254
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,419
Exotic pets are all the rage right now.

255
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,979
Hiring a specialist for this department might be a great idea.

256
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,620
I think that sounds nice.

257
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:49,179
We may be able to attract customers from our competition.

258
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,579
It does sound nice.

259
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:55,219
But if we were to invest this much and happen to have no customer…

260
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,451
Can you take responsibility for that, Cha?

261
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,819
From what you said here,

262
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:08,444
how much more personnel do we need to hire?

263
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,671
Then there’s also tremendous decoration expense.

264
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,419
How can you be sure this will fly?

265
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:16,819
I hate a loser like you.

266
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:21,216
Since you’re not dating Inn, I don’t want anything to do with you.

267
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:21,620
But—

268
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,149
Don’t hate me for saying this,

269
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,238
but if your family doesn’t teach you, then I will.

270
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,274
A new graduate should pay attention to their work to secure their job.

271
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,484
They shouldn’t pay attention to nonsense like you do.

272
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,570
Stop getting other people off their track.

273
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,783
I’ll do whatever it takes to make it work.

274
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:45,619
Now everyone will stop thinking of me as a useless kid.

275
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,979
Then find a way to make what you think a reality.

276
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,379
Yes.

277
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:31,222
I told you not to come.

278
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,779
I don’t want her to be alone.

279
00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:41,285
She’s asleep.

280
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:45,619
I think you should go back to your place.

281
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:47,023
It’s alright.

282
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:50,419
I want to be with her in case she needs something late at night.

283
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:53,979
You’re strong-headed, aren’t you?

284
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,090
You should rest.

285
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,179
You’ve been taking care of Inn all day.

286
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:05,979
Well, how was work?

287
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,379
Everything’s fine.

288
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:10,515
Go home.

289
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,019
I’ll walk you out.

290
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:13,807
It’s alright.

291
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,379
Let me pay you back in one way or another.

292
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,779
If you want to repay me,

293
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:26,419
I think you can do that in some other ways.

294
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,619
I’m kidding.

295
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:37,179
I just want you to rest.

296
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:39,004
I’ll be going, then.

297
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:52,779
Oh, Inn?

298
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,552
You’re awake?

299
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,419
I thought you were deep asleep.

300
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,979
Do you want anything? I’ll get it for you.

301
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,579
I’ll sleep here tonight.

302
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,979
Just let me know what you need.

303
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:19,179
Honestly, do you even feel guilty that I am like this?

304
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:23,979
Would I be here if I didn’t?

305
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:26,379
Don’t.

306
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:27,619
Just go.

307
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,779
Inn.

308
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,419
If you really feel guilty, don’t do this little thing for me.

309
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,979
It’s pointless.

310
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,970
Then what will you have me do?

311
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,619
Die.

312
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:42,721
Inn.

313
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,419
Be reasonable.

314
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,819
Was what I said not reasonable?

315
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:52,779
I’ve never had anything nice in my life because it all belongs to you.

316
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,117
Everybody loves Irin.

317
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,579
Nobody cares about me.

318
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:59,979
Even when you’re not even slightly decent.

319
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:04,779
You’ve got bad personality, a sharp tongue, and a bad temper.

320
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,419
You must get what you want.

321
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,736
Doesn’t matter who you hurt.

322
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:13,219
But still, everybody loves Irin.

323
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,266
Without you,

324
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,019
my life would be better.

325
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,979
Inn.

326
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:30,019
Do you really think people would care about you more if I died?

327
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:31,179
You know what.

328
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:34,819
That is such a loser kind of idea.

329
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,091
Did your teacher not teach you at school

330
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,859
that if you want to be top of the class,

331
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,810
you must study hard and get good grades?

332
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,617
Not getting rid of someone who’s better out of the class,

333
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:50,411
hoping you’d be the best without even working for it.

334
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,419
I thought you’d be smarter than this.

335
00:22:57,457 --> 00:23:00,730
Did you know I couldn’t sleep last night

336
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,619
because I was thinking about what to do with this between us.

337
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:07,179
But now that you said that,

338
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,819
you’d made it much easier for me to decide.

339
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:14,456
Get out.

340
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:15,622
I won’t.

341
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:16,985
You’re not a child anymore.

342
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:22,819
You need to accept the fact that doing this won’t make you win.

343
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,977
Get out!

344
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:26,192
I don’t want to hear.

345
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:27,620
I hate you.

346
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:31,802
If you hate me so much,

347
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:34,779
get better and beat me.

348
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,419
If you can do that,

349
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,219
I’ll give you whatever you want.

350
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,419
Is that what you want?

351
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,185
Don’t forget your promise.

352
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,619
You really will give me everything.

353
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:07,180
I will.

354
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,819
Everything.

355
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:20,379
I’ll take everything back.

356
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:24,019
Nothing will be left of you.

357
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,379
Irin?

358
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:27,620
What happened?

359
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,019
Why are you crying?

360
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,979
I asked you why you’re crying.

361
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:38,379
What are you doing here?

362
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,019
I thought you’d be here.

363
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:43,805
I’m worried about you.

364
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,597
You can get in.

365
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:47,982
Inn isn’t sleeping.

366
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:51,579
But I’m here to see you.

367
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,979
Not someone else.

368
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,622
Am I such a bad person, Cha?

369
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,179
Why’d you ask?

370
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,410
Just answer me.

371
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:36,019
If you ask me, you’re such a great sister.

372
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:39,579
I think there isn’t a time when you’re not worried about Inn.

373
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:43,219
You always think of her, always do things for her.

374
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,306
No.

375
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:52,819
I’m demanding, bad-tempered, don’t care what anyone thinks.

376
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,219
I’m tempestuous.

377
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:58,779
Everyone at the office hates me.

378
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,179
I know that.

379
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,565
If that’s how everyone wants to see you,

380
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,779
it only means they’re not ready to understand you in the first place.

381
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,180
Someone who judges everyone like that…

382
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,579
You don’t have to care about them.

383
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,379
Does that mean I am really like that?

384
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:32,379
From the outside, yes, that’s how you are.

385
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:37,179
But I don’t think it’s unusual.

386
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,819
You’ve been looking after your family in your parents’ place.

387
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,958
You’ve been running the company in your grandfather’s stead.

388
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,779
You’ve been doing all of that even before you graduated.

389
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,485
Isn’t it usual for someone like that

390
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,219
to turn out a little less gentle than others?

391
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:04,819
It doesn’t matter how you are.

392
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:13,179
Because for me, I’ve seen that everything you do, you do it for others.

393
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:17,979
Being tempestuous is no big deal.

394
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,379
It doesn’t matter.

395
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:33,619
I told you.

396
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,179
You should allow yourself to be happy.

397
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:40,819
Do what you want.

398
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,379
Try not to think of other people sometimes.

399
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:58,779
Cry all your tears.

400
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:01,179
I’ll be here.

401
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:07,219
With me, you can do anything.

402
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,019
Just don’t run away from me again.

403
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:19,219
I just want to go through everything with you.

404
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,007
Okay?

405
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,610
(Eat lots and feel better.)

406
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:57,619
Irin.

407
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:09,495
How did you get in my house?

408
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,320
Is it supposed to be difficult to?

409
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:14,444
I did something far more difficult than that.

410
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,312
What do you mean by something difficult?

411
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:19,017
Dealing with your grandfather.

412
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,137
He will accept me.

413
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:24,019
He did once.

414
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,605
If you want to date my granddaughter,

415
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:31,191
your relationship must be monitored by me.

416
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:33,619
I’m the one who has the final say in this family.

417
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,545
Yes, sir.

418
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:38,066
I won’t let the same mistake happen again.

419
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,819
Are you admitting that you’re dating my granddaughter?

420
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,219
I intend to do so.

421
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:46,779
Don’t ever think of fooling around with my granddaughter.

422
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,419
You don’t want your parents to be on bad terms with me, do you?

423
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,727
Of course.

424
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,219
I’ve never been this serious about anyone before.

425
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:58,780
Make sure you remember those words.

426
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:04,774
Right. He thought you were talking about Inn.

427
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:05,980
I know.

428
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,691
I’ve known from the start that that was what he thought.

429
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:14,419
I was just trying to see how much he would let me in.

430
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,819
That’s where things got complicated.

431
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:20,709
Even if he’s really angry with me right now,

432
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:22,779
I’ll do whatever it takes for him to accept me.

433
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,219
Trust me, Irin.

434
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,419
Go to work.

435
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,819
Wait.

436
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:46,832
What’s this for?

437
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:50,419
I’ll use it as a talisman against vicious dogs at the hospital.

438
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:55,754
Smile.

439
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,619
You’ll be in a good mood all day.

440
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,179
Irin.

441
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,991
Quiet. Grandpa will hear you.

442
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:07,219
If you won’t smile, I’ll raise my voice.

443
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:08,983
Smile.

444
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:10,254
Hurry up.

445
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,875
Bullying you is so much fun.

446
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,619
Look.

447
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,820
What the hell’s wrong with him?

448
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:47,819
Lame.

449
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,167
Flowers?

450
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,579
Do you know what flower that is?

451
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:53,979
Forget-me-not.

452
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:55,605
Right?

453
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,619
It’s not just some flowers.

454
00:32:58,031 --> 00:33:00,019
It’s a promise.

455
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,419
"Don’t forget me."

456
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,819
Is that a promise or an order?

457
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:07,219
Both.

458
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,779
Are you going to do this every day?

459
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:13,977
But I want to see you smile every day.

460
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,088
That’s too much.

461
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,820
Who the hell smiles every day?

462
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,379
I’ll have an adorable photo of you for every day.

463
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,779
See?

464
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:24,205
That’s ugly!

465
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:25,321
Delete it right now.

466
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:26,555
It’s cute. Look.

467
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,566
Delete it!

468
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,456
Give it to me.

469
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:31,179
Delete it!

470
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:31,730
Nope.

471
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,619
Give it to me!

472
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:34,647
Cha!

473
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:35,888
Delete it!

474
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,177
No way!

475
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,219
How did you get in?

476
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:22,278
Thanks to that, I got to see someone waiting for me.

477
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:22,992
Who?

478
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:23,894
Who was?

479
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:25,645
Not me.

480
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:27,579
You wanna see the video I took?

481
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:31,219
Who coud have been craning her neck looking for me…

482
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:34,779
I was just looking at this and that.

483
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:36,934
And?

484
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,188
Where’s my gift?

485
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,579
Did you run out of ideas?

486
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,051
Not a chance.

487
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:41,743
Here’s the gift.

488
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,851
What do you think you’re doing?

489
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:44,788
Where?

490
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:45,736
This is it.

491
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,565
Are you out of your mind? People could see you.

492
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,047
Let go.

493
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,328
What if someone sees you?

494
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,158
Get out or I’m calling the police.

495
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,019
But here it is.

496
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,130
You silly…

497
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,154
This is reserved just for you, you know.

498
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:57,398
What’s with the disgust look on your face?

499
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,779
Get out!

500
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,219
If you won’t leave, I will really call the police.

501
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:02,792
Go or I’ll have you arrested.

502
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,592
Go. Go!

503
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,019
Go!

504
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,537
Go.

505
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:08,345
Come here.

506
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,447
Enough.

507
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:10,819
Go!

508
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:17,484
Is Inn being discharged today?

509
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,179
Yes.

510
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,579
Did you get someone to pick her up?

511
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,219
I’ll drop you off at the office and then will pick her up myself.

512
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:30,019
How is she doing after the…

513
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,847
suicide attempt?

514
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,579
She’s much better now.

515
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,219
She’s still seeing a psychiatrist, though.

516
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:40,779
But I don’t think she’s thinking of anything like that anymore.

517
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,419
Good.

518
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:47,979
I want her to be half as good as her sister.

519
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,294
But look at her.

520
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:54,019
How could I truly let go of my work at the office?

521
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,888
But you have Irin to take care of everything.

522
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,819
It’s not the same.

523
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,219
How is it not?

524
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:13,915
Is the kid next door still messing around here?

525
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,128
Not anymore.

526
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:16,779
Good.

527
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,177
We have enough mess as it is.

528
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:22,394
There’ll be journalists at the office today, right?

529
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:23,628
Yes.

530
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,379
They’re there for the online show about the books.

531
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:30,019
Irin wants to hold a press conference to spread the words.

532
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,354
So some journalists will be there for a scoop.

533
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:34,151
They all probably know

534
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,379
that our company is on its last leg.

535
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:45,517
What’s with the nice getup?

536
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:47,231
You don’t have work today, do you?

537
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,180
I don’t.

538
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,619
But I’ll be a special guest at Irin’s show.

539
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,472
What show?

540
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:56,820
It’s an online show her publishing house is producing.

541
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,979
It’s for their book promo.

542
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,623
Who knew publishing houses do publicity nowadays, too?

543
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:06,207
Yes, Irin really puts a lot of effort into it.

544
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:11,337
She sent me the book for me to prepare before the interview.

545
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,219
I think she’s got high hopes for this.

546
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:16,779
I read it, too, that book.

547
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:19,014
It’s not even hard.

548
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:22,480
Any decent vets know all that.

549
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,170
How did you get your hand on one?

550
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,204
It’s just out.

551
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,280
Well, I took it from your room.

552
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,905
Bastard!

553
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:35,979
Once the show’s on, my daughter will become an internet sensation.

554
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,925
Aww, no way.

555
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:42,020
I’m not that beautiful.

556
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,020
What’s with you?

557
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:46,272
What’s with the full makeup?

558
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:49,134
I woke up like this!

559
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,379
Don’t you dare smile.

560
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:52,779
But if that’s the case, isn’t it great for us?

561
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:56,128
If you’ve become a well-known face,

562
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:59,979
it’s like a PR for us.

563
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:02,379
You have to be recognizable, Tan.

564
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:08,077
Your fame will get people to come to our hospital more.

565
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,579
It’s free publicity.

566
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:13,219
I’ll do my best.

567
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:18,346
I think the all-rounded service animal hospital project

568
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,932
of yours needs this.

569
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,979
Honey.

570
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:26,135
Can you not pressure them any more than this?

571
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,725
Look at them. They’re all stiff now.

572
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,931
I’m not pressuring them.

573
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:34,819
But if we’re the only one helping them then what’s the point?

574
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,373
We should turn this into a chance to promote our hospital.

575
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:41,311
Right?

576
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,005
Otherwise, what’s the point?

577
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:45,579
It should benefit both parties.

578
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,250
(Speak Animal Language)

579
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:11,791
You’ve read the book?

580
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,145
Yes.

581
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,145
Do you have any questions?

582
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,746
You want this interview to be rather casual, right?

583
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:19,309
Yes.

584
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,429
I want it to be like

585
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:23,148
a conversation between friends, like any online shows.

586
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:27,271
Make it easy to digest, but keep the idea of the book.

587
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:28,779
Sure.

588
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:32,419
Grandpa.

589
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:34,364
Hello.

590
00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:35,979
Please, have a seat.

591
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:43,078
I’ll go get ready.

592
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:44,419
Please.

593
00:39:44,872 --> 00:39:46,576
When is it going to start?

594
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:48,576
We’ll start at around ten.

595
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:51,619
Where’s the vet for the show?

596
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,179
On the way, I presume.

597
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,106
But isn’t it nearly time?

598
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,979
We need to get ready.

599
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:03,619
I’ll talk to the team.

600
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:13,219
Ugh! What a hellish traffic!

601
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:18,019
I’ll take this lane, then.

602
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:35,291
Sir, I am so sorry. Are you alright?

603
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,909
Do you even know how to drive?

604
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,620
I didn’t mean to. I didn’t see you.

605
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,779
I need to go somewhere but I’ll take care of everything.

606
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:44,042
Insurance and all. So please, don’t worry.

607
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,668
You need to take responsibility.

608
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,004
We will wait for the insurance to come here.

609
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:51,192
Yes. I will do that. And I’ll take care of everything.

610
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,779
But I need to—

611
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:01,219
Answer your phone, Tan. Damn it.

612
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:13,428
Oh, where’s your vet?

613
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:15,619
We should begin.

614
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,019
Wait a moment, please.

615
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,851
What now? She said she would take care of it.

616
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:26,345
I bet they ghosted.

617
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,525
Good. She deserves it.

618
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:29,405
Totally.

619
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,579
Sorry I’m late.

620
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,619
You asked for his help?

621
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,019
Whatever you want me to do, I will.

622
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:14,419
You’re very close with that kid.

623
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,560
Grandpa?

624
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:16,549
Grandpa.

625
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:17,552
Grandpa.

626
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:19,065
Don’t run away from me again.

627
00:42:19,065 --> 00:42:22,185
Because I’ll find you again no matter what.

628
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:26,419
About Namcha and Irin, we need to cause more trouble.

629
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,819
I want to get married.
