1
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:01,401
Why are you wearing a hoodie?

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,117
It's Cha's. Does it look bad on me?

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,527
When will I stop thinking about this?

4
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,613
What they are doing is none of my business.

5
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:10,770
The dog is not that stupid.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,979
But there's a stupid dog that is still waiting for you here.

7
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:17,841
Touching, isn't it?

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,308
That dog must be very stupid.

9
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:21,964
Take care of the wedding.

10
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:22,940
But I think...

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,644
I hope what I ask isn't too much for you to do.

12
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:27,979
I will never marry you.

13
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,054
You don't want to marry or do you hate me?

14
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:32,530
Maybe it's all of those.

15
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:35,216
I'm a security guard here.

16
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,019
Do you usually fire people that easily?

17
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:43,979
You fired me without even remembering my face or my name.

18
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:54,019
Thanks for coming with me.

19
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:59,002
You must be sick of coming here so often.

20
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,382
I can't help it, can I?

21
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,382
Sick of it or not, I have to come.

22
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:05,979
Hold on to this for me.

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,019
This way, please.

24
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,792
How are you feeling this month?

25
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,817
I didn't have any symptoms.

26
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,669
Let me examine you.

27
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:22,022
If you stay healthy for the next two months,

28
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:25,244
I'll let you do some simple exercises.

29
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,244
Exercises?

30
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:29,872
Just some light exercises you can do at home.

31
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,282
Nothing strenuous.

32
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,752
I'll tell you how.

33
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:34,765
That's good.

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,524
I have a friend who loves working out. He can help.

35
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:39,980
Great.

(I've been thinking about what I should do with you.)

38
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:23,398
(I want this company to go down with me.)

39
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,925
Or should I just kill you?

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,880
Should I shoot everyone in the company.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,017
Should I shoot everyone in the company.

00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,415

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,265
Irin, where are you?

45
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,200
(Inn)

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,586

47
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,629
What are you doing?

48
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,011
Irin?

49
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,011
Irin, where are you?

50
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:51,762
Crap!

51
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:59,375
You brought this on yourself.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,491
Damn it!

53
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,949
Where is Irin?

54
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,715
She went to the office alone.

55
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:09,979
Are you happy now?

63
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,979
You've been grumbling, but don't you want to know why I fired you?

64
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,334
What was your duty?

65
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,453
Just operating the elevator?

66
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:01,477
Do you know how the guy who worked this post before you did his job?

67
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:03,737
He remembered everyone who used that elevator,

68
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,979
their names and their departments,

69
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:11,979
and he knew which floor each of them needed to go, without even being told.

70
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:19,515
That guy now works as the head of security here.

71
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:23,328
He moved up from being just a liftboy.

72
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,979
Do you see the difference between you and him now?

73
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,777
Your duty was nothing difficult.

74
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:33,979
You had it easier than other security guards, in fact.

75
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,868
Yet you did not do it well.

76
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,868
You know why?

77
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:43,274
Because even you yourself look down on your job.

78
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,979
You think it was just pushing numbers on an elevator

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,210
so you didn't put your mind into it.

80
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:57,210
But that guy before you meant to send everyone to where they need to be.

81
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,979
He did his best.

82
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,945
Do you see the difference now?

83
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:07,785
I did not fire you because you used an air freshener I hate,

84
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:11,507
but because I couldn't see how someone who

85
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:13,937
looked down on their duty could do a good job.

86
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:16,098
And no matter where you work, with this

87
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:21,970
mindset, you will never advance in your career.

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,979
You dare lecture others when everyone hates you.

89
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:49,425
Don't you realise everyone here despises you?

90
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,610
Should I just kill you?

91
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,979
Should I?

92
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:57,749
Your employers might even thank me for it.

93
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,979
Then you can kill me.

94
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,979
Do it.

95
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,979
My parents died many years ago.

96
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,875
They were killed in a car accident.

97
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,708
I was the only one in that car who survived.

98
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,979
If I died now, I'd only be too happy to see them again.

99
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,751
But you know what?

100
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,788
Even if I die today, my company will go on.

101
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:33,977
Because my sister will take over and make it better.

102
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,475
But you will go to jail,

103
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,979
likely for the rest of your life.

104
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:47,949
How will your aging parents feel

105
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,979
about having a murderer for a son?

106
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,980
Crap!

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,210
(Calling Irin)

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,610
(Calling Irin)

109
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,223
I'll tell you what.

110
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:34,899
If you get fired and all you do is whining about it without doing a thing,

111
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,816
but blaming your fate and me,

112
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,786
when will your life ever get better?

113
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:41,979
How can you not realise something so simple?

114
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,306
You love hearing yourself talk, huh?

115
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,819
You ran your mouth.

116
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,253
Did you think I wouldn't do it?

117
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:57,749
My sister knows what's going on and she's coming with the police.

118
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,979
I bet they're almost here.

119
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,632
If you run away right now,

120
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:07,979
I promise the police won't hear about any of this.

121
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:11,655
I won't take charges against you...

122
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,388
Unless you want me dead,

123
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,380
or go to jail.

124
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,231
Irin.

125
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,330
Irin.

126
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:01,164
What did he do to you?

127
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,164
Did he?

128
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,979
It's alright.

129
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,979
You're safe now.

130
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,666
What happened here?

131
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,457
Excuse me.

132
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:56,583
Did you see the man who came here with me who was sitting over there?

133
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:59,708
Oh, are you Miss Intira?

134
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,244
Yes.

135
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,940
He said he had an urgent business so he left your thing here.

136
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,226
What business?

137
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,979
He didn't say.

138
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,982
My phone.

139
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,945
I knew something awful must be going on,

140
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,805
so I took Inn's phone with me.

141
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,717
In case you didn't know anyone else's number.

142
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,717
Who's with Inn right now?

143
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,320
The one you should worry about right now is yourself.

144
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,979
Inn is alright. It's just a checkup appointment.

145
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,979
But you shouldn't just leave her there.

146
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,462
Where's the first aid kit?

147
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:57,869
You're still bleeding.

148
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,050
Don't worry about me.

149
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,980
Go back to Inn.

150
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:05,979
Can you not be stubborn for a minute, please?

151
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,090
I can do it myself.

152
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,979
Can you see your own neck?

153
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,789
Good thing the wound isn't deep.

154
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:38,434
But it's best you go to the hospital for a tetanus jab.

155
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,982
Understood?

156
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:41,982
I know that.

157
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:57,157
This will sting a little.

158
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,613
You'll only hurt yourself grabbing tight like that.

159
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,979
What if you dig a wound into your skin?

160
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,979
It's okay to let someone know when it hurts, you know.

161
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,979
It'll be alright.

162
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:35,189
When you share your pain with someone, it feels better, doens't it?

163
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:39,280
Stop talking and just get this over with quickly.

164
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,979
Were you terrified?

165
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:11,604
Not really.

166
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,517
I was just a little startled.

167
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,979
Didn't you see that I dealt with it just fine?

168
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,290
But you were shaking.

169
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,090
Says who?

170
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,979
I'm not a scaredy cat.

171
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,979
So you're done...

172
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,087
Go back to Inn.

173
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,979
She must be looking all over for you.

174
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:53,269
Miss Irin, I have the footage.

175
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,979
Here.

176
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:07,005
I looked him up. He's the guard who just came in to clear his stuff today.

177
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,845
I can't believe he would do something like this.

178
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:13,976
Would you like me to go to the police?

179
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,389
No need.

180
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,979
And don't tell anyone about this.

181
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,598
Why not?

182
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,979
He might come back to hurt you again.

183
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,320
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

184
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,979
Just tidy up the office before Monday.

185
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:29,979
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,979
He nearly killed you and you won't press charges?

187
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,979
Just forget about it.

188
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:43,031
He must really have been at a deadend.

189
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:45,031
I feel sorry for him.

190
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,176
Just go to the hospital in my car.

191
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,019
Why must you drive?

192
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,480
I can go alone.

193
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,890
It's just a vaccination.

194
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,976
You don't have to go.

195
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,976
But you shouldn't be alone right now.

196
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,691
Why not?

197
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:45,955
Because of PTSD. You could have a post-traumatic event stress.

198
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,770
I'm not fragile like that.

199
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,954
I'll be fine.

200
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,931
Just go.

201
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:37,014
Don't you dare! I have pepper spray!

202
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,979
Your pepper spray smells great.

203
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,980
It's mineral water spray.

204
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,979
That's what I meant when I said you could have PTSD.

205
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,979
Get it now?

206
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,460
That wasn't funny.

207
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,900
I told you you shouldn't be alone right now.

208
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,979
I'll go wherever you go.

209
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,361
Shall we?

210
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,854
Do you need me to stay with you while you get your vaccine jab?

211
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,437
Nonsense.

212
00:17:58,437 --> 00:17:59,574
Get out.

213
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:00,970
Pervert.

214
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,976
They're not gonna jab you in the butt, you know.

215
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,499
What were you imaging?

216
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,451
I don't care where they jab, you can't see any of it.

217
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,979
Get out.

218
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,414
Please?

219
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:11,982
Let me stay with you.

220
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,979
I'll look after you.

221
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,408
Idiot, just get out.

222
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,979
Go.

223
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:29,979
Get out of here.

224
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:42,994
Sir, animals are not allowed in the hospital.

225
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:45,177
But who would take care of him otherwise?

226
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,979
Oden is a really good boy, you know.

227
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:52,905
Excuse me.

228
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:56,607
I'm a vet. Can I talk to you?

229
00:18:57,142 --> 00:19:00,942
No matter what, I can't leave him.

230
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,980
Sugar gliders can't be alone.

231
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,685
He needs a friend.

232
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,977
But we have a strict regulation against pets here at the hospital.

233
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,979
You're here for your chemo, too.

234
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:22,734
It's germs from your little frined here that can harm you.

235
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,960
You could get worse and can't take care of him anymore.

236
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,005
Then I don't need the chemo.

237
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,717
How about this?

238
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:35,979
I'll take care of him until you get better.

239
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,031
He's very delicate.

240
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:43,979
I've seen many cases at the hospital where they died of loneliness.

241
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,254
Some owners only buy them because they're trendy.

242
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,920
They only want them for photos, not to really care for them.

243
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,979
Who brings pets to human hospital?

244
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,979
I swear on my profession to take great care of him.

245
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,897
I became a veterinarian because I wanted to make every life count.

246
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,979
You can trust me.

247
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:31,145
Just focus on getting better now.

248
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,140
You can come back for him later.

249
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,979
You can trust his words.

250
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:42,989
I know him well.

251
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,979
He will protect even random house lizards he finds at home.

252
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,015
A lizard!

253
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,700
Are you scared of lizards?

254
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,961
I'll shoo him away.

255
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,918
- Cha, be careful. Cha.
 - Go.

256
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,942
Go out by the backdoor.

257
00:20:57,942 --> 00:20:59,220
I have a guest.

258
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,515
This isn't the time for you to be here.

259
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,515
Get out of the way, Cha. I'll handle this.

260
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:03,789
Irin, don't!

261
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,515
Kiddo, run!

262
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,656
Move away, Cha.

263
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,453
Cha!

264
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:08,148
Go.

265
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,148
Irin, don't.

266
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,615
Don't hurt him.

267
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,958
Irin, stop!

268
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,829
Irin.

269
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,370
Irin, don't hurt him.

270
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,690
Cha, are you out of your mind?

271
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,937
That thing is hideous. We can't coexist with it!

272
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,715
He has a life, too!

273
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,690
Who are we to decide if he lives or die?

274
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:29,979
He's taken great care of everything in his life.

275
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:35,554
Trust me when I say he will look after him just as well as you do.

276
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:45,979
Where's Grandpa?

277
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,979
Mr. Jin said he's still resting.

278
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:55,103
Will you be dining here, too?

279
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,840
I'll eat with Inn.

280
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Yes.

281
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,142
You don't have to.

282
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,979
I always eat by myself anyway.

283
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,143
How was your hospital visit?

284
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:19,143
Bad.

285
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:22,909
Very bad.

286
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,979
What did the doctor say?

287
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,522
That's not why it was bad.

288
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,980
It was something else.

289
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,979
You can tell me, Inn.

290
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,977
Do you know

291
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,979
what I hate more than aything?

292
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,979
Abandonment.

293
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:07,979
Ever since I was young, everyone in this family has barely paid me any mind.

294
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:17,004
Another thing that I hate is being lied to.

295
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,979
It seems today was full of everything that I hate.

296
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:37,417
Did you know that sugar gliders are such a lonely animal?

297
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,979
If they're left alone for too long,

298
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,979
they can get so distressed that they hurt themselves.

299
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:53,979
I don't think there's anyone who feels as alone as I do in this world.

300
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:13,979
You're not as alone as you feel.

301
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:19,979
At least, I am probably more alone than you are.

302
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,905
You have your family,

303
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,528
Irin

304
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:26,011
and your grandfather.

305
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,979
But look at me.

306
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:33,979
I've got no one.

307
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,979
But if you take good care of them, be with them,

308
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,977
they'll become the nicest friends.

309
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,979
I don't think this one's nice to me.

310
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,822
But take good care of him.

311
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:12,822
Don't let him get lonely.

312
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:17,979
I know what it feels like to be alone in the world.

313
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:33,505
What happened? Why is your hair...

314
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,669
Just an accident.

315
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:35,979
Nothing much.

316
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,745
I think you look perfectly happy.

317
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,979
I went to work. What's there to be happy about?

318
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,979
Why are you lying?

319
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,979
Inn.

320
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,936
What did you say to her?

321
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,186
Why is she in such a mood?

322
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:07,979
I think that's a question you should ask yourself.

323
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,979
Inn?

324
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:41,842
Inn.

325
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,210
I think we need to talk.

326
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,204
Inn.

327
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:52,755
Dad. Mom. I'm leaving.

328
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:55,146
Irin, won't you have breakfast first?

329
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,146
No. I've got an exam.

330
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:00,998
Good luck with your exam, my beautiful.

331
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,979
No worries. My girl is amazing.

332
00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:05,979
I'm more worried about you.

333
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,561
You have to be as amazing as your sister.

334
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,982
I'm going, then.

335
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,982
Goodbye.

336
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,982
Here it is.

337
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,611
Beautiful?

338
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:22,991
I knew this dress would look good on you right when I bought it.

339
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,991
Inn, how do I look?

340
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,874
You can take a look around my closet.

341
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,657
There's plenty of old clothes I don't wear anymore.

342
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:33,432
Pick what you like.

343
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,536
Yes.

344
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:35,374
It fits perfectly.

345
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:37,374
It does.

346
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,982
I won't tolerate you anymore, Irin.

347
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:27,979
Call for me if you need a friend, alright?

348
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,450
(Irin)

349
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,979
I totally forgot to ask Irin to return this to Inn.

350
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:57,979
Later, then.

351
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,805
How about we go to the beach? I want to go.

352
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,423
Sounds nice.

353
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:20,007
It's been a while since our family takes a vacation together.

354
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:25,823
Inn, how about we go to the beach this weekend?

355
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,626
I can't go.

356
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,103
I have an exam.

357
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,979
Should I book a hotel now?

358
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,979
Alright. You pick.

359
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,265
How about we go to the beach? I want to go.

360
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:40,730
How about we go to the beach? I want to go.

361
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,241
How about we go to the beach? I want to go.

362
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,979
How about we go to the beach? I want to go.

363
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,133
I want to go.

364
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,149
I want to go.

365
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:49,144
I want to go.

366
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:50,168
I want to go.

367
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,053
Dad?

368
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:15,980
Mom?

369
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,505
Dad!

370
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,505
Mom!

371
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,980
Mom!

372
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,979
Dad!

373
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,970
Dad!

374
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:36,722
Dad!

375
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:39,979
Dad!

376
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:43,979
Help!

377
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:45,970
Help!

378
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,979
Back to this again.

379
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,890
(Symptoms of PTSD)

380
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,875
Initial symptoms of PTSD patients:

381
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:39,871
flashbacks of their traumatic events,

382
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:43,457
like broken DVD players that keep showing the same images,

383
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:49,108
causing patients to have hallucinations, nightmares, or severe anxiety.

384
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:03,979
If you have recurring nightmares about something, you have to tell me.

385
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,330
(If you have recurring nightmares about something, you have to tell me.)

386
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,979
See you at the park tomorrow.

387
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,690
(See you at the park tomorrow.)

388
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,681
Hey. Hey, look.

389
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,171
He's gorgeous.

390
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,672
What an attractive guy.

391
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,979
He's so well built.

392
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:39,979
She's here.

393
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,979
I thought you would stand me up.

394
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,979
What? What do you mean?

395
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:00,909
I'm just here for my workout routine.

396
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,979
Why is the jogging mode off?

397
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:15,979
Here.

398
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:19,980
Let me see.

399
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,320
Do we have to do it like this?

400
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,669
I can take if off.

401
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,979
No need.

402
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:35,143
Maybe the motion sensor is broken.

403
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:37,979
What are you doing?

404
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:26,025
Can I help you?

405
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:26,838
I don't need help.

406
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,340
You can rely on other people, you know.

407
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,008
Nobody is going to think you a coward for it.

408
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,214
What's happened?

409
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,865
Why is this guy in your car?

410
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,050
Her grandfather asks me to take care of everything in this household.

411
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,610
What are you poking your nose around here for?

412
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,859
Go home, Cha.

413
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,103
You like that kid, don't you?

414
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,103
Don't be absurd.

415
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,506
Dr. Cha and I are long-time friends.

416
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:48,783
He's someone I've known since he was young.

417
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:49,789
You know

418
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,634
I will stay by your side

419
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:54,798
like a parrot that never leaves their partner.

420
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:56,835
Let's break up.
