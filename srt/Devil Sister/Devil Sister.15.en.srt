Grandpa.

Grandpa.

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,019
Call an ambulance.

5
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:08,419
I want to see my will.

6
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:12,811
I want to take care of everything before I die.

7
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:16,687
Cha.

8
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,330
I got you.

9
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:21,989
Namcha’s parents and Irin’s friends,

10
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,179
will they support their relationship?

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,379
Do you know that Irin is dating Cha?

12
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:38,419
Now we are back together.

13
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,229
If I didn’t find this out,

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,779
I would be a fool that was deceived by you for the rest of my life.

15
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:52,214
How could you call yourself my friend?

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,179
Do you understand me?

17
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,783
I didn’t mean to do anything like Tan said I did.

18
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:06,862
Calm down.

19
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,877
Don’t think too much about it.

20
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,779
You know how she gets sometimes.

21
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:17,477
But even if it were me or someone else,

22
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,805
nobody would be pleased with that.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,019
Nobody wants to be a fool, you know?

24
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,579
You did hide it from her for years.

25
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,979
That was bad.

26
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:41,662
But you’re really unbelievable.

27
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,997
How could you keep it a secret for this long?

28
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:46,779
That’s your best friend’s little brother.

29
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:01,179
But how did Tan find out?

30
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:07,220
Did she... see you?

31
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:14,419
Wait, if she just saw you, she wouldn’t know how long you’ve dated.

Anyways.

34
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:28,511
We need to go home for today.

35
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,219
I’ll try talking to Tan about this.

Why are you here? Why did you come here?

I’m a regular here, Paeng.

I’m leaving.

47
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,709
Wait, Irin.

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,379
Wait for me.

49

Irin, where are you going?

50
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,608
Home.

51
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:39,205
Liar.

52
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,819
You’re acting like this again.

53
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,562
Acting like what?

54
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,619
I’m just going home.

55
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:50,419
You know you can’t lie to me.

56
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,219
I’ve seen you act like this too many times before.

57
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:00,019
And you’re acting like you’re leaving me again.

58
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,779
No matter what happens,

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,419
we will still do this together, won’t we?

60
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,619
You don’t have to say anything.

61
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:26,422
Just give me a nod to reassure me.

62
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,782
You do know

63
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:50,419
that you can’t run away from me, don’t you?

64
00:04:53,859 --> 00:05:00,019
No matter what happens, I’m not letting go of your hand.

65
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,179
I have to go.

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,019
Why has it gotta be so damn sad?

(Last Will and Testament)

68
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:55,179
What is this document here...

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
(Adoption Application)

70
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,248
Adoption...

71
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:27,619
The only person who could give me his blood is Grandpa.

72
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,019
But I don’t think he could.

73
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,579
That only leaves you who must have been there.

74
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,979
That’s all the people in my life.

75
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:46,456
But Irin was also there when you were in the OR.

76
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,219
She wasn’t born to do something for others.

77
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,986
That’s why her blood type is different from the rest of us.

78
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,179
Does that mean...

79
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,979
Irin is the only one in the family with a different blood type?

80
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,379
Yes.

81
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,579
So that’s why.

82
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:13,219
That’s why Irin doesn’t share the same blood type with her family.

83
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,379
Sir.

84
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,779
What?

85
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:34,164
Why do you want Irin to marry me?

86
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,980
What about it?

87
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,411
I just would like to know your reason.

88
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,526
Why would a millionaire like you

89
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,979
want your granddaughter to marry a nobody like me?

90
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,619
Is that bad for you?

91
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,913
It couldn’t possibly be because

92
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:59,979
she isn’t your real granddaughter, could it?

93
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,779
What are you saying?

94
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,619
Dad, I’ve decided to adopt a child.

95
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,554
Dad. Mom.

96
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,752
Hey there, darling.

97
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,570
Irin, say hello to your grandpa.

98
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,680
Say hi.

99
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,619
What if one day you had your own children?

100
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,619
Grandpa!

101
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,419
Grandpa, the baby talks to me.

102
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:43,219
I can never accept this child as my own grandkid.

103
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:46,431
Why did Inn do so badly in class?

104
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,431
I told you to find her a tutor.

105
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:51,309
Inn isn’t as bright as Irin.

106
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:55,219
This is your daughter. Why can’t you raise her as well as that adopted kid?

107
00:08:56,706 --> 00:09:00,602
She isn’t healthy. Now she’s not bright, too?

108
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:02,419
Useless.

109
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,979
This is all so useless.

110
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:10,779
Grandpa, did I do this correctly?

111
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,219
It’s fine.

112
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,779
Then I’ll keep it up.

113
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:32,379
I do want you to marry my granddaughter.

114
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:38,419
I do trust you to take care of a lot of things in my house.

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,379
But I don’t want you poking your nose into my family matter.

116
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,779
Remember that.

117
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:50,915
I apologize.

118
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,619
You are here to follow my orders, not to offer your opinions.

119
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,419
Don’t let this happen again.

120
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,619
Everything I do has been thoroughly planned.

121
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:17,979
I hope you won’t get yourself into trouble in the future.

122
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,779
Good morning, Dr. Namtan.

123
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,785
What a nuisance.

124
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,619
I told you I don’t want to go in around this time.

125
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,019
What did the customer say?

126
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,114
Okay, then.

127
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:04,819
I’ll come in to take a look in the evening.

128
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:09,619
I asked someone to spread rumors about that.

129
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:14,105
I bet it’s all over social media by now.

130
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:17,979
Once everything falls into place, I’ll call you.

131
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,635
Oh, Namtan.

132
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:26,419
What are you doing here?

133
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,205
I’m washing my hands.

134
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,219
How long have you been standing there?

135
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,619
I just got here.

136
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:57,060
Dr. Namtan.

137
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,019
What is it? You’re scaring me.

138
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,579
Have you seen this?

139
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:10,226
What is this?

140
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:15,579
"An animal hospital that rather kills than treats"?

141
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,013
You might want to read the comments.

142
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,758
They’re talking about us.

143
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:23,450
They even said our initials here.

144
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,179
I know.

145
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,579
How did this happen?

146
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,979
I have no idea, either.

147
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,880
Are there any recent cases where the pet died here?

148
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,019
No, there aren’t.

149
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,731
Then how could they just write something like this?

150
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,650
This is causing trouble.

151
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,045
I think so.

152
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:47,134
And all the comments just agree with them.

153
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,419
This is bad for us, Doctor.

154
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,979
Who would come here anymore?

155
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,110
What I like about this book is

156
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:03,579
how accurate the advice about each type of pets is.

157
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,237
I know there are myths about...

158
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,219
How long have you been dating my brother?

159
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,085
Since he was 15.

160
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,988
Look at your age gap. How could you do that?

161
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:18,416
There are many guys out there and you chose to date my brother.

162
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,379
Disgusting.

163
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:24,592
...or cutting their tail for health, for example.

164
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:29,691
There are already several experts debunking this myth.

165
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:32,668
It’s very touching.

166
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:34,779
I have no issue with this.

167
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:44,146
Don’t tell my father about this just yet.

168
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:46,779
I’ll deal with the letter on that page myself.

169
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,179
Yes.

170
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,822
What’s happened?

171
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,019
What’s wrong with her?

172
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,579
So what exactly happened?

173
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:10,370
Well... There’s a rumor going around about our hospital.

174
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,019
What does it say?

175
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,788
They said we let pets die

176
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:22,779
rather than save them, even for trivial cases.

177
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,019
What?

178
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,579
How did this start?

179
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,979
Why are you surprised?

180
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:32,379
It’s true, isn’t it?

181
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,419
There actually is a doctor here who often lets pets die.

182
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,219
I doubt anyone would want to bring their pets here anymore.

183
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,579
And it’s the whole hospital that’s taking the blame for this.

184
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,419
Whether we do it or not,

185
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,979
all the doctors here have to be held responsible.

186
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,779
I’ve been saying not to let an inexperienced kid work here.

187
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,779
Where are you going?

188
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,290
Do I need to tell you?

189
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,219
You never tell me anything.

190
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,779
You think I’m a fool anyway, right?

191
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,619
What should we do, Dr. Namcha?

192
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,290
(Namcha)

193
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,690
(Namcha)

194
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,419
Do you need something?

195
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,579
No.

196
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:20,379
I just feel like we haven’t talked much lately.

197
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,897
How’s my grandfather?

198
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:25,179
He’s better now.

199
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:29,979
I thought so. That’s why I came back to work.

200
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:31,804
I know.

201
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,979
Why are you looking at me like that?

202
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:44,379
You must really love this company.

203
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,090
This company belongs to my grandfather.

204
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,419
Of course I have to look after it.

205
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,219
Even though you don’t know if...

206
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,619
If it’s ever going to become yours?

207
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:02,007
What are you saying?

208
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:05,453
I never even think about that.

209
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:07,807
I only think of it as my family business.

210
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,619
That’s why I must take care of it.

211
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:13,179
I feel sorry for you.

212
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,219
What exactly are you saying?

213
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:22,779
Everything I do has been thoroughly planned.

214
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:27,330
I hope you won’t get yourself into trouble in the future.

215
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:38,379
I think your life will get a lot more complicated from now on.

216
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:46,819
But no matter what happens, I’ll be by your side.

217
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,219
I don’t want you to be used like a tool like this.

218
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:26,419
If this keeps up, we’re in trouble.

219
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:31,219
There’s a new animal hospital around here, too.

220
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:33,219
Is there?

221
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:38,419
Yes. They offer grooming service and vaccination just like we do.

222
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:44,379
They will open a pool in the future, too.

223
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:48,645
They’ve been in business for many months.

224
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:53,979
But they’ve just started doing publicity for their all-rounded service.

225
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:56,379
Those are our regulars.

226
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,979
Isn’t that Uncle?

227
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,379
What is he doing here?

228
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,979
What should I do?

229
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,779
What should I do?

230
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,515
What’s happened?

231
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,611
He got hit by a car.

232
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,644
Is he yours?

233
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,644
No, he’s a stray around here.

234
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:44,302
Why did you leave the emergency room?

235
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,617
They want me to pay a 5000-baht deposit.

236
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:49,179
Or else they wouldn’t treat a stray like him.

237
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,931
Where would I get that money from!

238
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,979
It’s the end for him.

239
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,857
Treatment costs money.

240
00:19:56,857 --> 00:20:01,179
The hospital can’t shoulder charity cases all the time.

241
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,579
You have to understand, too.

242
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:07,179
But let’s bring him to my hospital.

243
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:09,579
It’s not far from here.

244
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,360
But I don’t have any money.

245
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,379
It’s alright. I’ll deal with it.

246
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,401
Reschedule this customer.

247
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:55,496
What’s happened?

248
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:57,579
Prepare the OR right away.

249
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,487
This way, please.

250
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,280
Yes.

251
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,379
Our team’s just posted the video, Irin.

252
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,779
We told you last time.

253
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,379
This is the best time of the day for engagement.

254
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,042
Do you normally accept strays here?

255
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,019
We do.

256
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:33,579
We have a lot of rescued and abandoned animals living at the back.

257
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:37,182
Is that guy just now a doctor here?

258
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,979
Yes. He’s the veterinarian who owns this place.

259
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,979
Go all out with publicity.

260
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:59,700
We’ve gone to great lengths to increase the sale in every platform.

261
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,594
If this fails,

262
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:03,580
you all should know the company will have to lay some employees off.

263
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,179
Your career depends on this.

264
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:10,779
Mine, too.

265
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,182
All the veterinarians here are kind.

266
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:19,179
But that doesn’t stop bad rumors from spreading.

267
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:23,979
Dr. Namcha may be a new graduate.

268
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:27,493
He may not be as experienced as the other doctors,

269
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:31,179
but he gives his whole heart into saving every animal.

270
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:33,579
You’ll be alright, you hear me?

271
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,558
I hope you can help me, Cha.

272
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:38,379
Just like you always have.

273
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,825
How could you let this happen?

274
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,619
I trusted you to take care of the business, Tan.

275
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,579
How did it turn out this way?

276
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,979
Calm down, honey.

277
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,579
This could be one of our rivals trying to discredit us.

278
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:05,677
But if it wasn’t based on the truth,

279
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,854
it shouldn’t have become such a big deal.

280
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,365
Oh, honey.

281
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:13,179
You should know how it is with online discourses.

282
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,779
But should this even happen?

283
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:22,500
If it’s on the news on television, what would we do?

284
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,379
You know how the media loves making a big deal out of nothing these days.

285
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:32,622
I’m compiling information on the animals that come to our hospital.

286
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,396
We’ll summarize it into statistics on death cases

287
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,179
and use that as our proof.

288
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:40,779
Will they listen?

289
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,379
People only love sharing about bad stuff.

290
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,579
You might need to ask your friend what he intends to do.

291
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:53,979
What do you mean?

292
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,745
There is a new hospital nearby.

293
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,692
It seems they’re working on the all-rounded

294
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:04,779
pet service idea I came up with.

295
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,699
What does that have to do with this?

296
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,785
I went to that hospital.

297
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,810
I saw Uncle walking in there.

298
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,379
Don’t be ridiculous.

299
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:19,179
It’s not like your idea is completely unique.

300
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,979
I asked someone to spread rumors about that.

301
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:27,579
I bet it’s all over social media by now.

302
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:34,779
I think I’ve heard him talk on the phone about spreading some rumors.

303
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,379
Don’t accuse people so easily.

304
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:44,087
He’s the one who helped me start this hospital.

305
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:45,579
Why would he do this?

306
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:51,579
How are you so sure he has nowhere else to go?

307
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:59,979
You did say once that he was asking to withdraw his part of the shares.

308
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,179
I’ll talk to him about this.

309
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:10,779
But what do we do with the bad reputation we’re getting?

310
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,779
I’ll deal with it.

311
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,185
Have you seen this video?

312
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,016
What video?

313
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:24,690
This vet is freaking cute!

314
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,302
He is!

315
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,619
Watch this.

316
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:30,875
They talk about how to take care of cats.

317
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,361
I’ll take a look.

318
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,154
Oh, he’s hot.

319
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:36,419
I’ll take my cat to his hospital.

320
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:38,413
He really is hot.

321
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,354
He is cute, isn’t he?

322
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:42,930
Totally.

323
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,093
Oh my God.

324
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,779
Can I like this video a hundred times?

325
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,567
This video gives such good advice on how to take care of pets.

326
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,000
Everyone who wants a pet should know this.

327
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,979
I’ve bought the book he talks about.

328
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,924
Isn’t this the guy from that pet behavior video?

329
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:02,705
(This vet is freaking cute in real life. And he’s so kind!)

330
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,786
(I’ve taken my cat to this hospital. They were amazing.)

331
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,179
(The doctor is so kind.)

332
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:15,579
What is all this?

333
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,457
I told you not to come. I’ll handle it.

334
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,379
What is this?

335
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,979
They’re all waiting for Dr. Namcha.

336
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:32,379
What for?

337
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:34,204
Take a look.

338
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,179
This is the sale from yesterday.

339
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,782
It’s a bestseller now.

340
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:08,379
We might need to reprint it soon, Irin.

341
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:32,379
Eat lots and get healthy.

342
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:38,379
Being ill is really bad, you know.

343
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,182
Inn.

344
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:50,380
Take a look at this.

345
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,937
The interview with Namcha.

346
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:56,379
The feedback is great.

347
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,979
The book sale skyrocketed.

348
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:04,393
What I like about this book is

349
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,877
how accurate the advice about each type of pets is.

350
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:12,586
I know there are myths about some breeds of dogs like Doberman.

351
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:15,579
It’s believed to be healthy for them to get their tail cut off—

352
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:18,958
Why are you telling me this?

353
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,579
I don’t want to know.

354
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,979
I think you should.

355
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,579
This is your company, too.

356
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,831
My company?

357
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:32,380
It obviously belongs to Irin.

358
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,979
Grandpa will definitely give this company to his favorite granddaughter.

359
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:41,979
Even when I asked him to help me with Cha, he didn’t do anything for me.

360
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,890
I think you misunderstand your grandfather.

361
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,382
How?

362
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,979
Look at this.

363
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:14,748
What does this mean? I don’t get it.

364
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:16,783
Irin isn’t his real granddaughter.

365
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:22,779
If you think he’s going to give the company to Irin, you’re wrong.

366
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:28,779
Your grandfather is just using Irin to look after the company for you.

367
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:33,579
You think he doesn’t love you.

368
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,979
But that’s not true.

369
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:47,979
You should know that the one who doesn’t have anyone is actually Irin.

370
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:56,379
Does this mean Irin isn’t my parents’ biological child?

371
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:05,979
Then Irin and I are not sisters.

372
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:19,179
I can’t believe the whole thing would turn out this way.

373
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,534
It’s all thanks to you, Cha.

374
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:25,179
Without you, it could end really badly.

375
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,478
Don’t thank me.

376
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:29,051
It’s all because of Irin.

377
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:32,379
It’s all for her publishing house’s publicity.

378
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,725
It’s because of the stray dog rescue video.

379
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:38,880
If it wasn’t for that video of him on the motorbike,

380
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,709
people wouldn’t have liked it so much.

381
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,179
It came at the right time to cover up the bad rumors.

382
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,779
I agree that it was because of that.

383
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:53,979
I’ve built this hospital so the two of you can take after me.

384
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:57,579
Take good care of it, alright?

385
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,465
Cheers.

386
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:08,380
Excuse me for a bit.

387
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,727
Are you guys having a good time?

388
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:14,379
- Yes, sir. - Good.

389
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:32,379
Answer my call, Irin.

390
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:35,979
Are you calling Irin?

391
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,379
No.

392
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,979
Stop lying.

393
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,379
How long do you think you can fool me?

394
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:47,408
Tan.

395
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,579
Are you two having fun?

396
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:53,979
Is it that entertaining to make a fool out of me?

397
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:58,779
You know about Irin and me?

398
00:31:59,145 --> 00:32:00,232
How did you find out?

399
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,632
It doesn’t matter how.

400
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:04,666
What matters is why you lied to me.

401
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,179
Do you still think of me as your sister?

402
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:13,087
Tan, I never wanted to keep this from you.

403
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:14,380
Then who did?

404
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,579
Irin?

405
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,565
No.

406
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:20,379
It was my fault.

407
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:23,979
You think I don’t know my friend?

408
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,382
It was her idea, wasn’t it?

409
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,179
How was I dumb enough to be friends with her?

410
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:38,379
Tan.

411
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,979
I’m sorry.

412
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,379
But it was all my fault.

413
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,779
Don’t blame Irin.

414
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:57,579
What should I do with you two?

415
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:06,979
Oh?

416
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,411
What are you doing here, Inn?

417
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:09,840
Why aren’t you resting?

418
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,979
Inn, you should calm down.

419
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,979
Get out of my company.

420
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,402
Inn, what the hell’s gotten into you now?

421
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,579
Get out of my company right now!

422
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,379
You have no right to have a say in this place that will never be yours.

423
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,779
You’re just a child someone picked up.

424
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,179
How dare you took everything from me!

425
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,890
(Adoption Report)

426
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,779
You killed my parents.

427
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,179
You’re bad luck.

428
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:05,979
You have no right here.

429
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,379
Get out!

430
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:31,179
Why won’t she answer the phone?

431
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:39,918
Hello, Paeng?

432
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,979
Did Irin call you recently?

433
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,074
No. What’s the matter?

434
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:45,579
Where is she?

435
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,482
I went to her house and she wasn’t there.

436
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:49,103
She’s not at her condo, either.

437
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:51,540
Is she at the office? She’s probably working.

438
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,611
She didn’t call me once.

439
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:57,022
Can you call her for me?

440
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:58,558
She doesn’t answer my call at all.

441
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:01,063
I think she’s distressed about Tan.

442
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:02,897
Alright. I’m on it.

443
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:04,779
I’ll call you after.

444
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,779
(She doesn’t answer my call, either. Doesn’t even read my texts.)

(Her car’s gone, too.)

448
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,779
(Where on earth is she?)

449
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:43,105
How are you feeling?

450
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,288
Do you want Inn’s inheritance?

451
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:49,179
Now that Irin doesn’t matter, you’re using her sister instead?

452
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:53,010
You don’t know what you’re saying.

453
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:56,379
You know I love you to death.

454
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,954
I don’t want to wake up in the morning

455
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:03,579
and worry that you would leave me.

456
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,579
I don’t think Irin will come to work anymore.

457
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,094
Where is Irin?

458
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,749
Tell me.

459
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:14,318
She can go to hell.

460
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:15,579
It would be nice.

461
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:16,965
I wouldn’t have to see her anymore.
