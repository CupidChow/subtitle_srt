1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,220
Why did you do this?

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,937
What did I do?

3
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:06,838
You didn’t tell me I’m just some adopted kid.

4
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:11,725
I’m resigning from being a part of your family,

5
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:14,149
and every position in your company.

6
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,512
I want to get married.

7
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:18,019
If it was Inn you want to marry, I wouldn’t even stop you.

8
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,580
Irin is his granddaughter, too.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,453
His granddaughter?

10
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,717
She’s just a kid they picked up.

11
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,379
How is Irin?

12
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,035
I can’t get through to her.

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,717
What do you think?

14
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,776
An acquaintance of mine is leasing this place.

15
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:31,764
It’s perfect.

16
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:32,915
I’ll sign the contract right away.

17
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:37,219
But why are you inviting us over today, Mr. Anon?

18
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,219
I want to talk to you about marriage...

19
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,157
Then you can marry her yourself.

20
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:42,608
Because I won’t.

21
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:45,579
Irin, where are you?

22
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:03,579
This doesn’t seem to be his condo.

23
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,560
How are you doing today?

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,382
I’m looking for a new job.

25
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,871
You won’t go back to the company?

26
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:28,302
I have dedicated my life to that company.

27
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:32,334
I think it’s enough to pay him back for raising me.

28
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,779
Did you know about their marriage?

29
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,022
Why?

30
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,579
Your grandfather wants Namcha to marry Inn.

31
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,619
They look good together.

32
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,019
Give it to me.

33
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,419
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

34
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:52,534
If I can even take care of

35
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,219
a small thing like this, I won’t be able to do anything.

36
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,004
Wait a sec.

37
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:06,958
Can you help carry this stuff to that lady’s room?

38
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,160
Sure.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,619
Thank you.

40
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,099
This is my car key.

41
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,979
Please give it back to my grandfather.

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,579
No. Please give it back to Mr. Anon.

43
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,179
I don’t want anything from him.

44
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:27,579
Then I’ll give you a ride.

45
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,777
It’s okay.

46
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:31,219
You should go back to your work. I can take care of myself.

47
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,568
If you need anything, please call me.

48
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:35,472
Yes.

49
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,179
Excuse me.

50
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,908
I’ll call the elevator.

51
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:43,994
Yes.

52
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,779

How did you know that I’m here?

61
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,419
You can’t run away from me.

62
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:50,379
I told you that I will always be by your side.

63
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:56,419
I’m here.

64
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,219
I heard about what happened to you.

65
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:20,419
Please eat something.

66
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,979
I think you haven’t eaten anything all day.

67
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:29,154
Your condo looks empty.

68
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:32,337
I’ll find time to buy groceries for you.

69
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,819
I’ll move in with you.

70
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,219
Why are you going to move in here?

71
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:42,019
If my family is still acting like that, I don’t want to live there.

72
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:44,854
You can’t do that.

73
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:46,595
Why?

74
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:51,619
Many couples are living together. There’s nothing wrong with it.

75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,788
You have a home and parents who love you.

76
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,579
Don’t you know how wonderful it is?

77
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,219
But they never understand me.

78
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,779
It would be better not to have one.

79
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,979
When I knew that they are not my family.

80
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:15,619
When I knew that the house I’ve lived in my entire life is not my home,

81
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,179
Do you know how terrible I felt?

82
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,979
I don’t want anyone to go through the same thing as I did.

83
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:27,346
They might not understand you right now.

84
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:31,179
They might think you are too young. So they don’t trust you.

85
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:37,219
But when you can earn their trust, things will get better.

86
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,373
Why would you want to move here?

87
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,179
It doesn’t make anything better.

88
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,214
No.

89
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:48,808
You are the one who understands me the most.

90
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:52,780
Cha, listen to me.

91
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,619
I’m listening to you.

92
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:07,179
Right now, I have nothing.

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,860
All I have is myself.

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,845
I don’t even know if I will be able to get a new job.

95
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,379
You know it, right?

96
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:21,579
But you have your family and the vet hospital to take care of.

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,648
Your father is only worried that

98
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:28,779
if he is gone, his children might have hard lives.

99
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,419
That’s why he is doing everything to give his family a secure life.

100
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:37,219
That’s how adults think.

101
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:40,779
They always think about people that they love.

102
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:44,419
Sometimes, you might not like the method they use.

103
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,979
But you know that they have good intentions, don’t you?

104
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,979
It’s time for you to act like an adult for others.

105
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,779
You can’t always have everything your way.

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,819
Sometimes, we need to give up on the thing that we want for others.

107
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:15,619
But I don’t think we need to give up what we want for others.

108
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,367
If they love us, they should try to understand us.

109
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,660
People who are living together should respect

110
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,619
our preferences and decisions, shouldn’t they?

111
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:32,419
You can’t always expect people to understand you.

112
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:39,622
So I think...

113
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,819
We should break up.

114
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:56,419
Is this the adult’s decision that you are talking about?

115
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,219
No.

116
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,221
If growing up and being an adult is this painful,

117
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:10,819
I’d rather be a kid forever.

118
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:14,380
I don’t care what other people are thinking.

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,779
I will only think about my feelings.

120
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,179
Cha.

121
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:27,251
I think I should leave for today.

122
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:32,419
I won’t move in here but I’ll come back tomorrow.

123
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,819
I will come back no matter what.

124
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,037
Cha.

125
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:42,019
Please do what I have asked you to. I’m begging you.

126
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,219
I told you that I won’t let you go.

127
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:54,019
I can’t do that.

128
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,579
Do you want to see me running away again?

129
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:03,248
If you won’t do what I’ve asked you to, I will run away again.

130
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:07,179
Because I don’t want to ruin your life.

131
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,622
Let’s end our relationship.

132
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:19,182
If you want me to be happy,

133
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:26,379
Can you please do what I’ve asked you to do?

134
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:30,019
Don’t come and see each other again.

135
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,419
I don’t understand.

136
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:38,379
Why do we have to break up when we still love each other?

137
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:43,179
You might not understand it now.

138
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,979
But one day you will understand it.

139
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,379
What if I’m never able to understand it?

140
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:56,128
If my life is not better than when we are together,

141
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,580
who will take responsibility for it?

142
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,219
I will

143
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:04,779
I will take responsibility for it.

144
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,819
I promise.

145
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:15,619
No matter what will happen, I’ll be there for you.

146
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:22,819
I don’t understand why you are acting like this.

147
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:32,419
You told me that you would respect my decision.

148
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:00,139
You should thank me.

149
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,779
I let you follow me from the house and pretended that I didn’t know.

150
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,440
I let you follow me here because I feel bad for Irin.

151
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,979
She is going through this crazy stuff.

152
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,379
It’s not because I like you.

153
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,779
Can you have a drink with me?

154
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,179
What’s wrong with you?

155
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,819
Can you drive because I’m going to get drunk?

156
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,857
From now on, you will be happy just like you want to.

157
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:56,140
What about you and Irin?

158
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,044
Don’t worry about me.

159
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:02,226
My life is not going to be worse than what it is right now.

(Jin)

161
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,694
Can I ask you seriously?

162
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,208
Do you really like Irin?

163
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,561
Why did you ask me that?

164
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,179
Just answer me.

165
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:37,179
Or do you stop liking her because she is now useless to you?

166
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,779
Probably.

167
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,179
What do you mean?

168
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,779
I just feel bad for her.

169
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,379
She and I, our situations are not much different.

170
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:55,179
If you only feel bad for Irin, then who do you like?

171
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,408
Are you drunk?

172
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,140
Not yet.

173
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,779
Just answer me, who do you like?

174
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,379
One more, please.

175
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,179
You will get too drunk.

176
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:18,816
Answer me. Who exactly do you like?

177
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,579
Why do I have to answer you?

178
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,379
Hello, where are you?

179
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,779
I’m drinking with Namcha.

180
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,179
How can I help you?

181
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,579
You’re with Namcha?

182
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,179
Where are you?

183
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,580
Why is he this drunk?

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,179
He went to see Irin earlier.

185
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:04,779
Did you go with him?

186
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:09,579
I went there to help Irin move into the condo.

187
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,379
She moved out of the house but you two still went to see her.

188
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,925
Do you start to feel sorry for her?

189
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:23,979
No, I feel sorry for you.

190
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,379
Why?

191
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:32,379
Irin has moved out for some time and won’t come back into your life.

192
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:37,179
But it seems like you are still not happy with that.

193
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,648
She had taken away my happiness for all my life.

194
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,284
She took away everything that was supposed to be mine.

195
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,979
Do you want me to love her and feel good when people care for her?

196
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,379
I’m worried about you.

197
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,979
I want you to be happy.

198
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,379
No.

199
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,783
You are worried about her.

200
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,180
Everyone is worried about her.

201
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,080
Inn, you shouldn’t drink it.

202
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,884
Inn, that’s enough.

203
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:11,979
Let my hand go.

204
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:25,179
Can you help me do something?

205
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,432
Excuse me.

206
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,982
Don’t you feel anything?

207
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,290
About what?

208
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,979
About me sleeping with another man.

209
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,579
What do you want me to feel?

210
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:57,579
When we kissed, how did you feel?

211
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:01,179
I wasn’t serious about it.

212
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:04,779
Excuse me.

213
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,779
What are you doing?

214
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,379
Don’t you remember what happened?

215
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:47,979
How did you get here?

216
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:52,488
I went to see you at the bar. Jin told me that you were drunk.

217
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,155
I was worried about you.

218
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:56,379
But I was too afraid to drive you home.

219
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,779
So we slept here.

220
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,604
I tried to stop you but you...

221
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,579
Stop talking.

222
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:09,579
There’s nothing wrong with it since we’re getting married.

223
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,980
Other couples are doing it, aren’t they?

224
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,579
Why do you want to marry someone who never loves you?

225
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:17,271
You know who I love.

226
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,965
Miss Irin Bannasorn.

227
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,401
Yes.

228
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,340
Please go to that room for the interview.

229
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,779
Thank you.

230
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,170
(Inn is calling)

231
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,379
How did you do that to my granddaughter?

232
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,979
Although you are getting married, this is disrespectful to me.

233
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:34,779
Hold the wedding as soon as possible before it becomes a scandal.

234
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,379
But I don’t love Inn.

235
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:43,179
Don’t talk like an irresponsible person.

236
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,665
Aren’t you worried that it will become a scandal?

237
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:48,520
If it becomes a big scandal,

238
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,579
do you think your parents won’t feel embarrassed?

239
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:55,440
If you already made up your mind about what I should do,

240
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,522
I’ll do as you said.

241
00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,522
But I want to tell you one thing.

242
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,546
Forcing a kid to do what he doesn’t want

243
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,379
to protect your reputation or happiness,

244
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,779
I don’t think you can call it love.

245
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:16,779
Even though I marry Inn, I will never love her.

246
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,855
Get everything done as soon as possible

247
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,979
so I don’t need to worry about it anymore.

248
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:35,979
I sent letters to many companies asking them not to offer a job to Irin.

249
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:39,579
I’m preparing a wedding for you.

250
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:43,179
I have done everything for you but why are you still crying?

251
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:49,179
I’m afraid that when I’m dead, everything will be taken away from you.

252
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,979
Stop acting useless.

253
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:08,379
Do you think you will be happy if you marry me?

254
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,779
You know that I’m pregnant.

255
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:14,379
I already broke up with Irin. Why can’t you be satisfied with that?

256
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,505
Why do you have to make up the lie?

257
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,364
I didn’t make up the lie.

258
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:20,834
I’m really pregnant.

259
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,404
But I am positive.

260
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:26,379
No matter how drunk I was, I would have never slept with you.

261
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,771
Because I will never sleep with a woman that I don’t love.

262
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,379
The only woman that I love is Irin.

263
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:35,979
When you did something bad to me,

264
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:38,379
I would look past it because you were my friend.

265
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:44,379
But you know what, you are making me hate you more and more.

266
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:49,179
Why do you have to make me hate you so much?

267
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,979
If I can’t have you, no one can.

268
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:57,579
You are making yourself become more evil.

269
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:01,179
Even though you can force me to walk down the aisle with you,

270
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,894
it doesn’t mean that we will have a relationship.

271
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,979
We will become strangers.

272
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:10,779
I agree to marry you because Irin has asked me to.

273
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:15,161
I’ve never loved you.

274
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,779
And I will never love you.

275
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:33,577
How do I look?

276
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:37,179
Great.

277
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:54,095
If you can come, please come.

278
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,779
It’s a small wedding.

279
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:07,062
I thought the groom and the bride would give us the invitation themselves.

280
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,979
How is Irin doing?

281
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,162
Irin.

282
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:13,179
Tan.

283
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:14,379
Pang.

284
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,779
You...

285
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,379
How are you?

286
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,979
Um.

287
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,779
We are worried about you.

288
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,979
It’s going to be alright.

289
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:03,580
Tan, I’m sorry.

290
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,179
I’m really sorry.

291
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,508
You don’t need to apologize to her anymore.

292
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,979
She isn’t mad at you anymore.

293
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,980
There’s another person who misses you.

294
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,382
Cha.

295
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,179
Cha.

296
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:35,979
I want to come to say goodbye to you.

297
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,179
I’m getting married tomorrow.

298
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:51,579
I hope you will be happy.

299
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,979
Inn loves you so much.

300
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,979
I’m sure that she will take good care of you.

301
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:17,979
I will never be happier than when we were together.

302
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,579
Don’t forget your promise.

303
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,047
If things don’t turn out the way you have planned,

304
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:33,579
you have to take responsibility for it.

305
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:03,579
The insurance company hasn’t paid for the damages for Inn’s accident?

306
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:05,475
I talked to them on the phone.

307
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:08,379
They said it wasn’t an accident. So they refused to pay for the damages.

308
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:11,014
How could it not be an accident?

309
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:14,379
They sent us the evidence. You can take a look at it.

310
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,379
Why do you look so sad?

311
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:47,979
I told you that I feel sorry for our son.

312
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:43,180
What are you doing here?

313
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,779
Can I use the meal date coupon that you have given me?

314
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,602
Right now.

315
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,282
You told me that I can use it any time I want.

316
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:01,179
And you will come with me without any conditions.

317
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:07,177
Yes.

318
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,979
Stop acting crazy and get out of my wedding.

319
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:16,225
Inn, I have a few questions to ask you.

320
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:19,962
Your business is done. Get out.

321
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:21,536
I can’t leave.

322
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:27,579
I promise Cha that I will take responsibility if my decision is wrong.

323
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:31,179
So I have to come here and take care of it.

324
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:37,100
I want Irin to feel guilty for doing this to me.

325
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,841
How could an older sister not give things up for her little sister?

326
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:42,666
I want her to feel guilty for the rest of her life.

327
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:46,485
Do you think I should intentionally cause an accident?

328
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,179
But I won’t die like my mom.

329
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,971
Because I want to see her feel miserable

330
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:57,440
for being the cause of my accident.

331
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,317
I think that’s too dangerous.

332
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,951
To hurt the woman that I hate, I can do anything.

333
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,779
Inn, do you know this?

334
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:19,179
When we were growing up together,

335
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:23,979
how many things have I given up for you?

336
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,379
Whatever you wanted, I tried to get it for you.

337
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,179
I gave what was supposed to be mine to you.

338
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:35,767
I was trying so hard to be a good sister to you

339
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,379
just like our mom had asked me to.

340
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,979
But it seemed like it didn’t mean anything to you.

341
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:45,512
The more I gave you, the more you demanded from me.

342
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:49,179
You never felt grateful for anything that I did for you.

343
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:58,779
I was wrong and thought that we were family.

344
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:10,779
But none of you ever thought I was your family.

345
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,780
Not even you, Grandpa.

346
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,379
Since we are no longer related,

347
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,263
I think it would be alright

348
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,379
if I come to take everything that is supposed to be mine back.

349
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,779
Shameless.

350
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:32,379
Everyone knows that we are getting married because I’m pregnant.

351
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,979
How could you come and take my baby’s father away?

352
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,379
Are you still a human?

353
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:41,979
Are you sure you are pregnant?

354
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:49,180
I’m sure. I took a test.

355
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,779
Grandpa knows it. Cha knows it.

356
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,179
That’s enough, Inn.

357
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,382
You knew that nothing happened that night.

358
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,531
It’s impossible that you would be pregnant.

359
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,579
How can you be sure?

360
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:05,979
You weren’t in the room with us.

361
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,779
Then let’s go and take a test right now to see if you are pregnant.

362
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:25,179
Jin, why are you doing this to me?

363
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,561
I did all these terrible things because of you.

364
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:32,379
You cannot put all the blames on me.

365
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:37,179
I admit that I am a terrible person.

366
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:40,779
I did everything for my own benefit.

367
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:46,779
But I can’t stand watching you become a selfish person like me.

368
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,287
How could you do this?

369
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:52,779
I’ll make you pay for it.

370
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,102
Do it.

371
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:57,579
I have evidence of the bad things you did.

372
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:02,522
I want to know if I resign from your company,

373
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,177
will you send letters to other companies

374
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,209
asking them to not offer me a job?

375
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:09,579
Just like you did to Irin.

376
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:13,179
Jin!

377
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,979
You two should leave.

378
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:20,379
I’ll take care of everything here.

379
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,779
Cha, take my car.

380
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:17,979
Cha.

381
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,592
Why?

382
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:32,379
Why are you doing this?

383
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:34,779
Why, Jin?

384
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:38,379
Why, Jin?

385
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,779
It’s because of your grandfather.

386
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,846
This is a payback

387
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,579
for your grandfather who has been destroying other people’s lives.

388
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:48,936
So karma returns and hurts people that he loves.

389
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:52,779
You are the one who taught me all these evil methods.

390
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:00,615
Grandpa.

391
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,379
Sir.

392
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:03,610
Sir.

393
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,777
Grandpa.

394
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:05,610
Sir.

395
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:09,579
I never thought that you would dare to do something like this

396
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:10,890
Me, too.

397
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,805
Should we go back?

398
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:14,527
When I think about it again, I think...

399
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:15,579
No way.

400
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:20,379
If I hold your hand like this, you won’t be able to go anywhere.

401
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:25,179
Then where should we go?

402
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,779
Let’s go everywhere together.

403
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,111
Sure.

404
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,380
Let’s go!

405
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,423
How is it?

406
00:34:55,423 --> 00:34:56,496
Is everything alright?

407
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,573
Everything is great.

408
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:00,510
I will be stationed here

409
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:03,579
so I can provide info about our dog training program.

410
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,136
Just do what you think it’s good.

411
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:09,522
I’ll give you a complete authority on it.

412
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:11,259
How come you are so sweet, Dr. Cha?

413
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:13,023
You’re so cute.

414
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,870
I’m not surprised why you have many clients

415
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:17,980
and are able to expand your hospital.

416
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,379
You are amazing. You are smart.

417
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,779
Aren’t you going to give me any credits for that?

418
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,380
That’s right.

419
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,063
If the "I Company" didn’t help us with the promotion campaign,

420
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:32,379
our vet hospital wouldn’t become this successful.

421
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:39,005
So so. It’s not that special. Anyone can do it.

422
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:41,979
To be honest, I can do it too.

423
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:44,106
And I’ll do it for free.

424
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:45,579
Really?

425
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,379
Cha, don’t forget about the fan signing event tomorrow.

426
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:52,779
I forgot about it.

427
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:54,400
After that there’s a vlog shooting

428
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,506
about your lifestyle for our Youtube channel.

429
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:58,779
It might also have a short interview.

430
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:03,579
Of course. I will do anything for my girlfriend.

431
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:08,379
Cha, what are you doing? Come and help me here.

432
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,500
Sure, I’m coming.

433
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:19,179
Hello.

434
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,779
Thank you so much for helping us with the promotion campaign.

435
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:25,884
Cha is practically a celebrity now.

436
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:30,868
Nowadays, no one calls this a celebrity. It’s called an influencer.

437
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,146
Am I right?

438
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:35,397
You are so trendy.

439
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:16,779
I sold your company.

440
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:21,579
I’m sorry that I couldn’t protect it.

441
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:26,379
I’m moving to live overseas. So I can’t visit you often.

442
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:31,179
So I come here to say goodbye to you.

443
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,379
I heard that you sold the company.

444
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:07,179
I’m glad that you chose to live your own life.

445
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,779
Someone asked me to give this to you.

446
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,179
At first, I thought of leaving it here.

447
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,579
You would come and see it.

448
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,531
(Have a safe trip.)

449
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:36,650
(I hope you finally find the happiness you are looking for. - Irin)

450
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,379
Can I hug you for one last time?

451
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:09,579
Promise me that you will contact me.

452
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,179
I’ll be waiting for it.

453
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,179
Do you think you are successful now?

454
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,779
I think I’m successful.

455
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:37,179
Really?

456
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,779
Our success depends on our satisfaction.

457
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:45,579
For me, I’m satisfied with what I have.

458
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:49,155
Although I’m not that famous or my vet

459
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,979
hospital doesn’t have thousands of clients,

460
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:57,128
I have people that I love and people who love me.

461
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,979
That’s enough for me to think I have a successful life.

462
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:05,791
Did you know that winning my girlfriend’s heart

463
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:09,231
is much harder than building a successful business?

464
00:40:09,231 --> 00:40:13,179
But I made it.

465
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:19,182
Who said so? I never said I would be your girlfriend.

466
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,579
You are not my girlfriend?

467
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:22,358
Um.

468
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:25,180
Then what is our relationship?

469
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,579
Brother and sister.

470
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,117
Brother and sister?

471
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:31,060
Um.

472
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,481
I’ll give you another chance. What is our relationship?

473
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,179
I told you we are brother and sister.

474
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,715
Cha.

475
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,179
Let me go.

476
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,429
What is our relationship?

477
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:46,779
Brother and sister.

478
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:50,379
Cha, let me go.

479
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,179
How long are you going to pretend that you don’t love me?

480
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:57,579
So we are just brother and sister?

481
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:05,979
Okay, we are a couple.

482
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,115
We are not an ordinary couple.

483
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:10,779
Then what are we?

484
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:15,579
You are the first and the last woman in my life.

485
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:28,293
(Is it alright to expect something from us?)
