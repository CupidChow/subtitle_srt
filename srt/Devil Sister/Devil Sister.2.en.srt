00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:04,019
Good morning, Miss Irin.

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,385
What are you all standing there for? Get to work.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,454
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:13,942
Fiction is currently popular online, too.

5
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:15,334
Romance fiction,

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,520
the thing that makes people delusional and nonsensical.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,019
Which part of your brain did you use to come up with that?

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:25,979
So I'd like to know if this hospital does home visits for these vaccine jabs?

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,469
What's up?

10
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:30,130
I need a favor.

11
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:33,979
Dr. Cha doesn't do that kind of thing.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,019
You're jealous.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,176
I told you to respect me properly.

14
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:43,176
I'm seven years older, you know.

15
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,450
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,019
Did Irin mention me at all today?

17
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,391
Why would she talk about you when she's about to get married?

18
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,476
What?

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,600
Jin is a good man and he likes you.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,980
I'm sure Jin will take good care of you.

21
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:15,979
Thanks.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,300
Jin, please take care of the wedding.

23
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:22,462
Yes.

24
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,217
I want the wedding to take place as soon as possible.

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,352
Grandpa, but I think...

26
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,979
I'm very old now. I don't know how long I will live.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,979
I hope what I asked you to do isn't too much for you to do.

28
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,979
Jin, please take care of Irin.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,979
Yes.

37
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:25,979
Don't you have anything smaller than this?

38
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,903
So why do you need to change your clothes here?

39
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,979
Why don't you go home?

40
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,429
I don't want to go home right now.

41
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:36,797
I'm afraid that if I go home, someone would go there and whine about Irin getting married.

42
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:38,500
He might cause a chaos at my house.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,979
Why would I do that? It's useless.

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,979
That's right.

45
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,053
You two had broken up for 7 - 8 years.

46
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,053
Why would you care about it?

47
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,191
Are you done?

48
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:53,191
If yes, you should go home.

49
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:05,105
Hello.

50
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:13,979
Inn bought something for me. So she drops by to give it to me.

51
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,902
What are you doing upstairs?

52
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,854
What did you buy?

53
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,980
They are healthy desserts.

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,979
The desserts from this shop are very delicious.

55
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,980
How is Irin? I haven't seen her lately.

56
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:43,000
She's doing fine.

57
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,324
It's been some time since we've last met her.

58
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:47,982
Right.

59
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,490
When she was young, she came here to play with Tan every day.

60
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,490
She was very sweet.

61
00:03:56,254 --> 00:04:01,979
Please tell Irin to come here if she has time and that we miss her.

62
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,979
Yes.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,309
Excuse us.

64
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,979
I will never marry you no matter what.

65
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:29,905
Do you get what I mean?

66
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,979
Then what do you want me to tell your grandfather?

67
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,979
You can tell him whatever you want.

68
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,979
No matter what, I will never marry you.

69
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,982
You don't want to marry because you don't want an arranged marriage

70
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:43,979
or you don't like me?

71
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,979
Maybe it's all of those.

72
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:53,979
I wonder what you've said to my grandpa to make him agree to set me up with you.

73
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:59,002
In your opinion, am I such a terrible person?

74
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,909
You are his lawyer. So you know the details about his assets.

75
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:12,296
It wouldn't be surprising if you would do anything in hope that his assets would become yours.

76
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:15,979
You barely know me. You don't know what kind of person I am.

77
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:17,979
I don't need to know that.

78
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:20,884
All you need to do is do your job and take care of him well.

79
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:22,884
And don't ever hope for anything more than that.

80
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,884
Bear that in mind.

81
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:33,979
You are exactly what I heard from your employees.

82
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:35,979
What did they say?

83
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,550
You're acting like someone who doesn't receive enough love.

84
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:42,403
You're aggressive and emotional,

85
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,838
and acting like a witch.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,235
You barely know me.

87
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:49,979
So why don't we get to know each other?

88
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,979
You've got nothing to lose.

89
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,005
No way.

90
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,979
Why are you wearing that hoodie?

91
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,908
It's Cha's hoodie.

92
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,979
Does it look bad on me?

93
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,245
Drive home safe.

94
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,979
Let's talk on the phone later.

95
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:31,805
Sure, I'll call you.

96
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,714
Okay.

97
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:43,979
I'm leaving.

98
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:05,001
It looks like Irin and Jin are getting along well.

99
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,979
Cha, come and have dinner.

100
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,518
What's wrong with him?

101
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,970
Maybe he argued with Inn.

102
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:25,979
They were fine a moment ago.

103
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:31,979
What were you talking about?

104
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,717
How is your day?

105
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:36,557
You're home late.

106
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,891
There were many patients today.

107
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,703
Why didn't you ask Cha to help you?

108
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:40,988
He's been home since the early evening.

109
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:43,979
It's okay. Let him get some rest.

110
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:47,979
Where's mom?

111
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:51,277
Nothing. She went upstairs to talk to Cha.

112
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:52,730
What's wrong with him?

113
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,503
Cha, it's me, mom.

114
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,825
Yes.

115
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,825
Let's go down and have dinner.

116
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm not really hungry.

117
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,980
What's wrong?

118
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,979
If something is bothering you, you can tell me.

119
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:19,979
Is it about your love life?

120
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:27,402
Can I ask you something? Is Cha dating Inn?

121
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:29,402
How did you know that?

122
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,979
I saw them together several times.

123
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:35,979
Earlier, they were alone in Cha's room.

124
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:39,979
When she walked out of the room, she was wearing Cha's hoodie.

125
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,432
What else could I think?

126
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,205
I don't know.

127
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,900
He never told me anything about it.

128
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
He never talked about his life.

129
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,979
Do I look too young?

130
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,979
You are a grown-up handsome man.

131
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:01,979
Why?

132
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:03,979
Did someone say that you look like a child?

133
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:05,979
Yes.

134
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:15,979
I think there are many advantages of ling being.

135
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:21,979
There are many things that an old lady like me envies you.

136
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,979
What are they?

137
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,979
Courage.

138
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,977
How is the hospital doing?

139
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,977
Overall, it's good.

140
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:41,979
But the vet who is your business partner seems to dislike Cha.

141
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,979
I guess he doesn't trust him yet.

142
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,979
He graduated not long ago. He still needs more training.

143
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:53,979
If Cha is doing well, he won't pressure him.

144
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,528
Then when will Cha get his chance to showcase his skills?

145
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:01,451
Your partner never gave him any important cases.

146
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,451
I feel sorry for Cha.

147
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,979
I think we should wait and see a bit longer.

148
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,979
Don't you see that when people are getting older,

149
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,925
they are gradually losing their courage?

150
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,979
There's no way that they would get up and make changes.

151
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:27,979
Because their experiences have made them fear many things.

152
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,979
Unlike you,

153
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,114
you are a courageous person.

154
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,979
I've never seen you fear anything.

155
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,055
Though you're graduated for not long,

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,979
you have many ideas to improve our hospital.

157
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,652
Instead of worrying about those words,

158
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,979
you should make use of what you have.

159
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:07,979
Why are you wearing that hoodie?

160
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,979
It's Cha's hoodie. Does it look bad on me?

161
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,342
When will I stop thinking about this?

162
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,979
What they are doing is none of my business.

163
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,810
(You can't sleep?)

164
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:47,979
OMG!

165
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,370
(Are you that excited about getting married?)

166
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,290
(I guess so.)

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,810
(Every woman wants to marry the man that she loves.)

168
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,410
(When did you start to share a dream that other women have?)

169
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,297
Here is the flower.

170
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,979
Yes.

171
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,440
I...

172
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Wow!

173
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,260
Would you marry me?

174
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,712
Okay.

175
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,219
What's wrong?

176
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,979
We shouldn't come to this restaurant.

177
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:45,625
It's chaotic.

178
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,628
When will people stop proposing in public places?

179
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:51,979
Not everyone wants to be a part of it.

180
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:55,979
Don't most women like this kind of proposal?

181
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,979
At least, I'm not one of them.

182
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,979
I don't like the proposal and the surprising events.

183
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,500
They did it to show off to other people.

184
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,314
It's delusional and unrealistic.

185
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:11,979
If you really love me, you need to do this and that.

186
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:13,811
Such an overacting.

187
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,591
This is so annoying.

188
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,285
Love is about two people.

189
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,979
There's no need to show it off to the whole world.

190
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:27,979
Then you can't marry any guys except me.

191
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,862
Who is going to marry a little kid like you?

192
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,979
You should spend your time studying.

193
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,797
Hey, I'm being serious.

194
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:41,979
If you marry another man, I will destroy your wedding.

195
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,979
You can't marry another man. Get it?

196
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,611
What are you doing?

197
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:55,611
Give me your hand.

198
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:01,979
My hand is all dirty.

199
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,290
(SHE IS TAKEN)

200
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,979
This is a permanent ink. You can't erase it.

201
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:15,361
What am I going to do if I can't erase it?

202
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,634
I have a meeting with your sister later today.

203
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,979
What should I tell her?

204
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,610
Tell her that we are dating.

205
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,979
No, you can never tell her that. Get it?

206
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,930
(Don't you remember that I don't allow you to marry any man?)

207
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,779
I won't let it happen.

208
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,767
Are you crazy? Shut up!

209
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,521
I won't let it happen!

210
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,948
Quiet!

211
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,311
Quiet! People will hear you.

212
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,160
Then promise me first.

213
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,979
Quiet.

214
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:08,840
- Then you...
- Okay, okay.

215
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,980
I promise.

216
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:13,979
You are crazy.

217
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,979
So this is the advantage of the courage that mom was talking about.

218
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:59,979
Who was shouting a moment ago?

219
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,977
Who was shouting?

220
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,678
Didn't you hear it?

221
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:07,705
I've been standing here for some time but I didn't hear anything.

222
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,554
That's weird.

223
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,979
I really heard it. It was a man's voice.

224
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,330
Was it a ghost?

225
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,300
I didn't hear anyone shouting.

226
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,140
Did I hear it wrong?

227
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,140
Or...

228
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,979
Cha, wait for me.

229
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,979
Irin.

230
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,007
Irin.

231
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,979
Irin left in the early morning.

232
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,247
Where did she go?

233
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,105
She went running.

234
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:24,660
What are you looking at?

235
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,977
I'm not your friend.

236
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,447
Stop staring at me.

237
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,447
I have no food to give you.

238
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,847
What's wrong with you, doggie?

239
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,416
Why are you hoping from me?

240
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:41,979
Stop staring at me. I told you I have no food to give you.

241
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:45,497
The chicken smells so nice.

242
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,979
It also comes with bones.

243
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,979
I'll give it to you.

244
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:55,979
Who told you to give chicken with bones to a dog?

245
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,284
Are you trying to steal food from the dog?

246
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:00,410
It really wants to eat the chicken.

247
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,444
You can't do that.

248
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:03,979
Do you want him to die from eating the bones?

249
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,592
You are talking nonsense.

250
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,614
How can a dog die from eating bones?

251
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,800
It's a dog's favorite.

252
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,765
True. It can eat and swallow bones

253
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,979
but that doesn't mean it can digest them.

254
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,979
I've seen many cases where dogs died because of eating bones.

255
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,979
Dogs and bones are friends.

256
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,315
If they can swallow bones, they should be able to digest them.

257
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,517
Because you are thinking like this.

258
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:37,979
Do you know that bones that are cooked with heat are much harder than raw bones?

259
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,979
Dog's gastric acid cannot digest them.

260
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,979
So the bones remain undigested in its stomach.

261
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:44,915
It's like they are eating pebbles.

262
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,814
If you are going to give it this chicken, it would be better to buy him meatballs.

263
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:53,002
It might be too salty for dogs but it's okay since it doesn't eat them every day.

264
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,979
Irin.

265
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,749
Irin, where are you going?

266
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:13,091
Irin.

267
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,477
Here are meatballs. I changed it for you.

268
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:20,608
There are no bones.

269
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,746
It's enjoying eating it.

270
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:29,895
Can you digest bones?

271
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,979
So take it since you are complaining so much.

272
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:53,979
Do you know if you continue to give him food every day, you are giving him hope?

273
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:59,705
It will come to wait for you here every day,

274
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,814
every day, every day...

275
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:02,785
That's enough.

276
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,654
...every day, every day, every day.

277
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:11,979
That's enough. Stop saying every day.

278
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,808
The dog is scared of you.

279
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,660
Don't you feel sorry for it?

280
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,860
The dog is not that stupid.

281
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,979
If I don't show up tomorrow, it will go somewhere else.

282
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,979
It will follow its survival instinct. Won't you?

283
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:37,411
But there's a stupid dog that is still waiting for you here.

284
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:46,983
That dog must be very stupid.

285
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:49,547
Doggie, you need to be smart.

286
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,288
Don't wait for me because I don't like that.

287
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,979
Okay?

288
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,979
If you get it, you can eat some more.

289
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,979
Irin.

290
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,616
Irin, where are you going?

291
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,197
I'm going home.

292
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,182
Do you want to grab something to eat first?

293
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,979
I came here to exercise, not to eat.

294
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:23,979
But I'm hungry.

295
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,905
That's your business. It has nothing to do with me.

296
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:31,979
But I didn't bring any cash.

297
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,979
You already bought food for the dog.

298
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,979
You should buy me food, too.

299
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:47,525
I'm hungry.

300
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,979
Please buy me food.

301
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:52,057
Please.

302
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,662
Why don't you eat it?

303
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:05,979
I don't want to eat.

304
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:07,979
Hurry up and eat it. So I can go home.

305
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:11,109
Why are you in such a hurry? Do you have an appointment?

306
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:13,195
Yes.

307
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,013
But I don't have one.

308
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:19,854
Hey!

309
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:26,834
If you want it back, you need to get it from here.

310
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,136
Take it.

311
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:29,979
You are a crazy brat.

312
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:39,487
It's okay. I think I'm buying food for two dogs today.

313
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:47,979
Then I'm sure that at least one dog will be waiting for you at the same place.

314
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:53,291
Actually, it has been waiting for you for a long time.

315
00:22:56,794 --> 00:23:01,481
When you were home, it was thinking about whether you would go running.

316
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,408
Would you go in the morning or the evening?

317
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:11,979
So it decided to go running every day.

318
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,979
Isn't it a touching story?

319
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,377
It's such a stupid dog.

320
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,432
Give me my wallet.

321
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:40,813
If you want it back, you need to get it from your pocket.

322
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,524
I can't reach it.

323
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,979
Cha, I'm not your friend.

324
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,802
I really can't reach it.

325
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:50,915
Give it to me.

326
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,985
- Give it to me.
 - Irin.

327
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,945
Irin.

328
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,915
Give me!

329
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:56,767
We are in front of the house.

330
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,097
Cha, I'm not your friend.

331
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:01,097
Are you trying to mess up with me?

332
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,782
I can't reach it.

333
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:04,820
Are you messing up with me?

334
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I can't reach it.

335
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:11,608
Give it to me.

336
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:14,145
Give it to me.

337
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,451
I said give it to me.

338
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,340
Give it to me.

339
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,705
Gross. Your sweats are all over it.

340
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,979
What are you doing? Do you hate me that much?

341
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:45,979
Hello.

342
00:24:49,164 --> 00:24:51,035
Irin, did you go working out?

343
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,030
Yes.

344
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:55,746
That's great.

345
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,979
Next time, I should go with you.

346
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:03,979
Aren't you going to ask my opinion whether I want you to go with us?

347
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,303
Cha, you should go home.

348
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,979
Don't forget your promise from last night.

349
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,979
Cha, go home.

350
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,749
Did you come to see my grandpa?

351
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,979
Please come in.

352
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:39,979
I'm here to see you.

353
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,979
Sorry but I'm busy.

354
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,979
Hello.

355
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:07,160
Have a seat.

356
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:08,702
Thank you.

357
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,979
How is Irin?

358
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:16,600
As you know, she's not someone who listens to orders well.

359
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,979
You told her about the marriage directly like that.

360
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,869
So it isn't easy for me.

361
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:26,957
I'm not surprised since she is my granddaughter.

362
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:29,979
You said you like challenging tasks.

363
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:33,302
Is this task too challenging?

364
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,234
No, sir.

365
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:41,362
You and your father are people that I trust to take care of many things for me.

366
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:45,979
I always think that I have to repay you when I have a chance.

367
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:47,979
But it's too late.

368
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:55,979
Let's think of this as an opportunity for me to repay you and your father before I die.

369
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,506
This is your chance to win over Irin's heart.

370
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:11,979
When I am gone,

371
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,979
you are the only one who can take care of my granddaughters.

372
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:23,979
Irin and Inn are pitiful kids.

373
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:27,979
They lost both of their parents.

374
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,979
If they do something wrong, please don't be harsh on them.

375
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:39,979
I raised them by myself and I didn't do such a good job.

376
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,979
I won't give up.

377
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:49,979
I won't lose Irin to another man.

378
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:03,979
Hey!

379
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:05,979
What's wrong with you?

380
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,979
Why don't you ask your friend to have dinner here?

381
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,979
What are you talking about?

382
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:19,235
Your friend didn't come to have a meal here for a while.

383
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:23,328
You, I and your friend all have a day off today.

384
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,245
This is a good opportunity.

385
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,979
How did you know that my friend is home?

386
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:33,979
I went out for a jog and ran into her.

387
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,979
Oh, I see.

388
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,271
You should call her now.

389
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,979
Call her right now? Are we supposed to call her in the evening?

390
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,841
This is the best time to call her.

391
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,005
If we invite her for dinner, what are you going to serve her?

392
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,608
I'll order it. I'll do it right now.

393
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:55,786
It won't take long.

394
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:57,979
You should call her now. Do it now.

395
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,595
- Hurry up and call her.
 - Alright.

396
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,979
- Do it.
 - Okay, I'm calling her.

397
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:18,954
What's up, Tan?

398
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:20,309
Are you home?

399
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,973
Yes, but I'm leaving for the office.

400
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,506
Why are you going to the office?

401
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,905
I have some work to do.

402
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:31,979
Someone like you doesn't need to go to the office. You should rest at home.

403
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,789
I don't want to be home.

404
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:35,632
Why?

405
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,672
I'll tell you later.

406
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,357
I have to go now.

407
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:43,662
I wanted to ask you to come and have dinner at my house.

408
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:48,608
If you don't want to be home, why don't you come to work at my house?

409
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:49,882
It's a good idea, isn't it?

410
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:52,033
We haven't had a conversation for a while.

411
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,514
Get out of my way.

412
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,979
I have to hang up now. I have work to do.

413
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,357
Stop staring at me.

414
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,432
I only failed to invite her to come here.

415
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,177
Why are you giving me that look?

416
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:28,802
Irin is my friend, not yours.

417
00:30:40,217 --> 00:30:42,905
Inn, what are you doing here? You are scaring me.

418
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,414
Where are you going?

419
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:45,500
I'm going to the office.

420
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,634
Why?

421
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:47,814
I go to work there.

422
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,134
Who are you going with?

423
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:51,720
Inn, why are you asking so many questions?

424
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,032
If you want to know, why don't you come with me?

425
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:55,149
I have something I want to teach you.

426
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:57,093
I have a doctor's appointment today.

427
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:58,662
Really?

428
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,902
I'd better go.

429
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,979
Weren't you going to ask me what my doctor's appointment is for?

430
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,979
Inn, do you see Irin?

431
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:41,979
Your grandfather told me to take her to see him.

432
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,979
She left.

433
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,205
What?

434
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:49,979
I think she is trying to avoid you. So she hurried and left for the office.

435
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,400
How would my grandpa trust you?

436
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,979
You didn't even know she was going to do this.

437
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,980
Do I look that scary?

438
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:05,161
I don't know.

439
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,382
I wasn't Irin.

440
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,908
So I don't know how it feels to get all the attention.

441
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,731
Hello.

442
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:29,979
What's up?

443
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:31,320
Are you free?

444
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:33,320
Why?

445
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:35,979
Can you go to the hospital with me?

446
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:39,977
Who is going with you?

447
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:43,979
If you have to go alone with me, you won't go, will you?

448
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,208
I'll go. I'm kind of bored right now.

449
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:51,979
Where is Irin?

450
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:55,582
Who is she going with?

451
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,829
She went to the office alone.

452
00:32:57,829 --> 00:32:59,208
Are you happy?

453
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,979
Um.

454
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,977
Where are all the security guards?

455
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:25,979
They thought I wouldn't come to the office. So they wouldn't have to show up too.

456
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:39,979
Oh!

457
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:41,466
What are you doing here?

458
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,266
I'm a security guard here.

459
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:45,205
Why are you dressing like that?

460
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,056
My shift has ended.

461
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,979
Where are other security guards?

462
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:53,188
I think they went out for lunch.

463
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,979
What would they do if a thief came into the office right now?

464
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,702
They should take turns to have lunch.

465
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,902
I need to call them in for a talk.

466
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:03,979
I should fire all of them.

467
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:07,979
I'll escort you to your office.

468
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:25,980
Do you usually fire people that easily?

469
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,004
What do you mean?

470
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:37,979
You fired me but you don't even remember me or my name.

471
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,945
(You don't have to show up tomorrow.)

472
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,256
(You're fired.)

473
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:55,205
Have you ever cared for an employee like me?

474
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,530
Thank you for coming here with me.

475
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:17,979
You must be sick of the hospital because you have to come here often.

476
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,977
What else can I do?

477
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:21,977
Though I'm sick of it, I still have to come.

478
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:24,025
Keep this for me.

479
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:25,977
Sure.

480
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:33,770
How are you feeling this month?

481
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,979
I didn't have any symptoms.

482
00:35:36,142 --> 00:35:37,979
Let me examine you.

483
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,000
If you can stay healthy for the next two months,

484
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,979
I'll let you do a simple exercise.

485
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:45,979
Exercise?

486
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,979
A simple light exercise that you can do at home.

487
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,979
I'll tell you how.

488
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:53,686
That's good.

489
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:55,875
I have a friend who likes exercising.

490
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,887
I think he can help me with it.

491
00:35:57,887 --> 00:35:59,004
Alright.

492
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,979
Do you see these?

493
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,685
These are bills I have to pay every month.

494
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:17,979
For you, it's only a few thousand of baht.

495
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,791
For me, they are my whole life.

496
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,979
Do you get it?

497
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,650
(Irin is calling)

498
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,096
Hello.

499
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:25,979
I've been thinking about what I should do to you.

500
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:31,945
I want this company to go down like my life.

501
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,970
Or should I kill you?

502
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:37,979
Should I shoot everyone in the company?

503
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:44,908
Irin, where are you?

504
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:47,503
Irin.

505
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,004
Irin.

506
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:50,875
Irin.

507
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:53,607
What are you doing?

508
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,004
Irin.

509
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,979
Irin, where are you?

510
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:07,979
Crap.

511
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:19,979
You have a way to make me want to kill you.

512
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,813
You.

513
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:39,979
You think I won't dare to do it, don't you?

514
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:47,977
What did he do to you?

515
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:49,977
You must be very terrified at the time.

516
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:55,047
Not really. I was a bit scared.

517
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,047
Didn't you see that I could handle it?

518
00:38:58,594 --> 00:39:01,979
When you are hurt, it's not bad for you to tell people about it.

519
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:09,062
One thing that I hate is a lie.

520
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:12,505
What are you doing?

521
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,979
From now on, I won't back down for you anymore.
