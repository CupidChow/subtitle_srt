1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,490
I haven't seen Irin all morning.

2
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:07,812
Where has she gone?

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:10,019
I think she had something to do with a friend.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,742
Is Dr. Chonnawee in today?

5
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:14,019
Dr. Namcha is off duty.

6
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:15,921
Irin really must be with Namcha.

7
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,610
That might not be the case.

8
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,347
I need your help.

9
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:20,239
What's this?

10
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,104
Your birthday gift.

11
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:23,307
What is this, Inn?

12
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:24,899
It's my will, of course.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,175
I don't want anything else.

14
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:28,770
There is only one thing I want.

15
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,019
Irin.

16
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,519
Happy Birthday.

17
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,019
How did you know it's my birthday?

18
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,800
Oh, Cha?

19
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,870
What are you doing here again?

20
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,662
We already met this morning.

21
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:50,144
It's your birthday.

22
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,707
I don't want you to be alone.

23
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,284
Stop coming here.

24
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,019
What if someone sees you?

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,441
So...

26
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:01,979
Who gave you this?

27
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,979
That's my business.

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,979
Don't tell me it's that lawyer guy.

29
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:12,019
Yes.

30
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,979
Do you have a problem with my gift?

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,799
You dropped your phone in the car.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,601
I'm here to return it.

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,208
Thank you.

34
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,979
I didn't think I'd see you here, Dr. Namcha.

35
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,019
It's not strange, is it?

36
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:34,510
Irin and I are no strangers.

37
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,019
I know her better than you do.

38
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,747
If you can come see her here,

39
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,748
why can't I?

40
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,067
He just came by to wish me a happy birthday.

41
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,450
He's already on his way back.

42
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:53,979
I hope you only show up on special occasions.

43
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:56,019
Go home.

44
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,059
You heard that?

45
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,778
She means you.

46
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,019
Go home.

47
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:08,018
I think she means you.

48
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,019
No. You.

49
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:10,407
No. You.

50
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,052
I mean you both.

51
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:15,053
Go home.

52
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:29,279
You're just her employee.

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
I think you shouldn't get so cocky.

54
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,232
But you should be well aware

55
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:40,019
that I am the man her grandfather wants her to marry.

56
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,877
Don't you know?

57
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,979
Irin isn't someone to follow anyone's rules.

58
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:52,019
But she lets me give her a ride every day.

59
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,016
What about you?

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,000
What do you get to do but follow her around?

61
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:07,756
I think at your age, you should focus on work or achievements.

62
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,979
I don't need your life advice.

63
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,019
I can think for myself.

64
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:14,706
One more thing,

65
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,907
just because she lets you drive her to work

66
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:20,019
doesn't make you better than me.

67
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,519
Once her car is done being fixed,

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,979
she won't let you hang around her anymore.

76
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,979
What are we doing here, Dad?

77
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,979
You should be at Namcha's place.

78
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,979
He left here a while ago.

79
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,977
I'm getting dressed up.

80
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:17,696
I'll be there in a minute.

81
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,979
You need to pull off what I told you to do.

82
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,410
It will help you and I both get what we want.

83
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:26,019
Yes. I'll try.

84
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:31,979
Keep in mind of all the time you could only look at him from afar.

85
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,361
Now, it is time for you to be happy, too.

86
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:39,361
Yes.

87
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:06,437
Oh?

88
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:07,979
What are you doing here?

89
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,979
I'm waiting for you.

90
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,979
What for?

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,089
Where have you been?

92
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,858
I've been waiting forever.

93
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,608
Can't a man have some time to himself?

94
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,019
I thought you had a date with Irin.

95
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,004
Why would I?

96
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,979
Today's her birthday.

97
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,909
Is it?

98
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:37,616
Then why are you here?

99
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,979
Why aren't you celebrating with your sister?

100
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:42,893
Why would she do that?

101
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:46,019
She's never cared about me.

102
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,822
Don't say that.

103
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:50,019
She loves you.

104
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:52,616
She loves me?

105
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:55,244
I gave her a present and she didn't even accept it.

106
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,982
Well...

107
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,979
What kind of present was it that made her turn it down?

108
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,256
Insteading of doubting me for my choice of present,

109
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:11,022
why not wonder what kind of rude person turned down a birthday gift?

110
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,443
I'm her sister.

111
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,906
She shouldn't even turn me down in the first place.

112
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:19,979
I don't know about that.

113
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,019
But I think...

114
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:26,019
Irin is always reasonable in her actions.

115
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,105
Even if she doesn't explain it to anyone.

116
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,114
More importantly, Irin loves you so much.

117
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,306
There's no way she would ever want to hurt your feelings.

118
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,306
Weird.

119
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,330
She never makes me feel that way at all.

120
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,973
Why are you here again?

121
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:52,908
Let's go drinking.

122
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,059
Huh?

123
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,519
You? Drinking?

124
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,990
You're literally still munching on that snack like a kid.

125
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,215
What of it?

126
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:02,019
It's good.

127
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,979
I just want to live like everyone else.

128
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:12,379
The doctor said I could drink a little now.

129
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:18,020
Please?

130
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,846
Please, Cha, please?

131
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:25,554
I have no one else I can trust.

132
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,934
Please, come with me.

133
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,756
If you won't come, I'll go alone.

134
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,811
How can you?

135
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,562
It's dangerous.

136
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,355
Fine, I'll go.

137
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,155
One more, please.

138
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,461
Thank you.

139
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,662
Inn.

140
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,226
Slow down.

141
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,227
You'll get drunk.

142
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,934
I want to be drunk.

143
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,972
One more, please.

144
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,237
Thank you.

145
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,325
Inn, enough.

146
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,257
You've drunk enough.

147
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,762
What?

148
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,534
But I'm not drunk yet.

149
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:41,974
See? I am not drunk.

150
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,974
This is you being drunk.

151
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,207
Cha.

152
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,675
Drink with me.

153
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,525
If I drink, who's going to drive you home?

154
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,974
We don't have to go home.

155
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,738
We can just keep drinking every night, right?

156
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:03,934
I am not coming with you every night.

157
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,550
Why not?

158
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,527
You don't like me even just a little?

159
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:13,974
The bill, please.

160
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,379
Don't go yet.

161
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm still having fun, Cha.

162
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,933
Inn, it's late.

163
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,974
You've had enough.

164
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:32,455
Cha, you're so good to me.

165
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,481
I want to be with you forever.

166
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:37,974
What are you doing?

167
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,826
Enough.

168
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:41,702
Cha.

169
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:42,972
Can you hurry up with the bill?

170
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's dance, Cha.

171
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,757
Wait.

172
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,232
Why?

173
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,974
Wait until it's midnight.

174
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:23,934
What for?

175
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,931
I want you to spend today with me.

176
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,932
Not with somebody else.

177
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:31,934
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:37,934
I said wait.

179
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,934
I'm tired.

180
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,682
What are you doing?

181
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:03,061
Stop.

182
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,959
Did you tell your grandfather you were going out?

183
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,782
I can't go home right now.

184
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:27,159
Grandpa would kill me.

185
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,728
He probably would.

186
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,934
You're too drunk.

187
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,908
Go to Irin's place.

188
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:37,974
No.

189
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,328
You can sleep here for now.

190
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,934
Go home in the morning.

191
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,974
What about you?

192
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,934
Won't you sleep with me?

193
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,934
Hey, hey.

194
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:15,974
Quit that right now.

195
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:18,995
We're friends.

196
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:21,934
Go to sleep.

197
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,974
Cha, are you up?

198
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:58,563
Cha?

199
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,507
Honey.

200
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,934
Cha brought a girl home.

201
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,937
His girlfriend?

202
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:39,934
If she wasn't, would he bring her over?

203
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,974
Don't you wonder who she is?

204
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,181
Who?

205
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:45,974
Inn.

206
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,875
Does her family even know about this?

207
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,876
I don't think they do.

208
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:57,359
That brat, Cha. How could he do this?

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,340
Take it.

210
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,934
How did I get here?

211
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,553
You don't remember what you did last night?

212
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,144
Did we sleep together?

213
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,934
You out of your mind?

214
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:13,934
You were scared your grandpa would yell at you for being drunk.

215
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,636
So I let you stay over.

216
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:17,934
I slept downstairs.

217
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,648
Is that so?

218
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:25,934
Go wash your face and go home.

219
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,447
So we didn't...

220
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,325
We didn't do a thing.

221
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,865
Go home.

222
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,977
Go alone. I am not walking you back.

223
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:49,147
Honey.

224
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,863
Has he ever told you since when he started seeing Inn?

225
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:57,596
Does her grandfather even know she's dating our boy?

226
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,900
When would I get the chance to talk to him?

227
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:01,512
Cha works all the time.

228
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,974
When he doesn't, he is never home.

229
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:11,048
I hope he won't do anything that would be an embarrassment to us.

230
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,934
They're our neighbours. I don't want troubles.

231
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:21,842
But I think it seems serious.

232
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:26,868
Inn is a good girl, and they know each other for a long time.

233
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,934
It's better her than someone we don't know about.

234
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,839
Excuse me. I'm going back home.

235
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,974
Would you like breakfast before you go?

236
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,594
Maybe next time.

237
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,746
I have to hurry back. Grandpa would be worried.

238
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,973
Good, good. Don't cause troubles.

239
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,934
Good day.

240
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:13,934
Where have you been all night?

241
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,934
Didn't you hear me?

242
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,531
I went out with a friend.

243
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:27,974
A guy friend or a girl friend?

244
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,974
It was a guy, wasn't it?

245
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:37,093
You're a lady and you're out with a guy all night.

246
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,524
Aren't you afraid people would talk about what kind of girl you are?

247
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,935
Aren't you ashamed?

248
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,933
You're not healthy like other people.

249
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,974
And still you...

250
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:50,557
Who?

251
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,558
Who is that guy?

252
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,559
How long have you two been seeing each other?

253
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,975
Tell him to come see me if he really is serious about you.

254
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:05,934
Grandpa.

255
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:09,727
If he won't come, then he doesn't know how to respect his elders.

256
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,974
Just stop seeing him if that's the case.

257
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,442
Go.

258
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,443
I'll go to the office with you.

259
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,176
Kids these days...

260
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:30,956
How could I leave my company with someone like this?

261
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,041
Where's your sister?

262
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,464
She's probably getting ready.

263
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,568
Cha.

264
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,606
Use protection.

265
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:45,686
What do you mean?

266
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:57,050
Honey, men like us need to be straightforward about this.

267
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,949
Do you understand?

268
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,934
Whatever you do, just use protection.

269
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:06,267
Don't let it become a problem you can't take responsibility for.

270
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,934
Sure.

271
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:13,096
One more thing, don't disrespect your elders.

272
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,974
I don't want to have to avoid someone.

273
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:20,760
You need to properly respect her family.

274
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,934
What are you talking about?

275
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,974
Your girlfriend.

276
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,678
I'm talking about when you've got a girlfriend.

277
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:31,974
You understand?

278
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,934
Oh, sure.

279
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,676
Don't you know how to knock?

280
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,677
Oh, Grandpa.

281
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:55,974
Hello.

282
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,973
Do you have a meeting today?

283
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:01,059
Yes.

284
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
How are you, Grandpa?

285
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:05,934
I'm doing better.

286
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:11,974
I want to be in the meeting to hear your idea on how to improve our sales.

287
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,850
That's a good idea.

288
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:16,546
I also need your input on something.

289
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:19,455
I think what I came up with is very promising.

290
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:23,516
Good thing I still have one granddaughter who cares about this company.

291
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:27,974
Someone who doesn't disappear with a guy all night.

292
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,974
Disappear with a guy all night?

293
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:33,934
Yeah.

294
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,974
Your sister did.

295
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:49,934
Sir, I have prepared everything you asked for.

296
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,736
What did he mean?

297
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:09,934
Who were you with all night?

298
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,871
Who else could it be?

299
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:15,974
You know who I'm in love with.

300
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,974
Sleeping with someone, especially someone you're comfortable with,

301
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:27,485
is so much better than sleeping alone.

302
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:45,789
How was it last night?

303
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,974
Did you do what I told you to?

304
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,934
Yes.

305
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:55,881
And how was it?

306
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:57,934
It wasn't bad.

307
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:59,529
But it wasn't good, either.

308
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:02,475
Which part was bad and which part was good?

309
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,934
The bad part was...

310
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,631
What are you doing?

311
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,426
Stop.

312
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:32,543
I don't think Namcha is the type to be easily swayed by something like this.

313
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,233
And the good part?

314
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,145
I don't know.

315
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:43,974
It seems more people have gotten the wrong idea about Namcha and me.

316
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,934
His parents, for example.

317
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,974
Not only Irin.

318
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,974
Isn't that good?

319
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:57,058
Misunderstanding would be helpful for us.

320
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,974
I hope so.

321
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:07,974
I hope what we're doing will make everything better.

322
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,115
Of course, it will.

323
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,934
Please, contact some organisation about this.

324
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,028
I want them to go back to nature rather than staying in a temple or as pets.

325
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:33,934
Another thing, I want you to make an informative poster about releasing aquatic animals.

326
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,653
This should be put up in temples and around Bangkok.

327
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:40,681
Now people will be well-informed about how to properly release these animals.

328
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,406
Yes, Dr. Namcha.

329
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:46,429
One more thing, please be mindful about the food for these two.

330
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:49,655
While they're here, don't only feed them vegetables.

331
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,417
Feed them some protein, too.

332
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:52,802
Sure.

333
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:57,413
You've been bringing in a lot of animals to the hospital lately.

334
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:01,205
You should just open a special care unit for abandoned pets.

335
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:03,814
Use that unit to get in contact with related organisations.

336
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,934
Sounds good, right, Doctor?

337
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,974
We can only help them.

338
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,163
Since they can't help themselves, right?

339
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,163
It's our pleasure, Doctor.

340
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,324
Why don't you do that?

341
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:19,161
Do what?

342
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,651
Opening different departments in this hospital.

343
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:26,613
Open a special care unit or just start an all-rounded pet business.

344
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:31,933
You know, things like a pet hotel, a pet gym, or a pet-training school.

345
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,685
I think it's very interesting.

346
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,382
It sounds great.

347
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:38,840
But if we were to do that much,

348
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:41,623
I think I need more time to be well-informed about all of it.

349
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,524
There's no need for that.

350
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,922
You can just hire a great trainer from other schools.

351
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:49,028
Or just start a foundation or something.

352
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,740
All you need to know is people management.

353
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:56,188
I can help you with dog training.

354
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:59,580
My school has been training dogs for quite a while now.

355
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:02,719
As for other departments, I have some connections.

356
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I'll pull some strings to help you.

357
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,456
I'm sure your school's credentials are impeccable.

358
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:11,061
Judging from...

359
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,199
I still need some time to educate myself on it.

360
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,444
I want to understand how each department works.

361
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,974
You're so great, Dr. Cha.

362
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,817
If you ever want to get serious about this, ring me up.

363
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:32,763
I am more than happy to be your business partner.

364
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:41,124
What's wrong with your bird?

365
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:45,934
He won't stop pulling out his feathers.

366
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,486
He also doesn't talk to anyone anymore.

367
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:55,974
He used to talk a lot. Now he only repeats my father's name.

368
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,562
He's your father's bird, isn't he?

369
00:26:58,563 --> 00:26:59,762
Yes.

370
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:01,500
Where is your father right now?

371
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,974
He's just passed away.

372
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:07,974
I don't want the bird to die, too.

373
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,426
It's alright.

374
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:13,018
The bird is just sad, the way you are now.

375
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:17,373
He just doesn't know how to cry, so he's plugging out his feathers.

376
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:18,940
Don't worry, alright?

377
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,497
I will do my best to help him.

378
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:32,632
He's going to be okay. The doctor will take care of him.

379
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:35,934
What's wrong with that bird?

380
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,890
Parrots are known to be monogamous.

381
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,934
Have you heard about this?

382
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:51,092
In the same way, they will only get attached to one owner their whole lives.

383
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,619
You know who I'm in love with.

384
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:59,429
Sleeping with someone, especially someone you're comfortable with,

385
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,476
is so much better than sleeping alone.

386
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:13,263
So in some cases when their owner happens to die before they do,

387
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:19,263
they become distressed, and pull their feathers out like this.

388
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:41,379
I want you to be with him more often during these first weeks.

389
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,641
This helps him get familiar with his new owner.

390
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:48,441
Give him some toys or whatever he likes and play with him more.

391
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:51,525
Talk to him. Get him to communicate.

392
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:53,162
It'll help decrease his stress level.

393
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:54,599
Can you do that?

394
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:59,934
Could this be because of some other factors, Doctor?

395
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,945
I'll run some test in the lab.

396
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:08,414
We'll see if it's because of parasites, malnutrition, or bacterial issues.

397
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,210
I'll keep you updated.

398
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:14,434
But for now, try to spend more time with him to get you all familiar.

399
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:16,435
Thank you, Doctor.

400
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,972
Say thank you to the doctor, honey.

401
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:18,974
Thank you.

402
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,989
Learn to adjust, birdie.

403
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,220
Nobody is going to stick with you their whole lives.

404
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,755
You hear?

405
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:36,367
From what we discussed, there are eight ways to improve our book sales.

406
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:41,974
First, weekend or end-of-month special deals.

407
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:46,425
Of course, many readers tend to buy more books at the end of the month.

408
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:50,928
It is a good time to release new books and merchandise.

409
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,943
Second...

410
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:55,934
Who will be translating the book we just bought?

411
00:29:56,491 --> 00:30:00,800
I want it to be Dr. Worrapod, but we can't get in contact with him right now.

412
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,281
I heard he moved out of the city.

413
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:07,122
As for the online marketing scheme I told you last time,

414
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:10,891
we're still offering special deals from time to time on social media.

415
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,485
Once we get started on podcasts and audio books,

416
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:17,595
I think we can expand our market a little more.

417
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,856
It's worth a try.

418
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:23,734
Does Inn help out around here at all?

419
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,974
She does.

420
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,127
She's supervising online marketing.

421
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,974
There's no problem.

422
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:31,934
It's a shame.

423
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:37,974
It's a real shame Inn doesn't have what it takes to run this place at all.

424
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:41,156
Have lunch with me.

425
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:43,157
I already have a table reserved.

426
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,934
Maybe we can talk about something else, too.

427
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:49,718
Something else?

428
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,934
What is it, Grandpa?

429
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,974
Your marriage.

430
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:06,762
He set me up, didn't he?

431
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:09,974
He did that to me, too.

432
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,318
What an idiot I am.

433
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,208
I should have known he was going to set me up.

434
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,209
What do you mean?

435
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:23,934
What did he tell you? That he wanted to talk about your marriage?

436
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,934
When should we tie the knot?

437
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,974
What do you mean?

438
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,965
I mean what I said.

439
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,966
Are you certain?

440
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:37,974
Do you really want to marry me?

441
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:41,014
It doesn't matter if I want to or not.

442
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:45,385
What matters is I do as Grandpa said.

443
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,509
But I do want to marry you.

444
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,934
And you saying yes makes me hopeful.

445
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,367
Have you told that man to come see me?

446
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:01,974
No.

447
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:03,511
Why not?

448
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,083
Does what I said mean nothing to you?

449
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,256
I've been working all day.

450
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:10,732
So I haven't got a chance to talk to him.

451
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,539
Then call him right now.

452
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:16,707
Grandpa.

453
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:19,506
Call him right now.

454
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:22,617
It's....

455
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:24,618
I said call him.

456
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,405
Yes?

457
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:40,522
Are you busy tomorrow?

458
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:41,972
Can you come see me at home?

459
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:44,073
Why?

460
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:47,934
Grandpa wants to talk to you.

461
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,974
To me?

462
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,163
Yeah.

463
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,974
About what?

464
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,934
You'll know when you get here.

465
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:00,063
Fine.

466
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,974
Thanks a lot.

467
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:03,934
I have to go.

468
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:15,549
Did someone find out about Irin and I?

469
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:19,543
What did he say?

470
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,274
He'll be here to see you tomorrow.

471
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:25,869
Good.

472
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:30,794
I want to meet the guy who dares mess with my granddaughter.

473
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,805
You really must be desperate for my money to want to marry me.

474
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,552
If I told you it's not about money,

475
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,934
you wouldn't believe me, would you?

476
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:48,490
I wouldn't.

477
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:51,512
People only see what they want to see.

478
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:58,760
Are you saying I put up a wall because I'm judgemental of you?

479
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:00,996
No.

480
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,997
I'm just saying...

481
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:05,975
You already have an eye on someone.

482
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:11,934
What would you know about someone you never see like me?

483
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,454
How would you know what I feel,

484
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:18,776
what I think,

485
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,775
or who I really am?

486
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,934
You've never looked my way even a little.

487
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:35,934
I do want to marry you.

488
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:40,555
But more than that, I want you to be happy.

489
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,066
Be happy, huh?

490
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,405
I like Namcha.

491
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:49,974
I need a favour from you.

492
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:54,826
Sleeping with someone, especially someone you're comfortable with,

493
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:57,974
is so much better than sleeping alone.

494
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,974
I stopped thinking about happiness a long time ago.

495
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,974
My best way out right now is getting married.

496
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:11,974
I don't see any other options better than this.

497
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:21,518
You may not know that what you said is everything I've ever dreamed of.

498
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,934
But it would be too selfish of me if I go along with it.

499
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,974
Why?

500
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:35,974
Did you expect me to love you to marry you?

501
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,675
That's just some kid's bedtime story.

502
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:43,974
You should know that real life isn't like that.

503
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,645
I think you're being immature.

504
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:56,962
Because things won't just end after we get married.

505
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:01,934
Problems aren't threads.

506
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:05,157
You can't just cut them with a pair of scissors.

507
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:11,974
What you're doing is no different than stabbing yourself.

508
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,934
You must think I would jump head first into this.

509
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:23,974
Do you really see me as someone so selfish?

510
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:29,934
If you want to do something for me,

511
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:33,934
then let me in just a little.

512
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:35,974
That's all I ask.

513
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:42,365
Can you do that for me?

514
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,463
Yes.

515
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,455
I'll try.

516
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,934
Thank you.

517
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,227
You get out, Inn.

518
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:12,611
But Grandpa—

519
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:13,934
Out.

520
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,864
Yes.

521
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,934
I've talked to your grandfather.

522
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:27,974
He knows we used to date.

523
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,389
What?

524
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,539
He knows we used to date.

525
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,484
What have you done, Cha?

526
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,974
What did he say?

527
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:41,427
I think we should talk upstairs.

528
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:45,097
We could talk here, but it's gonna be a long story.

529
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,974
You don't want to know?

530
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:52,648
You don't want to know what your grandfather said about us?

531
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,599
What did you talk to him about?

532
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,882
Did you come clean about you and Irin?

533
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,000
I heard you're dating Jinn now.

534
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:08,025
I am.

535
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,092
You're good.

536
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:13,049
You get someone as stubborn as Irin to open up in such a short time.

537
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:14,656
If you're not here to tell me about what Grandpa said,

538
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:15,663
then you can just leave.

539
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,193
Get out.

540
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,054
Who is it?

541
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,439
Have a guess.

542
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:27,514
Pang.

543
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,291
Hurry up and guess who we are.

544
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,328
Namtan.
