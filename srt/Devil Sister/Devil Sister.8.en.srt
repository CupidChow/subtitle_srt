1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,927
Let’s go drinking.

2
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,979
Inn, Slow down.

3
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:06,019
You’ll get drunk.

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:14,019
Namcha, won’t you sleep with me?

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,080
Cha brought a girl home.

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,185
Does her family even know about this?

7
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,220
Where have you been all night?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,271
Who were you with all night?

9
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:32,019
Sleeping with someone, especially someone you’re comfortable with,

10
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:34,614
is so much better than sleeping alone.

11
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:36,835
If you want to do something for me,

12
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,830
then let me in just a little.

13
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:43,130
Yes, I’ll try.

14
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,038
Are you busy tomorrow?

15
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,038
Grandpa wants to talk to you.

16
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:48,539
To me?

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,650
Did someone find out about Irin and I?

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,468
Inn, go out.

19
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:58,385
But Grandpa...

20
00:00:58,385 --> 00:00:59,979
I said go out.

21
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:03,979
Yes.

22
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:18,019
Where did you take Inn the other night?

23
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:20,678
I took her out drinking.

24
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:23,979
You knew that she’s not healthy but you still took her out drinking?

25
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:29,435
Because she’s not healthy, she shouldn’t get to live like others?

26
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,435
I feel sorry for Inn, Grandpa.

27
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:35,160
I think she should get her chance to live a life like others.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,250
So you took her out all night

29
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,760
without considering how an old man like me would feel?

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,017
I admit that I was wrong for taking her out all night.

31
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,019
But I insist that I didn’t do anything disgrace to her.

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,450
Your definition of ‘disgrace’ is different from mine.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,361
A woman spends all night with a man.

34
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:57,309
I’m a man. I know what men think.

35
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:02,019
Don’t tell me that things have changed.

36
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,979
Men are the same no matter what era it is.

37
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:04,786
But I didn’t...

38
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,786
I’m not done talking yet.

39
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,020
Inn.

40
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:16,539
What’s going on?

41
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,019
This is bad.

42
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:19,405
What’s bad?

43
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,019
My grandpa is talking to Namcha.

44
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:23,395
About what?

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,922
If Namcha tells my grandpa about his relationship with Irin,

46
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:30,019
Wouldn’t everything that we try to do go wasted?

47
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,979
What should I do?

48
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,019
Inn.

49
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:40,712
Come in to talk to me.

50
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,019
Grandpa.

51
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:43,979
Come in to talk to me.

59
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:35,118
From now on, you need my permission every time you want to go out.

60
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,118
What do you mean?

61
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:40,857
It means you can’t spend the whole night out with a man as you did again.

62
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,857
Why is it hard for you to get it?

63
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:48,019
What did Namcha say to you? Why you are...

64
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,902
I have raised my granddaughters well.

65
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:56,019
Irin is always following my rules and expectations.

66
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:57,979
She has never disappointed me.

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,228
I don’t know what is wrong with Inn.

68
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:01,979
She’s never done things right.

69
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:05,979
Yes, Irin is an able woman. I really like her.

70
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:07,838
Of course.

71
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,979
She’s my granddaughter. I’ve raised her myself.

72
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,151
If you want to date my daughter,

73
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:17,488
your relationship must be monitored by me.

74
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,019
I’m the one who has the final say in everything in this family.

75
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,019
Yes. I won’t let the same mistake happen again.

76
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:28,019
Are you admitting that you are dating my granddaughter?

77
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,979
I’m planning to do that.

78
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,979
Don’t ever think of fooling around with my granddaughter,

79
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,979
If you don’t want your parents to be on bad terms with me.

80
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,530
Of course.

81
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,654
I’ve never been this serious with any women before.

82
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,979
Make sure you remember those words.

83
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:52,960
Is there something you haven’t told me?

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,979
No.

85
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:57,394
Don’t ever do what you did the other night again.

86
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:58,802
Understand?

87
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,802
Yes.

88
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:06,878
It’s good that you aren’t dating someone whose background is unknown.

89
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,872
What did you talk to him about?

90
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:23,979
Did you confess about your relationship with Irin?

91
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,979
Do you usually ask personal questions to a stranger?

92
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:31,045
You should learn some manners.

93
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:34,019
I asked that because I’m worried.

94
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,170
I don’t want him to be confused.

95
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,979
Confused? Confused about what?

96
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:47,922
Irin and I agreed to open up and see each other.

97
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,019
This is good

98
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:55,980
because sooner or later we will get married anyway.

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,792
Don’t try to mess up with my mind.

100
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,792
I’ll never believe you.

101
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:06,019
I guess you haven’t seen Irin.

102
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:10,019
Otherwise, you would have heard it from her.

103
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,019
I forgot.

104
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:18,897
She was with me last night.

105
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,146
I don’t believe you.

106
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,485
You can say whatever you want.

107
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:30,019
But there’s no way I’ll let other men have her.

108
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:36,885
Because her grandpa may already know that I’m dating Irin.

109
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:39,979
Did you tell him?

110
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:43,979
What’s going on?

111
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,979
Why don’t you ask her?

112
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:57,004
Inn, did you tell your grandpa about Irin and me?

113
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,979
It must be you.

114
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:05,979
That’s why he knows that I’m dating Irin.

115
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:12,019
Yes, my grandpa was pressuring me. So I had to tell him.

116
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,125
That’s good.

117
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,400
So he would stop setting Irin up with someone who doesn’t worthy of her.

118
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:35,152
What’s going on?

119
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:42,019
What do you mean that you told him the truth?

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,019
Grandpa thinks Namcha is dating his granddaughter.

121
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,979
That granddaughter is me.

122
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,300
But Namcha thought that the granddaughter is Irin.

123
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,019
This is funny.

124
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:59,979
This stupid misunderstanding is like luck on our side.

125
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:03,308
Both my grandpa and Namcha don’t know the truth.

126
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,718
Yes, it’s funny.

127
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,019
How could this happen?

128
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,980
It happened because both of his granddaughters fall for the same guy.

129
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,019
Even though this happened, we’re still able to stick to our plan.

130
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:29,130
Irin told me that she wants to get married.

131
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,130
Really?

132
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,946
If your grandfather still mistakenly

133
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,019
believes that you are dating Namcha,

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,019
you can use him to force Namcha to marry you.

135
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,019
I hope that we both will win this game.

136
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,979
We will definitely win.

137
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:03,979
Because I’m here today to talk to your grandfather about the wedding.

138
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,094
Irin agreed to date you?

139
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:06,020
Yes.

140
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:09,014
Well done.

141
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:14,019
You get someone as stubborn as Irin to open up in such a short time.

142
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,979
I’ve told you that I hate defeat.

143
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,979
So I’m doing everything I can to win.

144
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,979
This is what I like about you.

145
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,518
I wish you will keep winning.

146
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,882
Of course.

147
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,979
Good.

148
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,019
Both flavors look yummy.

149
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,170
I’ll try this one first.

150
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:20,019
Why isn’t Irin answering my call?

151
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,019
Irin.

152
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,937
Irin.

153
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,207
What?

154
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,068
You keep staring at me. Is there anything wrong?

155
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,404
Nothing.

156
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,900
I heard that you are dating Jin.

157
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,680
Yes.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Is there something you want to say?

159
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,000
Nothing. I just want to congratulate you.

160
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:03,008
I hope there will be the good news that our grandpa has hoped for soon.

161
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:08,019
Cha and I are doing well too.

162
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:39,357
(Every road will eventually come to a split)

163
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,979
(I guess we are just like that)

164
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:50,714
(No need to blame if it’s your fault or mine)

165
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:54,947
(Today is just the day that we break up)

166
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:57,491
Mister.

167
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:02,019
Excuse me. You can’t sleep here.

168
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:03,979
Yes.

169
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:11,204
(Stop acting nosy and whining)

170
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:16,617
(I only said means words but who knows what’s really on my mind)

171
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:21,620
(I’m being mean to you because I love you wholeheartedly)

172
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,057
(But I have to keep it inside)

173
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,770
Do you want me to extend your hotel booking?

174
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,604
It’s okay. I think he has stopped coming to see me.

175
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:33,635
Yes.

176
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,966
(The meaner I am, the more I love you)

177
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:42,374
(Save your love for her)

178
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:57,917
Are you sure you don’t want me to walk you to your room?

179
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,805
Yes. I think he has stopped coming here.

180
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:06,014
If he still comes to see you, you can call me immediately.

181
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:07,469
Yes.

182
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:08,801
Wait, Irin.

183
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,019
Yes.

184
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:16,856
What’s this?

185
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,979
The gift that I want to give to you.

186
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,019
For what occasion?

187
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,019
For giving me a chance to date you.

188
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:30,019
It means a lot to me.

189
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:38,019
Please take it. I bought it for you.

190
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,019
Thank you.

191
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,979
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

192
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:57,208
Where have you been the past few days?

193
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,208
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

194
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,600
Why don’t you get it?

195
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,979
I don’t want to talk to or see you.

196
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,019
Why?

197
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,979
Because of the ring’s owner?

198
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,508
Yes.

199
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,407
Now you know. So stop asking.

200
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:29,979
If you don’t talk to me, I’ll go talk to your grandfather.

201
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,019
Are you crazy?

202
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,979
Would you leave me alone?

203
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,979
I talked to him and he knew that we are dating.

204
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,619
What?

205
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,694
He knows that we are dating?

206
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,288
What did you do?

207
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,979
What did he say?

208
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,014
I think we should go to your room and talk.

209
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,979
It’s a long story. We shouldn’t talk here.

210
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:57,552
Talk here. Talk it through.

211
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,019
Do you know how long I have been waiting for you?

212
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,979
I really need to go to the restroom.

213
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,651
If that’s so, we don’t need to talk.

214
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:13,979
Don’t you want to know what he said when he knew about our relationship?

215
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,019
Hurry up and tell me what he said.

216
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,019
I’m hungry.

217
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,979
Do you have anything to eat?

218
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:36,019
Drop your act.

219
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,404
Tell me everything that he said.

220
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,979
Oops!

221
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,019
I dropped it.

222
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,979
If you are going to act like this, then leave.

223
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:02,019
If you want to know, you have to tell me first.

224
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:03,865
What made you mad at me?

225
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:06,019
Why did you disappear like that?

226
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,019
So you lied to me that you had talked to my grandpa?

227
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:16,370
If you want to know it, then tell me what I did that upset you.

228
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:19,665
If you are going to act like this, then leave.

229
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,019
I only asked why you were mad at me.

230
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,697
It’s not a difficult question.

231
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:26,908
If you aren’t going to tell me what my grandpa said, then leave.

232
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,485
If you don’t tell me what’s on your mind,

233
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,930
I would never know what you are thinking.

234
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,979
Get out.

235
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,019
Get out.

236
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,979
Get out.

237
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,100
Let me go.

238
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,019
Your heart is beating fast.

239
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,979
Do you have any feelings for me?

240
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:11,979
I said let me go.

241
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,019
Get out.

242
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:33,005
Then tell me why you were mad at me.

243
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,682
I said get out.

244
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,682
Tell me, please.

245
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,979
Get out.

246
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,019
Tell me why you were mad at me.

247
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:51,205
You slept with another woman. How could you not know that?

248
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,528
Wait.

249
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,528
Me?

250
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,640
Get out.

251
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,588
Get out.

252
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:08,019
I slept with another woman?

253
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:12,019
You’re talking about Inn?

254
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:16,019
If you don’t leave, I’ll call security.

255
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,801
But it was nothing.

256
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,979
Who’s there?

257
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:25,979
(Guess who this is.)

258
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:29,980
Paeng.

259
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,445
(Hurry and guess.)

260
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:33,127
Namtan.

261
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:35,127
Go hide.

262
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,112
Where?

263
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,468
In here.

264
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,398
Get in.

265
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,440
Hurry up.

266
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,640
Can you get in?

267
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,945
Do you think I can really get in?

268
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,551
(Why does it take so long?)

269
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,980
(Hurry and open the door. It’s heavy here.)

270
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,044
Wait a sec.

271
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,515
Get out.

272
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:02,432
Stay here and don’t go anywhere.

273
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,346
Wouldn’t it be better to lie to them that I came here to run an errand?

274
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:06,404
No.

275
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,979
Get down.

276
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,979
Don’t go anywhere.

277
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,340
Were you in the bathroom? Why did it take so long?

278
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,982
What are you looking for?

279
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,019
I think I heard a man’s voice.

280
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:38,540
I might come from the next room.

281
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,506
Really?

282
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:42,872
But I think it’s from your room.

283
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,573
Are you crazy?

284
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:47,367
There’s no man in here. How could there be?

285
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:48,595
What are you doing here?

286
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,979
Why don’t you tell me in advance?

287
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,608
It’s a surprise.

288
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:55,697
Happy belated birthday, my friend.

289
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,697
Tan and I just have free time today.

290
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,164
But I didn’t forget your birthday.

291
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,736
So we bought many things to celebrate with you.

292
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:04,019
Let’s have a long party tonight.

293
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,610
Why don’t we dine out?

294
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,854
I have many great restaurants to introduce to you.

295
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,680
We bought a lot of stuff already.

296
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,979
I don’t want to go out. Let’s dine here.

297
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:17,979
We can have a drink together. Let’s party here.

298
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,351
We can party until dawn. That’s good.

299
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:24,851
Or do you want to get a new atmosphere by drinking on the balcony?

300
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,413
No, no, no.

301
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,019
You can’t go there.

302
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,921
Put it back.

303
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:32,921
Why?

304
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:36,308
It’s going to rain soon.

305
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,854
Didn’t you hear the thunder when we were driving here?

306
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,103
I see.

307
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,583
It’s about to rain.

308
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,285
I heard that it is a storm. So we should drink inside.

309
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,285
Okay.

310
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,019
The rain is coming.

311
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,917
I also want to go to the bathroom.

312
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,247
How bad could it be?

313
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:19,979
(Happy birthday to you)

314
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:24,712
(Happy birthday, happy birthday)

315
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:29,601
(Happy birthday to you)

316
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:34,619
I already blew the candles. You two can go home now.

317
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:39,970
Hey, we just got here.

318
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,894
It’s raining heavily. The traffic must be really bad.

319
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,019
We already drank the wine. How could we drive?

320
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,454
I think I should watch a drama series.

321
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,856
Sure, I want to see handsome actors.

322
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,386
Let’s do it.

323
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:54,496
I like it.

324
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,312
Where are you going?

325
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,019
Aren’t you going to watch it with us?

326
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,979
I’m going to the bathroom.

327
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,346
I’ll be right back.

328
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:07,979
I want to see a series about high school life.

329
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,188
Namcha.

330
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:40,808
Take it.

331
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:46,970
I need to go to the bathroom.

332
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:48,394
You can’t.

333
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,776
They are still inside.

334
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:51,945
Do you want me to let it out here?

335
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,785
I’m going to do it now.

336
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,954
No.

337
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,979
You may be spotted.

338
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:57,765
Can I go in?

339
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,508
No.

340
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,020
I said you can’t.

341
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,979
Then what do you want me to do?

342
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:04,571
Let it out over the balcony.

343
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:05,825
What?

344
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:07,022
Over the balcony?

345
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,522
It might hit someone below.

346
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:09,979
Are you crazy?

347
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,019
Then what do you want me to do?

348
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:19,306
The electricity is out.

349
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,185
I thought you didn’t fear anything.

350
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,019
But actually, you are afraid of darkness.

351
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:32,797
Who’s afraid?

352
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,284
Get your phone. Hurry.

353
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:38,019
I got it.

354
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:43,154
Irin, where are you?

355
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:44,758
Please turn on the light.

356
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,888
Let’s go this way, shall we?

357
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:48,062
Irin.

358
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:50,531
Irin, turn on the light.

359
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,979
This is the chance.

360
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,779
What chance?

361
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:54,962
I’m going to the bathroom.

362
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:55,979
No.

363
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,979
You are so mean.

364
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:06,019
Don’t go.

365
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,980
Then follow me.

366
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,201
Why do I need to come to the bathroom with you?

367
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:27,979
You are afraid of darkness, aren’t you?

368
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:31,979
Since it’s dark in here, you won’t see my private part.

369
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:35,979
I know that but I don’t want to hear the sound as well.

370
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:39,979
Did you hear a man’s voice?

371
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:42,794
Irin.

372
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,571
The light is on.

373
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:47,481
That’s true.

374
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:58,019
Why did you turn my way?

375
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:00,585
Your friends would see us.

376
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:06,019
Irin, are you with someone?

377
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:07,979
How would there be someone else?

378
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:10,960
Who would bring someone to the bathroom with them?

379
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,650
But you are okay, aren’t you?

380
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,881
When the light went out, you weren’t afraid, were you?

381
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,789
I’m okay. You can go watch your series.

382
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,789
I’m not done yet.

383
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,010
Okay.

384
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:29,014
Let’s go and watch our series.

385
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,014
We’re going now.

386
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,019
What should we do now?

387
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,979
I’ll take them to my bedroom.

388
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:03,124
Then you get out of the room as soon as possible.

389
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:03,980
Do you get it?

390
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,019
Okay.

391
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,595
You’ve been in the bathroom for some time.

392
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,737
It was so chaotic when the light went out.

393
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,737
Why are you so wet?

394
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,603
When the light went out, I was surprised

395
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:38,757
and accidentally turn on the shower.

396
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,364
Were you that surprised?

397
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,762
I’ll go get changed.

398
00:27:46,786 --> 00:27:49,545
I have many clothes that I bought but they don’t fit me.

399
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:50,771
Do you want to go and try them on?

400
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:52,577
- Sure. - Me, too.

401
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,848
Let’s go.

402
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:55,102
Follow me.

403
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:57,102
Okay, let’s go.

404
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:02,509
I’m walking to my bedroom.

405
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,428
I’m almost there.

406
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:07,752
Who are you talking to?

407
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,893
I’m talking to you. So you will know where we are heading to.

408
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:12,893
I think you are drunk.

409
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:58,925
Will your café be opened today? The owner is having a bad hangover.

410
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,903
I already called and told my staff to take care of it.

411
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:04,477
What about you? Are you going to work today?

412
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:09,309
I told Namcha to cover for me since I’ll be late today.

413
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:11,665
Good morning.

414
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:13,665
Jin.

415
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,640
This is Paeng and Namtan. They are my friends.

416
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,469
This is Jin.

417
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:23,979
Hello, Jin. Nice to meet you.

418
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:29,797
You’re Namcha’s sister who is living next door to Irin’s house.

419
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:31,797
Did you know me?

420
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,797
How wouldn’t I know you?

421
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,445
I must be so pretty that he remembers me.

422
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:39,979
Calm down.

423
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:46,951
You are the owner of the café that Irin has shares in.

424
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:50,019
Did you know me?

425
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,961
I know all of Irin’s friends.

426
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,727
Why didn’t you introduce him to us?

427
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:02,902
Jin is working at my office. My grandpa asked him to give me a ride.

428
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,980
Then you are giving her a ride every day?

429
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:08,963
Yes.

430
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:12,965
Why don’t you tell us that someone is giving you a ride every day?

431
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,317
It’s nothing. You two should go to work.

432
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:19,554
We won’t stay here and be your third wheel.

433
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:22,017
Let’s go, Tan.

434
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,194
Please excuse us, Jin.

435
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,432
Please take care of my friend.

436
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:30,016
Bye.

437
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,019
You never told them about me?

438
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:43,979
I guess your friend had never heard of my name before.

439
00:31:45,284 --> 00:31:47,979
Why does that matter?

440
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,386
Nothing.

441
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:55,979
It means I am no one to you all this time.

442
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,810
But earlier I introduced you to them.

443
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:02,019
Right.

444
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,977
You haven’t opened the gift that I gave you, have you?

445
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,952
No.

446
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,979
Is there something wrong?

447
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:26,019
No.

448
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:29,697
Please come this way.

449
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:41,364
Where had you been last night? Why did you come to work late today?

450
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,979
I slept over at Irin’s condo.

451
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:47,632
Irin has a boyfriend.

452
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,779
What?

453
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,017
Who?

454
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:55,979
I don’t know but he’s giving her a ride every day.

455
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:57,854
How did you know that he’s her boyfriend?

456
00:32:57,854 --> 00:32:59,979
Maybe he’s not.

457
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,377
Maybe he’s her driver.

458
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:06,019
How can a driver be that good-looking?

459
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,345
He also knows who I am.

460
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,794
Good looking? How?

461
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:14,019
Your brother is more handsome than him.

462
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:18,019
He is calm and mature.

463
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:19,608
He’s much better than you.

464
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,822
When do I act immature?

465
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,373
All the time.

466
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,934
You are impatient, frivolous, hot-headed, and unsettled.

467
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:35,432
Jin is calm and discreet. He’s so different from you.

468
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:41,342
In this era, you should be looking for someone who is active and agile.

469
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:43,463
If you are moving as slow as a turtle,

470
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:46,019
how would you keep up with the world?

471
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:47,979
Are you saying you are a rabbit?

472
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:51,565
A turtle.

473
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,068
How did it get here?

474
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,315
There you are.

475
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:57,558
I’m sorry.

476
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,979
You’ve come so far.

477
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:04,906
It’s a little unwell.

478
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,275
What’s wrong with the rabbit?

479
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,019
It seems to have a problem with the excretion.

480
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,805
It’ll be alright.

481
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,813
I’ll examine the rabbit. You go and examine the turtle.

482
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:20,019
Why?

483
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:25,970
I don’t like those who do things slowly and act calmly.

484
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,019
They rub me the wrong way.

485
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:33,078
Okay. Then take good care of it.

486
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:35,654
- Please come this way. - Yes.

487
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,160
Come in.

488
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,816
Let’s go in.

489
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,617
Bunny, you need to win it.

490
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:45,979
I’ll give you the best treatment.

491
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,605
What’s up?

492
00:34:57,605 --> 00:35:00,019
When will you have free time?

493
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,979
Why?

494
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,948
I want to ask you to drop by and have a chat at my café.

495
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,700
I was drunk last night. So I don’t remember

496
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,200
anything about our conversation.

497
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:09,979
Um.

498
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,979
Why don’t you take Jin with you?

499
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,979
Okay, I’ll ask him to go with me.

500
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,019
That’s it.

501
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,510
What’s wrong with her?

502
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,979
Eat a lot. So you will get better soon.

503
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:47,303
What’s going on?

504
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:49,303
About Irin’s boyfriend?

505
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:52,823
What? Irin’s boyfriend? Why?

506
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:55,979
Irin agreed to officially introduce him to us.

507
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:58,019
What did you say?

508
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:37,108
It’s all because of Irin.

509
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:40,810
Without her, my life would be better.

510
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,641
Irin has never introduced her boyfriend to us.

511
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,822
You are her first boyfriend.

512
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:48,722
What boyfriend? She never told me that she has a boyfriend.

513
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:53,084
You are well aware that Irin will marry me eventually.

514
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:57,285
Irin doesn’t love you. How could you be so brazen and marry her?

515
00:36:57,285 --> 00:37:00,019
I haven’t lost yet because this game isn’t over.

516
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:04,019
It’s normal for a couple to have problems sometimes.

517
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:07,194
But she’s acting like she doesn’t care about me.

518
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,760
Then why don’t you give her a taste of what it’s like to live without you?

519
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,890
She may realize how much you mean to her.
