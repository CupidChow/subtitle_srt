00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,320
I like you.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,580
I know that already.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm hitting on you now.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,660
If you want to hit on me, then go ahead and hit on me. If you want to like me, then go ahead and like me.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,380
I just… I don't know if I feel okay with you yet.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,920
What is love?

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,220
It means Pete.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,740
Why is what I see... only pain?

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,060
I don't want to be like you, Ai'Ae.

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,560
- Why are you avoiding me?
- Who's avoiding you? Are you just overthinking it?

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,520
You're avoiding me.

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,800
But I'm still glad. Because it means that you're finally starting to think of me.

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,040

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,760
What's wrong?

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,020
I don't understand.

18

If... I like you or not.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,260
Just eating and watching movies together, it's...

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,580
Isn't that enough?

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,540
Why do we have to be in a relationship?

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,500
Because you're the air I breathe.

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,120
When I'm with my family,

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,400
I feel like my head is being pushed down and I'm drowning in water.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,340
I can't breathe. It's like I'm suffocating to death.

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,400
But when I'm with you,

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,960
it's like you've pulled me out and allowed me to breathe again.

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,920
I still don't really understand.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,480
Look at Ai'Ae.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,800
Ae still has to sit around being sad. I don't want to be like Ai'Ae.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,440
If we…

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,780
aren't together, then maybe the two of us might not have to be sad.

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
I don't see how it's a big deal at all...

Your big brother will be back soon.

Leave it until we can eat together.

All right, Can is finally home. Come. Come eat together.

73

I didn't even eat first. Don't scold me. I'm too tired to listen.

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,500
That's right. Did you do anything to your older brother?

I'll sit with you, all right, Tin?

160
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,320
You can sit wherever you like.

161
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,580
I'm not the owner of the university.

162
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,680
Soon, it'll be time for the University Football Tournament.

163
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,000
You guys need to try to work harder.

164
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,860
Do you remember the pain of losing during the second round?

165
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,440
This time... don't let it happen again.

166
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,560
But I'm not sad at all. Because I just joined the team this year.

167
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,400
You and Can really are friends.

168
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,320
Geez...

169
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,180
You don't need to spoil them so much, you know.

170
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,100
Ai'Type ditching me and getting a hubby is already bad enough.

171
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,920
Dude, you're really...

172
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,640
Whatever, forget it. Just do what you want.

173
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,260
So where'd the albino monkey go? Where'd he disappear off to?

174
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,160
Shit!

175
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Since when did you get here?!

176
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,120
Not even making a sound... my heart stopped, Ai'Can!

177
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
What happened to your face?

178
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,100
You look so gloomy like you were hexed.

179
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,900
Can you guys help me eat this?

180
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,520
I already bought it, but I don't have an appetite.

181
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,760
Someone like you doesn't have an appetite?

182
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,360
Someone like Ai'Can doesn't have an appetite?

183
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,680
You guys can go to practice now. Go, go.

184
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,120
Hey. Ae.

185
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,040
You're not going back yet? It's already late.

186
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,200
What time is it now?

187
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000
It's already 9.30 p.m.

188
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,060
P'No is so harsh.

189
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
I really want to know

190
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,100
between going to the final match or dying first,

191
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,680
which one will come first.

192
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm so damn tired today, too.

193
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,640
Ai'Tin.

194
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,360
What's with you? Suddenly talking about Ai'Tin...

195
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,140
The reason that you're like this... is because of Ai'Tin, right?

196
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,720
Is it because my answer wasn't clear enough?

197
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
What question are you talking about?

198
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,740
I haven't even asked you any questions yet.

199
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,040
You're missing Ai'Pete so bad that you're starting to lose it, dude.

200
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,100
Have you taken a look at yourself?

201
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,780
You're sad about Ai'Tin.

202
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,840
To the point that you're losing it, too.

203
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,300
Listen to me, Ai'Can.

204
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,260
I told you before that love to me is Ai'Pete.

205
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,080
And if he were to stand right here,

206
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,420
I wouldn't hesitate to pull him in for a hug.

207
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
I would protect him.

208
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
I would stay by his side.

209
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,400
Even if your brain can't understand that,

210
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,400
but shouldn't your heart understand it?

211
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,360
If there's something, then you should have a good talk together.

212
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,380
Trust me.

213
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,460
All right. Then I'll go talk to him.

214
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,500
Thank you so much.

215
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,940
You really are the best kind of friend.

216
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,640
Fighting.

217
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm going to go get changed first then.

218
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,160
It'd be good if you were with me.

219
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,960
P'No.

220
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,380
Are you running away from me?

221
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,200
No...

222
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm not running away.

223
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,060
You're just overthinking it, Ai'Kla.

224
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,400
What about when I went to your house and didn't see you?

225
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Or the time when you climbed out of your window?

226
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,800
Doesn't that mean you're running away from me?

227
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,480
I wasn't running away from the window... but from the balcony instead...

228
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,740
So what do you have to say? Just say it then...

229
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,360
I want to quickly go home to shower and sleep already.

230
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,580
I really like you, P'No.

231
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:49,011
It's...

232
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,140
It's true I might have lied to you.

233
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,660
That that night you were the one who started it.

234
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,780
But the thing I never lied to you about...

235
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,460
is that I really like you, P'No.

236
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,100
I liked you for such a long time.

237
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,520
I liked you since the first time we met.

238
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,700
But the thing that you lied to me about...

239
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,060
That's still the truth, isn't it?

240
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,180
I told you already, that right now...

241
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,640
I have nothing to say to you.

242
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm going to go now, all right?

243
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,920
P'No.

244
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,380
What is it?

245
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,100
At least, can I please take you home?

246
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Please.

247
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
Is this his car?

248
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,640
He still hasn't left yet?

249
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,580
How should I start the conversation?

250
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,620
It's pretty late now, huh?

251
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,300
Yeah.

252
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,540
If I didn't have your help, I would've been screwed.

253
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,500
And you even offered to drop me off, too.

254
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,960
Thank you.

255
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,360
Yeah.

256
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,440
I shouldn't have hidden behind his car.

257
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,300
Ai'Tum! Ai'Tum!

258
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,440
This one!

259
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,720
The one I told you about.

260
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,700
Today, he posted a picture again.

261
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,120
This is the younger guy I told you about. That always posts a picture every day.

262
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,760
Along with a caption as if he's talking to someone.

263
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,180
But he never tags anyone.

264
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,820
And as I was looking through it,

265
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,740
he really does post a picture every day, dude.

266
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,560
Like... a diary.

267
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,540
What he did today, what he did, who he's with...

268
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,720
Here, you should take a look.

269
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,380
I don't see how it's strange at all.

270
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,800
Don't people who use FB always do that?

271
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,140
So…

272
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,860
why do you think he's interesting?

273
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,720
I don't know, dude. You should try taking a look.

274
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,020
It's like the pictures he posts are trying to communicate something...

275
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,660
It's like he's trying to say something, dude.

276
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,820
But if you're not interested, then…

277
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,040
Who said that I wasn't interested?

278
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,980
Well, you said...

279
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,420
I was just asking.

280
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,520
I trust your intuition.

281
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,620
Then, should we go try to meet him?

282
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,700
How?

283
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,840
Dude, he is studying engineering at our university.

284
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,380
It won't be hard to find him.

285
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,560
All right.

286
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,600
If you think that's a good idea, then I think it's a good idea, too.

287
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,300
Great.

288
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,460
Dude.

289
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,860
I think I got it.

290
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,260
Hey!

291
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,900
This is okay, bro. We finally have a game plan.

292
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,940
This should work.

293
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,540
Whatever you say, I'll agree with you.

294
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,460
Thanks alot, dude.

295
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,370
I really believe...

296
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,760
that this time, if we're able to do it,

297
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,980
I have faith we could be the champs.

298
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,120
Wow, hot and spicy.

299
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,440
Tin!

300
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,540
Tin!

301
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,480
Why are you walking so fast? Wait for me.

302
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,200
Thank you for dropping me off last night in front of the university.

303
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,840
My friends are really terrible.

304
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,700
Not a single one of them waited for me.

305
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,640
So I had to bother you.

306
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,158
Thank you so much.

307
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,120
Calm down, Ai'Can. Calm down. Don't overthink it yet.

308
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,060
Wait to talk to Ai'Tin first.

309
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,120
Right, Tin...

310
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,040
Can I ask you something?

311
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,980
Tin, do you have a girlfriend yet?

312
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,340
I don't have one.

313
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,260
Then...

314
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,960
do you want to be my boyfriend?

315
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,240
There will never be a day where I choose a person like you to be my girlfriend.

316
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,440
And stop bothering me already.

317
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,060
It's really annoying.

318
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,500
You idiot!

319
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,440
Give me another one!

320
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,020
You're pretentious!

321
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,080
You rich show-off!

322
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,820
Give it to me!

323
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,740
Didn't you say I was your air?

324
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,280
So, why the hell are you breathing air from someone else?!

325
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
Give me another one!

326
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,380
There aren't any left!

327
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,960
How can there not be any left?! I want to practice!

328
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
Geez!

329
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,060
I ran around collecting them for you for half an hour already!

330
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,320
Just look!

331
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,840
Just collect the balls yourself. I'm off.

332
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,960
Didn't you say you liked me?

333
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,980
Ai'Job!

334
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Come here.

335
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,560
Dude, what's wrong with Can?

336
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,060
Right, bro?

337
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,520
He's been like this for the whole week already.

338
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,160
You tell him no, and he won't listen.

339
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,740
Is he going to be okay?

340
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,180
How can he be okay?

341
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,240
He's practicing that hard,

342
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,480
maybe he wants the World Cup.

343
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,180
Then...

344
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,960
You... You should stop him.

345
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,120
If I could stop him, then he wouldn't be Ai'Can.

346
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,740
Although I'm handsome and this cool,

347
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,920
I can't do everything you know.

348
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,900
Why don't you have Ai'Ae go in and check on him?

349
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,132
He listens to Ae more than me.

350
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,010
Right...

351
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,380
Ae, go stop Ai'Can.

352
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,320
Look.

353
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,480
He's not a little monkey anymore.

354
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,387
He's like a rabid dog.

355
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,860
Hey, Ae!

356
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,700
Another one, too?

357
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,940
Why don't you guys just have a good talk?

358
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,840
What does it have to do with you?

359
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,960
He going to practice too hard.

360
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,340
If you're worried, why don't you go in?

361
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,660
How can I do that?

362
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,560
Why can't you do it?

363
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,920
At least Ai'Can is right in front of you.

364
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,640
Once he's no longer by your side,

365
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,800
it'll be torture you know.

366
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,980
Well, he doesn't like me,

367
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,460
like how Pete likes you.

368
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,320
How do you know

369
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,580
that Ai'Can doesn't really like you?

370
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,000
Tomorrow, we're going to have a match.

371
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,540
You should come support him.

372
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,940
I think Ai'Can would probably want you to come and cheer him on.

373
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,240
Why are you helping me?

374
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,720
Then, why the hell did you help me when Pete's dad was going to expel me?

375
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,120
Because Pete asked me to.

376
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
That's right.

377
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,900
Because you're Ai'Pete's friend.

378
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,980
Give Ai'Can a bit of time.

379
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,220
Him not understanding it,

380
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,580
doesn't mean that he doesn't feel anything.

381
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,440
What's wrong with you, Ai'Can?

382
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,620
It's because I'm nervous, P'No!

383
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,700
We're about to start the match you know!

384
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,780
What are you nervous about? You're just a substitute.

385
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,460
So what? I'm nervous.

386

I can't get up. It hurts.

411
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,360
We all even practiced to death!

412
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,760
We all practiced every day!

413
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,320
But we played only two matches.

I'm going to cry more.

I'm going to cry more...

Cry so you can forget about it all.

You can cry with me.

It's not that I don't like you...

does a handsome guy have to be with a handsome guy?
