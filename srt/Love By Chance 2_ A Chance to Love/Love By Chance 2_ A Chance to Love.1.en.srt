Go after the ball! Go after the ball!

(T/N: P' is used to refer to someone who is older.)

5
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,730

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,630
We didn't win this year, but we still have a chance next year, man!

14
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,170
Shut your mouth, Ai'Can.
(T/N: Ai', used to talk to a close friend in a very informal way)

15
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,310
Just take a look around! There are plenty of cute girls at this university!

16
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,190
If you guys are still sulking, you won't get any girls.

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,210
Can you just be quiet for a bit, Ai'Can?

18
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,890
Ae! You're scolding me, too?

19
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,570
We still have next year, but P'No is a fourth year, man!

20
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,150
Look at the face you're making, Little Monkey.

21
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,110
Are you worried about this?

22
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,390
It hurts just a bit.

23
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,810
I will get better in a few days.

24
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,110
That's enough guys. You can stop being sad now.

25
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,430
Let's quickly go back to the university.

26
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,550
Otherwise, the coach will scold us again.

27
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,170
Come on! Let's go back, everybody.

28
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,710
Let's go. We'll try again next year.

I'm sorry.

30
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,510
What are you sorry for?

31
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,610
I'll come back quickly to play football with you guys often.

32
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,870
But right now, you should go back.

33
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,070
Do you understand, Little Monkey?

34
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,770
You can go first. I happened to drink too many sports drinks,

35
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,830
so now I really have to pee. Let me go pee first, all right?

36

Where are you rushing off to?

160
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,190
Don't you know I'm in a hurry, too?

161
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,970
What should I do? What time is it now?

162
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,310
I don't have a watch!

163
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,390
The professor is going to scold me for sure.

164
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,910
The main street!

165
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,650
I'm so late.

166
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,010
I'm so late! Ai'Can! You're so late!

167
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,310
Ai'Can, you're so late!

168
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,470
What the hell kind of driving is that? Are you in a rush to die or something?

169
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,790
We're at the university!

170
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,550
Just because you're driving a luxury car, do you think you can do anything you want?

171
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,110
What about Ai'Ae?

172
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,370
Lately, he doesn't seem to be very okay.

173
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,070
When you see him, just don't ask him too many questions, I guess.

174
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,490
What...

175
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,050
Our friend upgraded to a motorcycle I see.

176
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,530
He's so cool!

177
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,150
I'm talking to you, but you're not talking to me?

178
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,090
Are you doing okay?

179
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,150
Ai'Ae, where are you going?

180
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,030
You don't need to follow me.

181
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,870
Are you not going to go to class?

182
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,170
Ai'Pond, can I just be alone?

183
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,910
What the hell is with him?

184
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,790
Pond, what's wrong?

185
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,010
Ai'Ae! You too!

186
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,990
Ai'Pond! And you too!

187
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,770
He's got to be an inter-kid for sure. I'm absolutely sure of it.
(T/N: Inter=International; Inter-Kid usually means someone from abroad or studying an international program/school)

188
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,710
What's with you? Whining as soon as you get here.

189
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,810
I'm not whining about anything.

190
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,510
Do you know that this morning I almost ended up in 2-3 pieces on my way to school?

191
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,590
Some psycho just suddenly cut me off.

192
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,670
It's a good thing that the shrine helped me in time.

193
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,630
The shrine? What shrine are you talking about?

194
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,130
Are you going to continue listening to me or not?

195
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,730
I haven't even said that I will listen to you.

196
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,150
He just drove away.

197
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,810
Do you know how freaking unlucky I was this morning?

198
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,230
I woke up late, choked on bread,

199
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,230
I waited for so long before the motorcycle came, and the driver drove too slowly.

200
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,810
I had to run all the way to the university.

201
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,430
And there was this inter-guy who cut me off!

202
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,570
You don't need to get confused about how I know that he's an inter-kid.

203
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,750
Because he drove such a fancy car.

204
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,130
I'm not saying that people who drive fancy cars are bad people,

205
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,890
but he was driving to the parking lot for the international college building.

206
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,690
So, I'm pretty sure it's an inter-kid who hurt me.

207
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,830
I guarantee you.

208
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,650
Are you going to keep talking?

209
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,510
If he really is an inter kid, then it's just him.

210
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,030
But you, you're a great liar, Ai'Can.

211
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,430
I don't know. I hate him.

212
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,130
Be careful. Whatever you hate, is what you'll get.

213
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,410
- For real?
- Really.

214
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,830
Then... I'll hate money then!

215
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,650
Money, I hate you.

216
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,110
He said what I hate is what'll I get.

217
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,470
Can you fall down here? I don't see any.

218
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,290
Type isn't even here. There's not a single person to help me.

219
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,930
Are you going to be making that pose for much longer?

220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,830
Until you lose your mind.

221
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,850
Until I lose my mind?

222
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,350
Sure. Sure.

223
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,790
Come here.

224
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,170
Go change your clothes already. Go!

225
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,170
Come over here, Ai'Can!

226
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,310
Where do you think you're going?

227
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,430
Practice already! Go!

228
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,790
And what about Ai'Ae?

229
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,650
Ai'Ae?

230
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,930
There... There's your friend. He keeps being all down.

231
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,730
So then, did Ai'Ae really break up with Ai'Pete?

232
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,550
How am I supposed to know? Why don't you ask him yourself?

233
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,850
Who would dare do that?

234
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,570
He seems still now, but when he's angry he's so freaking scary.

235
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,410
Is that so?

236
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,770
Can you ask him for me?

237
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,750
That's awful. I'm not looking to get myself killed.

238
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,030
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

239
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,330
You know what?

240
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,790
I think you should stop sticking your nose in other people's business.

241
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,410
Let's go! Go practice!

242
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,770
All right, everyone! You're doing great!

243
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,350
That's great. Just like that.

244
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,210
Love is so freaking complicated.

245
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,830
I don't see the reason for wanting to be in a relationship.

246
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,190
I should go find something to eat instead.

247
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,210
Can, where are you going?

248
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,670
Come and practice first

249
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,270
Ai'A,

250
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,530
can you stop being like this already?

251
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,710
Ai'Ae!

252
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,930
He's not with me anymore.

253
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,530
Damn... He's not with me anymore.

254
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,250
That's right.

255
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,650
He's not with you anymore.

256
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,030
And if he were to see you in this state,

257
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,990
do you think he'd be happy?

258
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,210
The reason that he broke up with you, is for you, you know.

259
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,830
But I didn't want him to do that.

260
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,060
Do you understand?

261
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,190
Just leave me alone.

262
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,890
[Tin, I don't even know where to begin.]

263
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,870
[But I'm sure that you probably already know what happened.]

264
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,010
[Therefore, there's something I'd like to ask of you.]

265
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,100
[I know that you don't like the Thai Program kids.]

266
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,130
[And you don't like Ae.]

267
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,250
[But they're all good people.]

268
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,090
[I want you to open your heart.]

269
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,890
[Be willing to accept them.]

270
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,470
[But that's not all that I wanted to ask of you.]

271
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,450
[Tin, could I also leave Ae to you?]

272
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,590
[I know that I'm troubling you.]

273
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,550
[But you're my only friend.]

274
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,750
[You're someone that I trust.]

275
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,330
[I'm not asking you to look after him.]

276
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,890
[Just that if he's in trouble.]

277
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,570
[Can you promise me that you will help him?]

278
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,230
[Think of it as my last request.]

279
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,710
[Because I don't know if this will be the last e-mail I send to you or not.]

280
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,270
[I ask that you be friends with him in my place. - Pete]

281
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,810
That's how it should be!

282
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,170
I'm so sick!

283
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,890
Sick about what?

284
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,610
What else could it be?

285
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,310
My unfortunate and incredibly depressing life, my friend.

286
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,890
My friend, Ae, disappeared somewhere.

287
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,770
I play games, but I can never win.

288
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,310
I'm so sick!

289
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,070
Is that game... BnS Evolution?

290
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,710
- Yeah
- I'm playing it now, too.

291
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,630
Take and eat this, man.

292
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,950
Thanks, man.

293
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,890
I didn't get an item.

294
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,870
But at least I got a yummy snack to eat.

295
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,030
This is not just a snack.

296
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,310
You can use it to get items in the game, man!

297
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,050
- Really?
- Yeah

298
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,530
Awesome.

299
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,390
Then, can I have it?

300
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,330
This...

301
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,690
It's under the tray.

302
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,250
Exchange the code in the game.

303
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,410
- For real?
- Yeah. There's a code. Take a look.

304
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,730
- Can I have it?
- Yeah. Take it all. I'm going to die. I'm going to die.

305
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,290
Oh, and what you said about Ai'Ae disappearing...

306
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,610
How's he been doing?

307
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,170
Nothing much.

308
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,950
Except...

309
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,910
What did you just eat?

310
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,030
Eat...

311
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,930
Poop.

312
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,250
When did you get here?

313
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,190
When I got here isn't that important.

314
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,390
But continue what you were just saying.

315
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,510
How's Ae been? I want to know.

316
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,410
- You want to know?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,990
I don't want to tell anymore.

318
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,590
Geez. What the hell?

319
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,310
I'm going to continue playing instead.

320
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,750
Why are you like this?

321
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,470
I didn't get to hear about Ae, but getting something to eat is good, too.

322
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,830
Dude! It's yummy!

323
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,770
Can I have it all?

324
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,690
Hey! Ai'Bow!

325
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,550
That's mine!

326
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,150
What kind of person is she?

327
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,030
How is it that I'm still friends with her each day?

328
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,510
Exactly.

329
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,650
I can't stop being curious.

330
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,730
Why did Ae and Pete break up?

331
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,190
They loved each other so much.

332
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,630
You're in the way.

333
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,190
Who are you saying is in the way?

334
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,110
Move.

335
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,370
I'm trying to walk.

336
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,290
I'm not moving. There's plenty of space to walk. So go ahead and walk.

337
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,110
Move out of the way I'm trying to walk.

338
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,090
Then you can go ahead and wait. I'm not moving.

339
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,790
Why? Is your dad the owner of the university?

340
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,790
You don't know who my dad is?

341
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,870
Nope.

342
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,750
Is your dad that important in the community? Was he even recorded in history?

343
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,970
But even if your dad is in the history books, I still wouldn't know him.

344
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,450
I failed social studies.

345
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,310
My surname is Medthanan.

346
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,350
So?

347
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,570
Talking to an idiot like you is a waste of time.

348
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,230
Why? I'll admit that I'm stupid.

349
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,190
What about you? Do you admit that your parents didn't teach you well? Letting their son treat others badly like this?

350
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,730
Are you done?

351
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,210
If you're done, let go.

352
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,690
I don't want to waste more time.

353
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,430
Are you insulting me?

354
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,970
Asshole! Come back and let's talk!

355
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,310
The angrier I get, the hungrier I get.

356
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,830
Let's go, Can. I'm hungry

357
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,970
Can!

358
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,890
What the hell is with you?

359
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,710
It's because I'm annoyed! I'm annoyed!

360
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,590
Who does he think he is to think that he can insult me like that!

361
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,850
He called me stupid! I was in the way! So what?

362
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,890
My parents never talked to me like that.

363
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,990
Did you eat too much today or too little?

364
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,310
- Why are you so crazy?
- I'm not crazy!

365
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,530
Someone who says that they're not crazy is totally crazy.

366
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,270
Go get examined.

367
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,970
Go to the nurse's office. I'll take you. Everyone is annoyed by the sound of your whining you know.

368
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,850
Job! You're my friend! You should be on my side.

369
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,070
He said I was in the way and I was stupid about social studies. That I didn't know of his dad.

370
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,730
Everyone loves me. You can ask Techno, Champ, and Type. They love me to death!

371
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,630
I'm the most beloved member of the football team. Everyone loves me!

372
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,950
So I need to be happy then!

373
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,170
Job, where are you going?

374
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,600
I don't know! I'm hungry

375
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,530
I'm sick of listening to you already.

376
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,870
At first, I was going to join the football team with you, but I don't want to anymore.

377
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,730
If I'm with you, I'm going to lose my mind.

378
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,530
Hey! Wait for me, too!

379
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,330
Job, you're my friend you know!

380
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,190
Job!

381
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,950
This weekend, can I sleepover at your place, Dad?

382
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,230
About that, I think that...

383
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,630
My little brother isn't ready to intern yet.

384
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,170
I figured...

385
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,170
that it would turn out this way.

386
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,800
Walking away like this,

387
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,920
that's not very nice, Tin.

388
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,480
What do you want?

389
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,740
A big brother is just greeting his little brother.

390
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,580
Is that strange?

391
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,520
I think you should stop acting already.

392
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
What do you want?

393
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
About your internship...

394
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,500
I want to intern at the company.

395
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,860
You just turned nineteen.

396
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,800
When you were nineteen, you also interned at the company.

397
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,680
As a messenger.

398
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,420
You won't be able to do it.

399
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,060
- I can do it.
- You can't do it.

400
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,080
You were never raised to face any difficulty.

401
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,300
So you told Dad

402
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,620
to not let me work there, right?

403
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,340
You really think cruelly of your older brother.

404
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,210
I already told you to stop acting.

405
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,870
I want to puke.

406
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,250
A mask of such an amazingly nice brother?

407
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,530
No one would believe it.

408
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,190
Then you should know.

409
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,590
if you really try to die, you'll end up dying for real.

410
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,650
You'll never have a day where you can keep up with me.

411
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,010
I'm not full yet.

412
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,290
I'll have P'No treat me to food instead.

413
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,130
- I'm sorry!
- Shit...

414
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,550
How did you get here? Are you looking to start something with me?

415
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,810
I'll fight you know!

416
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,940
Dammit.

417
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,410
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to.

418
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,550
It won't come off? I'll help you.

419
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,930
Don't bother me. You're in the way.

420
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,190
This time it was my bad. I'm sorry. Let me help you, please?

421
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,430
Can you not bother me?

422
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,250
Move.

423
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,050
No.

424
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,090
I told you to move.

425
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,090
Fine, I can move,

426
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,190
but...

427
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,070
After I take responsibility for what I did, all right?

428
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,850
Follow me.

429
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,290
Stay still!

430
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,510
When your shirt gets dirty, you have to clean it immediately. Don't you know? Otherwise, it'll leave a stain.

431
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,150
My mom taught me well.

432
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,430
Because I tend to get my shirts dirty. Just look.

433
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,770
Look. It's all over.

434
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,350
I'm going to die.

435
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,150
You won't die, dude.

436
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,250
Wash and shake it off a few times, and it'll be dry already.

437
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,270
That's too much.

438
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,590
Either way, it has to be thrown away anyway.

439
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,210
That's such a waste, dude!

440
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,310
My dad and mom taught me that people should know how to use money wisely.

441
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,530
Especially the money that your parents earn.

442
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,950
We need to know how to use it properly!

443
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,430
And another thing, my mom taught me to be responsible.

444
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,550
I made your shirt dirty so, of course, I have to clean it for you.

445
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,650
There. See?

446
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,390
It's clean already, dude.

447
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,170
My name isn't "dude."

448
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,770
But I don't know your name. So what do you want me to call you?

449
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,830
You want me to call you bastard or jerk?

450
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,190
My name is Tin.

451
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,330
Tin Medthanan.

452
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,710
Oh! My name is Can.

453
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,410
I didn't ask.

454
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,650
How can you talk like that to someone who cleaned your shirt?

455
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,190
I didn't ask you to.

456
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,890
You jerk! You... ungrateful guy!

457
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,590
You...

458
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,790
Whatever.

459
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,350
Let's just say that even though I didn't ask,

460
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,350
you already cleaned my shirt.

461
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,450
What do you want? Name it.

462
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,910
Dude!

463
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,150
The reason that I cleaned your shirt was because it was my bad. I had to be responsible.

464
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,530
I don't need anything of yours. I don't need your money either!

465
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,210
Someone like me can't be bought with money!

466
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,850
Damn stomach...

467
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,950
I was being so cool...

468
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,730
What are you laughing at?

469
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,190
Nothing.

470
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,110
Look! You're laughing!

471
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,810
I said nothing.

472
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,670
You're still laughing.

473
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,250
You can take this candy.

474
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,790
It might help hold your stomach over.

475
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,830
And remember this, too.

476
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,790
My name is Tin. My name isn't "dude."

477
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,890
Who wants to know you? I don't want to know you at all!

478
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,930
Geez! How could you embarrass your father like this, son?

479
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,020
♫ There's just me and loneliness ♫
