1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,820
Tin said I framed him for the thing about taking drugs, right?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,820
Ai'Tin, let me ask you something.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,000
Have you ever taken drugs before?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,180
You're thinking that, too. Right?

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,940
How many times do I need to repeat it

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,380
that I believe only you!

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,900
What?!

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,560
I can't stay calm anymore!

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,300
You think I'll believe it? In what you did?

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,260
Who can tell me what's going on here?

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,320
Is Can home?

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,520
He said he was going to kill someone at your house, Tin.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,240
Please excuse me.

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,940
Tin!

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,820
Don't think of doing anything crazy... Can.

[Love By Chance: Season 2]
[Episode 11]

38
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,220
Where is Can?

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,620
Khun Can is in Master's room.

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,100
He didn't do anything crazy, right?

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,960
Khun Can punched Khun Tul's face.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,700
You finally came?

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,180
This? It's nothing much.

44
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,040
I just got punched only a few times.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,840
Your friend packed quite a punch.

46
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,300
Where is Can?

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,360
Talking to dad.

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,720
Do you think it'll just end here?

49
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,300
Doesn't matter how it's gonna end,

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,080
I won't ever let you even touch Can.

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,520
In the end, you're the one who is the happiest still.

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,680
I wish you luck.

53
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,840
Uncle, why the hell are you being so biased?

54
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Ai'Tin is also your son. Why did you do this to him?

55
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,860
Do you know some of the things your eldest son has done to him?

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,860
Uncle, you're just ducking your head and just work, work, work.

57
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,960
Have you ever cared about him?

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,320
How sad he feels?

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,140
Just how hurt he's been. Do you know about it at all, Uncle?

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
Uncle, do you know what picture Ai'Tul sent me?

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
He sent me a picture of someone who looks like Tin having sex with a girl and taking drugs.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,280
Do you think I won't be able to remember my own boyfriend?

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,960
Shit. How the hell could he do this?

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,580
Tin, come sit down and let's have a talk.

65
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,180
Ai'Tin, what took you so long to get here?

66
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,240
I got here a long time ago.

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,140
I only managed to get your older brother with a few punches.

68
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,500
Someone like him deserves to be stomped to death.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,080
Too bad someone stopped me.

70
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,160
Why?

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,420
Why doesn't anybody know that your older brother is such a son of a bitch?

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,660
That's enough, Can.

73
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,920
It's not enough for me!

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,660
I'm going to reveal everything about your older brother!

75
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,420
Can.

76
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,140
Ai'Tin!

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,260
Why the hell didn't you tell your dad about what your older brother has done to you?

78
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,960
That's enough. Go home. I'll drop you off.

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm not going back! Not until we've cleared this up!

80
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,420
Cantaloupe.

81
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,300
Let him go, son.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,460
Go on.

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,460
I also want to know what my eldest son has done.

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,260
Dad…

85
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,240
I have an opportunity to speak to you... and your older brother.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,880
This time... it might just be time for me to finally listen.

87
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,700
Yes. Uncle, you should listen.

88
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,200
Stop acting like those stupid adults that don't love their children equally.

89
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,620
Go on.

90
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,500
Tell an old man who doesn't equally love his own children, about what happened.

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,160
Ai'Tul sent a clip of someone who looks similar to Ai'Tin

92
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,700
doing drugs, having sex with a woman,

93
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,040
and he also backstabbed Tin.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,100
Here, Khun Tul. I'll do it for you.

95
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,320
It's okay.

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,340
I don't understand it at all, Khun Tul.

97
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,220
Why do you purposefully do all these things to make Tin hate you?

98
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,580
Geez... I've never done anything like that at all.

99
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,780
Khun Tul, I've looked after you since you were just a baby.

100
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,740
Why wouldn't I know? The reason why you're doing this Khun Tul.

101
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,340
Khun Tul you're determined to make Khun Tin clearly hate you, isn't that right?

102
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,420
I have to do this.

103
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,440
And everyone should know the truth.

104
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,600
And I shouldn't get all these praises that I didn't deserve from my little brother.

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Come on, Khun Tul.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,820
And that's what made you punch Tul, right?

107
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,340
Obviously.

108
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,940
How can I not get angry?

109
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,640
He's sneaking around and clearly doing things behind Ai'Tin's back..

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,740
Is this true, Tin?

111
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,240
Even if I tell you, Dad, you wouldn't believe me.

112
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,000
Then, why didn't you try telling me first?

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,640
What if I told you that he's hurt me since I was young until now?

114
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry for hurting you without knowing it.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm sorry for staying still all this time.

116
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,260
Even though all this time,

117
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,120
I thought that I was doing what you needed.

118
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,200
I am indebted to you and Tul, aren't I?

119
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,120
What does that bastard have to do with anything?

120
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,340
What do you mean by what I needed?

121
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,880
It's freedom.

122
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,300
- Freedom?
- That's right.

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,740
The freedom to do whatever you want.

124
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,740
The freedom... to choose your own life.

125
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,180
The freedom... that your brother and I would never have.

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,020
I've never told you before, right?

127
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,520
Mhm, that's right.

128
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,200
I've never told you.

129
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,920
The freedom that I'd had before

130
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,960
was to marry Tul's mom.

131
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,960
The only freedom that I chose.

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,160
Even if people were against me, I didn't care.

133
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,140
And it ended in failure.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,020
It left me with only a boy

135
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,360
who had to receive all that misfortune.

136
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,920
Tin, I admit it.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,540
That I didn't object when your mom and Tul sent you overseas.

138
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,020
I was even thankful that it happened to you.

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,500
How can you say that?

140
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,300
Tin, for me,

141
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,060
having no one placing any expectations on you is the best thing.

142
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,300
You'll have your own life.

143
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,540
You can choose anything.

144
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,280
Everyone won't place any expectations on you.

145
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,600
Because that will slowly kill you.

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,660
That's why I said

147
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,860
that I've already given you the best thing I could.

148
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you talking about? I don't understand anything.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,280
Explain it to me.

150
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,160
That child has gone through more things than others can imagine.

151
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,720
Your older brother has faced many things throughout his life.

152
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,900
He's never been happy.

153
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
As for you,

154
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,090
who I thought I had already given the best thing possible to.

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,840
You've already found your own happiness.

156
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,260
Tin, I beg you.

157
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,160
You can hate me however you want.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,540
You can be angry at me however you want.

159
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,960
But please forgive your older brother.

160
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
You're so damn biased.

161
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
Fine.

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Ai'Tin!

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Your older brother has done this to you for so many years!

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,940
I can forgive him.

165
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,180
But, Dad, you have to promise me first

166
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,800
that you will give me the freedom

167
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,560
to love whoever I want.

168
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
I promise.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,940
There won't be anyone to block you from the path that you've chosen.

170
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,240
Not even your mother.

171
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,140
Please take care of my son.

172
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,560
Please help me and do what this old uncle never had the chance to do.

173
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh, right!

174
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,840
Tul is now getting a divorce from Vadee.

175
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Does this make you happier?

176
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,020
You've always been a good child, Tin.

177
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,700
Where are you going?

178
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm still going to prove

179
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,660
that I'm capable as well.

180
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,200
That's good.

181
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,940
Having another talented son to help me,

182
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,720
I'd be very happy.

183
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,360
Tin, we haven't even finished talking yet!

184
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,160
Geez, Tin! Why are you bringing me here?

185
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,940
We still haven't cleared up everything.

186
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,840
I really despise your brother so much, I'm going to...

187
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,180
Hey! Let go of me, Ai'Tin!

188
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,100
I still haven't finished talking to your dad yet!

189
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,020
It's already finished.

190
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,140
You're the one with a slow brain.

191
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,420
So you can't catch up.

192
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,841
What finished? I haven't finished cursing out your older brother!

193
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't know! I'm going to get revenge for you!

194
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,960
You already got revenge for me? Did you not realize it?

195
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,320
What? How?

196
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,280
Can you explain it to me? I'm stupid.

197
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,300
You have to promise me first,

198
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,980
and then you'll know the way to get the best revenge.

199
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,740
All right! I promise.

200
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Tin, it hurts!

201
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,420
Stay with me.

202
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,440
Make me the happiest man alive on Earth.

203
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,360
Have the kind of happiness that my older brother never had.

204
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,440
That...

205
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,360
is the best kind of revenge.

206
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,940
Sure.

207
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,420
I'll make you the luckiest man on Earth.

208
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,540
We'll make it so that your older brother will be jealous of you.

209
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,720
♫ I'm not asking anyone to understand ♫

210
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,180
Ai'Tin.

211
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,520
♫ I'm not asking for any other precious things ♫

212
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:33,440
♫ I'm not asking for anything else that everyone is seeking  ♫

213
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,220
I love you.

214
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,840
You just go ahead and cry.

215
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,760
Who cares about everyone else in the world!

216
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,580
You can only be weak in front of me, alright?

217
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,700
I will never leave you.

218
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,300
Don't ever leave me.

219
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,580
Yes.

220
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,300
I already promised

221
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,520
that I'll never go anywhere and leave you.

222
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,440
♫ Hold me tighter than yesterday ♫

223
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,200
♫ I want you. Only you ♫

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,720
♫ I want you. Only you ♫

225
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,160
♫ I want you to be my everlasting love ♫

226
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,900
What's up, Ai'Type?

227
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Yeah, I'm about to leave.

228
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,980
Come on. It'll be just a second.

229
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,600
Hey, that's all for now, Ai'Type.

230
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,960
[To... P'No]

231
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
P'No,

232
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,220
I know that you don't want to see my face.

233
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,480
You don't want to pick up my calls.

234
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,280
But I have many things I want to tell you.

235
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,160
I know that I was wrong to do something to you when you were drunk.

236
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,340
But it's because I've liked you for a long time already.

237
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,120
I liked you for so many years.

238
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,440
From the first time we met,

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,640
you're one of the few people that didn't care about my looks,

240
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,880
that didn't care about my family.

241
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,000
You made me feel good every time we were together.

242
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,320
Shit!

243
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,660
He even wrote me a letter?

244
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,260
Doesn't he know I also know how to get embarrassed?

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,640
No, Ai'No! No! Don't get soft-hearted for a kid.

246
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,020
P'No!

247
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,540
The thing is...

248
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,980
Shit.

249
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,600
He wrote me a letter

250
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,900
and waited for me in front of my house.

251
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,100
And he even became more handsome.

252
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,540
Geez, No! Don't get all soft-hearted for a kid!

253
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,540
How long are you going to stand and stare there?

254
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,020
Come sit down with me.

255
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,440
No.

256
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,740
Cantaloupe is waiting for me.

257
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,500
He's probably crying all over the room about how hungry he is.

258
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,620
It seems that you guys played pretty hard, huh?

259
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,320
In the end,

260
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,740
you're the one who has happiness.

261
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,240
No matter what I do.

262
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,500
In the end, you'll still be happy.

263
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,880
Dad told you already, right?

264
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,140
That I'll be divorcing Vadee.

265
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,560
Why?

266
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,060
Why what?

267
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,240
Why would someone who needs success, like you,

268
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,200
decide to get a divorce?

269
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,340
When Vadee and Phupha went to France several months ago,

270
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,180
Vadee met someone new there.

271
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,100
But I don't blame her.

272
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,420
I'm the one... who never had any time for her.

273
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,640
But Vadee and I have talked about it for a while already.

274
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,240
It's time to finally give each other freedom.

275
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,080
What about Phupha?

276
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,220
Phupha will stay here.

277
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,860
As soon as we get a divorce,

278
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,520
Vadee will go to France.

279
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,440
Go on and mock me.

280
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,900
In the end,

281
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,840
your older brother is just a failure.

282
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,860
Everyone runs away.

283
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,860
They're no different from my actual mother.

284
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,040
In the end...

285
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,360
you're a good child, just like dad said.

286
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,740
You never mocked anyone's failure.

287
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,720
Even a scumbag like this older brother of yours.

288
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,260
Why was that all you did?

289
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,238
Even though you could've done so much more than that.

290
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,524
You could have even made Can hate me.

291
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,580
Why did you just send a silly clip?

292
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,180
Like child's play.

293
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
I already promised him.

294
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,680
I just…

295
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,020
wanted to know whether that kid really loved you or not.

296
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,540
But I'm stopping now.

297
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,500
Because I already lost.

298
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Look after your person well.

299
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,380
Don't make the same mistake like your older brother.

300
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,860
What took you so long!

301
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,360
If I wasn't hurting—

302
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,320
What are you laughing at?

303
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,500
I know now

304
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,600
why your cheeks are so soft like this.

305
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,780
It's because you love eating this.

306
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,200
Ai'Tin!

307
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,480
Even if my cheeks are plump, it still hurts.

308
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,560
You pinched so hard.

309
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,020
Why? Do you want some? Here.

310
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,000
Are you finished eating yet?

311
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,180
Otherwise, go get another one!

312
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,960
You're not thinking of feeling shy or anything?

313
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,820
What do you want me to be shy about?

314
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,940
That we had an indirect kiss through the Jele drink?

315
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Dude? We're already passed that point!

316
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,420
You're really…

317
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,180
Why?

318
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,760
Fine, if you want to eat it just take it.

319
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,680
I can give it up for you.

320
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,780
Really?

321
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah.

322
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,060
You are…

323
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,436
so cute, really.

324
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:45,920
How cute?

325
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,280
So very...

326
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,580
Eat slowly.

327
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,340
I love my dad and I love my name.

328
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,100
Because "Phupha" is...

329
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,380
Dad's love that I gave to someone.

330
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,220
Why did I just figure it out?

331
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,800
Gonhin.

332
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
You thought this through carefully already, right?

333
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,540
Deciding to do something like this.

334
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,740
Yes.

335
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,300
I know this might seem ungrateful,

336
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,880
- but I...
- No

337
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,300
It isn't being ungrateful.

338
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,380
When I hired your family to work here,

339
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,540
I've never thought

340
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,200
that you were indebted to me or anything.

341
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,920
It's actually your family

342
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,400
that's helped me with my work for so many years.

343
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,260
But if you've already decided,

344
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,702
then I won't say anything against it.

345
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,440
Yes.

346
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,280
I've already made my decision.

347
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,140
And does Tul know yet?

348
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,940
Khun Tul has Khun Vadee,

349
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,000
and their child who is about to be born.

350
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,395
And what about you then? Who do you have?

351
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,660
I have memories

352
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,920
of the last ten years.

353
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,880
I am sorry Khun Tai...

354
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm sorry that I can't stay and protect Khun Tul anymore.

355
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,300
I can't do that anymore...

356
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,240
I want to keep doing it,

357
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,160
but I can't stay any longer.

358
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,460
I can't destroy the family that Khun Tul has wanted for so long.

359
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,780
Hin,

360
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,380
just calm down first.

361
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,740
I have to get out of this house.

362
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,580
You know, right?

363
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,860
That you can come back here.

364
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
You can always come back to this house.

365
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,760
You know, right?

366
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,697
That he'll always need you.

367
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,880
Yes.

368
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,460
But not right now.

369
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
Not right now.

370
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,300
It seems I really cannot help any of my sons.

371
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,120
Khun Tul.

372
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,160
I don't want to hear it.

373
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,227
I have something I need to tell you.

374
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,400
I said I don't want to hear it!

375
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm begging you...

376
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,660
You have to listen to me.

377
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,760
I don't want to hear it. I won't listen to it!!

378
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

379
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,500
I told you that I'm not letting you leave.

380
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,600
But I have to go.

381
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,460
Khun Tul,

382
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,760
we both know there's no better solution than this.

383
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,440
Khun Vadee is pregnant with your child.

384
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,560
One that I don't want...

385
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,600
You do want it.

386
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
You want him.

387
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,920
You've always wanted a family.

388
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,040
Someone who will love you.

389
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,760
Khun Vadee is carrying that person for you.

390
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,740
Something which I cannot give you.

391
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,560
Please don't say that you don't need them.

392
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,960
Because you know it best that you do want it.

393
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
No.

394
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,800
The one I need is you.

395
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,480
I can no longer stay by your side anymore.

396
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,880
I have to go,

397
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,240
so your world will be complete.

398
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,440
You are my world.

399
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,940
I am just a worthless rock.
(T/N: His name, Gonhin, means "rock/stone")

400
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,980
Please just throw me away.

401
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm not worthy enough to be your whole world.

402
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,900
But you promised to never leave me.

403
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,240
From now on, you probably won't need me anymore.

404
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,600
I love you, Hin.

405
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
I love you.

406
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,440
But your child needs a father.

407
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,300
That child...

408
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,680
please give him lots of love.

409
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,040
Don't let him grow up like you did,

410
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,440
or Khun Tin.

411
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,780
If you have no reason to keep on living,

412
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,820
I ask just one thing.

413
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,163
Could you please keep on living for them?

414
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,960
Consider this my last request.

415
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,500
Can you promise me

416
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,460
that you'll be happy?

417
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,700
You're asking me for the impossible.

418
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,020
I wish for your happiness.

419
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,360
Ai'Hin.

420
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,540
Ai'Hin!

421
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,740
♫ I still have hope even I know that it's hopeless ♫

422
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:54,840
♫ I've been hopelessly wishing for the impossible. I'm asking just for once ♫

423
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,960
♫ Just for once ♫

424
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,580
♫ Give me just a few seconds ♫

425
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,900
♫ So that I will no longer be lonely ♫

426
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,826
I'm receiving my karma now. Right, Gonhin?

427
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,700
In the end, I have nobody left.

428
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,940
And then...

429
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,300
I punched Tin's brother until he flew into the wall.

430
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,980
To that extent?

431
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,020
Of course!

432
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,620
He dares to mess with my Ai'Tin.

433
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,180
He doesn't know me well enough.

434
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,780
Now you're daring enough to say "my," huh? You bastard.

435
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,960
Well, you're the one that taught me that though!

436
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,300
That we need to have confidence in what we do.

437
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,960
So now I'm brave enough to say

438
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,900
that Ai'Tin is my boyfriend.

439
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,640
Oh, wow!

440
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,040
That's damn manly of you, friend!

441
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm going to go sell this video to your boyfriend

442
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,800
Let's see just how much money I can get from this.

443
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,780
Ai'Pond, you bastard!

444
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,640
What's the matter?

445
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,780
Don't send it to Ai'Tin to see!

446
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,800
I can also get embarrassed.

447
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,660
Aww, don't sulk dude.

448
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,600
Are you holding a whole watermelon in your mouth or something?

449
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,920
Your cheeks are so puffy.

450
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,380
But geeeez... Ever since you got yourself a hubby and kissed in the middle of the football field,

451
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,300
you've become a lot more showy.

452
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,700
That's enough! Give me the phone!

453
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,560
Not giving it. I'm not going to give it to you.

454
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,640
How'd you get here?

455
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,160
What's up, Shorty.

456
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,200
That loudmouth over there told me you're going to release your own song.

457
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,260
Hey! I didn't go around telling everyone your business.

458
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,940
It's not my song.

459
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,240
It just happened that a senior is writing a song. So I'm just helping out.

460
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,400
That's the same thing. So when can I listen to it?

461
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,520
Next month, at the university's music festival!

462
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,400
He really knows every detail, that bastard.

463
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
Ouch! Ai'Can!

464
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,015
Isn't your embarrassment too much? Ouch!

465
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
That's enough, dude!

466
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,140
Look there! Your person is here to pick you up over there! Go!

467
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,800
You should get going!

468
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,560
Then I'm going to head out first, all right?

469
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,760
Ae, I'm going to leave first, all right?

470
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
- See ya!
- Bye-bye.

471
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,340
You're seriously too much, Ai'Pond.

472
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,440
Dude, who said he's an albino monkey?

473
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,400
He's clearly a dog.

474
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,040
Am I going to catch rabies?

475
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,800
Then next month I'll come and listen to your song.

476
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,000
Hey! Pay attention to me first!

477
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,520
Do I have to pay attention to you?

478
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,080
Do you think you're worth my attention?

479
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,100
Ouch, that's pretty harsh.

480
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,860
Ai'Tin, what's with you?

481
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,620
Ai'Tin!

482
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,100
You're sulking, right? You're sulking because I was fooling around with Ai'Pond?

483
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,280
Here.

484
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,420
Stop being mad already.

485
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,680
I'm making up with you, so smile!

486
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,900
Why do I have to smile for you?

487
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,940
It's because you have such a cute and handsome boyfriend like me!

488
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,340
And another thing... What are you thinking? Me and Ai'Pond?

489
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,260
Just the thought of it gives me the creeps already.

490
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,720
Ew.

491
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,620
Fine, I'll stop being mad.

492
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,500
Very good!

493
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,420
You did the right thing. Very good!

494
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,500
I think I won't be in Thailand for about a week.

495
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,720
What? Where are you going?

496
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,860
Ai'Tin, I'm talking to you right now.

497
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,820
And what are you looking at? What's with that wide smile?

498
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,180
That we need to have confidence in what we do.

499
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,580
So now I'm brave enough to say...

500
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,100
- That Ai'Tin is my boyfriend.... 
- You're pretty cute.

501
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,380
That bastard, Ai'Pond!

502
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,400
That's so manly of you, friend.

503
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,140
I'm going to go sell this video to your boyfriend.

504
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,040
Give that back.

505
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,060
I'm not giving it to you anymore.

506
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,700
You already kissed it, so it's mine now.

507
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,780
Fine, I can give it to you.

508
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,260
Ai'Tin!

509
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm returning the kiss, too.

510
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,900
I'm embarrassed!

511
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,060
Then why is it in the video, you said

512
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,500
you're not a shy person anymore?

513
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,280
Yeah!

514
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm not embarrassed at all.

515
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,900
Because you're mine.

516
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,360
I just said the truth.

517
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,920
That's right.

518
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm yours.

519
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,320
What are you doing?

520
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,420
Hang on.

521
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,300
Slow down.

522
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,340
Calm down!

523
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,380
Here, want to have some first?

524
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,120
You'll get hungry.

525
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,840
Are you okay?

526
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,060
It'll come to you. Just be patient.

527
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,600
Eat this first.

528
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Great! Then why don't you eat, and then you can continue working?

529
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,180
You can do it!

530
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,660
Thanks a lot.

531
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,860
Let's see. Where are you up to now?

532
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,800
Nowhere.

533
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,200
You got it already?

534
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,460
Where? Let me see a bit.

535
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,100
See? Just take your time and it'll come.

536
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,240
How is it?

537
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,240
I think this hook is okay.

538
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,720
"No matter where... you are,

539
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,220
...you still got me."

540
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,180
That part is good.

541
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,320
Hey, what the hell?

542
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,400
Ai'Keen, take a look! I've finished writing the song!

543
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,920
I don't know! I've never felt this confident before.

544
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,860
Do you like it?

545
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,980
Hurry! Do you like it?

546
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,840
I like it/you.

547
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,020
Right? I like it, too.

548
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,680
I've never felt this confident before!

549
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,660
Ai'Tin, wait!

550
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,680
Ah, so damn tiring.

551
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,520
Good thing I've got this.

552
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,980
- What do you have?
- You're asking me what I have!

553
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,960
You forgot something.

554
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,560
What did I forget?

555
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
This!

556
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,440
I love eating this. It's damn good.

557
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,400
That much?

558
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,620
Look. I'm chewing coconut jelly with vitamin C in it.

559
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,200
Want to try it?

560
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,080
Then let me try it a bit.

561
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,660
Here, you can try mine.

562
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,920
You're crazy...

563
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,580
Try the drink!

564
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,880
Well, I'm tasting it from your lips.

565
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,960
You should go already.

566
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,580
I'll see you.

567
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,040
I'll send you off.

568
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,420
Who is this?

569
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,380
P'Tum's friend?

570
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,660
Khun Tin!

571
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,140
How did you get here?

572
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:07,580
[Preview]

573
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,520
I'd be crazy to miss you.

574
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
We haven't seen each other for only a few days.

575
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,660
You're too attached to me.

576
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,200
Ai'Tin!

577
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,140
I no longer have any business here.

578
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,560
I already know what I should know.

579
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,820
Tar!

580
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,200
Since when did you get back?

581
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Mom didn't tell me anything.

582
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,660
I asked Mom not to tell you.

583
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,480
I just wanted to surprise you.

584
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,680
♫ This song is still beautiful ♫

585
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,020
