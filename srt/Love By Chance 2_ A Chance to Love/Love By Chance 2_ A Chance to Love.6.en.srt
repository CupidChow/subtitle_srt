1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,260
Nong Phu, remember this, all right? Don't be like that naughty kid.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,520
I'm not like the younger brother. He's bad.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,100
A kid with a bad personality, no one has a need for them.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,400
Why didn't you also tell him just who the one was that taught such bad things to the younger brother?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,320
I used to think that my older brother was everything to me.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,860
Can I go and see you?

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,940
♫ I used to tell you  ♫

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:04,220
♫ That we could never be more than friends  ♫

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,240
♫ When I said that I don't love you, I actually don't know ♫

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
♫  I don't know what this feeling is ♫

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,440
♫ When I said that we're just friends, I actually understand now ♫

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,080
♫ Can I change it? I don't want us to be just friends anymore ♫

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,420
♫ This time, you won't be sad ♫

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,980
♫ We will get through it together ♫

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,780
♫ From now on, let me take care of you ♫

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,380
♫Tomorrow or whenever, our love will be everlasting ♫

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,160
♫ When I said that I don't love you, I actually don't know ♫

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,860
♫I don't know what this feeling is ♫

19
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,240
♫ When I said that we're just friends, I actually understand now ♫

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,860
♫ Can I change it? I don't want us to be just friends anymore ♫

21
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,240
♫ I promise I will love you forever ♫

22

23

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,740

26

♫ I promise I will always be true and honest to you ♫

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,380
Do you think I'm pathetic?

28
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,160
Who called you pathetic?

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,940
Tell me. I'll go punch them. No!

30
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,340
Right now, I really despise your older brother, Ai'Tin.

31
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,360
What kind of older brother does that to his younger brother?

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
Did you know? I have a younger sister.

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,960
No matter how much she insults me, but if someone does something to her,

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,980
I won't allow it. I'll punch them until their teeth fall...

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
Thanks.

36
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,640
Thanks for what?

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,800
I haven't done anything yet.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,060
You did.

39
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,360
What did I do?

40
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,320
By staying by my side.

41
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,500
Okay.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,760
I'll be next to you right here.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,900
What's wrong?

44
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,980
It's because I'm angry at your brother!

45
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,740
When I see his face, I'll punch him once!

46
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,520
Promise me.

47
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,020
Promise you what?

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,300
If you ever meet my brother, don't mess with him.

49
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,000
You'll never know what someone like him is thinking of doing.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
- But I…
- Promise me.

51
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Fine.

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll try then.

53
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,960
Ai'Tin! But someone like that,

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
it should be an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,220
That's what my captain taught me.

56
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,240
That blood should be washed with blood.

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,500
Also... I'm sorry.

58
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,020
I didn't even invite you inside to my house.

59
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,720
It's already late. I think that everyone in my house is probably all sleeping now.

60
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,040
If we go in and make noise, Ley will take a knife and try to stab me again.

61
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,240
I don't want to die yet.

62
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,180
Hey, Tin!

63
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,300
This is enough.

64
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,700
You should go inside. It's already late.

65
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,680
You kissed me without permission again.

66
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,700
- Go.
- Ai'Tin!

67
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,620
You should go inside your house now.

68
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,860
It's late already.

69
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,500
Sweet dreams.

70
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,540
All right.

71
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,600
You, too.

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,840
If something happens... punch his face, all right?

73
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay?

74
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,060
I'm going to sleep then.

75
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Thanks.

76
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,060
Mom, I'm back.

77
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,880
Don't make that face, Mom.

78
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm okay now.

79
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,640
It's okay, son.

80
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,780
Mom is right here.

81
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,180
Okay.

82
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,700
Hey, crybaby.

83
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,080
What are you guys doing at my house?

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
We're here to console you, our little shorty.

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,760
So, just what the hell are you guys doing at my house?

86
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,660
We came to visit you, friend. We came to visit!

87
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,000
You and I see each other's faces every day.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,300
I have to see you on weekends, too?

89
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,700
Ai'Ae,

90
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,180
a handsome face like mine can't be seen every day. It means you're blessed.

91
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,720
He's just nosy about your business.

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,980
As for you, you're just looking for a drinking buddy?

93
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,880
Well, I'm better than you who gets as drunk as a dog and doesn't know how to drink.

94
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,160
What's with you two?

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Every time you see each other, you fight every time.

96
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
Was I right or wrong to invite Mai to come along?

97
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,600
So, who would you have called then?

98
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,040
Do you think other people can deal with Ae?

99
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
Even you can't do that.

100
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,420
That hurts.

101
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,480
Does that hurt enough?

102
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,880
I'll give you a fist, how about it?

103
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,900
- Why don't you try then?
- Why?

104
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,140
I'll run away for you to see!

105
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,320
Dude.

106
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,660
Ae is laughing!

107
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,520
I want to cry.

108
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,260
The sound of his laughter for the first time after so many months.

109
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Thank you, God.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,160
You're overacting.

111
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,440
Ai'Shorty is finally laughing!

112
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,243
So you guys can finally keep your nose out of my business.

113
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,683
Hey.

114
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,440
The old Ai'Ae is back!

115
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
- Yeah!
- Hey! Since it's like this, we should take a picture!

116
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
Since the old Ae is finally back.

117
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
You're overacting, Ai'Pond.

118
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Just think of it as you're doing it for me.

119
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,540
- Yeah, I'm crying.
- Let's take a picture, quick.

120
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,100
One. Two. Three.

121
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,740
[My friends came to see me today.]

122
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,860
[I finally got to go back home today.]

123
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,840
[I have a quiz today.]

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
[I'm finally back to practicing football today.]

125
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,560
So today he posted again.

126
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,780
This kid is really, really damn interesting.

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm taking a quick break. I'm tired already.

128
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,400
[I'm waiting in front of the field.]

129
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,460
Ai'Tin, are you all right?

130
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,700
Your older brother didn't do anything to you, right?

131
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,100
Are you also worried about me?

132
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,300
Yeah, of course.

133
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,180
The other day when you came to see me, you were so sad.

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,820
So today, I thought there was some trouble.

135
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,020
So in the end, there's nothing. But you sent a Line message telling me to come out.

136
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,760
Really, you...

137
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,600
What are you doing??

138
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,920
Here.

139
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,060
Ai'Tin! I already told you...

140
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,100
I can't buy you with money.

141
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,980
I know.

142
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm not giving it to you for free.

143
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,020
What are you doing?

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,580
Well, you're always suddenly kissing me or suddenly giving me a peck.

145
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,180
You're not giving it for free.

146
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,260
Here. If you want to kiss or give me a peck, go ahead.

147
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,720
What are you doing?

148
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,160
I took the fee for your snack already.

149
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,840
Since when?

150
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,320
Remind me next time

151
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
that I shouldn't do anything to you when you're drenched in sweat.

152
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,100
It's salty.

153
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,180
I'm leaving now. I have class.

154
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,640
I'll call you.

155
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,940
You don't need to call me at all.

156
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,420
I won't pick up.

157
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,340
Pick it up.

158
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,440
Why do I feel ticklish like I want to poop every time he does this?

159
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,900
No, Can. Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

160
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,720
This looks yummy.

161
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,260
Geez...

162
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,920
Today's exam was so damn hard.

163
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,940
I couldn't do it.

164
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Were you able to do it?

165
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,500
Easy.

166
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,660
For me?

167
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,380
It's my favorite.

168
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,820
Can I eat it? I'll eat it now.

169
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,100
I want you to pass this onto P'No. I'm not giving it to you.

170
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,100
You had to go as far as going all the way to his university?

171
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,920
Just go quickly. Before P'No goes to practice.

172
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,420
So, what do I get in return?

173
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,560
Just think of it as you cheering me on, all right?

174
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,020
And if you want anything, just tell me.

175
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,300
All right?

176
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,000
You already said it.

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, just go.

178
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
You already said it.

179
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,560
Oh, Ai'Nic. How'd you get here?

180
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,240
Kengkla asked me to give you this.

181
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
He saw that you like to eat it.

182
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,940
So he bought it for you.

183
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,968
[I want to be your favorite just like Bento.]

184
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,760
Your face is all red.

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,240
I guess this flavor must be really spicy.

186
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,020
Shut up, Ai'Nic.

187
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,100
You're not going to eat it now?

188
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,080
You came to see me just for this, right?

189
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,116
You're not going to eat it now?

190
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,940
Why is your face so red?

191
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,180
If you're done, you can leave already. Go.

192
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,786
That's all you came for, right? I'm studying right now.

193
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,260
You'll give it to me for sure?

194
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,100
Of course. I'm a man of my word.

195
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,920
I just need you to help me a little bit, and that should be enough.

196
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,860
Tell me then.

197
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,240
For the next match, you have to let me play.

198
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,620
I want to show off my coolness.

199
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,660
For that nurse?

200
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,700
Yeah, that's right, bro.

201
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,780
Fine.

202
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,020
Give me the stuff.

203
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,900
That's how it should be.

204
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,260
Here, bro.

205
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
What the hell, Ai'Can?

206
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, that's right. What's with you?

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,700
Geez, you came without even making a sound.

208
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,480
What would you do if I had had a heart attack?

209
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,460
Where's mine then?

210
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,980
There isn't any.

211
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,960
Why? Why'd you only give it to P'No?

212
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,820
Fine! I'll tell everyone that P'No is taking bribes.

213
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,060
- He takes free stuff...
- They'll catch us...

214
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,340
Don't talk so loudly! Other people will hear it!

215
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,420
Ai'Can! Ai'Can!

216
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,680
Ai'Tin!

217
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,540
How'd you get here?

218
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,520
Come here.

219
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,400
Geez. Don't drag me. It hurts.

220
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,660
Are you the son of rickshaw puller?

221
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,120
What did I do to him?

222
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,800
He looked at me like he was going to kill me or something.

223
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,420
Hey, Ai'Job. Do you know why?

224
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,520
How am I supposed to know?

225
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,540
I was with you.

226
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
Well, whatever.

227
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,620
Whatever gives me an excuse to get out of the house on days off,

228
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,400
just thinking about it makes me feel better. Just go with Ai'Can.

229
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,980
Wait. Wait. Wait.

230
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,620
So, why do you need to find an excuse to get away from your house?

231
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,240
Well… Why is that?

232
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,260
I don't think you have to know everything, Job.

233
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,540
What's with him?

234
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,740
Hey, P'No! Wait for me!

235
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,540
Geez, the soccer field at night is so scary.

236
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,220
Geez, Ai'Tin! Can you walk slowly?

237
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,600
Can't you see that my legs are shorter than yours?

238
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,800
If you were going to stop, why didn't you tell me?

239
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,060
So what's wrong? Your face looks like ass (grumpy).

240
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,095
You should smile.

241
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,420
I like to be with people who are in a good mood.

242
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,580
So, do you like that guy then?

243
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,040
Oh! P'No?

244
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,900
Of course, I like him! I really like P'No!

245
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,760
P'No is really nice.

246
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,660
Even though he always scolds me, he still buys me food anyway.

247
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,320
Speaking of which, I'm still annoyed.

248
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,920
Ai'Job freakin' invited P'No to watch a movie, but wouldn't invite me.

249
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Then you interrupted.

250
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,840
Otherwise, I would've gotten a free movie ticket already.

251
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,840
Do you want to watch a movie at my house?

252
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
What do you say?

253
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,580
Your house really is rich!

254
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,160
So, have you decided already? On which movie you want to watch.

255
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,100
I want to watch so many, dude.

256
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,000
Zombie movies look interesting. The new horror movie looks even more interesting, too.

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,020
But if I watch all of them, then I probably won't be able to go home for sure.

258
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
Then you don't need to go back.

259
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,680
I can't, dude.

260
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,760
Today my mom is making steamed rice noodle rolls for us to eat.

261
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,100
I even asked a chef to prepare a full Italian course for you.

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,420
Italian…

263
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,400
Full course.

264
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
Let me eat it, too.

265
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,640
Good.

266
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,820
This sounds more like a date.

267
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,600
How is it a date, dude?

268
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,020
Something like this is just two dudes hanging out.

269
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,380
Watching movies, followed by dinner.

270
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,260
No matter how stupid you are, you know it's called a date.

271
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,740
Movie.

272
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,440
Dinner.

273
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,400
Let's go.

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's go on a date already.

275
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,940
What date?

276
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,860
I really don't like your older brother.

277
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,500
Uncle Tin! Uncle Tin, you really were home!

278
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,100
You'll keep me company, right? I'm lonely.

279
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,380
Yeah.

280
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,620
Isn't this that guy's son?

281
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,380
How are you?

282
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you a bad person like your dad?

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,420
You can't insult dad! My dad is a good person!

284
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,920
His personality is really great, too!

285
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,480
He has a good personality?

286
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,000
Or maybe he's really evil.

287
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,000
Uncle Tin, he insulted dad.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,700
He insulted my dad.

289
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,740
It's not Phupha or his mom...

291
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,940
If I want to take revenge,

292
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,100
it will be only on him.

293
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,740
Fine.

294
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,467
Then...

295
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,880
Let's make up.

296
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,000
You insulted my dad. I'm mad at you.

297
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,360
Come on.

298
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,700
Are you a good kid?

299
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,020
If you're a good kid, then you have to make up with me.

300
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,420
I'm a good kid.

301
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,100
Today, you're lonely, right?

302
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,740
P'Can will stay and play with you all day.

303
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,780
Hey, Ai'Tin.

304
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,940
You already sent your nephew to bed?

305
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,280
I like you.

306
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,980
Yeah, I know already.

307
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm hitting on you now.

308
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,400
So what?

309
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,560
I am hitting on you now.

310
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah, I said that I know that already.

311
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,500
Why are you saying it so many times? If you want to hit on me, then hit on me.

312
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,652
If you want to hit on me, then go ahead and hit on me. If you want to like me, then go ahead and like me.

313
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,460
It's just...

314
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,200
I still don't know.

315
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,980
I don't know if I feel okay with you yet.

316
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,580
What are you doing?

317
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,640
Collecting interest.

318
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,860
What interest?

319
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,900
From the stuff you ate.

320
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,680
You're going to kiss me again?

321
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,260
Here.

322
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,560
Can.

323
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,400
Open your mouth.

324
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,740
No!

325
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,520
Open your mouth.

326
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,560
I said no, so no...

327
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,180
I like you.

328
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,620
What's with you?

329
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,840
Crazy!

330
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,254
Hey! Ai'Tum, why'd you stop?

331
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
I'll be right back.

332
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,260
What?

333
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,560
What the hell is with him?

334
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,240
Do you know, Ai'Keen?

335
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,360
It's probably... about his brother?

336
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,320
Then... I'll be right back.

337
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,980
Yeah.

338
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah.

339
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,740
Take good care of yourself.

340
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,980
That's all.

341
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,440
Yeah.

342
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,200
Is there anything wrong with your little brother?

343
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,299
Did I tell you that it's my little brother?

344
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:38,100
No. I just guessed it.

345
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,180
It's nothing.

346
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,840
Tar sent me a Line text saying that he called and couldn't reach mom.

347
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,460
I thought it was a big deal, but nothing serious.

348
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,800
I must be crazy.

349
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,240
I don't think you're crazy, dude.

350
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Aren't you just worried about your little brother is all?

351
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,740
It's probably only you who understands me.

352
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, do you want to understand me, too?

353
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,380
What do you want me to understand about you?

354
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,020
Yeah... It's nothing, dude.

355
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,980
And about your lack of inspiration... I found this younger guy.

356
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,460
He seems damn interesting.

357
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,520
How so?

358
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
Hello, P'Tum.

359
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,240
Hello, Tar.

360
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,700
Actually, I have something to tell you.

361
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,020
What is it?

362
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,040
I got a break and some free time to go back to Thailand now.

363
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,220
When is that?

364
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,880
Pretty soon.

365
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,440
But I haven't booked the ticket for the flight or anything yet.

366
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,556
P'Tar, will you be free to pick me up?

367
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:45,620
Hey! But if you're not free, it's all right! I can go back myself.

368
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
Because I've grown up a lot more now,

369
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,720
and I've gotten better now too.

370
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,880
How have you been lately? Are you doing well?

371
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
Not too bad.

372
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,920
How about you?

373
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,900
I'm fine. No need to worry.

374
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,100
And also... I have the same question for you.

375
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,580
And that's....?

376
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,920
Do you want any souvenirs from here?

377
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,220
Then I'll give the usual answer.

378
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't want anything.

379
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,840
Then... I'll ask our mom and dad if they want anything.

380
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,620
Of course.

381
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,620
Anyway, once I book a flight, I'll quickly send it to you.

382
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,200
Sure.

383
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,100
Also, around the time that you're coming... there should happen to be a music festival at my university.

384
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,820
Let's go together, all right?

385
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,040
Of course. I'm free anyway.

386
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,280
Then I'll see you later, all right?

387
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,740
Okay.

388
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,620
Bye-bye.

389
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
What's up, Daddy's good boy?

390
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,420
Not going to sleep yet?

391
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,140
I'm not sleepy. I'm the best.

392
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,280
So what did Daddy's good boy do today?

393
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,160
I fought with Uncle Tin's friend and I won, too!

394
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,300
But he said you were a bad person first.

395
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,120
So I couldn't let it go.

396
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,540
Aren't I great?

397
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,460
Let's see...

398
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,900
Nong Phu, why don't you tell me who this friend of Uncle Tin is?

399
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,200
Of course! You can totally trust me!

400
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,080
Look into Tin's friend named Can for me.

401
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,160
I just want to know who Tin's important person is.

402
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,560
You probably won't get angry, right?

403
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,800
Ai'Ae.

404
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,180
Just what is love?

405
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,780
Why are you asking?

406
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,620
It's been on my mind...

407
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,140
Right now, I feel…

408
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,080
If I eat, it doesn't taste good.

409
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,820
If I sleep, it's like I don't get enough sleep.

410
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,420
I can't even really take a proper poop.

411
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,440
I've only been thinking about whether I like him or not.

412
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,140
That's why I've been wondering, just what is love actually?

413
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,520
I don't know what love means to others.

414
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,560
But for me...

415
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,520
It means Ai'Pete.

416
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,620
It's all right.

418
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm sorry that I can't give you the right answer.

419
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,680
Try to think it over.

420
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,400
Fighting.

421
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,420
Why is what I see... only pain?

422
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,460
I don't want to be like you, Ai'Ae.

423
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,740
Cantaloupe.

424
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,620
I told you not to call me by my full name.

425
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,020
Call me just Can, dude.

426
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,640
"Just Can."

427
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Are you trying to piss me off?

428
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,260
And what are you smiling about?

429
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,160
Why are you avoiding me?

430
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,300
Who's avoiding you? I wasn't avoiding you or anything.

431
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,760
Not at all. Who's avoiding you? Are you just overthinking it?

432
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,241
You were avoiding me.

433
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,920
But I'm still glad.

434
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,760
Why are you happy?

435
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,600
Are you crazy?

436
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,460
Because it means that you're finally starting to think of me.

437
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,540
Are you sure it's not just in your head?

438
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,880
I wasn't thinking of you or anything...

439
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,600
Where are we going?

440
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,780
To find a quiet place to talk.

441
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm not going. If you want to talk, then talk here.

442
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,160
Whatever it is, just say it.

443
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,620
Will you be my boyfriend, Can?

444

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,620
Can you be my boyfriend?

450
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,740
Calm down, Can.

451
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,220
Stop imagining things.

452
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,340
Dude.

453
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,360
What's wrong with Can?

454
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,700
He's practicing very hard.

455
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,920
Does he want to win a world championship?

456
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,300
If you're worried, why don't you go in?

We have a match tomorrow. You should come.

00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,820
I think he wants you to come.

459
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,897
