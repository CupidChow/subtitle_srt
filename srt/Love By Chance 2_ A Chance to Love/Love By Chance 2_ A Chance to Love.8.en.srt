1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,500
Why do we have to be in a relationship?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,300
Because you're the air I breathe.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,260
Can't we be friends?

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,020
I only need you.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,040
Can.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,600
Give Ai'Can a bit of time.

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,300
Him not understanding it,

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,660
doesn't mean that he doesn't feel anything.

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,540
We all even practiced to death!

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,660
We all practiced every day!

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,740
I'm right here now.

12
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm always right beside you.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,380
I like you.

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,440
I like you, too.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,700
You guys go home safely, all right?

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,140
We lost this time, but it's all right.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,900
There are still chances in the future.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,180
Get going already.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,960
You too, Captain.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,460
You did your best today.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,340
I'm really proud of you, friend.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,700
No, Ai'Champ... Don't...

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,660
I'll cry...

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,240
P'No! Ai'Nic told me that...

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,860
Can I console you, P'No?

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,260
I lost, Ai'Kla...

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,440
I lost...

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,540
You don't have to cry.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm right here.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,920
I love you, P'No.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,800
That matter and this matter are totally separate things.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm still not over being mad at you.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you for consoling me, Ai'Kla.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,660
P'No!

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
♫ I used to tell you ♫

36
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:44,760
♫ That we could never be more than friends ♫

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,900
♫ When I said that I don't love you, I actually don't know ♫

38
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,660
♫ I don't know what this feeling is ♫

39
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,060
♫ When I said that we're just friends, I actually understand now ♫

40
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,880
♫ Can I change it? I don't want us to be just friends anymore ♫

41
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,120
♫ This time, you won't be sad ♫

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,680
♫ We will get through it together ♫

43

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,660
Tin, I'm upset.

56
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,460
Do you hear me that I'm upset?

57
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,840
I know that already.

58
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,500
But before anything else...

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,960
Here.

60
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
You should eat first.

61
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm still upset though.

62
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
You're so messy.

63
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,880
Can...

64
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,300
Enough.

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,940
But I'm sad though.

66
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,040
But before that, swallow the food first.

67
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,140
Well, you told me to do my best.

68
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,260
But I still lost.

69
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,920
You came to cheer me on, but I still lost, Tin!

70
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
I don't want to disappoint anyone on my team.

71
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,580
Also…

72
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,220
I don't want to disappoint you either.

73
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,380
I've never been disappointed in you.

74
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,500
Ai'Tin...

75
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
I can't eat anymore...

76
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,700
Then I'll ask for the bill. Let me send you home.

77
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,520
Can I not go home?

78
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm afraid of being teased by Ai'Ley.

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,620
Okay.

80
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,640
Where do you want to go?

81
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
Your house.

82
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,440
Tin.

83
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,200
What is it?

84
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,840
What is it?

85
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,580
Tonight, can I sleep with you?

86
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,240
The thing is... I read that...

87
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,620
Men having sex together for the first time will be painful.

88
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,820
It hurts a lot! It hurts so much that it makes you forget!

89
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,560
So, in case it might help me forget about losing the football game,

90
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,140
you have to help me! Otherwise, I'll have a nightmare for sure!

91
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,400
Nonsense.

92
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,480
How is it nonsense?

93
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,260
You want to sleep together... just because you want to forget the pain?

94
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,960
Well... If you're not going to sleep with me then just say so.

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,540
No.

96
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,020
I don't need just sex.

97
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,540
Fine.

98
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,840
Then I'll go sleep with someone else.

99
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,380
Suit yourself.

100
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,360
Around here, you'll probably be able to find one or two people.

101
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,180
Ai'Tin! Although I'm stupid,

102
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm not willing to just bend my butt over for any random person you know!

103
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
And another thing, I really don't like it at all when you ignore me!

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,160
I call and you never answer. You won't even respond on LINE.

105
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,940
And you're even with girls, too. I don't like any of it!

106
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,240
I don't know! If I'm going to sleep with someone,

107
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,440
I'd only sleep with you!

108
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,400
Are you done talking?

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,840
If you're done, then let's go.

110
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
Go where?

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,420
Get in the car, of course.

112
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,840
Hurry up.

113
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,660
I'm counting. One...

114
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,840
Two...

115
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,960
- Three...
- Ai'Tin!

116
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,620
Could I go buy some things first?

117
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,180
What things?

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,280
Well…

119
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,980
Things for protection!

120
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,400
Wait here for a bit, all right? I'll be back!

121
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,620
Can.

122
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,480
Go take a shower first.

123
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,140
I don't mind.

124
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,960
But I mind.

125
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,960
We'll be dirty anyway though.

126
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,860
Can.

127
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,280
I know.

128
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,860
Why do you have to scold me?

129
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,320
Fine, I'll take a shower.

130
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,060
I'll make sure to be spotless. Wait just a bit, all right?

131
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,000
Auntie Klin?

132
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,620
Yes?

133
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,260
Where's Phu?

134
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,560
Oh, I was told that he was going to the other house with Khun Vadee.

135
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,060
I see.

136
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,420
And have you eaten anything yet, Khun Tul?

137
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,520
Would you like me to prepare anything for you?

138
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,660
I ate already.

139
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,240
You should go and rest.

140
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Lately, I've been coming home late.

141
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,860
You don't have to wait for me.

142
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,300
But either way, it's my duty. I have to prepare it for you anyway.

143
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,260
Right, and if that Hin were still here, he would do the same thing, too.

144
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,200
Auntie, so how's Ai'Hin been lately?

145
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,560
Tul, why did you come back just now?

146
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,340
I wanted to finish all the work first.

147
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,480
By the time I realized it, it was already late.

148
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,940
Really?

149
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,920
Lately, maybe it's just me, but you've been coming home late.

150
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,540
Well…

151
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,280
Is there something wrong between you and Vadee?

152
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
It's nothing.

153
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm the one who should be worried about you, Mom.

154
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
It's already so late, why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

155
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,560
What am I to do if you get sick?

156
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,900
Oh, Tul... You've always been such a good child to your mom.

157
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,820
Not like that Tin.

158
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,400
Today, he brought home a friend from who knows where.

159
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,080
We don't even know whose son or relative he is.

160
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,780
I don't even know what kind of friend he's been meeting with either.

161
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,440
I just hope that the same mistake won't be repeated.

162
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,800
I truly am lucky to have you, Tul.

163
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,860
Tul, you're the son that I can place my hopes on. Right?

164
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,180
Yes, Mom. You can place your hopes on me.

165
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,920
He's both stupid... and crazy...

166
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,800
But so damn cute.

167
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,820
Tin.

168
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,060
I finished taking a shower. Can I get on the bed yet?

169
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,380
I'm clean now.

170
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm cold, too.

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
Can I?

172
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,780
Come sleep with me.

173
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,940
Just sleep, right?

174
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,620
Don't go back on your words.

175
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,480
Weren't you the one who promised that we'd sleep together, but not the kind where we're just sleeping?

176
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
You're not afraid?

177
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,620
Why would I be afraid of you for?

178
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,820
You said you want to feel pain to the point that you forget, right?

179
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,140
I'll make you happy to the point that you just forget it.

180
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,760
Then do it.

181
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,200
What is it?

182
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm upset.

183
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,520
I know.

184
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm upset that I didn't understand my feelings

185
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,140
until I saw you with another girl.

186
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,840
- Ai'Tin.
- Hm?

187
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,080
Once you've slept with me,

188
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,600
you can't sleep with anyone else. All right?

189
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
I promise.

190
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
That I'll only have you.

191
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
You can put your hopes on me,

192
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,400
but I didn't say that I'd fulfill those hopes.

193
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,472
I don't have anything going on with that girl.

194
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,420
But… I saw she was linking her arm with you.

195
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,980
And then I chased her away, because I was annoyed.

196
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,880
Hey, dude! You can't do that to a girl.

197
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,060
She'll get her feelings hurt.

198
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,720
So, what do you want me to do?

199
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,200
Well just talk to her nicely. Maybe she'll understand.

200
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,260
And what if I talked to her nicely and she didn't understand

201
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,600
Then she would still be a nuisance to me.

202
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,960
Don't be like that, Ai'Tin.

203
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,900
My way is the best way already.

204
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,440
Whatever. I don't want to think anymore. I have a headache.

205
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,960
So... you don't have anything going on with that girl, right?

206
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm glad... that you're jealous.

207
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I…

208
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,720
Trust me.

209
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,400
I only have you.

210
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,480
I trust you.

211
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,660
By the way… Tin.

212
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,060
Hm?

213
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,160
Can we do another round?

214
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,120
Hey! Ai'Tin!

215
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,440
Why are you being like this?

216
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,660
I'm just asking for one more round.

217
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,760
Why do you have to pretend to be sleepy?

218
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,540
Please.

219
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,660
Cheers!

220
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,140
Come on, guys.

221
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,100
Let's celebrate our loss.

222
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,180
But we'll never give up.

223
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,960
My energy is back.

224
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,620
I thought you'd be sadder than this, Ai'No.

225
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,780
Come on.

226
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
This year we didn't win,

227
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,820
but isn't there still hope for next year?

228
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,500
But next year you won't be here anymore.

229
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
That's enough, dude.

230
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,520
It's not like I'm going to die.

231
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I'll be around here.

232
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,840
Although I might not be with you guys next year,

233
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,580
but all of you guys are still here.

234
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,080
Ai'Ae, next year, you have to win the championship. All right?

235
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,100
If you're able to do it, it's not just you guys who'll be happy.

236
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,100
The seniors like me will be very happy, too.

237
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,540
You got it, Bro.

238
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,580
I'm passing on the baton to you then.

239
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,700
Oh right! Where'd Ai'Can go? I haven't seen him.

240
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,000
You don't have to worry about him. Ai'Tin won't hurt him.

241
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
That's good then, dude.

242
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
All right.

243
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,760
Cheers again.

244
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,740
Take a photo for me.

245
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,680
Yeah, I'm about to leave and won't be here anymore.

246
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,560
Come, come.

247
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,300
Hey! Wow! The camera is pretty good.

248
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,420
Make sure you get it, you guys.

249
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,725
You'll be waiting to see my success, right, Ai'Pete?

250
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,780
Good morning.

251
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,240
Good morning...

252
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,040
How did I get here?

253
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,320
If you're awake, go take a shower.

254
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,980
What's wrong?

255
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,080
N-Nothing's wrong, dude.

256
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,920
Then go take a shower.

257
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
When it came to last night, you were so sweet.

258
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,675
And now you're acting mean... Tin...

259
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,420
It's called making love.

260
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,840
Huh?

261
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,120
Last night, what we did wasn't just sex.

262
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
It's called making love. You should know that.

263
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,400
How are they different, Tin?

264
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,500
Because for me, making love is done with my lover only.

265
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,340
Go take a shower already.

266
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
I'll go make something for you to eat.

267
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
What lover?

268
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,080
I got goosebumps...

269
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,580
Why do I feel like there're spiders in my stomach?

270
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,300
About last night…

271
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,540
it didn't give me as many goosebumps as when he called me his lover...
(T/N: He's basically saying it's really cringey)

272
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,900
Why did I bring the blanket with me?

273
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,220
I should go take a shower.

274
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,160
- Ai'Tin.
- Hm?

275
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,760
Just now, you called me your lover. Right?

276
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,440
I can call you a lover,

277
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,580
boyfriend, or wife.

278
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,220
Anything is fine.

279
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,180
Dude, can you not call me your wife?

280
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,040
It gives me goosebumps.

281
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,960
Just when will you be my boyfriend then?

282
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,840
About the before... I'm sorry.

283
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,760
Forget about before.

284
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,480
What about this time?

285
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,200
Dude, I'm not handsome.

286
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,300
I can see that.

287
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,040
I'm not rich.

288
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
I know that already.

289
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,060
You can just nod. You don't have to respond.

290
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,320
Another thing... I'm stupid, too.

291
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,380
I don't have anything that's suitable with a top-tier young master like you.

292
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,600
Know this, Ai'Can...

293
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,520
I've never cared about any of the things that you just mentioned.

294
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,520
If I cared, I wouldn't have bothered you in the first place.

295
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,520
Um… then…

296
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
Then?

297
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,180
Then… be my boyfriend, all right? You bad-mannered young master.

298
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,800
Be my boyfriend, all right? Cantaloupe.

299
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,388
Here.

300
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,000
You asshole, Tin. I'm hungry.

301
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,880
Make a deal with me first.

302
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,560
What kind of deal this time?

303
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,580
I don't like it when you use swear words.

304
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,322
I also don't like it that you call me by my full name either.

305
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,900
Cantaloupe.

306
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,560
Yeah, fine.

307
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Do you want me to address you as "Mister"?

308
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,720
You don't need to.

309
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,580
But words like asshole,

310
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,500
fuck,

311
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,340
bastard,

312
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,400
or all those other swear words that you like to say,

313
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,300
I don't like it.

314
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,640
Yeah...

315
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
But sometimes it just slips out...

316
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,660
But I guess I'll try...

317
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,240
That's it. Here.

318
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,720
You don't like it when I say swear words, right?

319
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,640
Then... Khun Tin, Sir.

320
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,080
Again.

321
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,820
What again?

322
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,800
Don't pretend to be stupid, Ai'Can.

323
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,220
If you like me acting all sweet, why don't you just say so?

324
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,240
Khun Tin, Sir! Can is hungry now.

325
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,380
Can would like to eat...

326
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,200
That's enough.

327
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,460
Or I won't be able to restrain myself.

328
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,480
Just this, and I'm pretty crazy in love with you already.

329
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,109
Did you lose to the point that you've become crazy now?

330
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,240
Ai'Ley, my dear sister... I missed you so much!

331
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,540
Did you get drunk?

332
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,420
Go away. You're smelly.

333
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm not drunk or anything. I didn't even drink.

334
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,700
I went to Ai'Tin's house.

335
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,860
Really?

336
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,480
How was it? Tell me about it.

337
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,580
It was like this! His TV was like... had a huge screen. Bigger than this one!

338
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,160
The bathtub is so big that you can swim in it.

339
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,500
His bed is so soft and comfy. There's a swimming pool, too.

340
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,100
Air conditioner is on 24 hours. Everywhere you go is cold. Not like our house where it's so hot...

341
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,180
Also, the food! It was like... Wow, so damn delicious!

342
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,520
You won't feel full no matter how much you eat.

343
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
How great!

344
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,120
P'Tin is really amazing.

345
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,400
If he loved a boy that was... really cute, had red lips, and a slender body beside him...

346
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,520
It would be satisfyingly perfect.

347
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,606
But he really should have been friends with you though.

348
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,220
But Ai'Tin likes me!

349
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,880
Is it that he feels sorry for you?

350
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,540
Whatever you say.

351
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,400
You can ship Ai'Tin with whoever you like.

352
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm going to take a shower and sleep now. I didn't get to sleep last night.

353
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,500
Don't touch me!

354
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,280
Brother Can!

355
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,300
Tell me more about P'Tin first!

356
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,020
What were you doing to make you not sleep?

357
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Why the hell does she like Ai'Tin flirting with someone else?

358
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,680
Ai'Tin is MY boyfriend!

359
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,214
I can even call him my hubby now.
(T/N: Thai has 2 words for husband; This is informal, not necessarily married, but are sleeping together)

360
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,040
But… I just can't say it is all...

361
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,480
"Imagine if he has a cute boy by his side bla-bla…"

362
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,560
MY boyfriend.

363
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,740
Seriously, Brother Can.

364
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,100
Someone like P'Tin,

365
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:53,160
if he had a guy that's really fair-skinned, really cute, with red lips, a bit manly... by his side,

366
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,040
it would surely be really adorable!

367
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,180
What did I say wrong?

368
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,240
I'm serious, Mama.

369
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,600
P'Tin is damn handsome.

370
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,500
He's like an incarnated angel.

371
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,640
If there were two male angels together.

372
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,780
It must be perfect.

373
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,340
A male angel should be paired with a female angel, Ley.

374
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,480
But that's not always.

375
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,620
A male angel can be paired with another male angel.

376
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,000
But... if I were to imagine a picture of Brother Can with P'Ti,

377
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,800
I really can't imagine it.

378
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
It gives me goosebumps.

379
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,700
Right? How creepy, right?

380
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,660
Brother Can!

381
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,300
Can I ask you something?

382
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,980
Can you ask Tin for me if he has a boyfriend/girlfriend?
(T/N: The Thai word for boyfriend/girlfriend is gender neutral)

383
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
Don't want to. I won't ask.

384
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,100
Why not? Please?

385
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,020
Just ask him if he has a girlfriend or a boyfriend.

386
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,140
But if he has a boyfriend,

387
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,320
it would be really great!

388
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,720
Brother Can!

389
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,940
Can you ask him for me if he has a boyfriend or not?

390
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,380
That's all and he can't even do that for me?

391
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't figure it out!

392
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
What's with you this time, Ai'Can?

393
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,540
Are you still irritated about losing the match the other day?

394
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,420
Ai'Job,

395
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,820
does a handsome guy have to be with another handsome guy?

396
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,140
Are you crazy?

397
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,580
A handsome guy should be with a pretty girl, of course!

398
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Like me.

399
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,080
Of course, I'd have to be paired with that young nurse.

400
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,520
There should be a limit to your craziness.

401
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,300
It's so tiring to have such a stupid friend.

402
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,100
Damn you. You're talking nonsense. I'm not talking to you anymore.

403
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,760
You bastard, we're about to have an exam!

404
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,700
You're still going to skip??

405
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,250
Geez!

406
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,240
Took you long enough.

407
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,880
What are you doing here?

408
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,080
Isn't the IC building closed already?

409
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm here to pick up my boyfriend to go eat a meal.

410
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,520
You say that word so often.

411
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,820
"I'm here to pick up my 'boyfriend' to go eat a meal."

412
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,760
"I'm here to pick up my 'boyfriend' to go here and there."

413
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,960
Do you not know how to say other words?

414
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,280
Well, you are really my boyfriend.

415
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,020
What are you thinking?

416
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,780
Well… I'm thinking that... I've become the sugar baby of Sugar Daddy Tin.

417
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,200
Huh?

418
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,960
Who's sugar baby? Who's sugar daddy?

419
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,960
Well, look at you.

420
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,460
You always treat me well.

421
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,020
How could I not call you a sugar daddy?

422
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
Or should I call you daddy?

423
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,020
Like... "Daddy Dearest.." Like this.

424
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,620
Other couples call each other like babe, bae, or boo.

425
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,800
Should I call you daddy then?

426
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,940
Daddy Dearest!

427
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,960
Let's get going already.

428
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,620
Go where?

429
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,180
To go eat.

430
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,720
See?

431
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,780
This much like a sugar daddy... you're such a sugar daddy.

432
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,520
Then let's go quickly, my sugar baby.

433
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,980
Go do your duty to your sugar daddy already.

434
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,080
Daddy, wait for me!

435
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,940
Geez, Ai'Tin.

436
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,480
Don't make such a grumpy face like that.

437
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,340
It's just a second.

438
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,980
I already made an appointment with you.

439
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,240
When did you do that?

440
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,020
Didn't you come to pick me up on your own?

441
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
And another thing, today I'm not here to play soccer.

442
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm just here to get my comics back from Ai'Pond.

443
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,240
Come on. It'll be quick

444
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,600
I'll let you treat me a meal in return.

445
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,600
Right, Ai'Tin...

446
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,120
My little sister, Ai'Ley.

447
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,800
She likes to ship you with other handsome guys.

448
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,340
So what?

449
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,080
I don't understand.

450
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,300
Why do girls think good looking people have to be paired with good looking people?

451
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,380
Exactly.

452
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,100
Even someone like me can date someone like you.

453
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,060
Why? What's wrong with someone like me?

454
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,000
Huh?

455
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,900
Well, you're not handsome,

456
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,020
you're not rich,

457
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,300
and you're not good at studying either.

458
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,040
I'm not the one who said that.

459
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,020
You said it yourself.

460
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,580
Then go and date someone else then!

461
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,600
I won't go, no matter how hard you chase me away.

462
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,640
You're the only one for me.

463
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,980
You're crazy!

464
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,560
Ai'Ley!

465
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,840
I'm here to do a younger sister's duty.

466
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,820
P'Ae, you're okay now, right?

467
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,220
Thanks.

468
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm okay now.

469
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,060
I'm sorry for making you worry.

470
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,540
Ai'Ley!

471
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,280
Come here.

472
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,620
Brother Can!

473
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,960
Brother Can.

474
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
What are you doing here?

475
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,800
I came to accompany Chompoo!

476
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,900
That's all?

477
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,120
Of course, that's all!

478
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,340
P'Tin, hello.

479
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,520
P'Tin is so damn handsome!

480
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
If P'Pete was still studying here,

481
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,740
P'Pete and P'Tin would be such a perfect match!

482
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,720
I don't see how they'd be perfect together!

483
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,200
And why do you have to be so irritated?

484
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,920
I don't know.

485
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,640
I'm off.

486
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,240
Ai'Tin, let's go.

487
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,980
Wait.

488
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,800
Well, if you're going to go then just go by yourself. Why do you have to drag P'Tin with you?

489
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,620
He just got here.

490
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,480
Because he's...

491
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,380
"Because he's..."?

492
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,120
Because he's what?

493
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,480
Can and I, we're...

494
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,980
You and Brother Can are what?

495
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,900
It's nothing.

496
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,420
Brother Can!

497
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,000
If you have a secret, tell me right now!

498
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,080
I told you it's nothing! So it's nothing!

499
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,060
It's because your voice is like this that there has to be something!

500
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,240
Is there a problem?

501
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,180
Brother Can!

502
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,200
Tell me now or open his mouth.

503
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,700
It's nothing!

504
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,460
- Brother Can!
- I told you it's nothing!

505
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,940
Brother Can!

506
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
You want to know so badly, right?

507
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,240
Fine.

508
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,300
Then watch carefully!

509
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,060
So, now, do you know who Ai'Tin's boyfriend is?

510
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,360
♫ I'll let you be my sky when I'm flying ♫

511
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,820
♫ I'll let you be my guiding star when I lost my way ♫

512
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,540
♫ I wish you were here to hold me through these cold nights ♫

513
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:21,400
♫ I wish that you will be my everlasting love ♫

514
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,200
Why can P'Tul do it but I can't do it?
[Preview]

515
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,300
Because your older brother has to shoulder all the burdens instead of me.
[Preview]

516
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,100
So what if I asked to live somewhere else?

517
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,263
You're going to buy a room just because of that?

518
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:32,300
I also want freedom.

519
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,920
Don't forget to bring and introduce your friend to me, too.

520
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,260
Hey.

521
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,300
That's your asshole older brother.

522
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,820
I'm glad that I finally get to meet my brother's important person.

523
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
You're such a…

524
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,320
I want to know your old master's weakness.

525
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,440
I can't tell you that.

526
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:15,460
♫ Finally, I realized how it feels to lose someone special ♫

527
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,980
♫ It is too late for me to realize ♫

528
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,940
