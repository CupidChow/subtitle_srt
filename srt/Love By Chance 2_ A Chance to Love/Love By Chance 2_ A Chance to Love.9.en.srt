1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,300
Then… be my boyfriend, all right? You bad-mannered young master.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,380
Be my boyfriend, Cantaloupe.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,200
But he really shouldn't have been friends with you though.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,660
But Ai'Tin likes me!

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,680
Is it that he feels sorry for you?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,220
Can and I, we're...

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,420
If you have a secret, tell me right now!

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,660
You want to know so badly, right?

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,600
Then watch carefully!

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,420
So, now, do you know who Ai'Tin's boyfriend is?

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,080
Brother…

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,000
Brother Can…

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,420
and P'Tin.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,740
You guys are boyfriends?

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,540
I don't know if I should call you crazy,

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,720
or if I should praise you instead.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,420
I'm really happy for you guys.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Can! You really are the best!

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,340
My friend is amazing.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,220
Wow, kissing in the middle of the field? This will definitely reach Ai'Pond's ears.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
That's right.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,100
Me and Ai'Tin are boyfriends.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,760
Is that clear?

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,360
Let's go.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,800
What was that?

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
Brother Can?

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,960
Brother Can??

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,280
Brother Can and P'Tin are boyfriends?

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,000

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,580

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:21,860

[Love by Chance: Season 2]
[Episode 9]

51
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,660
I don't know if I'll ever be able to show my face again!

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,220
What have I done?

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm glad that you like me so much that you were brave enough to do something like this.

54
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,740
Hey! I don't like you or anything!

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,740
I just ran out of patience.

56
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,500
You and I are boyfriends!

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,800
Ai'Lay has no right to ship you with anyone!

58
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,880
What are you smiling about?

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,120
If you didn't like me so much,

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,340
you wouldn't have been this jealous.

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,500
I'm not.

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,260
What are you laughing about? Comfort me!

63
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,360
Comfort me!

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,140
There, there. Daddy's sugar baby.

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,700
I still haven't gotten over my amazement at our friend.

66
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,680
Not just you. I'm also still amazed.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,980
Geez. Ai'Can was really daring, right?

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,040
For this... we should give him a round of applause.

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,700
I guess they must really love each other.

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,740
That's why he was shameless enough to do that.

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,500
I want to laugh when I think about it.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,020
Dude,

73
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,360
is it that nice to have a boyfriend?

74
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,720
Don't tell me that...

75
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,540
No! It's nothing!

76
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,880
You're overthinking it.

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,460
I'm going to head out first, all right?

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,300
What the hell?

79
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,700
I was just going to ask him if he was envious of them.

80
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,620
What's he worked up over again?

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,980
Why did I suddenly think of him?

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,760
Or is it because I'm lonely?

83
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,580
Maybe not.

84
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,440
Shit! I accidentally called him!

85
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,320
What's up, P'No?

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,960
I dialed the wrong number! It's nothing! That's all for now!

87
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,840
Geez!

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,420
What's with you, Ai'No?!

89
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,460
Geez...

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,120
There is no answer from your requested number...

91
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Ai'Pond.

92
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,240
Dude, do you know what happened at the football field the other day?

93
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
I don't know.

94
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,780
How is that possible? A guy who's super nosey like you?

95
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,140
Well, yeah.

96
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,400
A guy who's super nosey like me doesn't know about it.

97
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,640
That's why I'm so angry with myself right now.

98
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,740
Especially when it's about Ai'Can and that IC kid, too.

99
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm so damn mad at myself.

100
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,020
Is my gossiping skill getting rusty, dude?

101
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,580
I was wondering why you look irritated all day.

102
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,620
And also...

103
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,400
Ai'Ae, did you know about it, too?

104
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,740
This guy knows about everything, but he won't tell me anything.

105
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,040
So I had to go snoop around and ask each and every member of the football team.

106
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,200
And what I found out that Ai'Can pulled Ai'Tin in for a kiss on the lips!

107
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,920
Geez! The whole university knows about that already, dude!

108
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,320
My friends from the IC said there's a whole line of heartbroken girls.

109
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,960
Including me.

110
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,300
It already reached the IC?

111
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,960
The whole university, dude! The whole university knows!

112
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Where have you been?

113
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,000
I missed the chance to be the first one to spread the gossip.

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,020
You're too slow.

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ai'Ae, and what are you doing this time?

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,380
You're choosing a photo again?

117
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,660
Yeah.

118
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Just how long are you going to keep doing this?

119
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,080
I'll just keep doing it.

120
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,300
There're 365 days in one year.

121
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,200
Why don't you just post 365 photos?

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,380
If he's not here for a year, then I'll post 365 photos.

123
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,740
If he's not here for two years, then I'll post 730 photos.

124
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,820
I'll keep posting it.

125
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,980
I'll tell him that I never stopped loving him.

126
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,020
You guys are so serious.

127
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,540
I'm going to go to my next class, all right?

128
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,940
I'll... leave him to you too.

129
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,020
Make sure that he's okay.

130
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,620
I'm leaving. Ai'Noon and Ai'Jane are waiting.

131
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm Bow. My name is Bow and I'm going to find Noon and Jane.
(T/N: A reference to an old song "Noon, Jane, Bow"; It's become popular again due to a Tik Tok trend)

132
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,280
Wait for me just a bit!

133
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,500
Since when did she have new friends?

134
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,180
Hello, Nong'Ae.

135
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,500
Can I talk to you?

136
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,140
How do you know me?

137
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,780
Before I answer your question, let me introduce myself first.

138
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,840
My name is Keen. I'm from the Faculty of Music and a fourth year.

139
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,860
Are you friends with P'Tharn and P'Type?

140
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,040
Well, something like that.

141
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,380
I know Tharn, but we're studying in different majors.

142
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,660
So what do you want from me?

143
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,260
Then let me get straight to the point.

144
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,380
The thing is, I wanted to know why you always post a photo every day.

145
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,920
Some photos don't seem to have anything at all,

146
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,180
and just have a really short message.

147
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,940
I know that it's rude to come and ask you about your private matters.

148
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,720
But I've been following you for a while now.

149
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,540
And I'm also interested every time I see a photo.

150
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,320
It's like... I feel like you're trying to tell a story to someone.

151
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,800
If I want to tell it, what does that have to do with you?

152
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,340
It's like I told you, I'm a music student.

153
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,820
So I got some inspiration.

154
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,360
I want to tell your story through a song.

155
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm not interested. I think you should find someone else.

156
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,460
Wait, wait. Listen to me until the end.

157
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,060
I can do it in my own way. I don't need anyone's help.

158
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,860
Don't you want to tell your feelings to that person in more than just a few words?

159
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,340
A song can say things more than words.

160
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,900
This song would be your song that will express your feelings for that person.

161
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,340
Anyway, I just want you to think about it for a bit.

162
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,040
I'll get going first.

163
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,740
Are you really okay, Ai'Ae?

164
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,300
You don't even like troublesome things.

165
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,660
And also... apart from you having to talk to that P'Keen or whatever, you'll still have to talk to his bandmates, too.

166
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,640
Yeah. I don't like troublesome things.

167
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,620
Then, why are you still going to…

168
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,140
You know why.

169
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,740
I can do everything for Ai'Pete.

170
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,800
Ai'Ae...

171
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,640
I want him to know.

172
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,380
Since the day that we broke up,

173
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,620
there's not a day that goes by that I don't miss him.

174
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,160
If there's anything that I can do,

175
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,320
even if it's something I don't like, I will do it.

176
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,020
Oh hey, P'No.

177
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,420
What happened to you?

178
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,540
Your face looks like you haven't slept in years.

179
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
It's because of your friend, Ai'Can.

180
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,220
He's been playing with Ai'Nic at my house.

181
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,600
He's been there for three or four days already.

182
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,880
By the time they finish playing, it's... it's 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.

183
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,080
No matter how many times I tell him, he won't freaking leave.

184
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,980
That's why my state looks like this.

185
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,460
Why's it like that, bro?

186
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,420
How am I supposed to know?

187
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,320
Damn... No matter how many times I ask him, he won't answer me.

188
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
They even have plans to meet up again.

189
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,800
I want to run away from home already!

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What the hell?

191
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,320
Hey! Ley!

192
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,980
What are you doing here this late at night?

193
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,800
I was so startled.

194
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm the one who should be asking you.

195
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,500
Why have you been acting like you're sneaking around?

196
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,120
How many days has it been already that you have come back home at this time?

197
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,940
Well…

198
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,900
Oh! I just happened to be planning the strategy with P'No.

199
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,000
And for some days... I also went to sleep over Ai'Job's house.

200
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,980
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to bed now. If you have anything to say, let's talk tomorrow.

201
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,520
Ouch! That hurts!

202
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,260
That's because I meant to hurt you!

203
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,995
How many days did you think you could keep running away from me?

204
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:52,660
Well… for several days still...

205
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,580
So, you and P'Tin are already boyfriends, right?

206
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,380
Tell me.

207
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,600
If you lie to me again,

208
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,200
I'll really stab you.

209
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Fine.

210
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm sorry then... for making you disappointed...

211
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,940
So, why do I have to feel disappointed?

212
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,600
Well, you wanted Ai'Tin to be paired with a guy who's handsome, rich,

213
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,040
and befitting of him, isn't that right?

214
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,420
But I also never said that if you were together, I'd be against it.

215
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,200
Another thing, you're still my older brother.

216
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,880
So if... P'Tin's already made a choice

217
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,340
then what can I possibly do?

218
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,380
You...You're actually siding with your older brother?

219
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,420
Of course, I'm siding with you.

220
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,880
Because if Dad and Mom are not on your side,

221
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,360
I'll be the one who supports you. And another thing,

222
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,340
It's P'Tin!

223
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,560
Don't let him slip through your fingers!

224
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,400
Okay.

225
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,240
I feel at ease now. I should go to sleep.

226
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,320
Oh!

227
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,520
Don't think of running away from me again, all right?

228
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,320
Because someone like you, can't run for long.

229
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,340
Don't let that slip through your fingers...

230
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,760
WOAH!

231
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,240
Ai'Ley! It's you again?

232
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm the one who should be saying, "It's you again?"

233
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,660
Why did you come downstairs? I was just about to go upstairs already.

234
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,360
Then just go up. I'm hungry. I'm finding something to eat.

235
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,323
Hey! Wait!

236
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,200
I've got this.

237
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,220
You don't need to eat any snacks.

238
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,340
Here. This will improve your skin health.

239
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,960
So your skin will become more resilient.

240
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,400
Your face will be plump, too.

241
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,660
Why does it have to be plump?

242
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,740
I'm hungry. I want to feel full.

243
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,680
That's exactly why. You'll feel full, and it's not fattening either.

244
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,560
You have P'Tin as your boyfriend.

245
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,640
So you need to take better care of yourself, too.

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't eat snacks, all right?

247
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah.

248
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
This is yummy.

249
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,340
Plump skin would be pretty good.

250
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,660
Ai'Tin likes to kiss my cheeks a lot lately.

251
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,840
I don't want my cheeks to be damaged.

252
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,740
Is it plump yet?

253
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,820
Ai'Tin! Did you know, Ai'Ley didn't kill me.

254
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
At first I was stressed to death, so I was hiding it from her.

255
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,240
But in the end, she wasn't angry.

256
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,740
If I knew this, I wouldn't have wasted time sleeping over and this and that person's houses.

257
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,165
Whose houses have you slept over?

258
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,980
Come on. Don't be mad.

259
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,580
I was laying around over at P'No's house. And I also played games over at P'Job's house.

260
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,280
Once Ai'Ley went to sleep, I just went back home. That's all.

261
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,480
Next time, come and sleep over at my house.

262
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,020
I don't want to. Your house is also far.

263
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,840
Also, it'd be really late and you'd have to drop me off, too.

264
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,380
There are no buses either.

265
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,400
If I was to sleep there, the only option would be to spend the night there.

266
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,360
But I'm at ease now. Because either way, now I won't get killed by my little sister.

267
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,220
Fine. Then I think I'll buy a room as well.

268
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,200
What are you going to buy a room for?

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,380
You already have a house. You also already have a car.

270
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,660
For what crazy reason would you need to buy a room?

271
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,400
So we can do something more conveniently.

272
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,547
Are...

273
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:23,155
you... talking about dirty stuff?

274
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,920
That's right. Right now, it's not very convenient.

275
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,640
How is it not convenient?

276
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,240
My mom didn't even say anything about me staying over at your house.

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,120
But if you're bored, you can come to my house!

278
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,040
My mom doesn't mind.

279
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,940
If I go, do you think the people in your house won't know...

280
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,060
that we…

281
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,300
That's true...

282
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,900
If I were to imagine my mom hearing me...

283
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
I get goosebumps!

284
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,840
Mom would definitely smash the door down to come in!

285
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,920
But Ai'Tin,

286
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,460
are... you really going to buy a room just for that reason?

287
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,020
Khun Chai Tin is definitely not ordinary, huh?

288
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,040
Not just that.

289
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,180
I also want freedom, too.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,220
Then... why are you just buying it now when you just started dating me?

291
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,680
At that time, I wanted to have some existence in that house, too.

292
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,340
You don't have to worry, all right? Forget those people in that house!

293
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,260
You have me now.

294
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,160
If there's a day I ever meet your brother, I'll also punch him in the face for you, too.

295
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,100
You said it already, all right?

296
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,160
Trust me. Someone like me is a man of my word.

297
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,120
[Personal Information]

298
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,300
It's time for your brother to meet him.

299
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,260
What is it?

300
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
It's about the internship.

301
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,760
Didn't I already tell your older brother that I'm not letting you do it?

302
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,900
Let's talk about this when the university tells you to do it.

303
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,640
Then why that…

304
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Why can P'Tul do it but I can't?

305
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,260
Because you and your older brother are not the same.

306
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,660
How are we not the same? Aren't we both Medthanan?

307
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:43,580
Because your older brother has to shoulder all the responsibility and burdens instead of me.

308
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,640
But you're not the one.

309
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,740
Dad, you're saying that like I'm not your child.

310
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,720
I never said anything like that.

311
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,400
And what if I asked to live somewhere else?

312
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,920
It's up to you.

313
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,100
Just looking at your face and I already know that you must not have gotten what you wanted, huh, Tin?

314
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,460
I already told you. You can't means you can't.

315
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,380
You're the one who told Dad, right?

316
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Look at what you're saying...

317
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Anything that Dad has already decided on... I also can't do anything about it.

318
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,300
There's something on this earth that you can't do?

319
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,420
There's plenty.

320
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,020
Such as the matter of... making my little brother go back to being adorable like before.

321
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,240
That probably will never happen.

322
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,800
And don't forget to bring your friend and introduce him to me, too.

323
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,900
Damn it.

324
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,660
He no longer exists.

325
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,880
That stupid little brother...

326
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,980
can no longer exist.

327
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,760
Brother Tul. Brother Tul, you have to believe me.

328
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,400
I really didn't mess with drugs!

329
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,540
Everyone looks at me badly now, Brother!

330
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,640
But I really didn't do it.

331
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,440
Even if other people don't believe it, it's all right.

332
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,200
But you have to believe me, Brother. All right?

333
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,320
You have to believe me, all right?

334
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,800
Right now, Mom and Dad already hate me.

335
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,580
But I don't care, Brother.

336
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,860
As long as you believe me, that's enough.

337
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,080
Of course, I believe you. I believe you.

338
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,080
Because I'm the one who made you like this.

339
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,260
What do you mean?

340
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,480
This is not funny.

341
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,260
Do you think I'm joking?

342
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm the one who put you at that party.

343
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm the one who called the news reporters there.

344
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,960
I'm the one who ordered you to be on the news there.

345
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm the one who ruined your life.

346
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,340
I don't believe it.

347
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,140
You're just joking, right?

348
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,000
You...You're drunk, right?

349
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,940
I told you not to drink too much alcohol! It's not good!

350
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,280
Just how much longer are you going to be stupid, Ai'Tin?!

351
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,300
I've never loved you at all!

352
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,200
I've wanted you dead since the day you were born!

353
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,240
If there was no you, your mom, and your grandmother,

354
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,680
then I wouldn't have to experience this kind of shit!

355
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,580
So now I'll ruin your life, too.

356
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,900
I hate you!

357
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,720
You can hurt anyone,

358
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,780
but don't hurt my important person.

359
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,400
It can't be Can.

360
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,510
[K'Tin]

361
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,180
Hello.

362
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,980
I want to know your former master's weakness.

363
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,840
We've already made an agreement before, Khun Tin.

364
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,280
Tell me everything that you know about him.

365
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,940
I can't tell you that.

366
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,860
What did I order you before?

367
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,100
When you came to see me last year,

368
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,100
I promised you that I would use my abilities to help you do your work.

369
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,320
I would do everything that you ordered me to.

370
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,860
But that there would be one condition,

371
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,040
and it's that I would never do anything that would cause harm to Khun Tul.

372
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,200
I will never betray Tul.

373
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,060
Even though he chased you out of the house.

374
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,600
Yes.

375
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,880
Khun Tul is not as bad as you think.

376
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,700
Khun Tin, you're the only family of Khun Tul.

377
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,180
Do you think I would believe that?

378
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,580
Khun Tul never chased me out.

379
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,160
I was the one who left of my own accord.

380
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,900
Calm down first. All right, Vadee?

381
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,140
What am I going to do, P'Tul?

382
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,000
What should I do?

383
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,720
I have something to tell you.

384
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm pregnant.

385
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm pregnant, P'Tul.

386
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,000
You finally have the family that you wanted.

387
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,360
Thank you for keeping your promise.

388
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,720
Thank you for not coming to look for me.

389
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,660
I wish you happiness. That's enough for me.

390
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,920
You're my entire world, Khun Tul.

391
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,260
Hello, Can?

392
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,600
Are you awake yet?

393
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm going out right now to pick you up.

394
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm awake now...

395
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,900
So where are we going today?

396
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,480
Where do you want to go?

397
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
I can take you anywhere.

398
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,000
Then let's go to your house. I miss your chef's cooking.

399
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,700
Oh... and I also want to watch a movie marathon, too.

400
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,540
I'm not sure if my brother will be there or not.

401
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,800
It'll be great if he is. I'll fight him.

402
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,580
Acting like you have a chance...

403
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,140
You're underestimating me, Ai'Tin.

404
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,600
Hurry up and come pick me up. I'm too lazy to argue with you over the phone now.

405
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,840
Okay. You should quickly go take a shower then.

406
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,360
When I shower, just three minutes and I'm done. That's all for now, all right?

407
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,300
Khun Tin, the car is ready.

408
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,860
Okay.

409
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,320
Where is he going?

410
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,560
Khun Tin, do you mean Khun Tul?

411
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,480
He's going to Khun Vadee's house. He should be sleeping over there today.

412
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,640
And he also told me that today I don't need to wait for him.

413
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,980
Can!

414
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,140
Hey! On your way back, stop by and buy some things for me, too.

415
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,160
Mom... can I not buy it?

416
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,120
I'll forget, and I don't know what time I'll be coming back.

417
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,080
Mom, why don't you use Ai'Ley to go buy it?

418
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,240
Well, your little sister said that during this period she needs to study for her exams.

419
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,800
I have to study too, Mom.

420
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,640
But I heard that right now you're running off to go on a trip.

421
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,000
Mom, how do you know that? I might just be going out to study.

422
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,340
You don't have any fever!

423
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,540
Mom…

424
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,300
Well, Cantaloupe, Mommy's sweet and lovely son, knows of the word "studying"? Yeah, right.

425
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,600
Every time I see you have exams, you're always sleeping and drowning in your drool on your books.

426
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,380
Mom, you should try to look at your son in a more positive way...

427
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,480
This is called accepting the truth, dear.

428
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,240
Is there any other mom in any other house that doesn't scold their child like me?

429
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,320
Even when my child fails an exam, I can even accept it and still smile.

430
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,760
So, anyway, on your way back, don't forget to stop by and buy me some things.

431
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,780
Here's the list of stuff.

432
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Go ahead now. Tin's already here to pick you up.

433
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,280
How great would it be if I had such a handsome son like you, Tin?

434
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,200
Hello. I bought this for you.

435
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,440
Thank you, son. You're handsome and kind as well!

436
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,040
As for the son in this household, well...

437
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,720
I wanted him to go buy some things and he complains.

438
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,220
Let's go, dude. I have to come back early to buy things for my dearest mother.

439
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,947
Such a long list.

440
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,660
Would it be all right to ask if I could take Can out and have him stay over tonight?

441
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,340
Huh?

442
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,460
As for this shopping list. Don't worry.

443
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,940
I'll ask someone to buy it for you.

444
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,600
How can you do that?

445
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,120
My mom asked me to buy it. I have to be the one to buy it then!

446
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,200
It's okay, son. It's okay. All right.

447
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,500
Tin, if you're the one taking Can, then I'm not worried.

448
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,720
Because I believe that you won't be taking Can out to loiter around somewhere.

449
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,140
You guys can go now, or you won't be able to enjoy your trip in time.

450
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,100
- Goodbye.
- Yes, dear. Goodbye.

451
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,960
Make your face look more proper!

452
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
All right!

453
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,740
It would be great if I had another son who is as incredibly sweet as Tin.

454
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,080
It could be that you've had one for a while already now.

455
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,940
Oh, my Buddha!

456
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,640
You scared me!

457
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
Why are you coming up without a sound?!

458
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,120
Right, Ai'Tin... Lately, my mom's always "Tin this" and "Tin that."

459
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,300
She never gives me anything I ask for.

460
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,400
And how is that bad?

461
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,060
If you say it's good, it's good, dude.

462
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,820
Whenever I ask for something and can't get it, I'll have you ask instead.

463
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,720
And didn't you say that we wouldn't go to your house?

464
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,160
Or is that you... want to do something lewd with me?

465
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,720
Can!

466
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,020
You don't have to sound so uptight with me!

467
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,100
Just looking into your eyes and I can already tell.

468
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,880
It's good, too. Because I also miss...

469
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,440
Ouch! That hurts.

470
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,260
If you already know that, then don't run away back home then.

471
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,300
Someone like me never runs away.

472
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,780
Fine.

473
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,480
Let's go inside.

474
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,340
Who's that, dude?

475
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,220
Let's go inside.

476
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,000
Ai'Tin, who's that?

477
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Isn't that your asshole brother?

478
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,520
Are you Tin's friend?

479
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,540
My name is Tul. I'm Tin's older brother.

480
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Nice to meet you.

481
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,400
What's up?

482
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm glad to finally be able to meet my brother's important person.

483
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,720
You're really such a...

484
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,440
Tin!

485
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,680
Don't mess with my guy.

486
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,220
- Tin, I haven't even…
- Get in the house.

487
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,820
- Tin.
- Get in the house.

488
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,180
Please.

489
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,260
Go. Wait for me inside.

490
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,060
What a pretty naïve kid.

491
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,800
Don't mess with him.

492
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,740
Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.

Is Can home?

495
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,880
He said he was going to kill someone at your house, Tin.

496
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,500
Please excuse me.

497
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,200
Oh, Tin!

498
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,180
Should we go sit and have a bit of a chat?

499
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,900
Tin said that I framed him about using drugs, right?

500
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,500
- This is...
- Where did you get these photos?

501
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,400
I talked to your brother.

502
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,740
Then we have nothing left to talk about.

503
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,440
Ai'Tin!

504
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,060
Ai'Tin! Can you stop being so stupid already?

505
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,780
You believe him, right?

506
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,640
You must hate me then.
