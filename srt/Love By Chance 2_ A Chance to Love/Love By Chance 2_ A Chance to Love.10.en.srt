00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,480
- Hello, Nong'Ae. Can I talk to you?
- What do you want from me?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,440
I want to tell your story through a song.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,880
I just want you to think about it for a bit.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,580
I'm sorry then... for making you disappointed...

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,760
But I also never said that if you were together, I'd be against it.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,740
But I'm at ease now. Because either way, now I won't get killed by my little sister.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,100
It's time for this older brother to meet him.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,460
My name is Tul. I'm Tin's older brother.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm glad to finally get to meet my brother's important person.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,210
You're really such a...

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,380
Don't mess with my guy.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,340
There's dust all over the room now, Can.

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,640
Well, it's because I'm irritated though.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,160
Irritated about what?

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,040
Well, that bast—

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Why are you making that face?

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,360
I don't know what I'm irritated about.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,020
It's that older brother of yours.

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,760
At first, I thought he approached us looking for a fight;

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,820
but in the end, he acted nice towards me.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,460
I was just about to curse at him, but you had me get in the house first.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,380
If you didn't stop me,

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,100
I would've cursed him so bad by now that he wouldn't even be able to find his way home.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
But this is his house...

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,860
I'm so irritated!

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,540
Pretending to be a good person towards me, does he think I'd believe that?

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,423
Because you said he's an awful person, so wouldn't I have to believe you?

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,920
What are you thinking right now?

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,160
Can you promise me something?

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,040
Don't get involved with my brother again.

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,850
Are you scared?

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm scared.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm scared that he'll take it out on you.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,160
I won't let anyone touch you.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,120
I won't let anyone hurt you either.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,940
Come on.

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,100
Can you stop ruining the mood between us for just two minutes already?

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
Of course.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll set the mood for you!

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
Can!

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,480
Don't even. I know you also want to do it.

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,780
It's because I already fell for you.

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,960
Such a smooth talker. I'll give you some service.

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,620
Tin!

[A Chance to Love 2]

70
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,740
Oh! I guessed right, too.

71
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,680
Mom said to behave myself when I go to someone else's house,

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,620
but your son is hungry though...

73
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,860
Where did everyone go?

74
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,780
There were so many people here in the morning.

75
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,040
At night, I don't see a single person.

76
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,220
The worker's rooms are at the back.

77
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,680
By this time, everyone is probably asleep already.

78
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,280
You don't have to be that cautious.

79
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,580
So, where's my little brother?

80
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,780
Already asleep!

81
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,660
So, why did you come downstairs?

82
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,900
Did you need something?

83
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,207
I don't need anything from someone like you!

84
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,120
This damn stomach…

85
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,880
What's so funny?

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,940
Follow me. I'll make you something to eat.

87
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,980
Who says I'm hungry? I'm not hungry damn it!

88
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,100
Spaghetti stir-fried with chili and bacon.

89
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,340
It's a simple dish, but I'm confident that it's delicious.

90
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,160
Give it a try.

91
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,020
Guess you don't believe that I could make it.

92
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,880
That's because Tin has no way of knowing how to cook, right?

93
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,400
But that doesn't mean that the older brother wouldn't like stepping in the kitchen, you know.

94
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm not going to eat it.

95
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,600
You're a funny kid.

96
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,268
Try it, so that it won't go to waste.

97
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,966
I don't want anything to go to waste, all right?

98
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,800
It must be yummy then.

99
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,280
This is Nong Phu's favorite menu.

100
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,099
But he can't eat spicy, so I only put in bacon.

101
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,940
Nong Phu said that he met Tin's friend who said I had a bad personality.

102
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,778
That's you right, Can? What did Tin tell you?

103
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,619
All the bad things, of course!

104
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,320
And you believe him, Can?

105
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,360
I believe him! Whatever Ai'Tin says, I'll believe all of it.

106
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,380
I also don't understand why Tin likes to make up stories.

107
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,780
He thinks that I like to hurt him and other people.

108
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,292
As you can see, I love my little brother to death.

109
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,500
I really don't understand... just what Tin is thinking.

110
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,520
You can't insult Ai'Tin!

111
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,860
I won't believe anyone! I'll believe only Ai'Tin!

112
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,020
Remember that.

113
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,660
What a waste.

114
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,500
He acts just like Nong Phu.

115
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,799
Ai'Champ... Ai'Champ... Why don't you just say that I got my ass tapped by a kid...

116
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,568
P'No!

117
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,200
Speak of the devil and the devil appears…

118
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Who'd stick around...

119
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,140
P'No, are you all right?!

120
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Stop!

121
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,660
Don't say anything.

122
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,320
But...

123
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,440
I said not to say anything!

124
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,046
If you talk again,

125
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,760
I won't talk to you anymore.

126
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm embarrassed.

127
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
You don't need to help me.

128
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,460
Even though you're mad at me, you're still cute.

129
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,120
Come on, Ai'Tin.

130
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm just here to buy something for the team with Ai'Ae, that's all!

131
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,540
And another thing... exams are finally over! I also want to walk around the mall for a bit.

132
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm not angry that you're buying stuff for the team.

133
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,222
Oh...

134
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,440
Then that means that you're angry that I'm here to buy things with Ai'Ae?

135
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,040
Ai'Tin… it's Ai'Ae.

136
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,560
Geez, Khun Chai.

137
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,260
Khun Chai, you already know who Ai'Ae loves and who he's infatuated with.

138
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,220
But I guess I can't really say anything, because you also love me and you're infatuated with me, too.

139
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,920
Sorry, that I'm a bit too charming.

140
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,220
You being worried isn't that strange.

141
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,756
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

142
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh! I have to go buy stuff now! That's all for now, all right?

143
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,100
There's still another hour… What to do, Ai'Can?

144
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,180
Let's find something to eat instead.

145
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,120
I'll fight you...

146
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
What a coincidence.

147
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,540
What a coincidence, my ass!

148
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,849
Your house is in the opposite direction of the mall! How'd you pop up here?!

149
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,520
Fine, fine.

150
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,220
I came here looking for you, Can.

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
Looking for me, for what?

152
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,180
If you want to know, should we go sit and have a bit of a chat?

153
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
What are you looking at?

154
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,800
You act just like a child.

155
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
I never thought that Tin would like someone like this.

156
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,519
So what if I'm like this?

157
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,620
Nothing. I didn't mean anything bad.

158
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,880
I just thought it was strange that Tin is dating someone so bright and naïve.

159
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,720
Because in the past, he wasn't like this.

160
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,500
Are you...

161
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,040
trying to make me suspicious of Ai'Tin?

162
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,460
Keep dreaming.

163
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,200
The past is the past.

164
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm the present.

165
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,980
I'm not here to do that.

166
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,240
I just came to correct a misunderstanding is all.

167
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,380
To correct a misunderstanding? Correct what misunderstanding?

168
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,380
Tin said I framed him for the thing about taking drugs, right?

169
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,820
It's not accusing or anything. He said the truth.

170
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
This is...

171
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
What is it?

172
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,900
Tin never told you? That he did drugs before.

173
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,840
Ai'Ae,

174
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,360
I can't meet up with you today anymore.

175
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,860
Sorry, all right?

176
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,840
What you said...

177
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,680
What does that mean?

178
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,740
Please allow me to place your order.

179
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,480
Thank you.

180
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,740
So, dude? Why did Ai'Can call?

181
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,540
So nosey!

182
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,760
Fine.

183
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,700
Go ahead and insult me. Insult me as much as you want.

184
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,300
Just a word and I'm nosey. Even two words and I'm nosey.

185
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,360
If you weren't nosey, then why the fuck did you follow me for?

186
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,660
Please continue talking. I'm free now.

187
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,760
This is Ae, the engineering kid that I told you about before.

188
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,640
As for this side... This is my friend, Tum.

189
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,918
He's the one I told you about before who's wants inspiration for writing a song.

190
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:42,320
That's why the two of us are interested in you, Ae.

191
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,171
Isn't it just you, Ai'Keen?

192
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,620
Try talking to him first.

193
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,860
Maybe you'll get inspiration for multiple songs.

194
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,140
Not just one song, dude!

195
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,280
Ai'Keen said that your story is pretty interesting.

196
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,420
Actually, if you're not interested in my friend,

197
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,440
then you don't have to talk to him.

198
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,440
You look like you don't totally want to be here.

199
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,160
Shit, Ai'Pond...

200
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,260
It's the truth though, dude...

201
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,380
Then let me ask you something.

202
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,180
How interesting do you think your story is?

203
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,960
I don't know.

204
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,854
I just know that...

205
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,960
I'll do everything so I can tell him that I love him.

206
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,087
And that I'll always be waiting for him.

207
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,300
And what did he say?

208
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,440
Have you ever loved someone so much,

209
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
but there's something that makes it so you can't be together?

210
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
Of course, I have.

211
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,840
See? I told you that it'd be worth listening to Ae's story.

212
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,780
That's right. I think this was already worth skipping practice to come here.

213
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,600
Right, Ai'Ae...

214
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,780
Don't say it.

215
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,560
I don't want to hear it.

216
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,580
You shitty friend! You keep telling me not to do things, dude!

217
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,704
If you stop prying into people's business, maybe your life would be better.

218
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,700
It's not like I can help it!

219
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,983
Like that pair just now! I say something smells fishy!

220
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:47,580
I'm sure of it, dude! You can trust me!

221
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,320
P'Keen must secretly like P'Tum. And P'Tum must still like someone else!

222
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm sure of it!

223
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,620
Oh, right dude! Should I ask P'Type about this?

224
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,280
In case I might get some more information.

225
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,198
Ow...

226
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:03,560
Stop whatever you're thinking.

227
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,820
It's their business. It's not any of your business, is it?

228
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,160
Are you going to hit my head till one day my brain explodes or something?

229
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,660
Fine. Fine. Fine. I won't pry into their business then.

230
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Instead, I'll wait to hear how your song will turn out.

231
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,840
It's not my song.

232
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,860
Then it should be called the song that got inspiration from the love story of you and Ai'Pe…

233
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,300
Shit. I shouldn't have said anything. What should I do?

234
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,620
Oh right, dude! So where's Ai'Can?

235
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm sure that he woke up late!

236
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
He sent me a message saying that he had important business. He's lying.

237
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,940
Why are you sighing at me this time?

238
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,020
Ai'Ae! Wait for me first!

239
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,580
If you ditch me, there's no one to help carry the stuff!

240
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,120
Ae!

241
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,900
What is it?

242
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,439
I saw that yesterday you posted an update on Facebook that it rained and you got wet.

243
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,020
So what about it?

244
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,900
You should start looking after yourself sometimes.

245
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,560
Here, eat this.

246
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,340
I bought it for you.

247
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,873
You got soaked from the rain so you need to eat a lot of vitamins. So that you won't get a cold.

248
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,220
So, why didn't you tell me you arrived once you got here?

249
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,180
That way I would've come out right away.

250
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,980
What are you looking at?

251
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,820
Your eyes are small already.

252
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,200
And you're still trying to squint.

253
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,670
AiTin, let me ask you something.

254
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,680
About?

255
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,240
Have you ever taken drugs before?

256
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,400
Why are you asking something like that?

257
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,367
Take a look then.

258
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,801
Where did you get this picture?

259
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,080
Well, your older brother sent it to me.

260
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,580
You talked to him?

261
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,980
Yeah... I talked to your older brother.

262
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,140
Okay.

263
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Then we have nothing left to talk about.

264
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,630
In the end, you still believed him.

265
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,300
Ai'Tin! Wait a minute! Damn it!

266
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,780
Ai'Tin!

267
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,400
Ai'Tin…

268
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,360
Ai'Tin, listen to me first!

269
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,120
You're thinking that, too. Right?

270
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,016
You must hate me already then.

271
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,180
Can you stop being stupid already? Stop being stupid and listen to me first.

272
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,940
How could you think that I'd believe that bastard more than you?

273
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,260
If I believed him, why would I bother asking you?

274
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,820
Let me seriously ask you... Do you believe that I'd believe your older brother over you?

275
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,667
How many times do I have to say that you're the only one I believe!

276
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,780
Even if I'm stupid and you deceive me, I'll believe only you.

277
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,600
Stop thinking and assuming things on your own already. You're being foolish.

278
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,060
Ai'Tin! Just answer me!

279
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,960
Just tell me what's wrong. I'm your boyfriend, you know!

280
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,140
Didn't you tell me before that I'm stupid?

281
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,020
Then enlighten me.

282
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,360
Just tell me directly already!

283
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,900
Why are you quiet?

284
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,920
Answer me already, damn it!

285
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,860
I'm sorry.

286
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm just scared.

287
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,960
I thought that you'd believe my older brother

288
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,540
and hate me like how everyone else hates me.

289
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,220
I'm sorry, Can.

290
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,960
Well, you're my boyfriend.

291
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,820
♫ Let love and our hearts guide us ♫

292
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,460
How can I believe anyone more than you?

293
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,480
♫ You​ will never ever have to feel sad ♫

294
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,080
♫ We will always be together ♫

295
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,180
♫ This time, let me take care of you forever ♫

296
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,820
♫ Our love will last until the end of time ♫

297
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,140
At first, I thought that you believed him.

298
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,160
Ai'Tin... I'll knock your head off!

299
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,980
What are you saying?

300
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,180
Everyone who talks to my older brother ends up believing him.

301
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,460
And they all abandon me.

302
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,620
Did I ever say I believed him?

303
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,780
I just wanted to know what that clip is.

304
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,460
I wasn't going to show you that clip and start crying like a drama queen.

305
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,920
I just wanted you to explain it, Ai'Tin.

306
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,820
After that incident, I acted foolishly.

307
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,240
But I didn't do drugs though.

308
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,760
Yes, I could sleep with anyone,

309
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,340
but I am not like what my older brother told you.

310
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,640
That's all I needed to hear.

311
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,680
See? As soon as you explained it to me,

312
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,740
I understood immediately.

313
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,020
I'm really sorry.

314
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,420
Why are you saying sorry?

315
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,920
The one who should apologize isn't you. It should be that older brother of yours!

316
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,260
What kind of crazy person is he... doing such a thing to his younger brother?

317
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,800
Just talking about it makes me damn furious.

318
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,480
Why are you staring at me?

319
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,695
I love you.

320
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,200
Please don't leave me and go anywhere.

321
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,540
Can.

322
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,040
Tin! Why are you pulling my hand away?

323
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,500
Can't you see I'm embarrassed right now?

324
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah, I won't leave you and go anywhere.

325
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,660
I'll stay like this.

326
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm so embarrassed to the point that I really have to poop now.

327
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,140
Can.

328
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Ai'Tin! In the middle of the university?!

329
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,640
Stop it!

330
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,980
I'll end up shitting!

331
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,380
That's enough.

332
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,560
You've thought about it carefully already, right?

333
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,720
Yes. I've made a careful decision already.

334
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Even if in the end,

335
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,400
you won't have anyone left?

336
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,020
Yes. Even if I won't have anyone left.

337
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,940
If you've made a decision already, that's fine.

338
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,360
Thank you.

339
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,220
Tul.

340
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,680
Nevermind, nothing.

341
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,220
You can go.

342
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,460
Gonhin, I'm sorry...

343
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,140
That this old man wasn't able to help anyone at all.

344
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,870
[Cantaloupe]

345
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,420
So what are you doing in Bangna anyway?

346
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,440
An event with stupid people.

347
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
I couldn't not come.

348
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,120
Everybody already probably thinks that the Medthanan family has only one son.

349
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,580
Just say that you're there to show face then.

350
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,220
You should go then. I'll sleep and keep missing you then.

351
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,360
If I just tell him I miss him,

352
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,560
he'll hurry to come see me tonight.

353
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,840
I should keep sleeping until I'm fully rested then.

354
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,220
Ai'Tin…

355
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,060
What?!

356
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,920
Calm down, Can...

357
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,800
Ai'Can… Calm down…

358
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,800
GEEZ! I can't stay calm anymore!

359
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,580
Where are you going, Can?

360
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,500
I'm going to go kill someone at Ai'Tin's house! I'm not coming back tonight!

361
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,820
And if I go to jail, bail me out, too!

362
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,140
What's this son of my mine gone crazy about this time?

363
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,260
Did you bite your big brother? He's gone completely crazy...

364
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,150
Coming! Coming!

365
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,180
- Tin!
- Hello.

366
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,020
Hello, dear. Did you make plans with Can, son?

367
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,580
Oh, no. I just happened to pass by the area so I stopped by to bring some snacks.

368
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,025
Oh my! You're always so sweet, Tin!

369
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,680
But next time you don't have to. I feel bad.

370
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,340
Okay.

371
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,260
But... is Can home?

372
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,140
Oh right! Since you mentioned it, I just remembered.

373
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,680
Can left already left about an hour ago.

374
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,380
He said he was going to go to your house.

375
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,760
You didn't see him? I guess you must have missed each other.

376
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,100
Wait... What did he say again...? Oh!

377
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,760
He said he was going to kill someone at your house, Tin.

378
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,260
My son seems sillier by the day, right?

379
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,020
He has such a sweet friend like you, Tin. Why would he kill you?

380
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Please excuse me.

381
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,100
O-Oh, Tin.

382
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,048
You're going back already, son?

383
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,680
What's with everyone today?

384
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Please put on your jacket.

385
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,240
Tonight, I'll be coming home a bit late.

386
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,900
Auntie, you can sleep first. I'll lock up the house when I come home.

387
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,600
It's okay, I can wait for you.

388
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,340
Ai'Tul!

389
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,760
Can, Tin's not here today.

390
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,980
- Khun Tul!
- You're a piece of shit, you hear me?! Why the fuck did you do this?!

391
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,955
You are such a fucker, do you know that?

392
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:28,800
Let go of me!

393
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,940
You think I'll believe it? In what you did?

394
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,740
What did I do?

395
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,420
Everything you did! Don't mess with Ai'Tin! You bastard!

396
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,180
Please! That's enough, Khun Can!

397
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,840
- Let go!
-That's enough! Please! I'm begging you!

398
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,660
What's going on?!

399
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,020
Who can tell me what's going on?

400
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,340
Where's Can?

401
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,640
Khun Can punched Khun Tul's face.

402
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,980
Did you think it'll just end here?

403
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,360
No matter how this ends,

404
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,640
I won't let you even touch Can.

405
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,340
Look after your guy carefully.

406
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:28,720
Having the kind of happiness that my older brother could never have, that is the best revenge.

407
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,700
Khun Tin!

408
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,040
You decided carefully already, right? To do something like this?

409
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,300
Yes.

410
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,940
♫ I never understand the meaning of love ♫

411
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,000
♫ What is it? ♫
