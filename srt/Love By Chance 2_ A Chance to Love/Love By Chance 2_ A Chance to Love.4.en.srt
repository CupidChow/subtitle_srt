1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,380
Ae.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,300
What did you say friends are for?

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,700
Huh?

4
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:07,700
You like to help other people so much, right?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,120
But could you turn around and care about us for once?

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,060
We are very worried about you.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,780
Where's the guy named Ae?

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,500
You're Ae's friend?

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,140
Not at all.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,157
Hey!

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,757
Hey! Are you here looking to pick a fight with Ai'Ae?

12
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,713
If you're here to pick a fight, then I can punch you in the mouth first!

13
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,480
You guys are probably all pathetic.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Why? Someone with a face like mine can't have a girlfriend?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,020
And you, you should go back where you came from.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,160
Brother Can!

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,843
Where did you disappear to? I called but you wouldn't pick up.

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,970
Oh my!

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,560
Hello.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,480
You are Brother Can's friend?

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm Ley.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm Brother Can's younger sister.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
Younger sister?

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,980
Not a girlfriend?

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,680
No!

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,980
I'm not!

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,680
His younger sister.

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,080
A face like Brother Can's? There's no way he'd have a girlfriend.

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,440
Give it back already.

[Love by Chance Season 2]
[Episode 4]

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,240
Ley,

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,380
let's go back home already.

53
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,140
Just stay still.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Ley!

55
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,200
Be quiet!

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,260
Thank you, P'Tin, for inviting us to eat.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,460
It's not a problem.

58
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,800
I just happened to be free as well.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,060
Wait. Didn't you say you had errands?

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,460
There are still several hours before my appointment.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Nong Ley, right?

62
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,180
Go ahead and order anything you like.

63
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,760
You're treating us?

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,060
Please help yourself.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
Are you deceiving my little sister?

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,520
Then I won't hold myself back.

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,580
Go ahead.

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,980
Miss?

69
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,720
Thank you.

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh! Nong Ley.

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,820
Why do you call Can...

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,520
Cantaloupe?

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,460
Well...

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,680
Brother Can's name comes from...

75
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,760
Ouch!

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,580
Please don't mind him, P'Tin.

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,640
Brother Can is always kind of crazy like this.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,580
Well, Brother Can's name comes from "Cantaloupe."

79
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,300
As for my name Ley, it's "Lemon."

80
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,840
Because when our mom was pregnant, she wanted to eat it.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,420
That's nice.

82
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:22,774
How is that nice?

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,840
The name is too cute.

84
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:29,887
Not all mothers care enough to think of their children's names.

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,300
I want to go home so bad.

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,340
Ley won't stop talking about me.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,620
This dude, too.

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,340
Speak of the devil.

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,000
Why are you following me around?

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,500
I didn't follow you.

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I just came to the bathroom is all.

92
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,400
Go in then. If you want to go to the bathroom, then just go in.

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,420
Go!

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Your face looks like you have something to ask.

95
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,320
Is my face really that obvious?

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,560
I just want to ask you a few questions.

97
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,860
Ask then.

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,200
Well...

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,820
About what you said...

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,100
Not all mothers care enough to think of their children's names.

101
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,380
What do you mean?

102
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,880
My name is Tin.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,440
I know your name is Tin.

104
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,660
Tin something Nanan or whatever.

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,180
But...

106
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,880
I just want to know why?

107
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,420
My older brother's name is Tul.

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,600
Tin and Tul.

109
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,900
Your names really suit you. They're cooler than my family's.

110
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,440
The reason that my mom named me Tin,

111
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,720
is just because she wanted it to match with my older brother's.

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,280
She wants me to be good

113
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,820
and talented,

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,420
and to be like that older brother of mine.

115
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,620
But the truth is I'm just a child that she doesn't want.

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,820
I'm just Tin,

117
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,060
who will always be under my older brother's shadow.

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Tin...

119
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,600
I didn't know what you've been through so much in your life.

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,080
I just saw that you were making a strange face.

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,840
You believe me?

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,260
What do you mean?

124
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,120
Just a little bit of acting and you believed it so easily?

125
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,400
You're incredibly stupid.

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,140
You asshole, Tin!

127
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,360
I was even worried about you. You're such an asshole.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,440
Thanks.

129
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,080
Thanks for what kind of shit now?

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,820
For worrying.

131
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,520
Who's worried about you?

132
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,160
They'd be crazy to be worried.

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,640
If I were to tell you the truth,

134
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,380
would you believe me?

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,060
I have to pee. I'm going to go pee first, all right?

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,400
P'Tin.

137
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,920
P'Tin, you're friends with Brother Can, right?

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,121
Yes.

139
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,400
Then, can I leave P'Can in your care?

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,260
He is pretty foolish and naive.

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,000
So he's often getting tricked by people.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Is it that often?

143
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Very often.

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,100
P'Tin, just think about it. When he was a kid,

145
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,500
he was tricked into believing that if he flipped open a girl's skirt,

146
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,040
the teacher would give him extra points.

147
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,460
And that Brother Can believed it!

148
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,060
So he flipped open my skirt!

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,440
I was crying so hard back then.

150
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
That's not all either!

151
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,680
He was once tricked into climbing up and hitting an ant's nest!

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,060
He was tricked into believing someone was abusing their dog, so he climbed over into their house!

153
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,800
He almost died you know!

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,820
A Thai Bangkaew dog attacking a ten-year-old kid.
(T/N: Bangkaew are known to be territorial and protective)

155
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,020
Just thinking about it wears me out.

156
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,300
So what did Can do?

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,820
What could he do?

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
No matter how many times he gets hurt, or how many times he cries,

159
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,040
he's always views the world optimistically.

160
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,960
He never gets angry or insults people seriously.

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,080
He's the type to truly believe in his friends with all his heart.

162
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,960
Why are you telling me all this?

163
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Well, it's because you're smart, P'Tin!

164
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,920
So I'd like you to teach Brother Can sometimes.

165
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,760
Thank you for telling me this.

166
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,900
Can I trust you?

167
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,980
Are you there already, Ai'Type?

168
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah. Wait for me just a second. I'm about to head out already.

169
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,780
Come on. Just a second. I'm about to head out already.

170
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,940
Yeah, yeah. yeah.

171
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,320
How the heck did you get here?

172
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,080
Geez!

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,440
Ai'Keng has been waiting for you for two hours already.

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,460
P'No,

175
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,960
I'd like to talk to you about...

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
that night, is that all right...

177
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Don't say any more! Otherwise, Nic will hear all about it!

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,500
Geez...

179
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,560
P'No.

180
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Actually,

181
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,480
I know everything already.

182
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,948
Huh?

183
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,640
Really.

184
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,100
But let's just say... That regarding this matter, I won't interfere. All right?

185
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,640
Have a nice chat.

186
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
P'No.

187
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,680
What do I have to do

188
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
for you to stop being mad at me?

189
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
No...

190
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not mad at you.

191
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,520
Then, why are you avoiding me?

192
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm not avoiding you.

193
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,880
P'No,

194
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm ready to do everything just for you to stop being mad at me.

195
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,100
I really do like you.

196
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,080
Let's talk about that matter later...

197
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,920
I already said that I had plans with Ai'Type.

198
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,340
I have to go now, all right?

199
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,420
P'No!

200
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,840
My older brother, really...

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,980
He's soooo good at running away.

202
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,920
He ran away again.

203
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,140
But I'm probably the one who really messed up.

204
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey,

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
it's everyone's fault.

206
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,380
Even myself. I sold my brother in exchange for stuff.

207
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,820
Shit!

208
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,680
Why is Ai'Kla so handsome?

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,360
My damn heart, calm down. I'll end up having a heart attack.

210
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,660
Give me a bit more time, Ai'Kla.

211
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,040
Since I was born, I never thought about having a boyfriend before.

212
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,300
Shorty, wake up already!

213
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,500
What the hell is with you?

214
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,540
It's not the time to be sleeping, dude!

215
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,280
It's so late already that the sun is about to lick your ass.

216
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,160
Don't you usually wake up at 5:00 a.m.?

217
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,860
Get up!

218
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
Shit!

219
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,380
I don't know anything.

220
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,780
I didn't see anything.

221
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,560
Are... my two friends... getting together for real?

222
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Shorty,

223
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,820
are you that depressed that you've gone crazy?

224
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,640
I understand if you want to have a boyfriend,

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,400
but I cannot accept the fact that...

226
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,420
you'd make Ai'Mai your wife.

227
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,460
What is this?!

228
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,680
Ai'Pond!

229
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,260
What? I'm about to leave already!

230
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Are you fucking crazy? Ai'Pond, you asshole.

231
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,840
Yeah!

232
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,240
I get it.

233
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,160
You have a new buddy now.

234
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,740
So you've already forgotten about your old friend. Okay.

235
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,700
Damn you.

236
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,740
Where are you dragging me to?

237
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,920
Just come.

238
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,760
I guarantee that the thing I'm bringing you to, is definitely suitable for you, Ai'Ae.

239
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,560
Can you stop that scowl on your face that's like a pitbull's ass or something?

240
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,640
Here. We're here.

241
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,500
You should join this.

242
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,180
What the heck is it?

243
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,680
A volunteering camp?

244
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,140
Yeah.

245
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,620
Instead of feeling sad,

246
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
you should do something more useful.

247
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,560
Take that time thinking about your boyfriend

248
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,760
to do something that you're good at instead, Ai'Ae.

249
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,400
Just register already. Go.

250
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,540
It's better than overthinking.

251
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,160
Ai'Mai is amazing.

252
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,440
He studies but doesn't even study here.

253
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,060
Yet, he still knew that they were taking applicants.

254
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,160
But it really is very you.

255
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,640
Didn't you complain to me before? That if you had the chance, you'd like to volunteer?

256
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,560
Ai'Ae.

257
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,000
Ai'Ae!

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
Are you even listening to me?

259
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,940
Can you take a picture for me?

260
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,340
Huh?

261
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,560
Since when do you like to take pictures?

262
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,925
Just take it.

263
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,745
Come on.

264
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,280
1, 2...

265
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,280
Dude, you're not going to smile, joke around, or pose a bit at all?

266
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,700
This is good enough.

267
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,960
Can you tell your buddy, Pond, just what's on your mind?

268
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,454
You said I don't like to update about my life.

269
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,380
So I wanted to try doing it, too.

270
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,100
At least it's better than doing nothing.

271
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,860
Ai'Ae.

272
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm okay. Thanks a lot.

273
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
Is that really...

274
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,340
someone who says he's all right?

275
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,440
Thank you P'Tin for dropping us off.

276
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,820
Brother Can and I didn't even have to carry heavy stuff on the bus.

277
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,040
It's only me. You never helped with anything.

278
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,200
Ai'Ley! I'm your big brother you know!

279
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,480
What are you laughing at, dude?

280
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,840
Either way, thank you very much.

281
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,460
What about you?

282
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,100
What?

283
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,580
Did you forget something?

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,860
Forget what?

285
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,820
I came out of the house with just a phone and a wallet.

286
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,640
It's probably Ley over there who forgot something.

287
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,260
What P'Tin means is did you forget to thank him?

288
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,220
Brother Can, if you're going to be like this, I'm going to tell Mom.

289
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,340
Ley,

290
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,360
I'm your big brother.

291
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,800
What's so funny?

292
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,380
I'll give this to you.

293
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,040
Thank you.

294
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,260
Ley, our household doesn't accept things from strangers though.

295
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,180
And Mom has said that our household can't be bought with money.

296
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,940
How is he a stranger? This is your friend, P'Can.

297
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,980
This thing came from your friend, Brother Can. So that means that I can accept it.

298
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,560
Then I'll head inside the house first.

299
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:37,274
Okay.

300
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,420
What is it now?

301
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,380
Did you forget something?

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
You really want words of thanks from me that much?

303
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,840
Okay. "Thank you so much."

304
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,620
Are you satisfied now?

305
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,980
I want to receive your words of thanks

306
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,800
this way instead.

307
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,280
You're so much cuter than those girls.

308
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,420
Ai'Tin kissed me again!

309
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,960
So why...

310
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,280
do I feel this way?

311
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,456
It's like... dragonflies are flying around in my stomach.

312
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
I get it now. This is how you solve it.

313
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,880
Dude, what's with you?

314
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,320
He's stressed right now.

315
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,887
If you're stressed then eat this. It's tasty. Eat it and you won't be stressed.

316
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,900
Don't just play around. You're not helping me to do the work at all.

317
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,860
Give it here. If you're not going to eat it, I'll eat it myself.

318
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,280
Come on, dude.

319
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,160
It's mine.

320
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,280
Seeing you enjoy eating helps me feel a bit less stressed.

321
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,360
So, what are you stressed about then?

322
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,500
It's because of Ai'Ae, of course.

323
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,100
Come on now. Just give him some time.

324
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,380
It's like he doesn't have anyone left, dude.

325
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,020
Then there's no need for you to feel sorry.

326
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,640
What?

327
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,780
Because he still has us, of course!

328
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,160
All right! Let's continue working quickly! Let's finish our work. Ae's part, too.

329
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,511
When we're finished, you can go look after him.

330
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,120
Oh, yeah...

331
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,580
What do you guys have to do?

332
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,300
Pick it up.

333
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,620
Pick it.

334
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,670
Bring it in.

335
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,595
- What are we doing?
- Cheers!

336
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,313
Cheers!

337
00:23:04,313 --> 00:23:05,720
Fight for Ae!

338
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,185
Fight, fight for Ae.

339
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,480
Do this, too.

340
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,720
- Ai'Keen.
- What's up, friend.

341
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,600
When did you get here?

342
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,308
Me? I came here a while ago already.

343
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,520
Are you all right?

344
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,040
Hey, it's nothing. I should be asking you.

345
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,000
Lately, doesn't it seem like you have something on your mind?

346
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
Are you overthinking the thing with Tar?

347
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,360
No. Tar is doing fine.

348
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,700
He called me yesterday about his friends and studies.

349
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,760
There's nothing to worry about.

350
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
But... I just feel like...

351
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,460
Lately, it's like I've been lacking inspiration.

352
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,580
About writing your songs?

353
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,200
Yeah.

354
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,431
I want to write a love song. But I feel that...

355
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:48,480
No matter how much I think of it, I can't think of anything.

356
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,860
I don't really know how to write songs, but I have an idea.

357
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,560
Someone once told me that

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,500
if you want to write a love song,

359
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,180
you must know how to love first.

360
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,400
Who would love someone like me?

361
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,840
How can you know if you haven't looked around?

362
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,580
What do you mean?

363
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,240
Forget it. Forget about it, dude.

364
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,940
Let's go, let's go. Let's practice.

365
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,980
- Sure, sure.
- Yesterday, did you figure out how to play it yet?

366
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,000
I did. For this, I added a solo part to the intro.

367
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,040
You finally came back?

368
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,920
It's late you know.

369
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,600
Next time, come back earlier.

370
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,040
Dad and mom will be worried.

371
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,420
You're just a student.

372
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Are you done talking?

373
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,607
Are you in a rebellious phase, Tin?

374
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,140
Lately, it seems like your big brother can't say anything at all?

375
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Because I don't need to listen to what you're saying.

376
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,180
Even though, before, everything was always "P'Tul"?

377
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,420
I told you already, didn't I? To stop being two-faced already.

378
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
You can be the amazingly good son,

379
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,420
a perfect husband,

380
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,260
or a sweet father, then be it.

381
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,680
But don't be my big brother.

382
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,900
He died already.

383
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm still sitting right here.

384
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
He died already!

385
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,360
He died many years ago, along with my stupidity.

386
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,040
Even though I've gotten smarter now,

387
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,540
why won't you finally take off your mask already?

388
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,580
You probably can't, right?

389
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,060
Because if everyone else knew what the real Tul was like,

390
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,000
no one would be able to stand you.

391
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,240
I'll excuse myself.

392
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,740
This little brother says pretty hurtful things, too.

393
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,420
You can't stand me either, right?

394
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,060
Gonhin (stone/rock).

395
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,540
P'Hin, where's P'Tul?

396
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,160
Oh, he went to talk with the professor.

397
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,060
Then we'll wait for him here then. Seeing P'Tul's face today will give us a bit more encouragement. Right?

398
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,640
Just seeing his face and my exhaustion is gone. What kind of person is that handsome?

399
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,700
Right! Did you hear about P'Tul already having a girlfriend yet?

400
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,400
Is she that one? The one that waited for him the other day?

401
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,360
She might be pretty, but I don't want to accept it. If P'Tul has a girlfriend, then there won't be any eye candy.

402
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,100
P'Hin (stone), does P'Tul really already have a girlfriend?

403
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,560
Well... I...

404
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,380
Ladies.

405
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,680
What are you doing in the common room?

406
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,520
We came to play.

407
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,280
I thought you guys came to see me.

408
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,400
Geez, P'Tul.

409
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,920
You already know that we've been waiting for you, of course.

410
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,683
If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known.

411
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,238
I almost got sad you know.

412
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,460
Hin, are you free?

413
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,640
I happen to want to talk to you about what I heard from the professor.

414
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,200
Will you excuse me for a moment? You can sit and relax for now.

415
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,040
I'll be right back.

416
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,480
Come.

417
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,780
Ai'Hin, look up and look into my eyes.

418
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,920
Look up already!

419
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,520
Who made you cry?

420
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,780
There isn't anyone.

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
You know that I don't like it, right?

422
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,040
I don't like it when someone else makes you waste your tears.

423
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,540
You can only cry because of me only.

424
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,360
Do you understand?

425
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,560
Yes.

426
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,100
I cry because of you, Tul.

427
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,080
Good.

428
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,300
You better remember that you're mine.

429
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Whenever I gave it to you, you acted like you didn't want it.

430
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,700
Now you're dragging your little sister out to buy it so late at night.

431
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,440
Isn't it because of you? You took and drank all of mine until it was gone!

432
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,540
It's only right that you come with me to buy it.

433
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,160
YOU are the one that drank all of it.

434
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,140
What is this?

435
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,480
So, what did you do that made you so hungry that you couldn't stand it?

436
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,880
Well, my heart was beating too fast... because of Ai'Tin...

437
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,820
Huh? What was that?!

438
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,140
Well, I was going to say that...

439
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,980
you eat too much, but you also talk a lot. Right?

440
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,840
That's why you never seem to get fat.

441
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,740
Don't get it twisted. Rather, it's because I stopped eating.

442
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,100
You should drink Jele. It's the best.
(T/N: Jele = Jelly drink high in nutrients and low in calories; Supposedly good for dieting)

443
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,420
It's easy to drink and not fattening either.

444
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,160
This one. It'll help your body grow, too.

445
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,780
Bro, you should try to drink a lot.

446
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,540
That way you'll grow (mature) quickly.

447
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,420
It really is yummy...

448
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,360
Ai'Ley! Where did you go?

449
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,580
Ley!

450
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm going home!

451
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,940
Oh yeah... I'm supposed to quickly go back home...

452
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,680
I'm late again!

453
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,860
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?

454
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,620
Geez, P'Win!
(T/N: P'Win is used to refer to motorcycle taxi drivers)

455
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,680
How did you get here?

456
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,440
When will you stop greeting me with that sentence?

457
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,480
Thank you for dropping me off.

458
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,935
You can go back now. SHOO!

459
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,800
Why haven't you gone back yet?

460
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,360
I told you. I don't just want the words "thank you."

461
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I'm on to you.

462
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,580
This time, you won't get to... kiss me.

463
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,600
You're going to tease me.

464
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm not teasing.

465
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,180
You're teasing.

466
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,220
You're going to tease me by kissing me to make me lose my mind.

467
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,860
I'm not going to fall for it a second time.

468
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm not teasing.

469
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,780
Then... what is it that you want?

470
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,300
To hit on you.

471
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,820
I have never hit on anyone like you.

472
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,020
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

473
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,140
But I will hit on you.

474
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,660
You... are going to... hit on... me...?

475
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
Tin is going to hit on me...

476
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,540
Tin is going to hit on me...

477
