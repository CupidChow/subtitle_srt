Hey!

00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:05,100
P'No!

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,811
That's right. He's not with you anymore.

4
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:11,561
And if he were to see you in this state, do you think that he'd be happy?

5
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,125
Fine, I can admit that I'm stupid.

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:17,170
What about you? Do you admit that your parents didn't teach you well? Letting their son treat others badly like this?

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,918
I told you already to stop acting. I want to puke.

[Love by Chance 2: Episode 2]

50
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,060
That's good, everyone! Just like that.

51
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,920
That's good you guys! Just like that. Keep running.

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,760
Just like that. If you guys practice seriously like this, this year's university championship is ours for sure!

53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,700
Hey! Over there! Don't be so lazy.

54
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,660
Hey! Why did you stop practicing?

55
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,740
What are you guys laughing at?

56
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,040
- No!
- Huh?
- Behind you.

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
Behind?

58
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,680
P'No, are you thirsty?

59
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
I can bring some water for you.

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Little Monkey...

61
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,220
Let me kick you just once!

62
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Don't run!

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Come on, P'No.

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,480
Wait until I catch you, Little Monkey!

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh! Our captain runs so slowly...

66
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,970
Why are you running like that?

67
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
P'No, I'm tired already.

68
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,360
I've been running and kicking back and forth so many times already. It's raining, too!

69
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,440
Don't even complain, Ai'Can.

70
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,700
If you want to be an actual player, then you have to practice.

71
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,620
Are you sure that you're not taking revenge on me?

72
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,240
But you probably wouldn't do that.

73
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,540
The captain that's respected and beloved by all his juniors.

74
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,040
No...

75
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
I just...

76
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm just training you. Isn't that good? I'm even training one-on-one.

77
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
I'm tired though.

78
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,420
So where did Ae go?

79
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,720
He hasn't come to practice for several days already.

80
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,800
I have no clue.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,900
Pond told me that he's in an extremely bad state.

82
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,160
So why don't you go and talk to him? Aren't you close to him?

83
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Who would dare to? He's freaking scary.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,540
Even Pond can't maintain eye contact with him.

85
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,360
- P'No...
- Hm?

86
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,440
Does being in love make you sad?

87
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,560
Why are you asking me about that?

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,780
Just look at Ai'Ae.

89
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Once he broke up with Pete, from being someone who never drank alcohol, who didn't smoke, and wouldn't even touch caffeine...

90
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Now, he does it all.

91
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,740
Back then he took care of himself so well.

92
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,420
I don't know. I won't ever be in a relationship for sure.

93
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,620
P'No, do you need to poop?

94
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,860
Huh?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,740
No, it's nothing.

96
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm going to... go put the stuff away first, okay?

97
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,860
P'No! Didn't you say you'd treat me to some food?

98
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Nope. Nope. Nope.

99
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,460
I'm hungry.

100
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,720
Hungry!

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,480
I want to eat!

102
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,340
I'm hungry!

103
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,220
I don't have any more energy!

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,050
Right now, I still don't want to talk to you, Kla.

105
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,100
How can I tell you that on that day...

106
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,380
It felt so good

107
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,880
Why do I feel this way?

108
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,460
P'No! P'No!

109
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,560
You said that after we finished practice you'd treat me to a meal.

110
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,340
I don't even know where the hell you disappeared to...

111
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,140
I'm hungry, so hungry. I don't even have any energy left.

112
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,100
Am I going to die?

113
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,660
That's right!

114
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,160
Yes! You've survived, Ai'Can!

115
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,880
You're in the way.

116
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,700
You're insulting me again?

117
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,300
Well, isn't it true?

118
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,380
No!

119
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,040
Where I stand is my business. Whatever I want to eat is also my business.

120
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,560
And another thing,

121
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,460
this car probably isn't even yours.

122
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,240
It's your car?

123
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,940
Yes.

124
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,400
And you're getting it dirty right now.

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,140
Why do you have to say that I'm dirty?

126
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,220
I'm not dirty.

127
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,580
Although I forget to shower on some days, and sometimes I don't brush my teeth.

128
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,430
Although I might run around the field to the point I'm drenched in sweat,

129
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,820
but my hair still smells good.

130
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,200
Do you want to try smelling it?

131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,360
Smell it!

132
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,780
Disgusting.

133
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,420
Disgusting?

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,320
Disgusting, right?

135
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,120
Now your car is dirty like me.

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,320
How's that?

137
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,640
Now, you're also dirty.

138
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,700
Your car is also dirty.

139
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,260
Ew, disgusting!

140
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,280
You're dirty.

141
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,720
What the hell are you smiling for?

142
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,500
Throw it away for me.

143
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,820
Throw it away yourself then!

144
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,380
I don't want someone who just leaned on my car

145
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,560
to choke to death.

146
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,340
If you want to die somewhere else, then just go.

147
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,640
Someone like me won't die...

148
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,860
I didn't want to drink it.

149
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,940
But my mom and dad taught me not to waste food.

150
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,840
He's so freaking strange.

151
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,560
Dude, take it easy a bit.

152
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,740
You'll end up dying.

153
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,600
Don't bother me.

154
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,680
I was just worried.

155
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
Pond! This way.

156
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
All right, all right.

157
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,960
He looks like he's in a fucking awful state.

158
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
How did you even find him?

159
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,360
I called him so many times to death. He even turned off his phone on me!

160
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,820
I came out with my high school friends.

161
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,000
And when I turned around I saw a familiar face.

162
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,080
How is it? Pretty clear, right?

163
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,440
Dude, I don't know what fucking problem he has with Ai'Pete,

164
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
but...

165
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,500
Pete isn't going to come and check on him for a bit?

166
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,520
They used to love each other so much.

167
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,120
It's not what you think.

168
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,300
Don't even talk!

169
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,660
The reason I broke up with him, isn't because we didn't love each other.

170
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,900
Do you fucking understand?

171
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Do you fucking understand?

172
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you fucking understand? He never dumped me.

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,380
Ai'Ae... Ai'Ae, calm down.

174
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,220
- Do you know that I love him?
- Yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,860
Ai'Bow wasn't blaming Ai'Pete at all.

176
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,620
She just didn't know what happened between you two.

177
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,060
Don't take it out on your friend!

178
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

179
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,100
I don't understand.

180
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,240
Which guy in our year do you think is the most interesting?

181
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,600
Pete, of course!

182
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,620
But it's such a shame... He already moved to study abroad.

183
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,840
But I don't really think so... It has to be Tin!

184
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,160
Geez. That Tin? He's so arrogant.

185
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,580
But he is perfect.

186
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,840
Who's Tin?

187
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,300
You don't know him?

188
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,420
Oh, right. Last semester you weren't studying the same courses as Tin and Pete.

189
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,440
Not knowing the two most famous friends in our faculty, wouldn't that be strange?

190
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,040
Do I really need to know them?

191
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,820
Of course, you do!

192
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,460
If they were just handsome, rich, and smart, that would just be ordinary.

193
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,900
Our school has a lot of good looking people, but Tin is exceptional.

194
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,260
Do you know of the Medthanan family?

195
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,540
The biggest real estate family in Thailand.

196
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,120
If you don't know them, you must have heard of the name Tun Medthanan before.

197
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,330
He's so talented that he was even featured in business magazines from abroad you know!

198
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,860
He's also handsome, rich, and even comes from a good family.

199
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,120
But it's such a shame, he already has a wife though.

200
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,650
That guy there is Tin?

201
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,160
Yeah.

202
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,980
Tin, the youngest son of Medthanan.

203
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,120
This is the number one guy in our faculty.

204
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
He is handsome, rich, and talented.

205
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,220
He comes from an extremely good family.

206
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Not to mention, he's still completely single. He has no interest or eyes on anyone either.

207
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,280
You said he's single, right?

208
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,460
Hey, girl...

209
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,260
He's extremely arrogant you know!

210
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,720
Something like this, you never know if you don't try.

211
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,080
Hello, Job, where are you?

212
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm in front of the International College building already.

213
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,520
Weren't you the one who invited me to lunch in front of the International College building?

214
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,380
You said the food is good, there's eye candy, and the price is pretty good.

215
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,300
How can you say something like that?

216
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,540
Do you know, that today

217
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,100
I didn't have class this morning so I woke up late.

218
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,660
Since I woke up late, my mom didn't prepare breakfast for me. And even now,

219
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,100
I still haven't had anything drop in my stomach yet.

220
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,580
Did you think our faculty and the International College building are only separated by a fence or something?

221
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,420
I don't have the energy to walk anymore. If I keep walking, I'm going to die for sure.

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,980
Hey, Job!

223
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,180
You lousy friend!

224
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,820
If I walk there, I'm totally going to die.

225
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,440
Or should I just eat at the International College building?

226
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,920
But I also don't want to see that dogmouth guy.
(T/N: Dogmouth = Speaks rudely, always insulting others, always talking shit, etc)

227
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,600
What to do, Ai'Can?

228
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Tin!

229
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,840
Tin! Tin?

230
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,780
Tin!

231
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,440
Tin!

232
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,500
Why are you in such a hurry like that, Tin?

233
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,340
What do you want?

234
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,900
The professor said that I need a partner to do the report with.

235
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,120
You should've already seen that our friends have already partnered up.

236
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,900
So I don't have a partner yet.

237
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
Tin, could you partner up with me?

238
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,020
Partner up with someone else.

239
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,920
Hold on, Tin. Tin, you don't have a partner either, right?

240
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,180
Come on and partner up with me.

241
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,380
I promise that I will help you with the report.

242
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,020
I told you already. Partner up with someone else.

243
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
I know that you get annoyed easily,

244
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,420
but don't you feel sorry for someone who's partner-less like me?

245
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,460
Or did you think that I approached you for some other reason?

246
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,340
I just wanted to come and find... a partner for the report. That's all.

247
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,200
What's your name?

248
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm Ongfong. You can call me Fong.

249
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,640
By the way, Tin... You're the younger brother of Tun Medthanan, right?

250
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,500
You don't want my number anymore?

251
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,920
How do you know my older brother?

252
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Who'd be crazy to not know of Mr. Tun!

253
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,900
Then let me tell you something.

254
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,760
Sure. What is it?

255
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,280
The sons of the Medthanan house don't like such easy girls like you.

256
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,640
Tin! Here you are! I spent so much time looking for you!

257
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,100
I'm starving to death. Let's go eat, come on!

258
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,860
Are you done talking? Let's hurry and go. I'm hungry.

259
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Hurry up!

260
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,440
Wasn't that close?

261
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,340
What was close?

262
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,160
And when are you going to let go?

263
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,780
It's not like I really wanted to touch you or anything.

264
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,200
Instead, you should be thanking me

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
for helping you just in time.

266
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,080
Wait! Wait! Wait! You don't have to act that disgusted of my hands.

267
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,160
My hands are clean.

268
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,760
This morning... This morning when I used the bathroom, did I wash my hands?

269
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,700
What about you? Just now, what were you going to do?

270
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,270
I'm the one who should be asking you.

271
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,240
Why did you interfere?

272
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,680
Well you were about to insult that girl, right?

273
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Someone with a dogmouth like you, just opening your mouth and I could see your uvula.
(T/N: He goes hard on insults)

274
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,300
How could you even insult her?

275
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,240
She was so freaking pretty.

276
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,740
Pretty?

277
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,260
She's so freaking pretty and so freaking cute.

278
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,320
Did you even use your eyes to look?

279
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,640
A girl like that?

280
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,440
Dude, you're so...

281
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,580
So do you remember my surname now?

282
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,100
I forgot. I can't remember.

283
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,540
My brain's memory is short.

284
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,700
Why? You're going to call me stupid again?

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,140
At least you're better than that girl.

286
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,120
What's with you?

287
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,380
Whatever. Let's say I did a good deed today.

288
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm off.

289
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,400
Wait!

290
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,620
What now?

291
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,680
Didn't you say you were going to eat with me?

292
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,000
I was just saying that. I'm not hungry at all.

293
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,690
Can you eat all of that?

294
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,300
Just you wait and see then.

295
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,140
Are you really going to treat me to this meal?

296
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,120
I told you that already.

297
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,120
Dude, you're so...

298
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,820
Every single word you say, why does it seem so hard to come out?

299
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,040
You can say more than just a few words

300
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,640
Well, you said that you helped me.

301
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,260
Even though I don't think it counts as helping,

302
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,000
but I don't want to be indebted to anyone.

303
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,160
I helped you, you know!

304
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,740
No matter how much of a dogmouth you are!

305
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,480
You still have no right to insult girls.

306
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,360
Otherwise, other people will say that you are a pussy.

307
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,180
I actually helped you. You should try being grateful for once.

308
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,440
A girl like that? She deserves it.

309
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,880
What the hell is with you?

310
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,000
Dirty.

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,180
You're insulting me again!

312
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,240
But you're still cuter than those girls.

313
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,170
So incredibly dirty.

314
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,710
Throw it away for me, too.

315
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,500
Is he insulting me or complimenting me?

316
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,400
Dirty but cute.

317
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,160
Is he complimenting me or insulting me?

318
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,740
What's wrong?

319
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,340
Lemon!

320
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,120
Can I ask you something?

321
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm not answering.

322
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,380
It's because you always like to ask about nonsense every time!

323
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,400
I'd rather spend that time reading tweets. That would be so much more useful.

324
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,080
What?

325
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,820
Lemon, if someone says that you're dirty,

326
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,920
it's an insult, right?

327
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,880
It... It probably is?

328
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,580
And what if... they said that you're cute?

329
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,040
Then it's a compliment, right?

330
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,720
Of course.

331
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,140
So what if there's a person who says you're dirty but cute.

332
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,140
What the heck does that mean?

333
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,480
He's probably... both complimenting and insulting you maybe?

334
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,960
I have a smart little sister.

335
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,860
But she's so useless at helping her older brother.

336
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,160
Who would be stupid like you then?

337
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,100
I can't figure it out!

338
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
How annoying!

339
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,740
I won't think about it anymore. My head hurts.

340
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
What the heck?

341
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,620
I can't figure it out.

342
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,200
I can't figure it out though!

343
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,460
P'Can!

344
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,320
What? It's because I can't figure it out! My head totally hurts now.

345
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
You're so annoying.

346
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,420
That hurts!

382
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,640
This flavor is really freaking spicy, dude.

383
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,380
I love it.

384
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,460
True, dude. I like this flavor, too.

385
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,160
Let me have some.

386
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,440
Why are you still eating here? Didn't you say you were going to see Ae?

387
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,320
I did?

388
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,260
You ate until you forgot your friend already!

389
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,140
Give it to me. I'll eat it instead. I want to redeem the item in the game.

390
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,560
It's mine!

391
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,260
Enough, I'll keep it.

392
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,320
You're not going to share it with friends?

393
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,220
Aren't you in a hurry to go to class?

394
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,200
I'll play the game first.

395
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,600
We should go now.

396
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,040
- It's so freaking spicy. See you later, dude.
- See you.

397
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,000
Pond! Pond! The snacks. The snacks.

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,820
I'm not giving it.

399
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,760
Die already!

400
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,900
So... what's your name?

401
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,440
You've been sitting here for a while, but you still don't know my name?

402
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,380
It's Mai.
(T/N: wood/stick)

403
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,520
I think that I'm about to get hit by Mai.

404
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,460
Don't you have class?

405
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,670
Go then.

406
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,100
Actually, I don't but...

407
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,960
Pond! I guess I have it.

408
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,200
Bye-bye, Mai.

409
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,660
How can you leave me with such a guy?

410
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,760
P'No, this is my friend.

411
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,640
That I was going to bring to sign-up for the university football team.

412
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,960
Hello, P'Champ. Hello, P'No

413
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,060
So, why did you want to join the football team?

414
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,540
Do you want a pretty kind of answer or an honest answer?

415
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,620
I'll take the pretty kind of answer first.

416
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,320
Because football is the sport that I've loved since I was young.

417
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,980
I think that becoming part of the team is an honor.

418
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,240
And the honest one?

419
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,180
All the girls go crazy for football players.

420
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,520
Dude, why did you answer like that?

421
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,440
Being a university footballer should mean that you want to win the championship for your university!

422
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
Such a shitty answer like that. P'No won't let you in.

423
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,320
Okay, you pass.

424
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,360
- P'No...
- Why not? He answered pretty sincerely.

425
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,760
What the hell?

426
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,280
Isn't that right? My answer is pretty sincere.

427
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,180
P'No, you're kind to everyone.

428
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,120
You're only mean to me.

429
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,940
You said I'm mean, right? Go.

430
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,140
You can go and buy water then. Buy a lot, too.

431
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,920
As for the new kid, let me test your skills first.

432
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,540
Yes, Sir.

433
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,280
- Go buy water.
- By myself?

434
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah. Go.

435
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,440
Are you going or not?

436
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,780
I'll go.

437
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,170
And I'm going to tell everyone that you're so mean to the kids (juniors).

438
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,900
This guy...

439
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
P'No, P'No.

440
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
He uses me too much.

441
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm going to tell P'Type for sure.

442
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,640
What kind of stupid party of yours, Mom?

443
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,580
If you want to show off your favorite son,

444
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,100
then that person is not me.

445
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,480
Either way, I'm not going.

446
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,460
Don't call me.

447
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,210
You're so annoying.

448
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,740
Tin, you asshole!

449
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,400
How can you talk shit to your mom like that?

450
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,280
I'm talking to you right now!

451
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,060
Stop acting like I'm nothing but air already.

452
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,140
If you're aware, then that's good.

453
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,820
Hey, Tin!

454
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,980
What the hell is with you?

455
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,720
Whenever I think that you're a good guy,

456
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,440
you end up acting like an asshole like this!

457
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,620
I don't know how highly you think of yourself,

458
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,920
but yelling at your mom is sinful.
(T/N: Filial piety is really big in Thailand as many Asian cultures)

459
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,560
Apologize to her right now.

460
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,400
Are you done?

461
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,820
No. Not until you apologize.

462
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm not apologizing to anyone there.

463
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,440
And you should stop meddling with my business.

464
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,400
You're really annoying.

465
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,840
Fine!

466
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,000
I forgot. You're just a kid who has lacked warmth and love.

467
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,840
What did you just say?

468
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,460
I said...

469
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,400
That you... are just a kid who has lacked warmth and love.

470
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,490
♫ I used to tell you ♫

471
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,542

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,150
Please... Please, please, please.

480
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,340
It's useless to be mad at you.

481
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,976
I'm off.

482
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,058
Even if you do this, Pete wouldn't be happy you know!

483
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,908
Don't bother me, you fucker!

484
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,620
You shouldn't become this weak.

485
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,720
Get up already!

486
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,430
♫ Think about that day ♫

487
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,210
♫ The day that you asked about us ♫

488
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,210
♫ I will tell you that I love you ♫

489
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,510
♫ I love you with all my heart ♫

490
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:35,810
♫ If we're just friends, I won't miss you this much ♫

491
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:43,550
♫ If we're just friends, I won't like the way you hug me  ♫

492
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,410
♫ When I said that I don't love you, I actually don't know ♫

493
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,210
♫ I don't know what this feeling is ♫

494
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,570
♫ When I said that we're just friends, I actually understand now ♫

495
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,070
♫ Can I change it? I don't want us to be just friends anymore ♫

496
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,530
♫ This time, you won't be sad ♫

497
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,130
♫ We will get through it together ♫

498
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,890
♫ From now on, let me take care of you ♫

499
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:19,170
♫ Tomorrow or whenever our love will be everlasting ♫

500
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,270
♫ When I said that I don't love you, I actually don't know ♫

501
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,010
♫ I don't know what this feeling is ♫

502
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,370
♫ When I said that we're just friends, I actually understand now ♫

503
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:50,280
♫ Can I change it? I don't want us to be just friends anymore ♫

504
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,200
♫ Promise I will always be true and honest to you ♫

505
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,780
♫  Promise I will love you forever and you
will be with me forever ♫

506
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,470
♫ Promise I will always be true and honest to you ♫

507
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,550
