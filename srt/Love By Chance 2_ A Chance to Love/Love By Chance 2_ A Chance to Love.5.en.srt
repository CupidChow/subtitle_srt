1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Thank you P'Tin for dropping us off.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,560
What about you?

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,560
You really want words of thanks from me that much?

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,300
I want to receive your words of thanks

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,960
but in this way instead.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,500
I'm ready to do everything just for you to stop being mad at me.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,620
I really do like you.

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,920
Let's talk about that matter later...

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,100
P'No!

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,620
Give me a bit more time, Ai'Kla.

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,180
How did you get here?

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,260
Thanks for dropping me off.

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,300
Why haven't you gone back yet?

14
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,380
I told you. I don't just want the words "Thank you."

15
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,720
What do you want?

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,700
To hit on you.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,300
Why haven't you gone back yet?

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,720
I told you. I don't just want the words "Thank you."

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm telling you right now, that this time you won't be able to kiss me!

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm on to you! You're going to tease me.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm not teasing.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,220
Then... what is it that you want?

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,960
To hit on you.

24
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,560

[Love By chance: Season 2]
[Episode 5]

45
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,900
Where the heck did it go?

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,940
Can, what are you looking for?

47
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,560
Where the heck did it go?!

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,580
Nothing!

49
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,520
Hey, what's wrong?

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm so dead.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,620
What? Are you going to die already?

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,220
My only property.

53
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,580
If it's about that, I don't think you need to worry about it.

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,640
After all, you don't have anything going on in your life anyway.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,680
Ai'Job! I have something! My phone!

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,420
But right now, I don't know where it is.

57
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,680
I kept looking to the point that my bag is about to be torn apart!

58
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,960
Geez! I still haven't paid off the installments to my mom!

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,560
How am I supposed to play games now?

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,920
So did you try calling your phone yet?

61
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,440
Dude, you're so smart!

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,100
Someone is answering, dude!

63
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,220
What did they say?

64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,660
But they said that...

65
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,680
"Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be reached," dude.

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,140
Just face it.

67
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,020
With your phone turned off like this, it's either been smashed or stolen already.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,580
Ai'Job!

69
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,760
All right, all right.

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm trying to help you think right now.

71
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,180
So can you remember which places you've been to today?

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,600
Well, when I left the house I grabbed it and was still playing on it.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,340
And then…

74
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,240
Ai'Tin!

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,580
I'm going to go to the international college building!

76
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,920
Hey!

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,500
Ai'Can! What about your bag, dude?

78
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,740
I have to keep it for him, don't I?

79
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,600
Geez... Why is there so much shit?

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,900
Hey! Hey! Hey! Do you know a guy named Tin? Tin who's really tall...

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,020
Do you know someone named Tin?

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,900
Tin who's really fair-skinned and tall...

83
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,560
Hey! Hey, guys. Do you know someone named Tin?

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,060
The one that's really tall and likes to walk like this...

85
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,340
You don't know him? The one who's really fair-skinned and really tall.

86
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,780
His eyes... His eyes are like this.

87
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,160
The one that's kind of arrogant.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,400
He has classes in this building.

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,620
But he's very tall and fair-skinned.

90
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,740
You can't even help me a bit?

91
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,080
Excuse me, Miss.

92
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Do you know a guy named Tin?

93
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
The one that's really tall, has a handsome face, and acts really arrogant? Right?

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,100
That's right! That's right! Do you know him, too?

95
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,860
Of course, we know him.

96
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,580
So... where is he right now?

97
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,980
We don't know.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
Hey, you don't need to make that face.

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,400
I'll ask someone in the group for you.

100
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,440
What group?

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,920
A really handsome guy like that... Of course, he'd have a fan club. Right?

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,500
(Fan club?)

103
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,660
Tin drove out in his car already.

104
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Then that means that I missed out on seeing him then.

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,640
Hey, it's all right.

106
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,020
He has a class at 1:00. He'll drive back again.

107
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,360
Yay!

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,420
You're the cutest!

109
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,500
Thank you so much!

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,620
He's cute!

111
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,820
Where is he?

112
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,480
If I had known, I would've asked for his number.

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,660
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
Ai'Tin!

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,680
So clumsy.

116
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,140
Where have you been?

117
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,820
Did you know that I've been looking for you all over school?

118
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,060
I waited for you for so long. They said you were going to come in at 1:00.

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,700
Do you know what time is it now? It's already 3:00.

120
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Were you still looking for me?

121
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,460
What are you smiling about?

122
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,620
♫ I don't know what this feeling is ♫

123
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,780
Dirty.

124
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,700
What's with you?

125
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,860
I'm not dirty at all.

126
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,640
I take a shower every day.

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,200
It's just...

128
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm just not that clean.

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,700
See? I'm clean now.

130
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,640
So, why were you looking for me?

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Oh right! Have you seen my phone?

132
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,600
Your phone.

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Huh?

134
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,240
Well you forgot it in my car.

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,660
I didn't happen to see it.

136
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,860
So when I opened the door, it fell.

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,101
Just from falling out of a car and it's in this kind of state, dude??

138
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,923
- It was crushed by a ten-wheeler.
- Crushed by a ten-wheeler?!

139
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,020
My son…

140
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,020
I never thought you'd leave so soon.

141
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,140
I never thought that we'd spend only eight months,

142
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,460
ten days, and twenty-eight hours together.

143
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,960
Doesn't a day only have 24 hours?

144
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't bother!

145
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:18,815
Here, this is yours.

146
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,660
Don't bother me!

147
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,500
I'm crying and mourning for my son right now.

148
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
This is yours.

149
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,500
A new phone. I bought it for you.

150
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,720
Ai'Tin, didn't I already tell you?

151
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,920
That someone like me isn't someone you can throw money at!

152
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,160
You just keep it.

153
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,960
I don't need it.

154
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,100
Can!

155
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,720
Wait!

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,880
Can, wait!

157
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,480
Can!

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,100
Can.

159
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,920
What did I do wrong?

160
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,680
Let me go.

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,720
No.

162
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,740
Let's talk properly.

163
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,900
I don't want to talk to someone who likes to throw money at other people!

164
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,840
Just when did I throw money at you?

165
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,040
When you bought a new phone to give me!

166
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,860
Did you think doing just that, it'd be the end?

167
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,020
Huh?

168
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,080
You think that I don't need your apology anymore, is that it?

169
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,100
You think that money can solve every problem? Is that it?

170
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
I was only trying to repay you.

171
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,480
But I don't need it.

172
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,700
But I broke your phone,

173
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,280
so, of course, I have to buy a new one to repay you.

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,340
But you're not the one who threw it on the ground for the car to run over it!

175
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,360
I don't know how you were raised.

176
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,460
But what I needed were just the words "I'm sorry"!

177
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,260
You can't say it? Just the words "I'm sorry"?!

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,440
Just that?

179
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Yeah!

180
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
That's all.

181
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
Sorry.

182
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,900
Once more.

183
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,120
That was all, dude.

185
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,220
Remember this.

186
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,460
Whenever we do something wrong, we have to say sorry.

187
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,300
That's what my mom taught me.

188
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,100
I can forgive you... for breaking my phone

189
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,860
and for throwing money at me.

190
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,260
I really wasn't throwing money at you.

191
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,500
- But you bought…
- I just wanted your number.

192
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,080
I wanted your phone number,

193
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,340
so I broke your phone.

194
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,560
Your new phone has my number.

195
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,740
As for your new number, I've already saved it.

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,060
You... bought a phone for me... just for that reason?

197
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,580
Well, I already told you.

198
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,820
What did you tell me?

199
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,140
I can't remember it anymore!

200
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm stupid.

201
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,980
Can you remind me?

202
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,580
That I'm going to hit on you.

203
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,900
So that's why I wanted your number.

204
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,120
A pretentiously unaffectionate guy like you

205
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,840
bought a phone for me

206
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,780
just because you wanted my number?

207
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,260
Well, that's the only method that I know of.

208
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,780
Fine.

209
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,580
I'll take it then.

210
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
Are you going to give it to me?

211
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,160
Give it here.

212
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,680
But...

213
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,160
let me pay you back (in installments).

214
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,260
I don't like owing people.

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
What are you smiling about?

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Let's go back inside the store already!

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,160
I still haven't finished my iced cocoa.

218
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,920
Why is he not picking up?

219
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,920
Hey, let me have some.

220
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,580
Hey, bro! Eat it, but don't swipe my game code. All right?

221
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,280
It's under the tray.

222
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,280
I won't swipe it.

223
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
So... what's the matter?

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,100
You look really serious lately.

225
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,020
It's Ai'Can! Damn. He won't answer my calls.

226
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,180
Oh!

227
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,660
He changed to a new phone.

228
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,900
Oh!

229
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,920
That's right.

230
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,220
He told me that he wanted to change to a new phone,

231
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,800
but he didn't have the money.

232
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,820
So he was able to get the money now?

233
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,440
And how come he changed phones, but also had to change his number, too?

234
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,020
Yeah... That's right.

235
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,400
Or could it be that there's someone who bought a new phone for him?

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,580
Just like me. I also just bought a new phone for that pretty nurse.

237
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,180
Okay…

238
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,800
Right! P'No! So what about the other day?

239
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,340
When he said someone wanted your butt?

240
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,860
We're talking about Ai'Can right now.

241
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,140
How did it become about me?

242
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,920
Come on. Tell me about about it.

243
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,600
Come on, Bro.

244
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,020
I don't know. I'm chewing right now.

245
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,840
I can't talk. I'm leaving now.

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Geez...

247
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,060
What the heck? He won't share it with me?

248
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,400
Oh! I just happened to run out of items.

249
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,660
If I'm out, then I can just fill it up again...

250
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,000
Ai'Can!

251
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,740
Why did you come so early today?

252
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,880
- P'No.
- What? What?

253
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,720
Help me, please.

254
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,104
- What is it? Ouch! It hurts! It hurts!
- I can't figure it out anymore.

255
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm serious, Bro. That young nurse, she's really fair-skinned!

256
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,940
- Job. Ai'Job!
- LIke, wow! Her eyes are so big like she's wearing big-eye contact lenses.

257
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,660
You're only listening to your little brother. Listen and look at me, too!

258
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,260
Ai'Can!

259
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,380
So, it's great that I became a football player. She said that she likes athletes.

260
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,660
Look at me, too...

261
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,740
Dude, help me first. I'm about to die already.

262
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,720
What? Why? What is it?

263
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,800
P'No...

264
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
What?

265
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,140
If someone hits on you,

266
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,500
what are you supposed to do?

267
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
How am I supposed to know? He's never hit on me!

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,320
Before I realized, I already did it with him.

269
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:14,880
Dude... just now... I saw some guy... He's an International program kid.

270
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,560
He was standing and waiting around the entrance.

271
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,200
Who is it?

272
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,960
I don't know. He's a... International program kid.

273
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
He looks arrogant.

274
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,300
He's fair-skinned.

275
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,740
And he doesn't talk to anyone at all.

276
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey! Ai'Can!

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,940
Where is he off in such a hurry?

278
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,760
- Wait a minute, P'No.
- Huh?

279
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,980
Just now you said... you did it with someone?

280
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,080
Geez...

281
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,320
Well...

282
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,510
I think... It's almost time for practice. I'm going to go change first. I have to practice now. See ya!

283
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,280
Hey, No! Where are you running off to?

284
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
So this is what he's like now?

285
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
That was quick as hell.

286
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's practice.

287
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Come on, Bro.

288
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,960
Why did you come here?

289
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,760
I'm here to score some points.

290
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,640
What points? Playing football?

291
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,380
But you don't play football.

292
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh! You're here to score points with my captain.

293
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,840
Our team is full already.

294
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,880
We're not accepting any more members.

295
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,900
You know what I mean.

296
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't know at all...

297
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm so stupid. I don't understand anything...

298
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,820
Your face is red.

299
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,640
Whose face is red?

300
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm not being shy, you know.

301
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,700
If you're not shy, then you're not shy.

302
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,760
I bought this for you.

303
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,680
I know that you can't be bought with money,

304
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,160
but it's just snacks.

305
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,200
You could probably accept it, right?

306
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,340
If it's just snacks… then...

307
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,360
They all look so freaking yummy!

308
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,040
Look at this.

309
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,620
Lucky me, Ai'Can.

310
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,185
Can.

311
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,480
Payment for the snacks.

312
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,700
I told you already. I'm here to score points.

313
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Why do I have to get kissed by him again??

314
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,600
And why does my heart have to beat so fast like this, too?

315
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This looks so freaking yummy!

316
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,740
Look at this!

317
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,300
Which one should I eat first?

318
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,580
It's full of so many things!

319
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
I chose everything by myself you know.

320
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,700
I hope that you will like it, P'No.

321
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,380
If you like something really hot and spicy, then eat the Bento.

322
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,720
But if you like it mild, then drink Jele Vita Bead.

323
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,940
I miss you.

324
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,300
I know that you don't want to see me yet,

325
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,400
but I do miss you.

326
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,480
Geez! That crazy kid!

327
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,600
[Thanks for the phone, man. I'll definitely pay you back.]

328
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,120
Hello, man. Why are you calling?

329
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,800
Calling makes it easier to talk.

330
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
Texting to talk is pretty easy too though.

331
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,760
I almost finished typing.

332
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,440
Do you like your new phone?

333
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,840
I like it so much, man! It's even faster than my old one.

334
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,380
It's so smooth when playing games!

335
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,480
I don't know if it's good luck or bad luck

336
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,640
that you coincidentally dropped my phone on the street.

337
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
Coincidentally...

338
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,340
Right! What a coincidence!

339
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,780
And I'm even luckier that you're letting me pay in installments, too.

340
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,560
I don't have ฿30,000-40,000 to pay you back all at once...
(Approx. $950-1,265 USD)

341
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,300
After a while, you're actually a pretty good person, too, Ai'Tin.

342
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,940
So am I good enough to hit on you yet?

343
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,820
Can.

344
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,980
I don't know.

345
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,240
Just tell me yes or no.

346
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,920
But I just don't know.

347
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,800
I just know... that I don't get goosebumps when you hit on me.

348
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,940
Then I'm going to get serious now.

349
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't know! I'm sleepy. That's all for now...

350
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm going to be serious, for real now.

351
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,140
Ae?

352
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,180
I'm going to buy stuff at 7 Eleven. Do you want to come with?

353
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,080
I'll go, too.

354
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
Hello, Tar.

355
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,740
Hello, P'Tum.

356
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,100
How have you been?

357
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, pretty good still. My school just started.

358
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,820
I've been a little bit busy.

359
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,840
And how is it over there?

360
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,260
Pretty good.

361
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,180
Lately, I've been thinking about... what songs I should write.

362
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,080
Writing songs?

363
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,040
Are you writing them to be an artist now?

364
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,940
For the song... How far have you gotten with writing it?

365
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,580
I still don't know what genre it should be.

366
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,900
I have no idea.

367
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,980
Then I think for now... maybe a love song? It seems to be in now.

368
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,720
A love song?

369
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,500
I don't know.

370
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,420
What are you doing now?

371
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,180
Oh... I just happened to be doing this.

372
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,700
Sitting doing various assignments. Sitting and reading articles and such for a project.

373
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,640
And I figured after finishing up in a bit, I was going to take a shower.

374
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,420
How is it over there?

375
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,000
Is the climate starting to get colder?

376
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,120
Well, it's Thailand.

377
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,360
It's as hot as ever.

378
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,260
Either way, if you ever have a chance, want to try visiting me?

379
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,080
By the way, when are you coming back?

380
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm still not sure yet.

381
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,020
But if I'm free or have a long holiday break,

382
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,940
I'll go back to see you.

383
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,500
Tell dad and mom that I miss them, too, all right?

384
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,200
If you come back this time,

385
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,120
will I get to try your desserts?

386
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,820
I guarantee that you'll definitely get to eat them! Because I've already taken the dessert class this year.

387
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,360
I should be better than before, probably.

388
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,860
It's a holiday break over there, right?

389
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,040
Yes.

390
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,960
Then I won't bother you anymore.

391
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Okay. I'll take a shower and go to bed then.

392
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,540
Sweet dreams.

393
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,400
Okay. Then, sweet dreams all right?

394
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,260
Dad, I'm bored.

395
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,300
Didn't I tell you to go with your mom?

396
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,840
I don't want to.

397
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,780
Grandma's always nagging.

398
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,460
I don't like it.

399
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,220
I like being with Dad more.

400
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,040
But you said you were bored.

401
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,840
Dad, can you tell me a story?

402
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,020
I'm still working.

403
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,760
It's late now. You need to rest.

404
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,160
You can't work, Dad.

405
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,740
Rest?

406
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,060
Then that means that I don't have to tell you a story, right?

407
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,020
I don't want that. You have to tell me a story.

408
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,180
Well… How about the story...

409
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,860
of two brothers? Sound good?

410
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,780
No, I don't want it. It doesn't sound exciting.

411
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,800
Then...the story of two brothers and one other, a servant?

412
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,840
It doesn't seem very fun.

413
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
Once upon a long time ago,

414
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,620
there were two brothers.

415
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,800
The older one was a jealous kid

416
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,960
who wanted revenge on everyone.

417
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,540
As for the younger brother, he was a naughty kid.

418
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,140
He was raised very spoiled until he was ruined.

419
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,520
But it was the older brother who purposely raised him to be ruined.

420
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,940
If he was someone with a bad personality, no one would love him.

421
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,920
Until one day...

422
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,480
What right do you have to tell me what to do?

423
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,200
You're just a servant.

424
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,120
Whatever I do is my business.

425
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,620
Khun Tin... but if you speak like this, it's not nice.
(T/N: Khun is an honorific that basically =Mr./Ms./Mrs.)

426
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,060
If Khun Tul heard it, he probably wouldn't like it either.

427
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,400
Well, I'm not speaking to P'Tul, am I?

428
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,140
I speak like this only to servants like you.

429
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,680
You have no right to tell me what I can and can't do.

430
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,920
Did you hear me?

431
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,820
Yes. I understand that I have no right.

432
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,960
Good. Now move over.

433
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Khun Rasa ordered me not to let you go out.

434
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,620
Move over!

435
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,080
I can't, Khun Tin. Please wait for Tul to come back first.

436
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,960
Move!

437
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,680
I'll make them pay for what they did to Tul.

438
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,140
You really can't do that.

439
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,880
Khun Rasa ordered me to keep you out of trouble.

440
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,980
But they insulted P'Tul.

441
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
I still can't let you go.

442
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,940
You should follow only Tul's orders,

443
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,540
not my mom's.

444
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,180
I will tell Tul about this.

445
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,960
Sure. If it will make you feel better, then you can go ahead and tell Khun Tul.

446
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,600
I didn't mean to!

447
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,380
- What happened?
- He... He put himself in front of me.

448
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,220
I didn't do anything.

449
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,200
Shut up right now, Tin!

450
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,840
Only spoiling the younger made the older brother unable to stand it anymore.

451
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,040
What happened after that?

452
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,760
Did the younger brother get punished?

453
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
Of course, he was punished.

454
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
Nong Phu, remember this all right?

455
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't be like that naughty kid.

456
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,300
I'm a good kid.

457
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,920
I'm a good kid, really.

458
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,820
I'm not like the younger brother. He's bad.

459
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,940
That's right.

460
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,760
Bad children need to be punished.

461
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,380
A kid with a bad personality,

462
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,840
no one has a need for them.

463
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
Why didn't you also tell him

464
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,860
just who the one was that taught such bad things to the younger brother?

465
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,640
Who made that younger brother have no one around him?

466
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,300
Go ahead and tell him.

467
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,440
Dad.

468
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,700
Uncle Tin. Uncle Tin, don't hurt Dad.

469
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,180
Nong Phu, remember this, all right?

470
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,240
Whether you'll be like the older or younger brother,

471
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,860
don't be a monster disguised as an angel.

472
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,880
Or don't be a stupid person

473
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,920
who just gets fooled repeatedly.

474
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,240
Do you understand?

475
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,660
Yes...

476
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,880
Dad, Uncle Tin is so scary.

477
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,240
It's okay.

478
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,100
Uncle Tin is probably just tired.

479
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,960
Sit here.

480
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,120
Nong Phu, remember this

481
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Don't be like those two brothers.

482
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,520
Especially the older brother,

483
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,960
the one who must pay for his sins.

484
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,980
He's paying for his sins still.

485
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,420
Khun Tul,

486
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,360
did something happen to you?

487
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,620
[Thanks for the snacks. They were damn delicious!]

488
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,520
Hey! Again?

489
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,580
I still haven't finished texting yet! Why are you calling?

490
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,900
If you listen to what I have to say,

491
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,780
would you believe me?

492
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,520
Of course, I'd believe you.

493
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,900
Because you're my friend.

494
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,200
Whatever you say, I'd believe you anyway.

495
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,540
I used to think that my older brother

496
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,540
was everything to me.

497
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,600
My older brother was everything that I had.

498
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,040
No matter what he said,

499
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,740
I'd believe him.

500
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,620
He had told me that

501
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,680
dad and mom didn't love me.

502
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,140
I believed everything.

503
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,860
I believed even the words of his lies,

504
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,940
that he said he would help me

505
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,380
when I was being accused of abusing drugs.

506
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Huh? What was that?

507
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,380
I grew up to be a spoiled child

508
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,640
with a bad personality,

509
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,160
and that bad child

510
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,040
had to be sent to study abroad.

511
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,200
I partied

512
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,100
and went out.

513
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,580
And then I was arrested

514
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,180
on charges of using drugs.

515
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,660
Even though I didn't even know that it was a drug party.

516
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,120
It was all over the news.

517
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,480
I was on the front pages.

518
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,200
"A drug-addicted socialite

519
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,540
was arrested abroad."

520
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,820
My older brother said that he would help me.

521
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,300
But the truth was he was the one behind everything.

522
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,380
He hates me.

523
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,800
He wants me dead.

524
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,240
He wants to take everything from me.

525
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,940
Hates me...

526
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,840
Ai'Tin, where are you?

527
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,260
What?

528
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,340
Ai'Tin, I'm asking, where's your house? I'm going to go see you!

529
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,460
I'm going to punch your older brother's face.

530
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,200
So? Where are you? Tell me!

531
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,420
Can,

532
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,580
can I go to see you?

533
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,980
Why not?

534
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,780
Gucci.

535
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,200
Is Ai'Tin going to be okay?

536
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,720
You really believe me, right?

537
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
Yeah.

538
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,160
I believe you.

539
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,520
[Preview]
Right now, I really despise your older brother, Ai'Tin.

540
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,160
If I see his face, I'm going to punch him once.

541
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,060
So, this is his son.

542
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,220
What's up?

543
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,260
Are you a bad person like your dad?

544
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,880
You can't insult Dad. My dad is a good person.

545
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,160
He has a great personality, too.

546
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,740
Or he just might be really evil.

547
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,800
What did my good boy do today?

548
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,540
I was fighting with Uncle Tin's friend and I won, too.

549
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,920
But he said you're a bad person first.

550
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,360
Look into Tin's friend named Can for me.

551
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,420
I just want to know who Tin's important person is.

552
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,680
You probably won't get angry, right?
