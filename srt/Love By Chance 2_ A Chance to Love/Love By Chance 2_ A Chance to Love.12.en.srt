1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,780
I beg you.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,800
Can you please forgive your older brother?

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,160
I can forgive him.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,700
I still haven't finished cursing out your older brother!

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,110
I don't know! I'm going to get revenge for you!

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,020
Make me the happiest man on earth.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,910
Have the kind of happiness that my older brother never had.

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,200
That... is the best kind of revenge.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,830

- Dad's love for a certain someone.

10

[Love By Chance 2: A Chance to Love]

32
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,950
The room's small.

33
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,940
Not earning much?

34
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,190
Well, I live alone.

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,180
I don't really need a big room.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,650
As for my income...

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,710
The job Khun Tai recommended to me since I came to England,

38
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,347
has allowed me to live without any difficulties.

39
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,230
You've been here for so many years.

40
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,370
You never thought of dating someone?

41
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,980
Khun Tin, you came all the way here...

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,240
Is there anything I can do for you?

43
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,730
You still haven't answered my question yet.

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,700
Khun Tin, you don't have to speak politely with me.

45
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,030
Just talk to me like before.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,670
No.

47
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,980
Things have changed.

48
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,680
They haven't changed.

49
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,160
Several years ago, when you asked me to help you with some work...

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm still the same even now.

51
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,340
Why do you love someone like my older brother?

52
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,940
At first, I felt it was strange.

53
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,640
As soon as I came back to Thailand,

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,480
my father told me to come to you.

55
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,500
At first, I took it as he wanted you to be my assistant.

56
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,930
But now I know.

57
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,178
He actually wanted you to tell me the truth instead.

58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,659
Khun Tai told you that?

59
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,560
Even if my father promised you that he wouldn't tell my older brother your address,

60
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,650
but that doesn't include me.

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,200
What else did Khun Tai tell you?

62
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,840
I want to know about Gonhin.

63
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,960
I already gave you Gonhin's address.

64
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
Dad, what exactly do you want?

65
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,770
Why are you giving me his address?

66
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't know.

67
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,640
If you didn't want Gonhin to become my assistant…

68
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,890
Dad, did you want me to know about Gonhin and P'Tul's relationship?

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,720
I have no idea what you think of me,

70
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,660
as the head of the family or as CEO of this company.

71
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,330
But your father is just a very old and stupid man,

72
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,370
who doesn't know how to help his son.

73
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,980
Whether it's you, Tul, or a kid...

74
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,990
that I've known since he was small, like Gonhin,

75
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,390
I was never able to help anyone.

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,160
So you took a gamble

77
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,590
and gave me Gonhin's address?

78
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,150
Like I've said before,

79
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,820
you're the nicest kid, Tin.

80
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,750
So you're hoping that a nice kid like me,

81
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,200
can help mend the relationship between those two? Is that it?

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,930
Not at all.

83
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,780
I'm just a selfish old man

84
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,480
who wants to see my sons go back to being on good terms while I'm still alive.

85
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,190
What does that mean?

86
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,280
Life is short, Tin.

87
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,960
I thought that I had lost the person I loved the most not that long ago.

88
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,780
But in reality,

89
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,440
decades have passed.

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,670
I don't want you guys to waste your time for nothing like this old man.

91
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,150
But just don't get your hopes up then.

92
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,580
You said it yourself,

93
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,440
you never expected much from me.

94
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,480
Just do what you want to do, all right?

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
So you came here because of Khun Tai then.

96
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,140
I didn't come here for anyone.

97
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,380
I came here for myself.

98
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,740
To atone for my past sins.

99
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,643
Khun Tin, would you like to hear about Khun Tul's childhood?

100
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,910
That's exactly why I'm here.

101
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,161
I've already packed everything up.

102
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,700
But I still can't take them all back yet.

103
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,020
So I thought that tomorrow I'll send people to get the rest.

104
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,720
Is that so?

105
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,654
As for anything that's left, P'Tul, you can throw them away.

106
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,750
So, when are you leaving?

107
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,540
Next week.

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,860
Nong Phu will probably miss you a lot.

109
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,630
P'Tul, you have to promise me

110
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,200
that you'll take good care of Nong Phu.

111
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm such a bad person for leaving my son here.

112
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,960
Not at all.

113
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,630
I have to thank you for allowing Phupha to stay here with me.

114
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,060
I didn't want to leave him here.

115
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,500
But I was afraid that...

116
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,740
Afraid? Afraid of what?

117
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,810
I don't see anything to be afraid of.

118
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,620
I was afraid that... if Nong Phu didn't stay here,

119
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,290
then you wouldn't be able to carry on living on this earth.

120
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,930
I didn't say anything

121
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,796
but that doesn't mean I didn't know.

122
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,990
All this time,

123
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,990
our son is the only reason you were with me.

124
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:41,704
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,660
P'Tul, you don't need to apologize.

126
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,550
It's all in the past.

127
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,060
Up until now, you've always taken good care of me.

128
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,970
But there's no wife

129
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,540
that would be able to endure it.

130
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,391
If their husband never embraced them.

131
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,710
Never kissed them.

132
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,090
Not even have any skinship.

133
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,060
Like other husbands and wives do.

134
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,966
Can I hug you one last time?

135
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm sorry for everything that's passed.

136
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:02,462
So you're saying my brother was once kidnapped?

137
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:06,350
And grandmother told those people that they could just kill my older brother?

138
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,400
Yes.

139
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,000
Your grandmother hated Khun Tul very much.

140
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,399
She hated him so much that

141
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,365
whe didn't even want to stand near him.

142
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,680
He was berated,

143
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,370
chastised,

144
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,790
looked down upon and abused.

145
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,250
And he wasn't accepted as someone with the Methanan name.

146
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,170
And it got worse

147
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
on the day you were born.

148
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,870
Because my mother was the person that my grandmother chose.

149
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,799
Yes.

150
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,754
Khun Ping always said that

151
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,260
Khun Tin

152
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,510
was the true heir of the Methanan family.

153
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,990
As for Khun Tul...

154
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,300
Khun Tul had it really bad.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,662
He faced it his whole life.

156
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,507
So I got to be the happy child,

157
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,330
while my older brother...

158
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,298
Got to be the despised one.

159
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,480
I won't ask you to forgive Khul Tul.

160
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,460
Because the things that Khun Tul did himself, shouldn't be forgiven.

161
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,814
But Khun Tul loves you, Khun Tin.

162
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,442
He both loves and hates you.

163
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,550
Because no matter what, you're his only little brother...

164
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,267
You're the only one Khun Tul counts as family.

165
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,991
It's not me.

166
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,127
Rather, it's you.

167
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,035
Do you know

168
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,350
what my older brother named his son?

169
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,720
I don't know.

170
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,140
I left before he was born.

171
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,330
Phupha.

172
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,030
Isn't it strange?

173
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,536
The father's name is Tul.

174
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,420
His wife is Napavadee.

175
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,638
But the son is named Phupha.

176
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,410
And your name is Gonhin,

177
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,560
or Mr. Pattapee.

178
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,660
"Phupha...

179
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,990
means a love that's strong and secure

180
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,220
that Dad gave to a certain someone."

181
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,287
Who do you think said this?

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,680
My business here's finished.

183
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,180
I now know what I should know.

184
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,710
I'll be heading off first then.

185
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh.

186
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,810
I forgot to tell you another thing.

187
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,750
My older brother already got divorced with P'Vadee.

188
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,770
I've already atoned for my sins,

189
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,800
but you and my father shouldn't expect me to go back to being P'Tul's obedient little brother.

190
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,854
I'll beat him no matter what.

191
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,770
Good luck.

192
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,870
Why did he send so much, huh?

193
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,940
I didn't want them.

194
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,730
P'No,

195
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,800
I know what I did was wrong.

196
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,398
I bribed Ai'Nic into coming up with plans to let me meet you often.

197
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:53,110
But once we started studying at different places,

198
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,610
I didn't know what to do to come and see you.

199
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,220
I'm someone who's cunning. I won't deny that.

200
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,170
But this wily fox,

201
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,080
likes only you, P'No.

202
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,470
I only have eyes for you, P'No.

203
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,050
I won't lie to you anymore.

204
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,320
Please give me another chance.

205
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,160
But even if you don't give me another chance, I'll still try.

206
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,540
You can avoid me or even ignore my calls,

207
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,290
but at least let me write these letters to you.

208
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,030
"I like your smile.

209
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,020
When you smile, P'No, I find myself smiling as well.

210
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,840
I feel happy every time you smile at me."

211
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,350
Ew! P'No!

212
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,660
Who wrote these letters to you?! They're so cheesy!

213
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,310
Hey! Ai'Can!

214
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,240
Hey!

215
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,930
Are you keeping secrets from your dearest little bro, P'No?

216
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,900
Don't come any closer.

217
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,790
- Let me...
- Hey! Don't! Don't!

218
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,780
- Let me read it a bit!
- Don't come near.

219
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,269
If you come near, I'll seriously cut you from the first team.

220
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,680
P'No! Did you forget?

221
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,080
That you're not the soccer captain anymore?

222
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,160
Then I'll treat you to a meal! For a whole week! But you better not tell anyone!

223
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,740
Okay.

224
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,040
I won't tell!

225
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
I don't know or see anything at all.

226
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:23,605
I don't know that someone wrote a cheesy and incredibly cringy letter for you, P'No!

227
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,600
I don't know and I don't see anything!

228
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,140
Shit, they'd all find out then...

229
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,350
So…

230
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,290
But who wrote them for you, P'No?

231
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,820
Ai'Can,

232
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,883
food for the whole week.

233
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,250
So…

234
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,780
where's that IC kid of yours?

235
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,803
I haven't seen him for several days now.

236
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,850
Don't mention him.

237
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,080
I already miss him to death.

238
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,140
Ai'Tin flew out to England several days ago.

239
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,107
Dude, you really have no shame at all, huh?

240
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,250
Why?

241
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,180
I miss my boyfriend. I don't see how that's strange.

242
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,330
I'm off!

243
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,160
P' No! Don't forget to treat me to food, all right?!

244
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,550
Ai'Tin! When are you coming back?

245
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,520
Do you miss me or something?

246
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,930
Of course, I miss you!

247
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,330
Oh! I mean I miss the souvenirs that you're going to give me.

248
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,040
I heard that you bought a bunch of snacks for me, right?

249
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,670
Can.

250
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,490
Why are you making your voice sound like that?

251
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,340
When you come back I will kiss your left cheek, then your right,

252
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,100
and then I'll kiss you like 'muah!'

253
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,430
You don't miss me at all or anything?

254
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,290
Are you crazy?

255
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,740
We haven't seen each other for only a few days. How could you act so childish?

256
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,500
Are you that attached to me or something?

257
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,170
That's it for now. I have a headache.

258
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,280
Tin.

259
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,990
Ai'Tin!

260
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,522
How dare you hang up on me?!

261
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,110
Who'd have the guts to say that I miss him...

262
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,580
That's not cool at all.

263
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,000
Keep playing it cool and he'll get bored of you.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,610
A ghost!

265
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,470
What ghost? It's just me, Ley.

266
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,580
Ai'Ley.

267
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,400
You startled me! If you're going to come in, make some noise or something!

268
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Who's going to take responsibility if your older brother dies from a heart attack?

269
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,940
I already made some noise.

270
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,870
And Brother Can, you should be careful,

271
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,760
if P'Tin gets bored of you. I don't know anything.

272
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,030
There's no way.

273
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,610
Someone like me?

274
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,420
And another thing, Ai'Tin basically loves me to death.

275
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,280
Then be careful of dying.

276
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,570
I think I'm going to go.

277
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,180
I'm sick of someone who's full of himself.

278
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,920
Oh! And if one day P'Tin gets bored of you,

279
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,050
don't let me catch you crying.

280
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,120
"If one day P'Tin gets bored of you, don't let me catch you crying..."

281
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,590
I can see you, Brother Can!

282
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,490
Geez! How can she see me?

283
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,300
Does she have eyes at the back of her head?

284
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Or can she see through the door?

285
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,920
And Ai'Gucci is barking again.

286
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
When will you come back…

287
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,000
Hey, P'.

288
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,380
Take a listen.

289
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,160
Other than Ai'Keen and Ai'Knight, our friend in the band, I wanted you to hear it.

290
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,960
Actually, you don't really have to have me listen to it.

291
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,090
Come on. Either way, I got inspiration from you.

292
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:06,340
♫ No matter where you are ♫

293
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,930

♫ My heart knows oh-so-well ♫

300
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:31,457

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,890
♫ That I wouldn't change whenever I hear it... ♫

323
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:55,277
- How is it?
- Thank you so much.

324
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:56,887
Hey! What are you thanking me for?

325
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,510
Thanks for making me realize that I never loved him any less.

326
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,720
I only loved him more.

327
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,259
Then you have to come and hear it when we're on stage, all right?

328
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,230
I wouldn't miss it.

329
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,570
Thank you.

330
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,825
Or could Ai'Tin actually be angry at me?

331
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,950
Ai'Can.

332
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,000
Ai'Can! Hey! Hello?

333
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,950
Ai'Can!

334
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,240
What the fuck are you playing at?

335
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,820
What if I hit my head and become stupid? What would you do?

336
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,830
Geez! You can't get any stupider than this.

337
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,090
I'm telling you! You've already reached the limit for being stupid.

338
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,670
So what's with you?

339
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,870
Is your phone going to transform into Godzilla or something? You keep staring at it.

340
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,630
You're even stupider than me.

341
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,490
Did you watch too many movies?

342
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,640
How can a phone transform?

343
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,030
It's just that...

344
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,740
Ai'Tin hasn't called me for several days already.

345
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,300
Then just go ahead and call him.

346
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,170
I already called him.

347
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,380
But he didn't pick up.

348
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,800
Well, we all have things we have to do.

349
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,180
Also, isn't the IC on break now?

350
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,084
Could he be on holiday with his family?

351
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,160
You really don't know anything, huh?

352
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,820
I'm the stupid one for asking for your advice.

353
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,010
Next time, don't open your mouth and ask me for advice again.

354
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,570
Here. Take this.

355
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,370
I bought it for you.

356
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,230
I saw that you like to eat this.

357
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,560
Drink it so you don't feel so down.

358
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,244
You're really giving it to me?

359
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,090
Dad!! I noticed that you haven't eaten anything.

360
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,990
I brought a snack to share with you!

361
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,160
Dad! Why are you crying, Dad?

362
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,730
What's wrong, Dad?

363
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,800
Who hurt you?

364
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,850
Did P'Can insult you?

365
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,940
I'll be mad at P'Can! I'll be mad at Uncle Tin!

366
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,130
Whoever hurts Dad, I'll be mad at them!

367
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,250
Nong Phu, don't be angry at anyone. All right?

368
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,260
There's nothing wrong with Dad.

369
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,500
If anyone's in the wrong here, it's probably me.

370
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:23,590
No! My dad's not at fault!

371
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,680
My dad's the best in the world.

372
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,180
Dad loves you, Nong Phu.

373
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,340
I also love you the most, Dad!

374
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,260
Auntie Kin! Auntie Kin!

375
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,080
Is anyone home?

376
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,390
Where did everyone disappear to?

377
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,410
Good morning, Khun Tul.

378
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,960
Did you know? That during the time that all those years passed by,

379
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,956
it was like I was dead.

380
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,060
What did you have me live on for? What was I breathing for?

381
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,750
I suffered so much, Hin.

382
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,680
I suffered so much.

383
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,200
You're so cruel.

384
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,100
What did you have me live on for?

385
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,910
Why not just kill me?

386
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,200
Why did you leave me? Leaving me to live without you.

387
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,820
Why?

388
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:54,124
You're the air I breathe.

389
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,180
If I don't have you, I don't have the strength to breathe.

390
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,810
Don't leave me again.

391
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,130
I can't live if I don't have you.

392
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,100
I can't again...

393
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,320
I've told you before,

394
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,780
that even if you don't have anyone,

395
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:31,468
I'm the one who will always be by your side.

396
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,290
I love you, Ai'Hin.

397
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,070
I love you.

398
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,040
I love you, too.

399
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,280
Can, look where you're walking.

400
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,128
Just let him be.

401
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,976
He's lonely because his boyfriend isn't here.

402
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,660
How'd you know?

403
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,560
Ai'Can never told you.

404
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
How can I not know? Who am I?

405
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm Pond!

406
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,790
Ai'Ae,

407
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,900
do you think Ai'Tin is mad at me for something?

408
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,810
Well, what did you do to him?

409
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,740
I don't know either...

410
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,145
If you don't know, then set it aside for now.

411
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,380
Today's the university festival!

412
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,250
So, of course, we have to have fun! Let's go!

413
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,050
I probably won't have fun with you though.

414
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,480
Come on! Let's go listen to some nice songs.

415
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,250
Everyone! I got the inspiration for this song from a junior

416
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,260
who has an unwavering heart.

417
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,420
He confesses love to the same person every day,

418
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,560
even if they are not together.

419
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,550
So I hoped to write this song

420
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,220
to pass on the love to everyone.

421
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,870
I'd like to dedicate this song to everyone who's in love.

Where'd Champ and Ai'Type go?

434
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,464
Kla, let go of me.

435
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:23,772
I'll let go...

436

as soon as you take back what you forgot.

437
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,774
What did I forget?

438
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,770
What's this? I can't seem to understand anything.

439
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,660
A love letter.

There are a lot of people, so I'm damn hungry.

What's with that, dude? There are a lot of people so you're hungry?

It's related, all right?

Tar!

482
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,192
When did you get back?

483
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,122
Mom didn't tell me anything.

484
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:30,688
I'm the one who told Mom not to tell you.

485
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,420
I just wanted to surprise you a bit.

486
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,238
And I saw that you had a performance today!

487
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:38,542
I'm really surprised you know!

488
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,280
I know.

489
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,080
P'Tum!

490
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,430
What's up?

491
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,660
Are you happy right now?

492
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,540
Yeah, why?

493
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,440
That's good then.

494
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,690
I want you to be happy.

495
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,800
We both…

496
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,195
should move forward eventually, right?

497
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,890
That's right.

498
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,180
The past has already passed a long time ago. I should finally move forward.

499
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,820
Right? My beloved little brother.

500
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,800
And I'm also sensing

501
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,160
that someone's ready to go forward with you.

502
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,733
Over there.

503
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:40,210
Then... if you're done packing everything, let's go find something to eat.

504
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,510
I rushed over to see you.

505
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,100
- Thank you.
- Have I grown?

506
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,660
You've grown up a lot!

507
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,285
And now I know how to make desserts, too!

508
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:53,288
Do you want to try some? My macaron is very good.

509
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:54,495
I'll make some for you.

510
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,313
Sure.

511
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,950
Hurry and go pack up with your friends already.

512
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,080
Then I'll be right back.

513
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,440
Okay.

514
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,440
How's it going guys?

515
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,940
I missed you.

516
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,320
I missed you, too.

517
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,620
Don't disappear again.

518
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:37,020
Next time, just tell me directly that you miss me.

519
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:43,510
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

520
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,625
Don't leave my sight.

521
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,732
I'm just standing here to enjoy the breeze.

522
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,500
I haven't seen this garden in ages.

523
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:39,627
I won't go anywhere again.

524
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,636
I have to thank Ai'Tin then, right?

525
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,240
At least, I would like it if you could talk to Khun Tin.

526
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,830
Of course.

527
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,979
I'll do everything you tell me to.

528
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,434
But only after this...

529
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,113
After this?

530
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,007
After I've kissed you.

531
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,760

537
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,345
♫ I just realized how much I love you ♫

538
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:34,970
♫ I hope it's not too late ♫

539

♫ I won't hurt you again like yesterday ♫

543
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,345
What's with you?

544
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:08,958
Smiling while staring at my sleeping face.

545
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,812
Are you crazy?

546
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:18,420
You're so unromantic.

547
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,100
Why?

548
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,454
Do want us to kiss until the sun rises?

549
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:30,464
That sounds pretty interesting.

550
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,450
Dude.

551
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,589
I'd be embarassed to kiss you now.

552
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:49,120
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

553
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,074
My mouth is bitter.

554
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,243
Up to you then.

555
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,572
I'll quickly go shower and brush my teeth sparkly clean.

556
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:12,100
It won't be too late to kiss then.

557
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,140
I'll get going. I'll be back soon.

558
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:25,555
As a deposit.

Cantaloupe.

573
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,740
Do you remember what next week is?

574
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,830
Why do I have to remember?

575
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,820
What did I do wrong?

576
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,100
You forgot P'Tin's birthday?

577
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,380
I didn't know… Damn it!

578

This method will not cost you any money.

579
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,650
And you can do it, too.

Shit! Shit! Shit!

Can, what happened?

582
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,250
Ai'Tin.

583
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,490
What are you doing?

584
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,660
