Geez... Why are you so handsome?

Then next time, I'll tell Khun Can for you.

But today... if you need anything, Khun Phu, can you tell me?

82
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,090
No! I don't want to talk to you!
(T/N: The form of 'you' Phu is using is considered disrespectful for someone younger to use towards an elder)

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Why not?

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,450
Because I don't like you.

85
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,720
Why don't you like me, Khun Phu?

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Don't know. Don't want to think about it. Don't care.

Khu Phu.

88

Stop nagging me! I already said that I don't want to talk to you!

89
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,680
Nong Phu! You're speaking very rudely.

Yay! Dad is back!

91
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,110
Dad is back.

92
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,820
But someone said that you were misbehaving.

93
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,720
I wasn't misbehaving...

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,950
Then, why didn't you call Hin "Uncle Hin"?

95
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,700
How could you call him "you"?

96
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,630
But Grandma said I could call people in this house whatever I wanted though.

97
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,140
But I've never taught you to speak impolitely with your elders.

98
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,660
Nong Phu, you even call Grandma Glin as "Grandma Glin."

99
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,640
Hmm, again.

100
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,550
What again?

101
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,660
Dad, you're siding with Uncle Hin again.

102
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,420
Dad, you don't love me anymore.

103
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,610
I don't like Uncle Hin, because you love Uncle Hin.

104
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
Dad, you have to love me, all right?

105
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,210
Please don't love Uncle Hin.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
Khun Phu.

107
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,790
Your dad loves you a lot.

108
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,680
He loves you more than anyone else.

109
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,990
He loves you the most in the whole world.

110
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,490
And not only your dad, Khun Phu.

111
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,380
Everyone in this house loves you alot, Khun Phu.

112
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,420
You too, Uncle Hin?

113
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,510
That's right. I also love you a lot, Khun Phu.

114
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,390
Dad, I'm sleepy now.

115
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,710
You stubborn child.

116
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,210
I'm going to take my son up to sleep, all right?

117
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,205
Come. Let's get you to bed.

118
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,040
Is Khun Phu already asleep?

119
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,420
Hey. I told you so many times already, didn't I? It's enough to just call him "Nong Phu,"

120
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,910
But Khun Phu doesn't like me.

121
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,340
Nong Phu doesn't like anyone who's close to his mom or dad.

122
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,930
But I believe that one day

123
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,350
he'll realize that this person, is the most important person in his dad's life.

124
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,450
The more you say such things,

125
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,710
Khun Phupha will feel more unhappy.

126
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,500
How many years did it take

127
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,240
before I was able to admit that I love you?

128
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,890
20 years.

129
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,380
Although my son and I don't easily accept other people's love,

130
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,994
but if we love them, we'll give them all of our heart.

131
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,160
Wait.

132
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,220
Khun Tul, you have some documents you need to read through before you go into tomorrow's meeting.

133
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,940
It's way past office hours, Mr. Secretary.

134
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,120
This time needs to be used for other things.

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,010
But the documents...

136
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,790
Geez! Khun Tul!

137
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,070
Here, here. You have to hold it like this. Like C.

138
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,350
- Right here?
- That's right.

139
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,220
Okay, like that.

140
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,820
Another one. Bring it down. Yeah.

141
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,980
Got it?

142
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,650
What are you guys doing?

143
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,220
You guys are sitting that close?

144
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,260
How's this close?

145
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,600
- Then I'm going to head off first.
- Huh?

146
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,210
- Leaving already?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,700
I happen to have soccer practice with some friends.

148
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,130
Oh! Okay, okay.

149
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,980
- Then I'll see you later.
- Yeah okay.

150
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,450
- Bye.
- See ya.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Was he here a long time?

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah, he came...

153
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,190
for just about an hour.

154
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,240
Are... you all right, dude? Why do you look so irritated?

155
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,620
Is it about Tar?

156
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
No.

157
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,540
It doesn't have anything to do with Tar.

158
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,940
What?

159
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,810
It's about you though.

160
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,720
What? Me?

161
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
It's nothing, forget it.

162
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,570
Tell me!

163
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,850
Tell me. Please?

164
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,440
What's wrong?

165
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,110
It's nothing.

166
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,630
Forget about it.

167
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,660
Okay, okay.

168
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,500
Next week… What day is it?

169
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,361
The day mom makes Chicken Rice?

170
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,930
But Ai'Tin doesn't like Chicken Rice…

171
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,980
Ahhh! My head hurts! I can't figure it out.

172
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,740
What day is it?

173
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,822
Ai'Can.

174
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,820
Ai'Can!

175
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,540
P'No! What's with you?!

176
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,240
If I had a heart attack, would you be able to take responsibility?

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,625
Wouldn't that be great? Then our world would have one less crazy person.

178
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:11,480
Crazy… Stupid… Let me seriously ask you... Do you even love me at all?

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,660
Do I have to love you?

180
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,890
Whatever. I don't want to repeat and play along with this nonsense anymore.

181
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,091
But what about you, P'No. You graduated ages ago.

182
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,300
What are you doing here?

183
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,718
Let me seriously ask you... Do you not have any work to do?

184
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,250
Ouch!

185
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,140
Of course, I have work.

186
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,100
But I just stopped by to see the coach is all.

187
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,460
I just happened to see you.

188
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,320
So what's wrong?

189
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,530
Well, it's Ai'Tin…

190
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,140
He's mad at me for something, and I don't even know why.

191
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,700
You're asking me, but would I even know?

192
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,860
I knew it.

193
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,130
Asking you is such a waste of time.

194
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,360
Even asking Ai'Ae would be more helpful.

195
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,370
Such a waste of time.

196
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,740
Hey, Ai'Can!

197
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,490
Hey! Come back here first!

198
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,070
Do you not see me as your older bro?

199
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,000
Ai'Can!

200
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,880
Who the hell is texting me on Line? I'm annoyed as it is.

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,880
P'No!

202
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,670
Have you finished talking to the coach already?

203
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,450
Yeah, I'm done talking already.

204
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,570
But really, you didn't have to come and pick me up.

205
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,130
P'No. I really wanted to come and pick you up though.

206
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,300
Please let me pick you up.

207
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,009
Okay, fine.

208
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:50,230
You can pick me up.

209
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,799
Really?

210
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,480
That's too close, Ai'Kla. Too close...

211
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,451
Step back a bit.

212
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,180
It's because I'm letting you make up for your mistakes.

213
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,470
But you have to promise that from now on that

214
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,530
you won't lie to me again.

215
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,320
I promise, P'No! I promise!

216
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,020
Hand... Your hand, Ai'Kla. Your hand...

217
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,380
Well... you're so cute though...

218
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm not talking to you anymore.

219
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,080
Hey.

220
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,965
Didn't you say you were going to send me off?

221
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,654
Hurry up then!

222
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm coming right now!

223
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,122
Khun Phu, would you like to eat some ice cream?

224
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:10,495
I don't want any. I don't want to eat it.

225
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,140
You still can't get Phupa to warm up to you yet?

226
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,530
Uncle Tin!

227
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,220
Even though you came back and immediately received the position of being my older brother's secretary.

228
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,590
You completed every project.

229
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,260
But with such a small child like this,

230
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,799
you still can't win him over?

231
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,360
And what about you? What's the matter?

232
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,140
I'm mad at Dad.

233
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,880
Why?

234
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,980
Dad doesn't listen to anything I say.

235
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,050
Then...

236
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,840
Can you tell Uncle Tin?

237
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,710
I want to go to the beach!

238
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,490
You want to go with your dad, just the two of you?

239
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,940
I want to go with dad, go with Uncle Tin, and go with P'Can!

240
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,440
Go with everyone!

241
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,130
What about Uncle Hin then?

242
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,520
Fine, Uncle Hin can come, too.

243
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,010
Really?

244
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,100
Who's talking to you, Uncle Hin?

245
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,430
I'm going to go eat some ice cream!

246
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,545
He's just a kid being haughty.

247
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,378
Isn't it because all the men in the Methanan family are like that?

248
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,680
My mom wanted me to ask you...

249
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,570
for your birthday next week,

250
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,182
would you like to eat anything special, Khun Tin?

251
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,110
I probably want to devour the guy who forgot my birthday.

252
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,193
Forget it.

253
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm going to go take a shower. I have to go talk to my dad, too.

254
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,600
He's definitely a man of the Methanan family.

255
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,910
You forgot P'Tin's birthday?

256
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,310
Ai' Brother Can!

257
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,350
You pea-brain!

258
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,985
How could you forget P'Tin's birthday?

259
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:44,658
And you even had to ask me!

260
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,410
Lay, so how did you remember Ai'Tin's birthday?

261
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,920
That's because I have a stupid older brother that's like this.

262
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,670
If I didn't remember, you'd get dumped!

263
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,960
I still want a handsome older brother like P'Tin.

264
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,140
So, what are you going to do?

265
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,930
I don't even know... damn it!

266
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,372
You gotta help your older brother, all right?

267
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,890
Please, please, please!

268
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,550
Otherwise, your big brother is going to die for sure!

269
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,180
All this shaking is gonna make my brain fall out and make me stupid like you!

270
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,740
Ai'Lay...

271
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,950
Look... I really have no idea what P'Tin sees in you.

272
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,300
On your birthday,

273
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,260
P'Tin had a big bouquet and took you out for a really luxurious dinner.

274
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,560
And he even gave you a present in a huge box, too!

275
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,550
Oh! And not to mention the condo he bought to stay with you.

276
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,350
But you're always running away and coming back home instead.

277
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,400
Thinking about it is so frustrating.

278
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,340
For this...you're on your own.

279
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,540
No, you can't! You gotta help your big brother, please! I'll do anything!

280
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,910
Anything, for real?

281
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,560
Yeah.

282
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,620
Then... you have to start by taking P'Tin out to dinner.

283
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,669
You know what he eats.

284
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:58,869
There's no way I can afford that.

285
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,465
Buy something that P'Tin likes. Like... a watch or cologne.

286
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:06,100
The stuff that he uses costs more than the snack money mom gives me for the whole month.

287
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,583
Then figure it out on your own then!

288
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,290
You can't! You gotta help your big brother. Please, please, please?

289
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,050
Fine.

290
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,512
There's still... one method left.

291
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,210
But…

292
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,420
I don't have any money though...

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
I know that already.

294
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,243
This method won't cost you a single baht.

295
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,920
And it's something that you can do, too.

296
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,594
You're gettin' it!

297
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,730
[Ai'Tin, don't hurry back yet.]

298
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,872
[Why?]

299
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,810
[Come on. I just need an hour.]

300
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,424
Fire! Fire! Shit! Shit! Shit!

301
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:26,470
Shit! Shit! Shit!

302
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,556
Can, what happened?

303
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,910
Ai'Tin...

304
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,684
How'd you get back here?

305
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,520
What are you looking at?

306
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,150
I'm feeling embarrassed you know...

307
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,622
What's this smell?

308
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,710
Um…

309
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,135
Dinner...

310
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,011
What are you doing?

311
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,526
It's my birthday.

312
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,313
So I'm going to unwrap my present, of course.

313
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,780
Wait a minute.

314
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,020
Wait for what?

315
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,630
Well...

316
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,070
Don't you want to eat dinner first?

317
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,670
Or shower first?

318
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,760
Or…

319
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,171
do you want to eat me first?

320
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,330
Well, Ai'Lay said...

321
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,920
Ai'Lay said that you'd like it if I did this.

322
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,929
Then I'll take my time

323
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:08,336

P'No ditched me.

00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,700
He said we were going to go eat, but geez...

454
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,781
He took off already.

455
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:15,780

Hey. It's this show!

460
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,130
Yeah, they're about to announce it already.

461
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,170
And the contestant who'll pass onto the next round is...

462
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,260
B06! Alex Good!

463
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,430
What the hell?

464
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,630
What a damn cheat! This show must be rigged.

465
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,260
B02 sings so much better.

466
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,975
That kid clearly has some backing.

467
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,170
Man, I even voted so much for B02. How'd he lose?

468
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,450
Geez!

469
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,679
I don't want to watch it anymore.

470
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:00,540
What are you doing here?

471
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,650
Oh, Ai'Tin...

472
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,250
I'm his friend...

473
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,260
It just happened... that Ai'Job got stood up by P'No.

474
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,550
So I let him come keep me company.

475
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,370
So what were you making a fuss about?

476
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,060
Well, it's this show! They're so cheating!

477
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,400
The guy we voted for sings so much better. We even voted. But I don't know how he lost!

478
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880
The other guy doesn't even seem to sing that well.

479
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,190
Even we sing better.

480
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,320
Is that so?

481
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,361
Yeah.

482
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:31,225
You're that into it?

483
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,293
So you know how to sing?

484
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,430
Ai'Tin, we know how to sing.

485
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,140
Better than this guy for sure!

486
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,390
If you don't believe it, then listen!

487
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,875
Ai'Job, turn on the music.

488
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,060
Mic ready.

489
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,090
Music coming.

So how was it, dude? Was it good?

511
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,736
At this level, we don't need to watch this show anymore.

512
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:18,640
- Let's go Let's make our debut.
- Form a band!

513
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,020
The three of us. Ai'Tin, you want to join?

514
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,018
Yeah, sure.

515
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,990
Wooohh!

516
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,390
My dear sea! Pond is finally here!

517
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,450
Wooh! The sea has to go with alcohol!

518
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,340
My dear alcohol! Mind is finally here!

519
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,920
What the hell is with you? We come to the ocean and the first thing you think of is alcohol??

520
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,990
Or are you not going to drink?

521
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,060
Of course, I'll drink!

522
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,950
That's the spirit!

523
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,890
I'll drink till the ocean dries up!

524
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,564
I'll drink till I can float in the ocean!

525
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:47,355
I'll drink till I drown and you rescue me!

526
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:49,315
I'll drink till... you just die in the ocean!

527
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:51,805
Okay, then we'll both die together.

528
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,529
Oh, man.

529
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:56,520
- This is great!
- I'm so happy.

530
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,480
It's so pretty!

531
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,200
Ai'Tin, are you done yet? I want to go play in the water already.

532
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,160
Can you be patient, Can?

533
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,700
Dude! But we're at the beach!

534
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,420
Cantaloupe.

535
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,760
You need to start looking after yourself.

536
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,970
When you come to the beach, you have to start using sunscreen.

537
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,110
It's not just about looks.

538
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,940
You have to also start looking after your health.

539
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,140
Understand?

540
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,820
Yeah.

541
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,880
Done. Go on.

542
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,720
No, no, no, no, no.

543
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,651
I won't fall for your sexiness.

544
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:56,554
I'm going to play in the water!

545
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:59,384
What are you talking about?

546
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,483
Go on already.

547
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,210
I'm just waiting for...

548
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,700
Hey!

549
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,910
It dried so damn fast! It's not sticky either!

550
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,420
I only choose the best for you.

551
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,760
Come. I'll put it on for you.

552
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,550
Ai'Tin...

553
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,074
Why is your heart beating this fast?

554
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,800
During the times that I'm with you,

555
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,920
my heart is always beating fast.

556
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

557
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,610
Me too.

558
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,390
What's this?

559
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,270
Oh! It's a sandcastle! I built it myself.

560
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,200
Good job.

561
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,265
Stay with Uncle Hin first. Dad will be right back.

562
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:25,813
Okay.

563
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,620
Uncle Hin?

564
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,780
Yes, Khun Phupha?

565
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,250
Uncle Hin, don't steal away my dad.

566
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,010
Then... what if I ask to stay and serve Khun Tul and you instead? Is that all right?

567
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,150
What's serve?

568
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,900
Well... It means that I'll stay and take care of you.

569
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,370
Only taking care of us, right?

570
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,570
Then... can I stay with Khun Tul and you, Khun Phupha?

571
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,650
Why?

572
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,030
So that I can stay and take care of you.

573
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,160
Let me think about it first.

574
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,010
Khun Phupha?

575
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,320
Don't interrupt. I'm thinking!

576
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,920
I know how to make desserts too, you know.

577
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,020
I can also stay and play with you too, Khun Phupha.

578
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,420
I can stay and protect you too, Khun Phupha.

579
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,052
Can you hit P'Can then?

580
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,910
Yes?

581
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,750
Can you hit and hurt P'Can then?

582
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,340
P'Can likes to tease me!

583
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,993
If I hit him, then it'll hurt.

584
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,590
Then fine. I'll let you stay with us, Uncle Hin.

585
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,800
But you have to hit P'Can really, really hard! All right?

586
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,260
What are you guys talking about?

587
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,410
Dad! Uncle Hin said he'll stay with me!

588
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,670
That's right. We'll stay together. All right?

589
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,500
Dad! It's stuffy! I'm hot!

590
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,160
Ai'Tin!

591
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,250
Peel the shrimp for me.

592
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,060
Peel it yourself.

593
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,550
I'm tired you know! I just fought with Nong Phu.

594
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,620
What kind of kid is he? The more he grows, the more precocious he gets.

595
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,575
Both you and your brother always let him do whatever he wants.

596
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,670
If it weren't for me, he'd grow up to be a self-centered kid for sure!

597
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,030
So you better peel the shrimp for me.

598
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,943
So what? I'm not tired at all?

599
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,345
I just got back from business in the U.S.

600
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,480
That's true...

601
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,117
Lately, you've probably been tired.

602
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,144
And lately, P'Tul also likes to leave Nong Phu under your care, too.

603
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:24,569
It's a good thing P'Hin is nice, unlike your older brother.

604
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:27,521
I can still consider him as an older brother.
(T/N: Basically treat/see him with respect and likeability)

605
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,520
But you're probably so tired.

606
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,080
With both studying and working.

607
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,160
You should find time to rest.

608
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,269
But once you're about to rest, your older brother ends up coming along, too.

609
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:41,980
What kind of person is so shameless...

610
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,160
But didn't your friends also come here?

611
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,629
Well, I accidentally let it slip...

612
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:50,800
No, no! Let's stop talking about friends already!

613
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,270
Let's eat. Here, I'll feed you.

614
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,860
Here.

615
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,880
Is it good?

616
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:05,892
Yeah.

617
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:08,426
If it's good, then you have to eat a lot!

618
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:11,140
Because tonight, I'll take away all your exhaustion myself.

619
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,590
Okay?

620
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,500
Can you do it now?

621
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,370
You want me to?

622
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,940
I love you.

623
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,680
I love you, too.

624
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,860
Is it good?

625
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,931
We promised we'd come here together.

626
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,868
We still haven't fulfilled that promise yet.

627

♫ I accidentally fall in love with you ♫

645
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:58,620
♫ I accidentally fall in love with you ♫

646
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:03,240
♫ What am I supposed to do with my feelings? ♫

647
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,020
♫ Should I let go of my feelings? ♫

648
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,860
♫ And let my heart lead the way ♫

649
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,320
♫ Whatever happens, happens for the best ♫

650
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,600
♫ Whether it's an accident or intentional ♫

651
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,800
♫ It happens for the good ♫

652
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,240
♫ Whether you speak it out loud ♫

653
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,640
♫ or express your feeling through your eyes ♫

654
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,000
♫ It's still love no matter what ♫

655
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,240
♫ It might be a coincidence, or it might be luck ♫

656
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,400
♫ Should I step forward, or should I give up? ♫

657
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,580
♫ But I already love you so I'll go for it ♫

658
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:40,020
♫ I accidentally fall in love with you ♫

659
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,960
♫ I accidentally fall in love with you ♫

660
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,560
♫ What am I supposed to do with my feelings? ♫

661
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,240
♫ Should I let go of my feelings? ♫

662
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,900
♫ And let my heart lead the way ♫

663
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,760
♫ Whatever happens, let it happen ♫

664
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,880
