1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,180
Dude, I don't know what fucking problem he has with Ai'Pete,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,160
But Pete isn't going to come and check on him for a bit?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,620
They used to love each other so much.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,280
Just now, what did you say?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,500
I had said you're just an unloved child.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,120
Why didn't you go to the banquet with Mom today?

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,920
So now she goes as far as to call and tattle to her favorite son?

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,920
It's you. You're the son that she loves most.

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,180
Don't even make me laugh.

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,900
Rather, it's because you weren't free today. That's why I was called instead.

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,040
You're overthinking.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
How could Mother love a stepson like me

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,180
as much as you, the son from her own stomach.

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,020
If you want to act as father, mother, and son... Do it elsewhere.
(T/N: Basically, "Pretend being a perfect family somewhere else.")

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,760
Hearing it makes me want to puke.

16
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,400
You're always like this.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,260
You should place some more importance on your family sometimes.

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,740
Just do whatever you want.

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,480
Someday I will tear off your mask.

20
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,340
Then that day probably won't come.

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,880
That day probably won't come.

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,900

24

He's not disgusting…

25
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,850
but he called me an unloved child, didn't he?

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,510
P'Can!

50
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,050
P'Can.

51
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,290
What's wrong?

52
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,730
- P'Can!
- I didn't! I didn't kiss!

53
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,830
What's wrong?

54
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,810
Nothing. There's nothing wrong... at all.

55
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,310
I'm eating, of course.

56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,190
Are you sure?

57
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,010
Sure. I'm just eating, right now, of course.

58
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,410
You're sure?

59
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,090
Sure. Okay.

60
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,630
All right, students. Today's lesson should be enough for you to understand somewhat, right?

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,310
Today, we've...

62
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,690
What I wrote on the board...

63
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,610
Could you please wake up your friend?

64
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,710
If he's going to sleep then don't disturb the lesson.

65
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,270
Can!

66
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,750
- Ai'Can!
- I didn't! I didn't kiss!

67
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,290
It seems like you really miss your girlfriend, huh?

68
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,790
Do you want to drop the class and just go stay with your girlfriend then?

69
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,030
I… I don't have any girlfriend, Professor.

70
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,130
And... I won't drop the class, Ma'am.

71
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,110
All right then. Let's continue the class, all right?

72
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,570
Are you serious? Can was daydreaming and yelling in the middle of class?

73
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,670
You're amazing, Ai'Can.

74
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,570
I'm serious. Today, for the whole day, too. He just suddenly yelled in class.

75
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,550
Although he's always yelling and annoying every day,

76
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,730
but today he's even worse than usual.

77
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,950
I think he's gone crazy

78
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,450
I'm not crazy!

79
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,410
Last night, I just didn't get to sleep much.

80
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,310
Then what were you doing that you couldn't sleep?

81
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,590
Bro, we've all got things on our mind.

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,980
Someone like you, Ai'Can?

83
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,770
Apart from eating and talking too much,

84
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,450
I don't think that your brain ever really gets used.

85
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,670
So, what were you thinking about? Tell me. I'll help you think about it.

86
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,130
Yeah. If there's something, then tell us.

87
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,130
Maybe we can help.

88
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,690
Why would I tell you guys? I'm not telling!

89
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,690
That's not it. Hey, Ai'Can!

90
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,910
Geez.

91
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,130
I still don't know who he ended up kissing. Making him sleep talk and causing a scene.

92
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,050
Exactly, Bro.

93
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,250
Who would want someone like Ai'Can?

94
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,790
Geez, even someone with a face like Ai'No

95
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,890
Is someone looking to stab that ass?

96
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,670
Someone might like Can, too.

97
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,830
Even though he's talkative,

98
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,990
but also…

99
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,590
Even his own big bro can't even think of any good points for Ai'can.

100
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,390
Wait, Bro. What was that?

101
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,230
Who's looking to tap P'No's ass?

102
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,190
Why should I tell you?

103
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,510
You again?

104
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,190
Last time, you did something shitty to me that we still haven't cleared up yet!

105
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,890
Do you know what a mess my life has been?

106
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,330
My little sister scolded me.

107
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,890
The professor told me to drop out.

108
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,970
My friends were also laughing at me, too.

109
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,490
And what if you came...

110
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,770
to kiss me again?

111
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,550
Where's the guy named Ae?

112
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,550
You're Ae's friend?

113
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,270
Not at all.

114
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,830
Oh...

115
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,790
There's no need for me to be friends with Thai Program kids like that.

116
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,410
Hey! Are you here looking to pick a fight with Ai'Ae?

117
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,830
If you're here to pick a fight, then I can punch you in the mouth first!

118
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,350
Forget it.

119
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,590
You guys are probably all pathetic.

120
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,590
I don't like it when people insult my friends.

121
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,230
If you're going to call me stupid, annoying, dirty then go ahead and insult me.

122
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,490
But you have no right to insult my friend!

123
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,830
And what's your problem? Why do you like to act like you're against the world?

124
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,070
Did someone do something to you?

125
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,890
Or was the world so against you? Is that why you're like this?

126
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,970
I might be just like you said.

127
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,490
I said so many things. Which one are you like then?

128
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,930
An unloved child.

129
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,370
Are you crazy?

130
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,650
Do you want to die?

131
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,830
Or are you stupid to not know that you're not supposed to cut off other people's cars?

132
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,650
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,190
For what?

134
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,730
Please, I'm sorry. All right?

135
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,070
I know that I just met you.

136
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,910
I shouldn't have called you an unloved child. I'm sorry, all right?

137
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,530
Please, please, please? Forgive me, please?

138
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,690
But you're the one with an offensive mouth. That is dogmouthed.

139
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,630
But I'm not saying that you're wrong.

140
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,730
I was the one at fault. Don't be mad at me anymore, please?

141
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,070
Or else, I won't be able to sleep tonight for sure. I'll have a nightmare for sure.

142
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,930
I don't want to hurt other people's feelings.

143
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,590
Please?

144
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,170
Let's make up.

145
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,070
What the heck are you doing?

146
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,510
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

147
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,510
♫  I don't know what this feeling is ♫

148
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,910

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,310
You scared the crap out of me. You psycho.

155

Uncle Tin, why did you just come back?

156
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,530
I waited for you for such a long time. I missed you.

Uncle missed you, too.

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,290
Are you by yourself?

159
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,110
Yes. Dad isn't here. He's working.

160
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,630
Mom went out to see grandmother

161
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,090
I'm lonely. I'm all by myself.

162
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,010
Khun Phupha, here you are.

163
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,630
Next time, don't run and rush out like that.

164
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,950
Auntie is old already you know. I cannot keep up running after you.

165
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,610
Then don't follow me then. I never even told you to follow me.

166
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,270
What does "rush out" mean, Uncle Tin?

167
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,810
"Rush out" is the thing that you were doing, Phupha.

168
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,730
No one's here?

169
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,830
No one has come back yet.

170
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,530
It seems that Khun Vadee said that she will go to the other house first,

171
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,910
so she left Phupha with me.

172
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,890
I got left again.

173
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,890
Don't say that, Khun Phupha.

174
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,970
Come. Why don't you go with Auntie, all right?

175
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,250
I don't want to. I want to stay with Uncle Tin.

176
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,570
Okay. Then I'll look after Phupha myself, all right?

177
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,630
Okay.

178
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,450
Thank you so much.

179
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,230
Let's go. Let's go sit and play.

180
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,470
Uncle Tin, did you know? Going on a trip with Mom wasn't fun at all.

181
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,530
I wanted to come back home, I missed Dad.

182
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,230
I missed you, too, Uncle Tin.

183
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,170
And it was cold.

184
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,710
Why?

185
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,670
You don't have any friends?

186
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,490
No. I don't want any friends at all.

187
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,170
I just want Dad to come and have fun with me

188
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,950
Nong'Phu, are you lonely?

189
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,730
And are you lonely, Uncle Tin?

190
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,490
So should I be lonely?

191
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,970
Of course, you should be lonely. If I'm not here, then you have to think of me, Uncle Tin. All right?

192
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,510
My hair is messy now.

193
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,410
Really?

194
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,410
When will Dad come back home?

195
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,030
Why?

196
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,450
Because I miss Dad.

197
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,110
Nong'Phu, do you love your dad a lot?

198
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,310
Mhm, I love Dad so much!

199
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,590
I love him this much.

200
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,130
I love Dad so much. I like my name, too.

201
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,310
Because Phupha means...

202
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,490
"Dad's love for a certain someone."

203
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,900
"It's strong and eternal like a mountain." (Phupha)

204
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,560
Dad!

205
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,820
Dad! I missed you so much!

206
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,040
Dad missed you, too.

207
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,850
Thanks, Tin.

208
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,650
For what?

209
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,430
Taking care of my love.

210
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,460
- Have you eaten yet?
- I already did.

211
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,780
Why am I thinking of him?
(T/N: Can also means "Why do I miss him?")

212
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,670
I know now how he's like.

213
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,910
He's like a 5-year-old kid.

214
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,130
Hello.

215
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,990
I have something for you to investigate for me.

216
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,170
Ai'Ae! That's enough already!

217
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,890
Are you going to keep drinking alcohol until you die?

218
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,650
I'll drink until I fucking die. I think that's great!

219
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,150
Even if you act like this, Ai'Pete wouldn't be happy!

220
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,150
He's not fucking with me.

221
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,950
He's not fucking with me, don't you hear me?

222
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,870
He's not fucking with me anymore.

223
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,910
- I told you to stop already.
- Leave me alone.

224
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,670
Damn it.

225
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,930
What should I do?

226
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,690
Hey, Mai! Over here!

227
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,450
What's up, Dude?

228
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,030
Can you help me stop him?

229
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,210
I can't stop him anymore.

230
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,950
Hey!

231
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,710
What's with this fucking shorty?

232
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,610
He's been taking in alcohol instead of food and water for who knows how many days now...

233
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,190
Normally, he never even drinks alcohol.

234
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,710
He takes care of his health to death.

235
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,870
And now look at the state he's in.

236
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,210
All you do is lecture him. Do you think he will listen?

237
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,490
With him being this drunk.

238
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,890
What do you want me to do then?

239
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,790
What the fuck, you asshole!

240
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,830
Come here, shorty!

241
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,290
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come with me.

242
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,890
- Let me go.
- Mai! Hey!

243
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,270
Come here!

244
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,850
Get the ball for me, Pond.

245
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,450
I said to go get it.

246
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,670
Fine. Keep your eyes on him, too.

247
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,290
Don't fight with him. He's no longer in his right mind.

248
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,820
Yeah.

249
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,870
My friend...

250
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,790
He's no better than a dog.

251
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,030
Just leave me alone, asshole.

252
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,050
I wouldn't even want to bother with you.

253
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,250
If you weren't my friend!

254
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,150
Give it here.

255
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,390
- What the hell are you going to do?
- Watch.

256
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,230
Hey! Hey! Hey!

257
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,650
Ai'Mai, don't. Mai!

258
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,050
Don't you like it? Playing soccer?

259
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,426
Come play soccer that you love so much then!

260
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,360
What the fuck is this?

261
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,613
Just how far down are you going to keep falling, Ai'Shorty?!

262
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:52,580
You're not someone who just gives up like this!

263
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,835
I think that if you keep on being a loser like this,

264
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:01,833
do you think your boyfriend would want to come back to you? Would he like it?

265
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,538
Answer me!

266
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:15,258
My friend named Ai'Ae, wouldn't keep being weak!

267
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,066
Get up! Get up!

268
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,537
Your boyfriend left because it was to help you!

269
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:27,654
You can't keep destroying your life like this!

270
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,889
Do you think that he'd like this, huh?!

271
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,213
I don't fucking know anything.

272
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,980
I don't know what to do.

273
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,290
I don't fucking know anything anymore.

274
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,195
Bastard friend!

275
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:53,305
If you ever sober up, you're so dead.

276
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:59,900
♫ I still hope and wait for the lonely nights to pass  ♫

277
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,170
Stop being like this already. We can't bear seeing you like this anymore.

278
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:11,117
♫ It might take a lot of time that all
the stars fall down from the sky  ♫

279
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:17,555
♫ I still have hope even I know that it's hopeless ♫

280
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:27,833
♫ I've been hopelessly wishing for the impossible.
I'm asking just for once  ♫

281
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,950
♫ Just for once ♫

282
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:45,135
Oh! Shit! What happened?

283
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,880
Shorty! You dared to kick me off of the bed?

284
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,817
Why wouldn't I?

285
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,879
And how did you end up sleeping on my bed?

286
00:22:56,879 --> 00:23:01,366
Well, last night, it's because the two of you wouldn't stop hugging each other.

287
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,464
That's right.

288
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:08,972
Last night you... just hugged me so tightly

289
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,502
Fuck! Did lightening strike?!

290
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:14,596
How did you get here?

291
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:19,100
That dude, your wife called me to come.

292
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,174
That fucker isn't my wife.

293
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:24,724
Where's your wife then?

294
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:32,122
Ai'Mai, I called you over to help him,

295
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,609
not to add insult to injury.

296
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:41,388
If Pond hadn't threatened me to come, he was going to tell Dear to come instead.

297
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,541
I wouldn't have come you know.

298
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,732
I didn't ask you guys to help.

299
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:53,189
Ai'Shorty, you should talk nicely.

300
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,153
I told you already that I didn't ask you guys for help.

301
00:23:56,153 --> 00:24:01,362
Geez. You guys, calm down. We're friends.

302
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,388
Ae...

303
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:08,206
What did you say friends are for, huh?

304
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:23,843
You like to help other people so much, right?

305
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:27,420
But could you turn around and care about us for once?

306
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,905
Just how worried we are about you?

307
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,427
Just look at Ai'Pond. He's so freaking worried to death.

308
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,510
Or even our group of friends?

309
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,353
We know that you're suffering to death.

310
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:45,419
But even then, you never think of them.

311
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,246
How would they feel, huh?

312
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,609
We're all very worried about you, you know.

313
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,843
Shorty,

314
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:07,783
I'm not telling you to stop feeling sad.

315
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:10,270
But please turn around and rely on us sometimes.

316
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:12,546
Understand?

317
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:22,429
And the thing I'm most annoyed about,

318
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:26,355
is that you didn't invite me to drink with you!

319
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,173
Damn it, what a waste!

320
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:30,644
What a waste!

321
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:33,119
Not asking me to drink with you.

322
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,217
How could you do that?

323
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,750
You're always like this, asshole.

324
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,550
Just trying to heal your heart and without me!

325
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,892
Lightning strikes (Damn you).

326
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:52,117
I still can't believe that you would kick the ball at Ai'Ae like that!

327
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,668
Since he loves soccer that much, you have to use a soccer ball to wake him up.

328
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,946
Do you think… he'll be able to think now?

329
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:02,893
I don't know.

330
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:06,032
Huh? I called you to help him though!

331
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,563
I don't know.

332
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:09,574
My job was to drag him out of the bar.

333
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:11,726
Letting him drink alcohol would be a waste.

334
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:14,573
He doesn't know the pleasure of drinking.

335
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,797
Obviously, who would be such a drunkard like you?

336
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,891
Normally, he's the one that drags you out of the bar, right?

337
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:21,972
So this time you were taking revenge!

338
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:26,096
Don't think that I don't know. Who am I? Ai'Pond, of course!

339
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:24,208
Hey! Hey! You missed. You missed. Come on. Come on.

340
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:27,736
P'Can! P'Can.

341
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,359
What? Don't bother me yet. I'll die.

342
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:34,801
Go out with me.

343
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:38,134
I don't want to go. I'm lazy

344
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:42,575
I'm going to buy stuff. Can you come and help me carry some stuff, please?

345
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,175
Don't want to. I'm not going.

346
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:46,569
I finally don't have any classes for once.

347
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:47,992
I'm too lazy to go right now.

348
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:49,974
Are you coming or not?

349
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:52,850
I'm not going.

350
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,331
Fine!

351
00:27:55,331 --> 00:28:00,262
Then I'll tell Mom where you hide the porn magazines.

352
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,197
On the bookshelf, second row.

353
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:06,470
Inside your textbook.

354
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,024
Mommy!

355
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,357
Okay, okay. My dearest little sister.

356
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,171
Calm down first, all right?

357
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,306
Where do you want to go? This older brother will take you!

358
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:21,452
Come on.

359
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:30,425
Oh, Ley. Do you know what you're going to buy yet?

360
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:38,566
What?

361
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,121
I can't with this, Brother.

362
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:45,041
What's with you? What is it that you can't?

363
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,794
Well, you have a really obvious pimple. Did you not notice it yourself?

364
00:28:50,803 --> 00:28:52,851
What are you doing?

365
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:55,384
I'm just going to cover it a bit so you can look more human-like like everyone else.

366
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,582
I don't want to!

367
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:02,785
Even though I'm stupid, even I know that when you have a pimple, you shouldn't put makeup on it.

368
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,788
You're seriously stupid.

369
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:11,870
This one isn't just to conceal pimples, but it's also to help reduce pimples, too.

370
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,035
Like this. Apply just a little bit.

371
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,535
It looks really smooth/flawless.

372
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,594
Then... can I have it?

373
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,217
Let's say it's my reward for helping you carry stuff all day.

374
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,487
I'm off.

375
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:34,362
It's mine! I use it on my pimples, too!

376
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:36,426
Brother Can!

377
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,531
This one! I want this! I want this!

378
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:57,486
- Let's go.
- Pay!

379
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:02,353
Let's go.

380
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,165
Give me your hand, please.

381
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,809
This one also seems fun to play!

382
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:36,023
Hey! This one also seems fun! This one seems fun, too!

383
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:37,960
Can I play for a bit, please?

384
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,060
Please, please, please?

385
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:44,927
Can I play for a bit, please?

386
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,653
Can I have some money?

387
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:49,165
This one looks so fun to play though!

388
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:50,199
Let's go.

389
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,227
Bring the bags, too.

390
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,507
Hurry up!

391
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,037
So slow!

392
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:15,733
Geez... I want to go home.

393
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:18,456
I'm so tired and so hungry.

394
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:22,718
Ai'Ley! What did she even buy? There's so much!

395
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:25,070
And she won't even carry it herself either.

396
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,140
My arms hurt and my back hurts all over already.

397
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:33,060
Geez, my arms...

398
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:48,638
Every time I see you, you seem weird each time.

399
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:50,864
How did you get here?

400
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,633
Don't you have any other questions?

401
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,182
It's because you suddenly showed up.

402
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,268
It's probably not a coincidence, right?

403
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:02,765
It's a coincidence.

404
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:04,265
Tell me the truth.

405
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:07,774
It's not because you're mad that I insulted you and you're here to take revenge on me?

406
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:12,290
Who told you to sit down?

407
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,112
It's because I want to sit.

408
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,130
Fine. If you want to sit then just sit there.

409
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,984
So what if the truth is it's not a coincidence?

410
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:30,429
What the hell is with you?

411
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:33,058
Just now, you were saying it was a coincidence.

412
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,535
So what if I told you that...

413
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,561
I wanted to see you.

414
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:42,350
What would you say?

415
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,637
What the hell is with you?

416
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:02,105
I'm just joking.

417
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,178
My heart was skipping a beat.

418
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,420
I'm came to do an errand.

419
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,531
Why are you here?

420
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,769
It's my business. Don't be nosy.

421
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:15,870
Who did you come with?

422
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,135
I just said that it's my business. Don't be nosy.

423
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,316
Have you eaten yet?

424
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,980
Ai'Tin.

425
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,152
I'm hungry.

426
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:24,746
Tin.

427
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:31,039
I told you not to bother me.

428
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,119
Oh!

429
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,531
It's... It's my girlfriend's stuff!

430
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,496
Girlfriend?

431
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:52,202
Why? Someone with a face like mine can't have a girlfriend?

432
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:55,310
And you, you should go back where you came from.

433
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,602
Brother Can!

434
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,751
Where did you disappear to? I called and you wouldn't answer!

435
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,982
Hello.

436
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,816
Are you Brother Can's friend?

437
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:16,392
I'm Ley. I'm Brother Can's younger sister.

438
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:20,871
Younger sister?

439
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:24,330
Not a girlfriend?

440
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:29,411
No! No! I'm not!

441
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:30,935
His younger sister.

442
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,665
A face like Brother Can's? There's no way he'd have a girlfriend.

443
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,562
Give it back already.

444
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,075
[Preview]
Look up and look into my eyes.

445
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:03,873
Look up!

446
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:06,926
You can cry only because of me.

447
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,622

00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:13,472
♫ Give me just a few seconds ♫

478
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:18,662
♫ So that I... ♫

479
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:26,068
♫ Will no longer be lonely... ♫
