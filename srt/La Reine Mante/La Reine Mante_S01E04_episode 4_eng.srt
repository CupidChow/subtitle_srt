1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320


2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,500
   

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,700
   

4
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,280
   

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,410
   

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,330
   

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,000
   

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,550
   

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,870
   

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,680
   

11
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,003
   

12
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,932
   

13
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:01,780
   

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,000
   

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,467
 Mining town of Woongsan. 

16
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:12,833
 There, I felt powerless every day. 

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,033
 People who lost their jobs 
 when the mine closed down, 

18
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:19,300
 - Hello. 
 - were drunk every day. 

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,633
 Some hurriedly left town 
 seeking a better life, but... 

20
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:24,633
   

21
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:28,700
 Waiting to receive their eviction pay, 
 the miners who remained in the company housing 

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,600
 would drink or play gambling 
 card games if they had money, 

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,000
 and if they didn't, they would take out 
 their frustrations on their wives and children. 

24
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:43,267
 A small town plagued by serial murders. 

25
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,333
 Helpless police. 

26
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,233
 Calm down. 

27
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,467
 - You police? 
 - Calm down. 

28
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,500
 Do you know who I am? 

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,667
 - Calm down, wait. 
 - It's none of your business! 

30
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,667
 Stay still. 

31
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,100
 Stop meddling in others' affairs. 

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,600
 - You okay? 
 - Hey. 

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,833
 Sir, please calm down. 
 - Hey. 

34
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,100
 Stop the violence and calm down. 

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,033
 - Use words, not violence. 
 - Did you call them? 

36
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,400
 Tell me. Is this what the police... 

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,367
 There, there. 

38
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,767
 - Take your things. 
 - I'll kill you! 

39
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:11,100
 Here, take your clothes and go inside. 

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,000
 Go inside. 

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,967
 What're you staring at? 

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,600
 Leave us be. 

43
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:32,133
 I'm Choi Jung Ho, Senior Officer 
 at Woongsan Police Station. 

44
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:37,633
 If you need help, just blink your eyes. 

45
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,667
 I'll assist you. 

46
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,433
 What're you doing? Get inside. 

47
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,900
 Ma'am. 

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,267
 What are you doing with that cop? 

49
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,700
 Are you coming up right now? 

50
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,233
 Do you have to get hit again to wake up? 

51
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,400
 All I could do while patrolling 

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,467
 was signal to people every day. 

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,100
 The police are here. 

54
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,100
 There are police nearby. 

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,670
 Even though I knew that giving 
 a warning would be useless, 

56
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,060
 I couldn't stop. 

57
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:29,200
 The thick air of crime enveloping this town. 

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,500
 I couldn't leave it. 

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,033
 Before I knew it, my mind had become hell, 

60
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:40,260
 and another day passed like that. 

61
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,633
 Now, are you getting a grip? 

62
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,067
 Consider yourself lucky it's not boiling water. 

63
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,067
 Hey, die! 

64
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:51,733
 How dare you! I, your husband, am your god! 

65
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,567
 Hey! You wench! 

66
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,833
 Hey, are you getting a grip? 

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,700
   

68
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,400
He thought there'd be a well 
 since it's a rural area.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
Same at the hospital...

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,130
Is Team Leader some kind of investigation genius?

71
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,167
How does he always get it right?

72
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,133
The clue fits too perfectly, doesn't it?

73
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,533
I'm not the only one 
 who thinks this is weird, am I?

74
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,233
Surely, somewhere we don't know...

75
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,367
Seo Ku Wan.

76
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,500
Isn't all this information coming from Seo Ku Wan?

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,333
Seo Ku Wan knew about 
 Jeong I Sin's first murder too, right?

78
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,400
Oh, you're right.

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
But why?

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,067
He knew about the hospital, the well, everything,

81
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:32,500
and still pretended not to know, 
 like putting on a show?

82
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,880
No, no...

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,260
Well, it's not, but...

84
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:46,500
Ugh, why does this feel so off?

85
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,100
 Eun Ae. 

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,667
What're you doing?

87
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:33,267
You're not supposed to be here. 
 Come out quickly. Quick.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,167
Uh, Su Yul. Yes.

89
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,030
She lost her mom at a young age,

90
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,630
and though they lived together,

91
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,500
they didn't get along well.

92
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,167
They barely spoke, and she was always out,

93
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,567
wanting to leave home as soon as possible.

94
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,167
 Why? Hungry? 

95
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,920
 Red. 

96
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,600
 Is that a signal for someone? 

97
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,633
 What signal? 

98
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,400
 This is the outfit you wore yesterday. 

99
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,267
 What did you get on it 
 that you washed it after wearing it once? 

100
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,800
 I Sin, I'm not a petty person. 

101
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,000
 Are you hiding something? 

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You can tell me. What are you hiding? 

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,633
 I Sin, what are you hiding? 

104
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:48,867
She left home as soon as her ID came out.

105
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:52,100
I barely managed to track her down, 
 and when I went to see her...

106
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,833
 I Sin, why do you keep hiding things from me? 

107
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:00,967
it turned out that her husband was 
 the notorious trash of the neighborhood.

108
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,133
 What are you hiding? 

109
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,767
I could clearly see how she was living,

110
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,596
and not being able to do anything 
 about it, I was just worried.

111
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:15,867
So I went a few times in secret 
 to check how she was.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
That night, too...

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,733
 Don't! 

114
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,167
How could she do that?

115
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,567
You should've made her 
 turn herself in or reported it.

116
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,233
If you had just reported it back then,

117
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,633
it could have at least stopped there.

118
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,600
After that, she killed five more people.

119
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,633
That woman did the killing.

120
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,480
Why?

121
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,300
Why did you just stand by?

122
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,633
I tried to stop her!

123
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,467
But I couldn't go through with it.

124
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,467
How could I report my daughter?

125
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,600
As a father, how could I 
 possibly ruin my child's life?

126
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,367
I know. I'm fully aware.

127
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:36,633
I'm a selfish man who committed unforgivable sins.

128
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,100
I raised you with repentance

129
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
and took in other children too,

130
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,767
but does that erase anything?

131
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,267
The debt of sin lasts a lifetime.

132
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,633
Anyway, the killer knows about that.

133
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you told anyone about this?

134
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,400
Who could I possibly tell?

135
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,633
No one knows.

136
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:09,233
Listen, Su Yul. Let this end here.

137
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,367
He's already dead.

138
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,967
I made his grave with my own hands,

139
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,867
treated him as deceased,

140
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,733
and that's how we've managed till now.

141
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,867
You understand that better than anyone.

142
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:26,033
It's because I worked so hard 
 that you are who you are now.

143
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:29,433
I know, but it's work.

144
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:35,500
Do you think keeping in touch with your mother 
 will make this end as "just work"?

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,033
The world doesn't work that way.

146
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,700
That murderer, must you be the one to catch them?

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,060
My mother...

148
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,900
committed her first murder because of me.

149
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,933
So, I have to catch them.

150
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:56,367
That woman killed six people.

151
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:00,433
Now a copycat has emerged,

152
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:05,533
bringing the total deaths to ten!

153
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,870
Since this all started because of me,

154
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,060
I must end it.

155
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,020
That's...

156
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,460
the only way I can survive, isn't that so?

157
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,567
The killer knew details about your past

158
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,000
that even the police weren't aware of.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,833
So, I'll start from the Yeonpo Bridge accident.

160
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,433
These are neighbors who lived nearby at the time.

161
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,833
Do you remember anyone?

162
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,867
   

163
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:22,033
Could they have witnessed 
 something related to my father?

164
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,133
It's possible because they were neighbors.

165
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,233
This guy's an alcoholic scumbag, too.

166
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,000
Assault, sexual harassment, addicted to gambling. 
    

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,267
Clear criminal predisposition.

168
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,200
Could he be the copycat?

169
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,233
Do you remember anything?

170
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:54,767
Is Jeong Yun resilient?

171
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,233
Even if my existence becomes public, 
 would she still stay by you?

172
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,800
I'll leave.

173
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,533
Will you leave that district officer alone?

174
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:20,900
Then, what should I do?

175
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,867
Kill him?

176
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Could you do it?

177
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll do it.

178
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,267
What?

179
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:39,700
Ms. Jeong I Sin, if something bothers you 
 or makes you uncomfortable,

180
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,600
do you just kill the target?

181
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I don't.

182
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,133
And I protect my family.

183
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:55,467
Don't play the caring mother now.

184
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,700
This is a warning.

185
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Next time won't be a polite request.

186
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,067
Nothing comes to mind?

187
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,667
Do you remember the son of that house?

188
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,400
Yes, I remember him. What about him?

189
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,667
When he was young, his mother left home, 
 and he was extremely lonely.

190
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:36,367
He was timid by nature, so he came 
 to our house almost every day.

191
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,933
He had injuries on his body,

192
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:43,067
and every day there were more.

193
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,033
Child abuse.

194
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,700
So, I went to see that guy, his father.

195
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:31,667
Min Jae acted as if he had been abused 
 even worse than he actually was.

196
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,400
- Why? 
 - Kids do that when they want attention.

197
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,300
No matter how much I cared 
 for him, there were limits.

198
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,100
So?

199
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,633
That's all.

200
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,000
That's not enough.

201
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,067
He saw me.

202
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,333
When I appeared on the news later,

203
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,900
he must've realized I used anesthesia, too.

204
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,000
When he realized I came to kill his father,

205
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,800
how do you think he felt?

206
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,500
Did Jeong I Sin come to save him? He'd think that?

207
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,333
Yes.

208
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,867
That's highly probable.

209
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,267
Park Min Jae's registered address is Yeonpo.

210
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:29,433
He still seems to live with Park An Bae.

211
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,667
 Exactly. 

212
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:35,667
In Park Min Jae's life, where he's never been loved 
 and still can't escape that house,

213
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:40,233
 there was someone who would kill for him. 

214
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:46,100
To Park Min Jae, Jeong I Sin 
 might've been more than a mother.

215
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,433
So, he copied Jeong I Sin's methods?

216
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,200
Not sure.

217
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,500
What's certain is he deliberately 
 lured me to the well

218
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,033
to trigger my memories.

219
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,233
 He knows me. 

220
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,967
Park Min Jae knows my face,

221
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,867
and he might already be near me.

222
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,967
About your father's disappearance,

223
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,400
honestly, it was suspicious,

224
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,833
 but I couldn't ask about it. 

225
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,367
With pressure from 
 the political circles and no time,

226
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,567
and fully relying on what Jeong I Sin says,

227
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:32,000
 we didn't have the luxury to dig 
 into undisclosed cases. 

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,467
As for this case...

229
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,333
Let's keep your father's case just between us.

230
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,300
 If it goes public, 

231
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,633
your relationship with her 
 will inevitably be exposed.

232
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:46,067
I'll dig into Park Min Jae. Stay alert.

233
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,167
I'll contact you later.

234
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,667
   

235
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,467
Feeling relieved now?

236
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,367
What are you doing? 
 You just met your mother-in-law.

237
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:06,900
Apologize to her for being suspicious 
 of Su Yul and greet her properly.

238
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,767
   

239
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,800
Seems someone visits occasionally.

240
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,920
   

241
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:35,868
   

242
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:43,733
He said it's the first house visible 
 after the beach forest path.

243
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,100
This must be the house?

244
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,733
But it seems abandoned.

245
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,367
Nobody seems to live here.

246
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,267
Hey.

247
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,467
Hey.

248
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,400
Hey.

249
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,433
Don't just barge into private property!

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,700
This place gives me the creeps.

251
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,100
Can't we just leave after a quick look?

252
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,633
This is someone else's house.

253
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,233
Huh?

254
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,500
Suit yourself.

255
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,233
Oh, Jeong Yun.

256
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,733
- Who are you? 
 - Jeong Yun.

257
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,967
I said, "Who are you?"

258
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,933
Ah, sir.

259
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,833
My husband lived here as a child.

260
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,467
We'll just look around briefly and leave.

261
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,100
Sir, take this for some drinks.

262
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,933
We'll leave soon.

263
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,567
Dad, what are you doing?

264
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,333
Dad, give that money back.

265
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:29,700
Dad, I said return the money.

266
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,367
Dad.

267
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,333
Dad.

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,733
I'm sorry. He startled you, huh?

269
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,367
My father is a little bit...

270
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,467
Wait a moment.

271
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,833
There it is.

272
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,367
- Ah, here... 
 - It's okay.

273
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,033
- I'm sorry for coming in like this. 
 - It's fine.

274
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,350
Take it back. You'll think us 
 country folks are stingy.

275
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,160
Take it.

276
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,600
I overheard a bit earlier.

277
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,500
If your husband lived here,

278
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,333
are you Ms. Jeong I Sin's daughter-in-law?

279
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,167
Do you know Ms. Jeong I Sin?

280
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,733
Ah, I know her very well.

281
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,567
She was in her twenties back then, 
 too young to be called "ma'am,"

282
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,667
but once married, everyone 
 was called "ma'am" in those days.

283
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,130
That's my phone alert.

284
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,030
My father needs his medicine.

285
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,967
Then, take care on your way back.

286
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,967
I truly apologize.

287
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,433
Seems like you've got a crush on him.

288
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,400
- Are you really not going to chase after him? 
 - No way.

289
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,367
He's totally not my type.

290
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,133
I've got standards too, you know.

291
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,567
Didn't I warn you? Huh?

292
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:20,900
Stop embarrassing me in public! Huh?

293
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,700
Did I startle you?

294
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,800
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,967
It's not like that.

296
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,300
You should've practiced driving earlier.

297
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,933
If it's going to be like this, 
 why did you even buy that car?

298
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,167
Just for decoration, okay? Why, what?

299
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,500
But seriously, this place really feels rural.

300
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,570
I can't get any reception here. Huh?

301
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Hello.

302
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,233
Oh, I found this at the house.

303
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,833
It's a photo of me and Ms. Jeong at the beach.

304
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,000
Wow, she's really beautiful.

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,200
Haven't you seen this photo before?

306
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,700
No, this is my first time seeing it.

307
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Oh, I see. But what should I do?

308
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,333
I only have this one, so I can't give it to you.

309
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,100
Ah, I'll just take a picture of it.

310
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,200
Oh, sure.

311
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,167
By the way, if you're heading that way,

312
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,533
do you want me to give you a ride?

313
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,233
I'm going that way anyway.

314
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,433
- It's okay. 
 - Good.

315
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,770
All right. I'll clear two seats for you.

316
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,960
Please wait a moment.

317
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,767
Why, it's nice to talk about 
 Su Yul's childhood, isn't it?

318
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,167
Let's just take a taxi.

319
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,467
No, it's fine, really.

320
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,567
Get in.

321
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,533
Park Min Jae has a business registration,

322
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,333
but it's classified under a security business.

323
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,667
 Looks like an errand service center? 

324
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,000
What's the address?

325
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,900
The registered address is here, 
 but they closed down long ago.

326
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,700
 - Where are you now?  
 - I'm at home.

327
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I can't reach Jeong Yun.

328
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,267
 This has never happened before. 

329
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm waiting here, worried.

330
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,833
- I'll call you back. 
 - Hyung.

331
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,533
You are Jeong Ho, right?

332
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:57,433
Oh, should I call you Su Yul now?

333
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:00,167
What? Don't you remember me?

334
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,300
I'm Min Jae, Park Min Jae.

335
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,967
Wow, you're really making me feel bad.

336
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,733
Oh, well... I went to Yeonpo.

337
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,100
Why Yeonpo?

338
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,300
I should get going now.

339
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,933
Then, get some rest.

340
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:16,500
Oh, this is the dried codfish.

341
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,810
It's a Yeonpo specialty.

342
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,730
A gift to commemorate your visit.

343
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,030
- Then... 
 - Don't you remember?

344
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,560
I heard he lived next door?

345
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,467
Min Jae.

346
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,900
Park Min Jae, right?

347
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,630
You remember me now.

348
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,860
I'm Park Min Jae.

349
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,067
 So, is your current webtoon series 
 almost finished? 

350
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:58,167
 There are five victims total, 
 and the culprit gets caught. 

351
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,700
Park Min Jae's car is 
 in front of my house right now.

352
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,033
 Park Min Jae? How? 

353
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,550
I'll explain later.

354
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,200
For now, track the license plate 
 and locate the garage.

355
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,137
 Min Jae, you said you can't drink 
 because you're driving, right? 

356
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,738
 Just water for me, please. 

357
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,600
 - Is the lip color the same? 
 - Isn't it really pretty? 

358
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,533
 It's similar to this. 

359
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,333
 Kind of like the color of grapefruit. 

360
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,200
Why did you go to Yeonpo?

361
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,133
Went for some air and stopped by briefly.

362
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,633
Why weren't you answering my calls?

363
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,367
What? Can I join, too?

364
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,000
- Huh, come on. 
 - Of course.

365
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,133
You can join, but do you have ketchup?

366
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,000
You have to dip dried codfish 
 in ketchup for the real taste.

367
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,133
Hey, Jeong Yun, look. 
 He said this is a drawing of me.

368
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,900
Huh? But somehow it 
 kind of looks like her, doesn't it?

369
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,567
- Right? 
 - Seriously?

370
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,833
Well, he is a webtoon artist, after all.

371
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,767
Can you sign here at the bottom?

372
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,400
I'll sell it for big money when you're famous.

373
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,267
You really said that I'm not famous 
 in such a nice way.

374
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,100
Ah! Wait a moment. 
 Hold that exact pose. Stay still.

375
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,700
I'll draw you in that exact angle.

376
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,833
This is perfect.

377
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:48,733
   

378
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,167
But, Jeong Ho, you really don't remember?

379
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:01,033
When we were kids, 
 we taught city folks how to dig clams.

380
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,833
I don't know. Why can't I remember any of this?

381
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:07,133
Ugh, why are you like this?

382
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Wait.

383
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,530
Then...

384
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,860
do you remember the Queen Mantis case?

385
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,933
Queen Mantis?

386
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,933
But doesn't everyone know about that, 
 even if they didn't live there?

387
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:27,867
Ah, maybe you wouldn't know.

388
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,100
It was during the World Cup back then.

389
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,133
What's that?

390
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:40,733
She's a serial killer.

391
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,067
But things got really chaotic back then.

392
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,200
Just across a bridge from Yeonpo,

393
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,000
there's a mining village called Woongsan.

394
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,467
But there, a young woman killed five people.

395
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,700
- Huh? 
 - Five? Why?

396
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,200
Well, he'd know better, since he's a cop.

397
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,670
No, I don't really know, either.

398
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,230
It's an old case.

399
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,300
Then, I'll explain.

400
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,933
They say she was a woman in her 20s,

401
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,533
but no face or name was ever revealed.

402
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,533
She's only known by the nickname Queen Mantis.

403
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:25,267
She targeted people who abused women 
 or children and killed them brutally.

404
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:28,800
Well, those dead guys did far worse things...

405
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,633
No matter how terrible they were!

406
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:39,200
She can't just go around killing people like that.

407
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,767
Then, what's the law for?

408
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,833
Right, you're a cop, after all.

409
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,867
But from my artistic perspective,

410
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:52,867
I honestly think Queen Mantis had 
 an extreme sense of empathy.

411
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,767
She just had an incredible sense of empathy.

412
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,833
She was extremely sensitive 
 to other people's pain.

413
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,833
So the abused children and women, 
 she felt the same pain as them and...

414
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,700
Snap out of it.

415
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,700
It's murder. Cold-blooded murder.

416
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,933
She took lives.

417
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,200
I know that, I do...

418
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,000
But, I mean, I guess it's understandable.

419
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,167
If I were a victim's family, 
 I might've found it satisfying.

420
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,433
They got freed from abuse.

421
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:26,733
But actually, rather than Queen Mantis,

422
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm more curious about her son.

423
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,733
- She had a son? 
 - Yes.

424
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,967
That's what the news said.

425
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,233
Wow, having a serial killer mom.

426
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,533
How would that feel?

427
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,900
He'd be around our age now.

428
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,167
Right?

429
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,700
But, why do you call him hyung?

430
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,100
Aren't you the same age?

431
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,967
Ah, there's a story behind that.

432
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:59,100
When I was young, I broke a side mirror

433
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,000
of an out-of-town car while playing ball.

434
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
 Hey, where is your house? 

435
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
 I'm asking where your house is, seriously! 

436
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,800
 I'm sorry! Please let it go this time, mister. 

437
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,033
 Ah, this darn kid... 

438
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,500
 Where's your house? You said it's around here. 

439
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,700
 Huh? 

440
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,400
 This little punk, I can't believe... 

441
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,433
 Excuse me. Is that your kid? 

442
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:23,720
 Yes, he's ours. 

443
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,230
 Why? 

444
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:29,167
Her embrace was so warm.

445
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,100
She paid for the broken mirror,

446
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,233
and I started visiting their house 
 almost daily after that.

447
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:40,367
So, that's what your mother was like.

448
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,833
But why call him hyung?

449
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,100
Oh, right.

450
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,400
The driver doubted if I really lived there.

451
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,700
He asked the boy next to me, 
 "Is this your older brother?"

452
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,700
"No, it's my younger brother."

453
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
He said it like this.

454
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,567
Even though I was taller back then.

455
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:05,367
But anyway, I started 
 calling him hyung since then.

456
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:10,100
My father hated it, 
 but I practically lived at their house.

457
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:15,200
She treated me like her own son.

458
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:20,267
But then she got into that accident so absurdly...

459
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:26,033
Why am I acting like this all of a sudden?

460
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,400
Thanks for having me today.

461
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,067
Come visit again.

462
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,700
Okay.

463
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,700
- I'll go. 
 - All right.

464
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,133
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

465
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,100
Take care.

466
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,867
By the way, why did you really go to Yeonpo?

467
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:07,033
To check if your mother really passed away.

468
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,467
You heard, right?

469
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:19,067
You heard me talking with 
 Pastor Jeong at the door, huh?

470
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,433
Your phone rang, and when I answered,

471
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,433
Grandpa suddenly said, "Don't go and meet your mom."

472
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,133
He sounded really worried.

473
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,030
And?

474
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,460
Did you find a grave in Yeonpo or not?

475
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,933
That cleared up the misunderstanding, right?

476
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,300
Enough. Let's go in.

477
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,933
You hate the idea, don't you?

478
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,633
Of what?

479
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,033
Having a baby.

480
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,567
Huh?

481
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,367
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

482
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,433
Don't pretend you don't know.

483
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,467
Everything seems connected.

484
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:02,700
What you're hiding about your family 
 and that issue and everything...

485
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,400
Jeong Yun.

486
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,530
You've had too much to drink.

487
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,767
Let's talk later.

488
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,667
You won't tell me, will you?

489
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:20,467
Jeong Yun, what's really going on with you?

490
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,360
   

491
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,933
   

492
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,700
 Your phone rang, and when I answered, 

493
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,167
 Grandpa suddenly said, "Don't go and meet your mom." 

494
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,567
That darn Park Min Jae.

495
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,767
I'm heading to the garage right now.

496
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,680
   

497
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,267
What are you doing?

498
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,650
I'm just playing a petty little trick.

499
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,467
Min Jae, let's take it slow.

500
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,500
I'll call you later.

501
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,267
   

502
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,710
   

503
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,700
- Where are you? 
 - At the garage.

504
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,600
Park Min Jae seems to live here.

505
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,733
What? Without a warrant, how...

506
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,167
Hey, get out now. I'm heading there right now.

507
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,630
I said the guy might be near me, right?

508
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,130
I was right.

509
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,833
This punk has been watching Jeong Yun 
 and me the whole time.

510
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:53,267
So what? What if he notices and goes into hiding?

511
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:56,533
Huh? Hey.

512
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:59,433
Oh, come on.

513
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:04,100
 Hello? Section Chief, are you okay? 

514
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,733
 - Section Chief?  
 - I lost him.

515
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,467
 Su Yul, get out of there now. 

516
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,333
 Got it. 

517
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,088
   

518
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,512
Darn it!

519
00:40:57,967 --> 00:40:59,800
You're dead!

520
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,600
It was you, huh? You killed them, right?

521
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,900
You killed them all, right?

522
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,933
Who?

523
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,700
You met her, right?

524
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,667
The two of you.

525
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,067
Because of the murders.

526
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,233
Shut up!

527
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,833
Just answer me.

528
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,667
Is Mom doing well?

529
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,200
Good work today.

530
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,700
Hello.

531
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,667
I'll talk to Section Chief about it.

532
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,536
Yes, understood.

533
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:52,312
   

534
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,867
   

535
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,233
I messed up.

536
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,533
Please forgive me.

537
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:31,868
Shoot!

538
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,000
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

539
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,267
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

540
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:39,933
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

541
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,533
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

542
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,933
Mr. Seo Ku Wan! Can you hear me?

543
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,767
Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

544
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,600
What did you do?

545
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
What did you feed me?

546
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,100
I killed someone?

547
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,533
With this?

548
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,767
Wouldn't it be great if this thing alone 
 could take someone down?

549
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,900
But you guys, being out in the open like this,

550
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,467
you really don't know 
 how things work in the shadows.

551
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,500
If someone gets caught cheating, you'd think 
 they'd just hide under the covers. Right?

552
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,033
No, that's not it.

553
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:27,033
Those completely naked went wild and attacked me,

554
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,700
and you think this was enough?

555
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,067
Whatever.

556
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:38,633
What were you doing

557
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:41,700
on the night of December 7th, between 9:00 and 12:00?

558
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,633
I don't know, probably something.

559
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:47,233
Hyung, do you remember 
 every detail from a week ago?

560
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,867
Park Min Jae, you're a suspect now.

561
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,933
Think carefully before speaking.

562
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:53,700
Wow.

563
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,167
Hyung, you're so cool.

564
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,267
So, this is how you work.

565
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,700
Mom should've seen this.

566
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,533
Stop!

567
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,500
I asked what you did on the night of the 7th.

568
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,933
Wow, looks like Mom is really your trigger.

569
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,600
Just hearing her name makes your veins pop.

570
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,500
Jeez.

571
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,867
Fine.

572
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:27,700
Get me a laptop. One with internet.

573
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,050
Why?

574
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,960
Even this business is competitive now.

575
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:35,000
I have to handle these receipts,

576
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,233
and I need to report 
 to clients what I've been up to.

577
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,567
I share my location in real time 
 to keep everything neat.

578
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:45,467
So then, they'll see exactly where I was 
 and what I was doing, right?

579
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,667
Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

580
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,800
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, look at me.

581
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,867
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, are you okay?

582
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:57,767
Can you see me?

583
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:03,000
Look at me. Look at me!

584
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,867
We met at the police station.

585
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,833
Ah, I feel so suffocated.

586
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,667
I can't catch my breath.

587
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,433
My hands hurt, too.

588
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:18,733
Just once. Please just once.

589
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:22,533
Please save me. I'm begging you.

590
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:26,100
Please... save me.

591
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,867
Are you okay now?

592
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,467
Thank you.

593
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,467
She's going to kill me.

594
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,667
Who?

595
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,400
Me.

596
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,200
Who will?

597
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,933
Queen Mantis.

598
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,067
Jeong I Sin is in prison now?

599
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:58,967
I've heard that recent murders are 
 similar to the Queen Mantis case.

600
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:00,100
The sooner you talk, the sooner you get out.

601
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,933
It's not about the method,

602
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,392
but they should be killing people 
 who actually deserve it.

603
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:05,167
That's the real deal.

604
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,733
Is that how it is?

605
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:10,912
   

606
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,900
Section Chief, seeing you here alone,

607
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,133
it seems you don't want other cops to notice me.

608
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:24,033
And I guess they don't know about you 
 and Mom's relationship, huh?

609
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,300
Shut your mouth.

610
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:28,300
I'm on edge.

611
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,367
It's not like I'm trying to make things difficult.

612
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:36,167
I'll carry the fact that you even made 
 a fake grave to hide it with people

613
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,433
for the rest of my life.

614
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,667
So, here's the thing.

615
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,467
Can't you let me see her just once?

616
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,833
Don't think about leaving.

617
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:56,867
Not until we figure out whether 
 it's you moving around or just your phone. Huh?

618
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,867
Give me some water.

619
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:05,300
I need to take my medication.

620
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,933
You don't know a darn thing.

621
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,500
You're right. I don't know.

622
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,167
I didn't know, so I came here.

623
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:16,000
Why would Jeong I Sin try 
 to kill you, Mr. Seo Ku Wan?

624
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because I know everything.

625
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,667
I'm a police officer. I'll protect you.

626
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,000
Jeong I Sin, Number 0.

627
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,033
It's a murder only you know about. Right?

628
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,400
I'll keep you safe. Just tell me alone.

629
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,600
You can't even protect your own son.

630
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,767
Ketchup guy.

631
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,933
I know him well. He's a regular.

632
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:58,033
Was he here on the night of December 7th?

633
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:59,933
Wait a minute.

634
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,767
Oh, he said he had lots of work back then.

635
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:06,433
He came every night to eat pork cutlets. 
    

636
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,067
Seo Ku Wan. Seo Ku Wan!

637
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:44,967
Yes, Manager Kim. Seo Ku Wan?

638
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:46,467
Police.

639
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:50,204
Yes, he left the hospital.

640
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,036
Darn it!

641
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,360
   

642
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:32,467
Manager Kim!

643
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,000
Team Leader, I'll cover 
 from this side to that end.

644
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,767
You check this area, Team Leader.

645
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,833
Are you okay?

646
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,800
Yes, I'm fine.

647
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,233
I'm sorry.

648
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:56,233
Seo Ku Wan!

649
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:58,200
Hey, Seo Ku Wan!

650
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,100
Seo Ku Wan!

651
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:21,867
Seo Ku Wan! Seo Ku Wan!

652
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,300
Stop it! Stop it!

653
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,500
Seo Ku Wan! Seo Ku Wan!

654
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:35,600
I could have it, too.

655
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:39,233
Why does everyone abandon me?

656
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,568
Why am I the only one being abandoned? Darn it.

657
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,544
Darn it...

658
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Seo Ku Wan!

659
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,767
You punk! Stop chasing me!

660
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,400
Seo Ku Wan!

661
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,967
Seo Ku Wan!

662
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,367
Seo Ku Wan!

663
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,333
- What is it? 
 - There's been an accident.

664
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,700
We have a traffic accident victim here.

665
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,667
At the intersection of Gwanghyeon 
 and Bogwang Bank. It's urgent.

666
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,867
Seo Ku Wan, an ambulance is coming.

667
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:37,200
Save your strength. Stay still.

668
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:42,067
I'll do whatever you want.

669
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:46,067
Because I know.

670
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:50,967
You, Queen Mantis, and your wife.

671
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:55,433
I'll... I'll tell everything.

672
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:58,700
What did you say?

673
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,933
You want me dead, too?

674
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,600
No, when you tried to kill yourself with a gun,

675
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,067
I was the one who saved you then.

676
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,333
There were other cops back then.

677
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:20,700
Bloodline.

678
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,567
You're exactly like your mother.

679
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,033
I envy you.

680
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,600
Darn it.

681
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,833
 In a bathroom vent where there's no CCTV, 

682
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,300
 it seems she secretly bred predatory beetles. 

683
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,967
 She collected venom 
 from those beetles and fed it to me. 

684
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,100
I was wrong.

685
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,333
Oh, no.

686
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:34,667
Did she even take your shoes?

688
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,000
Why did you do that?

689
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,900
I was hoping to get 
 more information about the case.

690
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,533
Didn't you say he's in the hospital 
 because his mind is unstable?

691
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,033
What the heck were you talking about?

692
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:16,267
There must be a reason why 
 Seo Ku Wan went berserk like that.

693
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,700
I'm sorry.

694
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,210
Why did you untie him?

695
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:30,733
If he hadn't thrashed around like that, 
 Seo Ku Wan wouldn't have died.

696
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,500
I'm sorry.

697
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:38,500
However, the hit-and-run that killed Seo Ku Wan...

698
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,667
It wasn't an accident but premeditated.

699
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:42,933
The moment Seo Ku Wan exited the alley.

700
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:46,033
They targeted and killed him 
 deliberately before fleeing.

701
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,600
Who could it be?

702
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,167
What if the real serial killer 
 silenced Seo Ku Wan?

703
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,533
You remember Number 0?

704
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:02,167
Seo Ku Wan. He must have known clues 
 about Jeong Won Sik's case.

705
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,400
Stop it.

706
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,933
Still, you should've reported to me 
 before meeting Seo Ku Wan.

707
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,067
Manager Kim, do you have a problem with me?

708
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:18,467
Ignoring all procedures 
 and treating me like you can't trust me.

709
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:21,567
Let's speak openly.

710
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,167
It's nothing like that.

711
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:28,833
You're just upset because I'm the team leader?

712
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:33,150
If it weren't me, 
 you would have been the team leader.

713
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,900
Is that why?

714
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:41,100
You caused many incidents 
 in the narcotics team, right?

715
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,567
Do you think you'll keep 
 your position if this gets messy?

716
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,133
Or if the whole team stands against you...

717
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,233
Are you threatening me now?

718
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:57,267
We follow you not because you're the team leader,

719
00:56:57,267 --> 00:57:00,267
but because we believe it aids the investigation.

720
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:01,367
If we determine otherwise...

721
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,600
Then, does this help the investigation?

722
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,433
Another person died.

723
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,467
Do you want to argue amongst ourselves 
 before the blood even dries?

724
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,933
We haven't even gotten close to the culprit.

725
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:17,833
If another dies as we speak, then...

726
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:21,633
It's not just you who's struggling. 
 We're all exhausted.

727
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,333
All of us.

728
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:29,400
I'll go find the hit-and-run vehicle.

729
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:45,800
   

730
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,000
Hello?

731
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,900
Are you insane?

732
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,800
What were you doing for four hours?

733
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:00,933
Darn it.

734
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:43,100
Who is it?

735
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,500
Ms. Lee Jeong Yun.

736
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,900
Hello?

737
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:11,080


738
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,060
   

739
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,000
 The killer we thought 
 was dead is alive and running around. 

740
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,800
 Did you kill Seo Ku Wan? 

741
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,800
 You talk first. 

742
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,967
 Aren't you relieved Seo Ku Wan's dead? 

743
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,900
 I heard Park Min Jae's already released. 

744
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,133
 Get a grip. 

745
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:47,000
 Stop glorifying a monstrous killer. 
   

746
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,667
 Just try to live normally. 
   

747
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:49,733
 It's a dating app. 

748
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:50,833
 A woman named Joy. 

749
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,700
 Among her followers are all four victims. 

750
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,600
 Give the phone to that woman. 
   

751
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,933
 That woman? What are you talking about?
