00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,030
   

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,420
   

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,300
   

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,930
   

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,650
   

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,440
   

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,910
   

11
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,103
   

12
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:00,196
   

13
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,216
   

14
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,900
   

15
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:31,303
- What's happening in there? 
 - Please stand back.

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,700
 Oh, no. What's this now? 

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,067
 Looks like death by hanging. 

18
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,900
 We'll need forensics to determine the time of death. 

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,400
 And signs of sexual assault... 

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,800
 When the mines closed down, 
 people lost their jobs overnight. 

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,567
 Back then, Woongsan was like a living hell. 

22
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:05,000
 Those pushing for casinos clashed with opponents 

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,900
 who fought like mortal enemies daily. 

24
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,100
 By early evening, streets filled with drunk thugs. 

25
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:19,400
 The gap in law enforcement. 
 Abused children and women. 

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,467
 Even though crime reports 
 were flooding in, we were stuck,  

27
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,200
 repeating the same words with no progress. 

28
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:31,867
 "Please be patient. We'll resolve this soon." 

29
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,067
 Let's go. 

30
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:37,333
 Then, she appeared. 

31
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,167
 A brutal killer who mocked the inept police 

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,567
 by killing the perpetrators 

33
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:53,233
 in the exact same way the victims had suffered. 

34
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,967
 The Queen Mantis. 

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,200
   

36
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,500
Seong Kyu, over here.

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,600
Team Leader!

38
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,367
My god!

39
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,316
Jeez!

40
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,267
Mr. Kim Tae Seok! Mr. Kim Tae Seok!

41
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,067
Seong Kyu!

42
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,100
Seong Kyu, call an ambulance.

43
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't die.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,433
Mr. Kim Tae Seok!

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,100
We must save him.

46
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,833
Don't die.

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,967
Don't die.

48
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,933
Don't die.

49
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,567
 - Cha Su Yul.  
 - Please.

50
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,067
 Become a cop. 

51
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,167
 Since five people have died, 

52
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,967
 you need to save five people. 

53
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,733
Please.

54
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,712
   

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't even dream about it.

56
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,600
Everyone in prison shares the same dream.

57
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:42,267
The missing man was a father to two children.

58
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:47,033
He's safely returned home now.

59
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you for your help.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,267
There was the sound of a gunshot.

61
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,600
 Jeong I Sin's condition for 
 confessing everything was 

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,233
 to ensure you wouldn't suffer because of her. 

63
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,133
 She wanted your name changed, 

64
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:33,333
 and to watch over your growth personally. 

65
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,333
 That's my condition. 
   

66
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,933
 Personal space, coffee, 

67
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,033
 music, books... 
   

68
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:47,667
 I carefully selected essentials. 

69
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:53,833
 The one point is no one 
 can know Jeong Ho is my son. 

70
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,833
 Change both his given and family name. 

71
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,533
Were you worried?

72
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,333
Did you miss me?

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
So, you agreed to help us...

74
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,767
under the condition that you would call me 
 whenever you wanted to see me?

75
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:27,500
Is Seo Ku Wan, that city hall 
 office worker, alive?

76
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,133
He knows you're my son

77
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,333
and that you're married.

78
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,067
He probably knows where you live, too.

79
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:42,333
Since he knows your wife's name.

80
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,933
Lee Jeong Yun?

81
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:47,600
Does she know about me, too?

82
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,233
Did you tell her about me?

83
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,700
It's Yirgacheffe coffee.

84
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,333
I heard you like this, so I got it for you.

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,433
   

86
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,100
I only paid for one. Isn't this stealing?

87
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,560
Probably not.

88
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,330
Do you know how much 
 I've spent on that vending machine?

89
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,360
   

90
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,233
I'm relieved.

91
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,833
You did it all by yourself, right?

92
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,700
Is that a compliment, or are you teasing me?

93
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,867
About sending Seo Ku Wan to the hospital,

94
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:09,300
I genuinely couldn't say anything 
 because I was in such a rush.

95
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,500
I hope you don't misunderstand.

96
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,467
I won't misunderstand.

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,472
But, Team Leader, what do you think?

98
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:25,833
Do you believe Seo Ku Wan's 
 behind these copycat murders?

99
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,470
Not sure.

100
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,400
What about you, Manager?

101
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,267
If you look around, everything else was messy,

102
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:40,267
but this place was spotless, 
 like he was treating it like a shrine.

103
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,767
That's number 0 here.

104
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,067
It's only a number, 
 but there's no material at all.

105
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:46,400
You can't just slap a number on it 
 without any reason.

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,000
This archive held only Jeong I Sin's victim files.

107
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
Maybe...

108
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,667
There might be other murders 
 by Jeong I Sin that we don't know about.

109
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,500
Even before the first one.

110
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
Seo Ku Wan knows about that. How?

111
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,200
Exactly, and on top of that, there's no connection

112
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,767
between him and the two previous murders.

113
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,033
Team Leader, I've made mistakes before 
 when I got too worked up,

114
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,400
but please let me meet Seo Ku Wan again.

115
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:27,133
Well, all right. Well, I haven't hidden him away...

116
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,500
Shall we go now?

117
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,967
Right now?

118
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,500
Yes.

119
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,633
When is he supposed to wake up?

120
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,567
I'm not sure.

121
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,767
I mean, he did hit his head.

122
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,467
Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

123
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,833
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, can you hear me?

124
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,767
Mr. Seo Ku Wan?

125
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,080
   

126
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,033
Jeong Yun.

127
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,700
Haven't run away yet?

128
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,400
Su Yul, it's been so long.

129
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,467
No, don't take it off! Don't!

130
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:39,533
I just stopped by briefly. I have to leave soon.

131
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,800
Didn't you catch the culprit?

132
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,733
We still need to monitor that suspect.

133
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,700
It's complicated to explain in detail.

134
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:52,267
Have you eaten? At least 
 eat something before you go.

135
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,533
I'm fine without eating.

136
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,967
Give me a hug.

137
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,400
No.

138
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,200
If I hug you, you'll just leave 
 again right away. Right?

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,367
Hurry up and hug me.

140
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,333
 We need to end this. 

141
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,433
 We have to kill him now. 

142
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,767
 He knows it all. 

143
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,367
Hey, you two.

144
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,967
Huh?

145
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:27,000
In this holy place where 
 we conduct business and education,

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,233
what are you two doing?

147
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,333
Go upstairs already. The bedroom is right above.

148
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,233
No, Ah Ra. That's not what it is.

149
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,567
I think I should go.

150
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,100
What do you mean?

151
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,367
I'll step aside so you two can finish up.

152
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,800
- Stay strong. 
 - No...

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
He was just dropping by.

154
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,367
Su Yul, make sure to eat properly.

155
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,400
Okay.

156
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,867
Oh, see you later, Ah Ra. You stay strong, too.

157
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,633
I'll go now.

158
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,833
Drive safe.

159
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,100
 The police have it tough, too. 

160
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,967
 No such thing as getting off work. 

161
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:13,733
 But after solving this case, 
 we should be able to rest a bit. 

162
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,400
 Should I make some tea? 

163
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,633
   

164
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,733
 That's number 0 here. 

165
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:32,967
 It's only a number, 
 but there's no material at all. 

166
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,067
 You can't just slap a number on it 
 without any reason. 

167
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,933
Ah, Section Chief.

168
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:43,267
What are you doing? 
 I told you to leave early today.

169
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,600
What?

170
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,667
What now?

171
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,633
The first murder we don't know about.

172
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:05,533
How would Seo Ku Wan know about that?

173
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,767
I don't know. It feels unsettling.

174
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,167
I think we missed something.

175
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:16,167
There was a murder I didn't know about?

176
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,100
Darn it.

177
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:30,150
I kept that one because 
 the handwriting was different.

178
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,433
   

179
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:42,067
Ah, why did the power go out?

180
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,133
   

181
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,900
What are you looking for?

182
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,700
It's a letter from Jeong I Sin offering to help me.

183
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:55,867
   

184
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,233
The handwriting...

185
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,833
   

186
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,233
It's similar.

187
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:03,467
It's completely different 
 from Seo Ku Wan's handwriting.

188
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:08,433
However, this is too short for a handwriting analysis.

189
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:13,500
Right. But it's strikingly similar.

190
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,567
That's why I checked it myself.

191
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:22,867
Section Chief, if Jeong I Sin 
 really wrote this letter,

192
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:26,233
the fact that Jeong I Sin, 
 who never responded before,

193
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,867
wrote "find your courage" like a response,

194
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:37,833
that would've been 
 a huge motivator for Seo Ku Wan.

195
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,133
For what?

196
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,180
What does Jeong I Sin gain...

197
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,400
from Seo Ku Wan killing people?

198
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:27,933
I envy how you can drop by anytime like this.

199
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,467
But I'm uncomfortable 
 because I have to welcome you.

200
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,300
How warm.

201
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,300
The hands that killed five, no...

202
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,967
Was it six?

203
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,533
Why are you doing this?

204
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
That's what I want to say.

205
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:11,100
What's troubling you?

206
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,000
Why did you manipulate Seo Ku Wan?

207
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,067
Because you were bored?

208
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,333
Is prison too dull for you?

209
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,033
Besides those five,

210
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,967
there are more, aren't there?

211
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,367
I've told you people everything.

212
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:38,067
Did Seo Ku Wan know about that?

213
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,633
Jeong I Sin, answer me.

214
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,890
Before killing Jo Gwan Wung, 
 the one whose tongue was cut out

215
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,867
and dumped in the river,

216
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:51,067
there was one more person you killed. Right?

217
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:56,133
Ask Detective Choi Jung Ho about that.

218
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:00,200
I already confessed long ago.

219
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,367
Jeong I Sin!

220
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,800
Section Chief...

221
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,130
said you might have come out to see me.

222
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:33,000
After 23 years apart, 
 he thought you'd want to see me.

223
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,333
Romantic middle-aged man...

224
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,300
In prison, every moment must have been scheduled.

225
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,400
But it's not like that here.

226
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
You're here to cooperate with the copycat investigation, 
 and that's why you're out.

227
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,533
I have both the right and the duty

228
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,733
to meet and question you anytime.

229
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,733
If this makes you uncomfortable,

230
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,500
just say so.

231
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,900
I'll send you back immediately.

232
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,667
After all, no one wants to see you 
 except lunatics like Seo Ku Wan.

233
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,567
I'll take my leave.

234
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,473
 I think someone died in there. 

235
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,456
 Is this another murder? 

236
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:53,740
 How did the victim die in there? 

237
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,098
 This is getting creepy. 

238
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,533
You're here.

239
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,433
You're here?

240
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,080
Make sure the evidence doesn't get disturbed

241
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,100
and check the bottom of the pond 
 as you move carefully.

242
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,420
Heung Soo, you measure the angles of the mirrors

243
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,030
from the body's position and take photos.

244
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,567
The victim's name is Yoo Si Hyun, 42 years old.

245
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,400
He was a professor at Hyoryeong College of Music 
 and has no prior record.

246
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,967
His family lives in Vancouver, 
 and he was living alone in this house.

247
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,667
Also, an injection mark was found on his neck.

248
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,467
They've set up the mirror like some kind of 4DX.

249
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,733
It must be a message to us.

250
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,600
Something like,

251
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,600
"Don't bother the wrong person 
 and waste your time doing stupid stuff."

252
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,333
Kim Hyeon Woo.

253
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,967
Kang Su Cheol.

254
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,467
Yu Si Hyeon.

255
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,267
Their tongues cut out, their throats slit,

256
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,100
suffocating to death underwater,

257
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,367
yet no one could save them.

258
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,767
We couldn't stop any of it.

259
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:19,900
The latest victim has been identified 
 as a professor at a local university.

260
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,333
Police continue to deny any link

261
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,800
to the earlier Noducheon murder case 
 or the storage warehouse case,

262
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,200
but suspicions remain.

263
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,867
This is Lee Jin Ah from OTC.

264
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,967
- Could you give us a statement? 
 - About the case...

265
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,633
You're the Investigation Team Leader, right?

266
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:03,100
Is the Noducheon murder related to this case?

267
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,867
Team Leader. Team Leader!

268
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,700
Team Leader!

269
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,267
 Is the Noducheon murder related to this case? 

270
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,100
 Team Leader. Team Leader! 

271
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,990
   

272
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,900
Su Yul, I saw the TV news.

273
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,800
Uh...

274
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,567
 You didn't go meet your mom again, right? 

275
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,333
Why aren't you answering?

276
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,700
 Um... Grandpa...This is Jeong Yun. 

277
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,333
Su Yul's showering right now.

278
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:44,433
Oh, Jeong Yun. Okay.

279
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,167
 I saw the TV news and got worried. 

280
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:51,467
It's nothing serious.

281
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm sorry. I'll call again later.

282
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,367
Okay.

283
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:07,600
Wow, smells good.

284
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,133
I told you to dry your hair 
 completely before coming out.

285
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,233
It's fine. If I leave it like this, it'll dry soon.

286
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,833
Your hands are hurt, too.

287
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,133
You need to let the wound dry properly 
 and put on some ointment, so it won't get worse.

288
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,767
Let's eat first. It's been a while 
 since I've had a homecooked meal.

289
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,000
So let's eat first.

290
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,133
Honey, after we eat, put some ointment on me. Okay?

291
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,533
Honey, why do you always come home injured?

292
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,833
You're worrying your wife.

293
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,333
Honestly, I don't get hurt every day.

294
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,670
Just look at me.

295
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,230
Physically, I'm quick, agile, 
 and kind of well-known in the team for it.

296
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:45,633
And this... this is nothing. 
 It's just a little scratch.

297
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,400
All right.

298
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:51,600
Ah, I told you, I'm okay.

299
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,233
Here.

300
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,100
I'm really okay.

301
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,420
Okay, I got it.

302
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,630
I put peas in the rice.

303
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,167
I love it, I absolutely love it.

304
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,767
It's done. I'll apply more 
 tomorrow morning after you wash up.

305
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,633
Jeong Yun.

306
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,700
I saw the news.

307
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,490
Oh.

308
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,230
Well, that's still under investigation 
 by the violent crime unit...

309
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,400
Reporters kept swarming in, so I...

310
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,533
You always tell me "you're okay," 
 and that it's "no big deal".

311
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:49,067
But seeing you struggle or get upset

312
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:53,000
through the news makes me feel awful.

313
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,200
If it's hard, say it's hard.

314
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,533
If the case isn't solved, 
 tell me you're frustrated.

315
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,667
Let me share your burdens.

316
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,200
Jeong Yun.

317
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,133
I feel like you're struggling alone 
 without telling me.

318
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm really sorry.

319
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,660
I was afraid you'd worry.

320
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,533
Am I a burden?

321
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:26,967
Am I so untrustworthy that you feel 
 like you have to hide what's inside

322
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,667
and only show me a cheerful face?

323
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:32,800
No. It's not like that at all.

324
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,967
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

325
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,967
Why wouldn't I trust you?

326
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:40,267
You're the only person I trust in this world.

327
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:44,340
Jeong Yun. Jeong Yun.

328
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,000
Look at me. Hey?

329
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,433
Oh, no. Look at me, okay?

330
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,620
I said look at me.

331
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,500
Look.

332
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,267
All right. Come here.

333
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,300
I told you to dry your hair.

334
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,600
You'll start smelling sour.

335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,233
What if people call you 
 "Sour-Smelling Team Leader"?

336
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,033
What's wrong with that?

337
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,800
"Sour-Smelling Team Leader" sounds fine.

338
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:13,430
   

339
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,900
What's that light?

340
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,400
It's a self-defense flashlight.

341
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,990
There are many types and distribution channels,

342
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,260
so this one can't be traced.

343
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,367
If the goal had been to subdue the target,

344
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,600
a taser or stun gun 
 would have been much more effective.

345
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,633
Which means they were confident 
 in their ability to overpower the victim.

346
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,110
They used the light only to distract,

347
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,830
then struck immediately.

348
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,170
Anything unusual?

349
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,030
The victim's phone is missing.

350
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:53,333
In every case, only the victim's phone was taken.

351
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,033
There must be a reason.

352
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,933
Maybe the phones contained 
 compromising information.

353
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:04,567
Yu Si Hyeon! We got a ping 
 from Yu Si Hyeon's phone.

354
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,133
Well, first snow isn't so romantic now.

355
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,767
The signal seems to be around there.

356
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:33,300
Easy. Too easy. Am I 
 the only one feeling this way?

357
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,967
The perp might've made a mistake.

358
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,133
Let's start the search first.

359
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,200
Hyeok and I will take the left side of this house.

360
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,733
The two of you take the rest.

361
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,367
Let's move.

362
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,600
Hey, junior.

363
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,930
This guy doesn't leave a single hair at the scene.

364
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,860
Doesn't this strike you as strange?

365
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,767
I dreamed of my late grandmother last night.

366
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,733
- Why's that? 
 - Last time I was at the scene,

367
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,167
- I got stabbed here, remember? 
 - Oh.

368
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,633
Darn it, this feels ominous.

369
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:58,667
Hey, can't risk it.

370
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,900
Give me a receipt, over 100,000 won.

371
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,267
Uh, hold on.

372
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,400
Here.

373
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,667
- Go away. 
 - Hey! Are you coming?

374
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,633
 Su Yul, you... 

375
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:26,400
 You didn't go and meet your mom again, right? 

376
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,533
   

377
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,200
   

378
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:41,333
Hey.

379
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,333
You scared me!

380
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,167
Sorry.

381
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,733
But, hey...

382
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,000
Is anyone home?

383
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,033
Anyone here?

384
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,900
 Son. 

385
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,433
 Ta-da. 

386
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:18,367
 Do you know what this is? 

387
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,833
 Our Jeong Ho likes drawing, right? 

388
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,867
 Dad made this. Wow. 

389
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:26,267
 Ta-da. Now, Jeong Ho. 

390
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:29,300
 Draw a cool picture of Dad. 

391
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,000
 - Okay. 
 - Great, great. 

392
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,167
 How should I pose? Like this? 

393
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,767
 I'll just sketch quickly. 

394
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,033
 Wow, why is Jeong Ho so good at throwing? 

395
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,967
 Why is our Jeong Ho so strong? 

396
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,767
 Jeong Ho, Dad will throw this high up. 

397
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:08,467
 Here you go. Get it! 

398
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,867
 What now? It fell in the water? 

399
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,033
Team Leader.

400
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,620
Oh, yes, Manager Kim.

401
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,630
Did you find anything?

402
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:26,033
He said his mother passed away because of this,

403
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:29,067
but none of the articles 
 mentioned a female victim.

404
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:32,767
So, does that mean his mother is still alive?

405
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:36,540
Yeah, like with the call from his grandfather...

406
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,600
But, just because it's in the newspaper 
 doesn't mean it's all accurate.

407
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,200
If you're curious, just ask him directly.

408
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,300
But he's never once brought up 
 family matters on his own.

409
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,767
Even when asked, he dodges with jokes.

410
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,033
Then, just drop it.

411
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,667
You're still doing well now, so what's the point?

412
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,733
Unless he says it himself...

413
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:02,333
Lee Jeong Yun. Don't look so grim, huh?

414
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,400
Stop sulking. Get up.

415
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,967
Get up. Just forget it. Done. Finished!

416
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,533
Help me with the brushwork instead.

417
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:13,533
In the neighborhood where Su Yul lived as a kid,

418
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:16,633
I heard his mother's grave is there.

419
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,500
Shall we check?

420
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,933
Let's go. Stop agonizing over it.

421
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,100
That would be the best, right?

422
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,067
- This punk... 
 - Why?

423
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,067
This punk's definitely watching us 
 from somewhere right now.

424
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,500
Really? How do you know?

425
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,000
This guy wants to mock us.

426
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,100
Gets off on seeing us running around clueless.

427
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,700
That's his whole game.

428
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,300
Hey! Laughing? Having fun?

429
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,033
You little son of a gun!

430
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,633
What?

431
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,967
Ah, nothing.

432
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:00,167
What time is it? You guys not hungry?

433
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,500
Let's call it a day.

434
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,633
One more sweep.

435
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,700
But it's getting dark...

436
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,200
You don't feel right about leaving, do you?

437
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,233
Well... yeah.

438
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:17,200
Then, let's check once more. Trust your instincts.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,133
Remember how he found Kim Tae Seok last time?

440
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:24,333
One more round. If nothing turns up, we bail.

441
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,384
Um, Team Leader?

442
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:30,767
It's probably nothing, 
 but in the neighbor's kitchen...

443
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,167
- What is that? 
 - Well, it's strange to have a jar

444
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:43,000
just sitting in the room, not even in the yard.

445
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,333
And there's only a single red ball in it.

446
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,933
Told you it might be nothing.

447
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,600
Has anyone seen a well nearby?

448
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,500
A well?

449
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,233
As you can see, this house was built long ago.

450
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:17,367
The village predates modern plumbing.

451
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:20,967
Places like this usually have wells. 
 But I don't see one.

452
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:25,667
Maybe they removed it after getting pipes.

453
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:29,533
But they'd seal it, not destroy it completely.

454
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,500
You didn't see one?

455
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,367
Uh, maybe I have?

456
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,933
When we entered the driveway earlier, 
 there was something there.

457
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,770
This way.

458
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,433
   

459
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,900
   

460
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,667
The wound found on the back earlier seems 
 to have been caused by a different tool.

461
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,433
A razor, maybe?

462
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,567
- Everyone here? 
 - Yes.

463
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,333
His name is Jeong Won Sik.

464
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,167
He suddenly went missing 
 three months ago and was a developer

465
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,367
at an IT company called DigiSolution.

466
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,600
Back in the early 2000s,

467
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,567
when the National Police Agency 
 started digitizing crime data,

468
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,833
this company participated in the project.

469
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,967
So cases related to Jeong I Sin were handled 
 through this company as well?

470
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,700
Yes, it seems that all along, 
 they obtained information about Jeong I Sin,

471
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,667
information only the police could access, 
 through Jeong Won Sik.

472
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,833
- You came? 
 - Yeah. Sit.

473
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,433
A Jeong I Sin copycat?

474
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,133
Professor, it's been a while.

475
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,867
Yeah.

476
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,933
You came here, too?

477
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,167
Yeah. Su Yul, it's been ages.

478
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,133
Everyone's been through a lot.

479
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,767
Come home sometime.

480
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:25,067
Professor, maybe save 
 the marital squabble for later.

481
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,500
Any findings?

482
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,600
Well, looking at the body

483
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,700
and the multiple stab wounds,

484
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,104
the death occurred at least three months ago.

485
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:36,433
Three months...

486
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:40,400
Three months ago means... 
 It predates the Noducheon murder case.

487
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,300
But the strange thing is,

488
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,167
the marks of restraint indicate 
 the victim had already been subdued.

489
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:50,800
Yet, unusually, the stab wound on the back

490
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,333
seems like it was inflicted 
 accidentally from behind.

491
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,100
Not a knife, but something

492
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,400
more like a large pair of shears 
 used for cutting fabric?

493
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,333
But the wounds on the chest and neck

494
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,833
are almost like someone was playing, 
 drawing with them,

495
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:09,400
until the victim died from excessive bleeding.

496
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:14,000
Strange, right? A copycat of Jeong I Sin?

497
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,033
Well, there's no connection 
 at all to call this a copycat.

498
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,900
Kim Hyeon Woo, with his tongue cut,

499
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,233
Kang Su Cheol, found in the warehouse,

500
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:24,467
and Yu Si Hyeon, who was drowned,

501
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:27,667
all clearly followed Jeong I Sin's patterns.

502
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,267
But not Jeong Won Sik.

503
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,567
Completely different.

504
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:35,967
Well, Professor. 
 What if this is the killer's first murder?

505
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,733
They could have stabbed him 
 in the back accidentally,

506
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:43,433
then later, as if "awakening" into 
 Jeong I Sin, started imitating her.

507
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:45,967
That would mean they got a taste 
 for killing from this case

508
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:49,567
and only followed Jeong I Sin afterward...

509
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,767
However, in Jeong I Sin's cases,

510
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:56,000
no bodies were ever found in a well.

511
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,267
Section Chief, this was found 
 in Seo Ku Wan's house.

512
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:04,200
But look here. There's nothing under number 0.

513
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,867
He collected all Jeong I Sin's case files

514
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:12,067
and displayed them like an exhibition.

515
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:23,367
   
   

516
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,700
   

517
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,033
Did you come at this hour on purpose?

518
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,900
Can we have a moment alone?

519
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,833
Is it my father?

520
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,867
I'm asking, is it my father?

521
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:40,433
Yes.

522
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,433
I did it.

523
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:55,500
The best decision I ever made.

524
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,000
I still stand by it.

525
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,767
How could you kill your own husband?

526
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,600
He was my father!

527
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,333
That's why you're alive.

528
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,400
That's all that matters to me.

529
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm fine with it.

530
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,967
Stop talking nonsense.

531
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:20,100
You killed Dad to save me?

532
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,333
That was all because of me?

533
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,833
How dare you

534
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:29,333
use such a horrific excuse so shamelessly now?

535
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,767
It's no excuse.

536
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,300
You might not remember, 
 but that man was drunk every day.

537
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,567
That day was no different.

538
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,300
 - You're back? 
 - Yeah. Where's Jeong Ho? 

539
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,367
 Sleeping. Do you know what time it is? 

540
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:53,233
 If his darn father's here, he should come out. 

541
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:56,000
 Leave him be. He went to bed late. 

542
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,610
 Why? 

543
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,430
 Does this place stink? 

544
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,400
 Come here. 

545
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,667
 Why? 

546
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,700
 Sit here! 

547
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,220
 Okay. I said okay! 

548
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,760
 Stop yelling, or you'll wake the kid. 

549
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,067
 No. Get up. Get up. 

550
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,767
 Here. 

551
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,500
 You know how much I care about you? 

552
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:16,180
 I know. 

553
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,830
 Thank you. 

554
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,980
 But it's late. 

555
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,700
 Go to bed. 

556
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,333
 I'll wash up and join you. 

557
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,967
 Ah, perfect. 

558
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,100
 Huh? 

559
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,900
 Is he some coal miner punk? 

560
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:46,267
 Why would you say that? 

561
00:49:46,267 --> 00:49:49,233
 I must've got it while cleaning the kitchen. 

562
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:52,500
 Those shady punks crossing 
 the bridge with filthy intentions. 

563
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,200
 Their eyes light up every time they see 
 a woman in the neighborhood. 

564
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,367
 You think I don't know? 

565
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,667
 Take off your clothes. 

566
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,433
 Here? 

567
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,867
 No one comes over here. No one. 

568
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,267
 If you've got nothing to hide, strip. 

569
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:13,167
 If I find a single scratch... 

570
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,167
 Now! Before I rip everything off! 

571
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,967
 Fine. Let's go to the room. 

572
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,800
 No. Here. 

573
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,967
 To the room. I'll undress there. 

574
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:27,733
 Why would you insist on going inside? 

575
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,200
 Ah, darn it. 

576
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,700
 What did he do here? 

577
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,733
 What are you hiding? 

578
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,467
 What filthy... 

579
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,533
 - There's nothing! What would I hide? 
 - Darn you... 

580
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:48,633
 Stop it! Stop! 

581
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:51,667
 Jeong Ho, this is between Mom and Dad. Go inside. 

582
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,600
 Don't hurt Mom! 

583
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,367
 Is that brat even mine? Huh? 

584
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,400
 It's our Jeong Ho - oh, honey! 

585
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,100
 - Oh, honey, don't do this! 
 - Stop! 

586
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,100
 - Honey. 
 - No! 

587
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,700
 - You little... 
 - Stop. 

588
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,033
 Oh, honey, don't. 

589
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:07,333
 - Let go! 
 - You... 

590
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,467
 Stop it. 

591
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:11,267
 Let go. Come here, you brat. 

592
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,267
 - Don't! 
 - You little... 

593
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:15,133
 - Hey, Kim Jeong Ho. 
 - Dad! 

594
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,400
 - Who are you? Are you my son? 
 - Dad! 

595
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,900
 - You... I'll... 
 - Dad! 

596
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,467
 - I told you to stop. 
 - Dad, I'm sorry. 

597
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:24,500
 You punk. 

598
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
 You darn kid. 

599
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,833
 You little monster. 

600
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,100
 Stop! 

601
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,267
 Jeong Ho! 

602
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,800
Luckily, you weren't badly hurt.

603
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,367
You fainted from the shock.

604
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,900
It's a lie.

605
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,567
It's fuzzy, but I remember everything.

606
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,700
My father...

607
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:05,733
He built me a desk, played catch 
 with me... things like that.

608
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:08,067
Oh, right.

609
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:12,700
Sure, there were times like that. 
 When he wasn't drinking. Occasionally.

610
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:24,000
When you confessed to the crimes, 
 why did you hide this?

611
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:29,200
What kind of person are you?

612
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,133
Blaming your own child for your mistakes?

613
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:37,330
Why did you hide this all along?

614
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,230
Why!

615
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:43,100
Well, no one ever asked.

616
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,133
What?

617
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:48,233
Since you couldn't remember that night either,

618
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:53,500
I just said he ran off after an affair, 
 and they all just accepted it.

619
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:00,867
Is this really my fault?

620
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:03,100
When I was young, I'd watch cats 
 hunt birds in the neighborhood.

621
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,300
The bird couldn't fly, but wasn't dead yet.

622
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:10,500
Cats don't actually eat the birds.

623
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:17,467
They strike again when a bird 
 with a broken wing or injury tries to move.

624
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:22,033
Eventually, the bird dies, 
 so you have to save it before that.

625
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:28,733
When kids rescue birds, they have to be careful.

626
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,133
If they don't control their strength, 
 the bird will die.

627
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:37,667
Press the breastbone just a bit, and it can snap.

628
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,900
They're really fragile.

629
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:45,433
But people are the same.

630
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,467
 My husband died. 

631
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:37,733
Killing a person is surprisingly easy.

632
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:42,100
The problem is dealing with 
 and disposing of the body.

633
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:48,067
That's just labor.

634
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,333
It's exhausting.

635
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,900
That's when I realized.

636
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,967
Killing isn't the hard part,

637
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:02,967
but handling the aftermath is.

638
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,367
But that day, I got lucky.

639
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:44,567
 It rains after I killed him. 

640
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:59,367
So peaceful.

641
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,500
And Jeong Ho and I,

642
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,300
the two of us were happy like that.

643
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,233
Peaceful?

644
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:27,000
You...

645
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,400
You killed five more people after that.

646
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,933
They deserved it? No.

647
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:38,433
You just killed because you wanted to kill.

648
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:42,767
Starting with my father, and after him,

649
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:47,100
you got addicted to killing, didn't you?

650
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:54,267
Can't deny that.

651
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,433
You are...

652
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:13,567
a slaughterer who loves the smell of blood.

653
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:15,733
Queen Mantis.

654
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,667
You are just a monster.

655
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,500
Right.

656
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:33,100
I shouldn't have done it that day.

657
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:38,200
Luckily, it rained, and there was a well.

658
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,133
I was worried about you, 
 so I couldn't finish properly.

659
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:46,133
I should have removed everything 
 attached to his body, one by one.

660
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:48,367
- Stop. 
 - Save the head for last.

661
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:52,367
- Shut up. 
 - I should've watched his body get cut apart.

662
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:58,400
It was my first time, so I was sloppy.

663
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,467
So sloppy that I didn't even want to tell the police.

664
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,900
Please stop.

665
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,333
Shut up, stop it!

666
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:17,833
How could you do something so cruel?

667
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,100
Yes, I killed your father.

668
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,367
I cut out the tongues of bad guys, 
 snapped their necks,

669
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,833
and crushed joints into pulp.

670
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,800
I did all that.

671
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:30,600
Yeah.

672
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:33,867
Do you hate me?

673
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,033
Fear me?

674
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,533
Want to kill me?

675
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:50,667
You'd be better off without me.

676
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,133
Kill me! Go ahead and kill me!

677
01:00:01,433 --> 01:00:02,767
Aren't I horrible?

678
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:04,933
Wouldn't it be better if I were completely gone?

679
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,567
Do it! Kill me!

680
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:08,867
Kill me here, right here!

681
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:12,833
It's such a pain that Mom's still alive, isn't it?

682
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:15,467
Stop it. Stop it...

683
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:43,830

685
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:06,233
 Do you remember anyone? 
   

686
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:07,500
 Dad, what are you doing? 

687
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,267
 Are you Ms. Jeong I Sin's daughter-in-law? 

688
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:10,933
 Do you know Ms. Jeong I Sin? 

689
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,460
 Same at the hospital... 

690
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,330
 Is Team Leader some kind of investigation genius? 

691
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,428
 The clue fits too perfectly, doesn't it? 

692
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:17,133
 Jeong Ho. 

693
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:19,633
 Park Min Jae's car is in front of 
 my house right now. 

694
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,233
 She's going to kill me. 

695
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:24,200
 Why would Jeong I Sin try 
 to kill you, Mr. Seo Ku Wan? 

696
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,467
 This punk has been watching 
 Jeong Yun and me the whole time. 

697
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,233
 You killed them, right? 

698
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:31,533
 You killed them all, right?
