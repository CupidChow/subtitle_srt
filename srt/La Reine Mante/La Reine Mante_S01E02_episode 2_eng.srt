1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:08,300


2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,440
   

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,400
   

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,680
       

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,050
   

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,210
   

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,250
   

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,850
   

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,700
   

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,290
   

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,090
   

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,333
   

13
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,633
   

14
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:00,976
   

15
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,200
   

16
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,567
 Hey, you punk! 

17
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,567
 Why're you butting in? 

18
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,167
 - Hey, punk. 
 - Stop picking on the weak! 

19
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,067
 Step on him harder. 

20
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,767
 You brats! 

21
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,767
 What the heck are you doing! 

22
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,867
 Hey, you punk. 

23
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,633
 Hey, hey, hey. Police! 

24
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,067
 - Police. 
 - These brats... 

25
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,167
 Why did you just take the beating? 

26
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,800
 Taekwondo, boxing, judo... 

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,900
 Did you learn those just for show? 

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,767
 I'm not training just to hit someone. 

29
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:47,333
 Still, come on... what's a guy supposed 
 to do if he can't even throw a punch? 

30
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,667
 What if I kill someone? 

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,167
 Detective, I'm really fine now. 

32
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,267
 I'm living well, so... 

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,533
 Enjoy your meal. 

34
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,033
 Eat this. 

35
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,167
 And don't come looking for me anymore. 

36
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,567
 You know, me mixing 
 your jjajangmyeon is a rare privilege. 

37
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:24,900
 You'd better spill something big, 
 or I might just not do it. 

38
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,067
 Cha Su Yul, 

39
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,167
 you should be a cop. 

40
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:38,600
 Wait a minute. Five people died. 

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,967
 So you need to save five people. 

42
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,100
 Be a cop. 

43
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:54,933
 Save more, if possible. 

44
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,330
   

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
Why would he...

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,067
Make this brighter. 
    

47
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,720
Brighter?

48
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,100
Here. Zoom in here.

49
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,700
What is it?

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,100
- This photo is flipped. 
 - Yeah.

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,467
A printing error, probably.

52
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,333
Hold on.

53
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,216
What?

54
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:46,233
So that means the head was 
 actually on the left, not the right.

55
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,333
It must've been flipped during newspaper printing.

56
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,200
This guy didn't copy it from the newspaper.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
He must have seen trial transcripts

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,733
or investigation materials.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes.

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,333
Find some trial transcripts or investigation 
 documents related to Jeong I Sin...

61
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,467
Already searching?

62
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,100
Got it.

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,900
Let's hurry.

64
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:36,600
   

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,033
We're police.

66
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,833
Is Professor Choi Mi Kyeong here?

67
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,900
She's overseas for a conference.

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,833
Oh, then, could we get her contact information?

69
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,000
As Jeong I Sin demanded a closed trial,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,467
only the court, prosecution, defense, 
 and the psychiatrist saw the transcripts.

71
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,733
Prosecution denies any leaks.

72
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,200
The psychiatrist will be back in a week,

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,100
but for now, she says she hasn't seen 
 anything except the photo in the paper.

74
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,967
The judge died three years ago.

75
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,800
The lawyer said he isn't certain 
 since it was 23 years ago,

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,133
but he never showed the trial transcripts to anyone.

77
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,700
When asked if he still had them, 
 he said he would confirm and let us know.

78
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Okay.

79
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,533
Good work, everyone.

80
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,200
They said he used to be on the narcotics team,

81
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
but he's still doing his job quite well.

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,500
What job?

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,333
It's only been a few days.

84
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,867
So, Attorney Kim, have you found anything?

85
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,110
Well, everything's here,

86
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,160
except for that one file.

87
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:56,367
Besides you, does anyone else 
 have access to this office?

88
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:00,200
Sometimes the cleaning staff, 
 and when meetings run late,

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,867
acquaintances might wait here.

90
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:05,233
So honestly, if someone wanted 
 to steal it, it could've been anyone.

91
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,400
Is there no one you suspect? 
 Among the people who came in here?

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
They're all acquaintances.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,533
Even the smallest thing could be a clue.

94
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,033
For example, someone 
 suddenly getting close to you...

95
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,033
Suddenly close, you say...

96
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:23,200
Well, once, when I was building a house, 
 I had to submit several documents.

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,767
One day, I got a call saying 
 something was missing,

98
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,467
so I went down to the district office.

99
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,400
And then?

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,033
It turned out to be 
 a clerical mistake on their part.

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,200
The officer felt terribly sorry, 
 and we ended up chatting for a while.

102
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,067
That must've been, what, about 30 years ago?

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,267
You see, some attorneys here and 
 I have been supporting a local orphanage nearby.

104
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,833
And by coincidence, that officer

105
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,633
turned out to be from 
 the very orphanage we had been sponsoring.

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,000
 Did you recognize him? 

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,233
 We only visit once a year, 
 and there are many children, 

108
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:58,300
 so it's hard to remember every face. 

109
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,333
But apparently, he remembered me.

110
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,267
He told me he hesitated for a long time 
 about whether to approach me or not.

111
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:04,800
Last year, I think?

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,467
He came to visit me here.

113
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,200
Wait a second.

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,467
Ah, here it is.

115
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:26,100
Safety and Construction Division, 
 Anam District Office, Seo Ku Wan.

116
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,467
Was he also waiting in this room?

117
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,333
Yes, he showed up without notice.

118
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,200
I told him to wait here until the meeting ended.

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,033
About the person you're talking about...

120
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,867
The orphanage said there was no such child.

121
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,500
I only found out later after 
 meeting the head of the orphanage.

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
It did feel a little suspicious,

123
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,333
but still, he just spoke awkwardly, 
 and didn't really seem like a bad person.

124
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,100
And it's not like I actually suffered any harm.

125
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:57,967
But are you saying that he's the one 
 who took the trial transcripts?

126
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,033
We'll take the afternoon walk in an hour.

127
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,867
Go!

128
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,867
After investigating the neighborhood,

129
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:21,433
Seo Ku Wan currently lives alone 
 and commutes by motorcycle.

130
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,567
 He should be here soon. 

131
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,933
Got it. Watch the entrance discreetly.

132
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,600
 Yes, sir. 

133
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,500
Nice car.

134
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,167
We confirmed Seo Ku Wan is indeed 
 an Anam District Office employee.

135
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:39,433
I've sent the files through PolMessenger.

136
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,850
   

137
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,190
   

138
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,790
It's not the same orphanage the lawyer mentioned,

139
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,800
but it's true he grew up in one.

140
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,433
Some of his story checks out, 
 but he mixed in lies.

141
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:07,033
He usually arrives around this time.

142
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,800
Hey, Hyeok, everything clear on your side?

143
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,900
 All clear. 

144
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,467
When's this guy going to show up...

145
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,433
All right, everyone listen up.

146
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,033
Don't make any moves

147
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:22,067
until you see Seo Ku Wan 
 go inside the house and stay subtle.

148
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:30,767
Did I just say something unnecessary?

149
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,333
No.

150
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,833
This is exactly the time to be cautious.

151
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,100
If you just think of it as confirming things.

152
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:42,500
One by one and moving in sync, that'll be good.

153
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,133
I'm sure everyone was shocked.

154
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:50,433
Suddenly, here I am, dropped in as team leader...

155
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,367
They're trustworthy.

156
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:56,000
- Just think of us as one team. 
 - Got it.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Team Leader, he's here.

158
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,567
Hey, Seo Ku Wan!

159
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,833
Hey! Stay still!

160
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,433
You punk, hey!

161
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,767
We lost him.

162
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,700
Seong Kyu, he's heading toward the main road.

163
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,433
 I see his motorcycle. I'll block the road. 

164
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,272
Darn it.

165
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:44,733
Hey! Ji An, get down quick!

166
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,800
- Hey! 
 - Catch him!

167
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,900
That punk... Hey!

168
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,033
Hey! You punk!

169
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,400
Where's Hyeok?

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,233
Hyeok!

171
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,667
Seo Ku Wan!

172
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,900
Hey!

173
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,967
Hey, Hyeok!

174
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,133
You almost got hit!

175
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,333
You nearly killed him.

176
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,333
Hyeok, get up.

177
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,267
Are you okay?

178
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,833
He collected all sorts of personal information.

179
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,500
What's this?

180
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,667
The encryption is insane.

181
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,500
Found it. Jeong I Sin's trial transcripts.

182
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,792
   

183
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,567
There's the attorney's file, 
    

184
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,167
and even the Anwon Prison guard records.

185
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,400
Team Leader.

186
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,300
   

187
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,400
This lunatic...

188
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,267
Section Chief Bae, Hyeok, and me.

189
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:44,533
Seo Ku Wan even dug into our backgrounds?

190
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:26,600
Why didn't he change the light bulb?

191
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,367
Darn nuts.

192
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,467
Manager Kim!

193
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,333
Team Leader!

194
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,267
This guy is incredibly diligent and thorough.

195
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,433
Welcome to the Queen Mantis World.

196
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:04,000
Sir, I think he was sick or something?

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,333
The pharmacy name is listed here. 
 I'll go and check it out.

198
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,400
While you are at it, you put a bandage on, too.

199
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,033
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:13,467
I'll take this in and check it out.

201
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,600
All right, go back.

202
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,133
What's this?

203
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,633
Why is it wrapped so tightly?

204
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,867
It's a safe.

205
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,600
3D printer.

206
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,267
Team Leader.

207
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,133
Kids, Daddy's home.

208
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,033
I brought chicken.

209
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,200
Are you all sleeping?

210
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,308
Not waiting for Dad?

211
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:31,933
So cruel.

212
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,267
Daddy's heartbroken.

213
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,800
Fine, then I'll just eat it all myself.

214
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,200
   

215
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,967
Jeong I Sin.

216
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,333
Anwon Prison.

217
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,933
Jeong I Sin sent letters from Anwon Prison?

218
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,033
Huh?

219
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,540
But how could Jeong I Sin 
 and Seo Ku Wan exchange letters?

220
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,833
Jeong I Sin, whom the world believes to be dead...

221
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,033
What the heck, you punk?

222
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,967
What are you talking about? I don't follow.

223
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,433
I'm back.

224
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,467
That woman isn't helping us.

225
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,667
 She's using us. 

226
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,033
It was Jeong I Sin who ordered 
 Seo Ku Wan to kill people.

227
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,700
What?

228
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,867
Coming here late at night 
 without even a courtesy call.

229
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,233
Why did you do it?

230
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,633
Why did you tempt Seo Ku Wan, 
 who was desperate to kill, into doing it?

231
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,667
Was killing five people not enough for you?

232
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,467
Answer me!

233
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,133
You wrote it, huh?

234
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:30,667
Telling him he could become 
 like you, killing people!

235
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,733
Saying it's no big deal if he tried...

236
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:36,467
I've never written a reply to someone like that.

237
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,900
Then, what are these?

238
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,900
Do you have proof that I wrote these?

239
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,600
So, you're a cop, 
 and that's all you're good for?

240
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,633
Are you saying you didn't write them?

241
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:00,300
Turn off the lights when you leave.

242
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:14,267
In prison, sleeping, eating, 
 waking hours are fixed.

243
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,200
Lights out means sleep time.

244
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Wake, eat, and get sunlight on schedule daily.

245
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,900
You know that, right?

246
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,700
So, anything outside those times, 
 whatever happens in your world,

247
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,867
you handle yourselves.

248
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,433
That's the rule.

249
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,900
Do I look like I'm on a field trip?

250
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,533
This is prison.

251
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,767
Come in the morning if you want to talk.

252
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,967
You're a cop, aren't you?

253
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,367
Ah, hot.

254
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,700
Honey, aren't you hungry?

255
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,833
 The police have announced that 
 they are releasing the face of Seo Ku Wan, 

256
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,833
 a prime suspect in the recent murder case, 
 and have upgraded him to a wanted status. 

257
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,768
 Seo Ku Wan has a history 
 of schizophrenia and delusional disorder 

258
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,104
 and has shown signs of mental instability lately, 
   

259
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,100
 according to the police. 

260
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,167
 The police also believe it's highly likely 
 that Seo Ku Wan is armed, 

261
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,100
 and immediate precautions are being taken. 

262
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,067
 Police describe Seo Ku Wan as 184 cm tall... 

263
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:57,300
This is the handwritten statement 
 that Jeong I Sin wrote 23 years ago.

264
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,267
On the right is the reply that Seo Ku Wan 
 supposedly received from Jeong I Sin.

265
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,367
The handwriting...

266
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,733
Not only the handwriting itself,

267
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:07,367
but Jeong I Sin's statement 
 has no spelling errors at all.

268
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,533
The sentences are also very clear and precise.

269
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:13,033
In contrast, Seo Ku Wan's reply letter

270
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:16,567
has many mistakes.

271
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,767
It's definitely not written by the same person.

272
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,533
Then, who wrote the reply?

273
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,030
It matches the handwriting

274
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,960
found in Seo Ku Wan's homemade 
 pistol blueprint and notes.

275
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,700
It was written by Seo Ku Wan.

276
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Uh,

277
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,267
based on the evidence recovered from his home,

278
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:40,200
Seo Ku Wan seemed to worship 
 Jeong I Sin like a follower.

279
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,167
Perhaps, he wanted to kill someone 
 but was too scared,

280
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:51,133
so he created delusions 
 where he received encouragement

281
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:55,433
or instructions from Jeong I Sin.

282
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:59,033
Given his long history of schizophrenia 
 with severe hallucinations and delusions,

283
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,567
this makes sense.

284
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,367
We checked the pharmacy 
 and found a prescription for Seo Ku Wan.

285
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:09,070
The hospital confirmed he had made 
 an appointment last month

286
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,700
but didn't show up.

287
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,233
That timing roughly coincides 
 with the first murder committed in Noducheon.

288
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,567
Since he stopped taking his medication, 
 his delusions likely worsened...

289
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,367
He's a dangerous lunatic, 
 which makes his behavior unpredictable.

290
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,000
Any tips?

291
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,533
All of them are just prank calls.

292
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,833
By the way, Seo Ku Wan's computer 
 has been unlocked.

293
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,133
Who's that man?

294
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,600
Where's Dad?

295
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,767
Listen to Mommy.

296
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,433
Do whatever he tells you to do.

297
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,900
No questions.

298
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,400
Who are these people?

299
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,100
This man's definitely insane.

300
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,367
What?

301
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,000
Look.

302
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Hey, you monster...

303
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,967
Car number here.

304
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,067
We got the license plate.

305
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,600
Trace the owner's address from this plate.

306
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,633
Request backup teams ready to move 
 as soon as we get the address.

307
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,800
Gear up.

308
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,100
Ah, the homemade pistol.

309
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,700
- Got the address. 
 - Let's go.

310
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,833
Yes, this is Detective Bae Seong Kyu 
 from Violent Crimes Investigation Team 1.

311
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,250
   

312
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,000
 We repeat our announcement. 

313
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,733
 The police have announced that 
 they are releasing the face of Seo Ku Wan, 

314
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,470
 a prime suspect in the recent murder case, 

315
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,730
 and have upgraded him to a wanted status. 

316
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,633
 Seo Ku Wan has a history of... 

317
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,800
It's done.

318
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,033
Mom.

319
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,700
It's okay, don't be scared.

320
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,100
I did what you said.

321
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,033
Where's their father?

322
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,500
Water's running.

323
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,700
Why is the bathroom faucet on?

324
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,433
Tear that up.

325
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,200
I said tear that up.

326
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,733
Mom.

327
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,400
It's okay.

328
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,567
If you listen to the man, we'll all be fine.

329
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,967
Right?

330
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,333
Sorry, Dad.

331
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,333
He's your dad.

332
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:34,333
If you listen to your dad, we'll all be okay.

333
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,367
Tear that up.

334
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,833
Listen to Dad.

335
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,100
Hurry up.

336
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,433
Where's Dad?

337
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,033
Where's my dad?

338
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:52,367
You're not my dad!

339
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,300
No, stop it.

340
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,933
Wait, I'll tear it up.

341
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,333
He's too young. Let me do it.

342
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,600
Seung Min, you...

343
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,167
Please, let me tear it!

344
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,833
Be quiet.

345
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,667
What's wrong?

346
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,167
Who else is here?

347
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,433
It's just us.

348
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:17,167
So Eun!

349
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,167
Honey, why are you lying?

350
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:25,400
I... I hear voices here.

351
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:27,433
Don't you hear them?

352
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:32,100
There's no sound. What voices?

353
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,833
No, no...

354
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,667
Are you saying I'm going crazy?

355
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,567
Why can't you hear this?

356
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,600
You baddie!

357
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,967
How dare you talk to Dad like that?

358
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,200
You are a baddie!

359
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,300
Seung Min, you...

360
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,933
You need to be punished.

361
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,000
- Seung Min! 
 - Mom!

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,167
- Seung Min! 
 - Mom! Mom!

363
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,367
Seung Min, no! Please!

364
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:56,833
Mom!

365
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,167
 - Apartments are shared living spaces.  
 - Seung Min!

366
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,233
 - Please be mindful of noise between floors.  
 - Mom!

367
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,900
Mom, help me!

368
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,733
- Mom, help me. 
  - Please wear soft shoes or walk lightly. 

369
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:09,133
Seung Min! Please, I'm begging you.

370
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,967
- I'll do everything you say. 
 - Mom.

371
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,700
Please, save my Seung Min.

372
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Dad! Dad!

373
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,767
Don't move. Police.

374
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Police.

375
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,633
Put your hands down. Slowly.

376
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,967
See? I told you someone was here!

377
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,367
Shut up and put your hands down! Slowly.

378
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,267
He peed himself.

379
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,467
I was just trying to clean him up.

380
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,167
Put the child down.

381
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,500
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, you are placed 
 under emergency arrest

382
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,200
on suspicion of the murder of 
 Kim Hyeon Woo and Kang Soo Cheol,

383
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
- and the disposal of their bodies. 
 - You are Seung Min, right?

384
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,632
I'll untie you now. Just wait a little.

385
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:46,567
You have the right to hire a lawyer,

386
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,433
- Let's go to Mom. 
 - ...to remain silent, and be aware that

387
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,700
anything you say can be used as evidence in court.

388
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,333
And when we get to the police station, 
 you're going to get scolded badly by me.

389
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,767
Yes, everything's secure. Don't worry.

390
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,567
 Hyeok, check the master bedroom. 

391
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,567
 Understood. 

392
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:06,767
- Mom, Mom! 
 - Hyeon Seo, come here. Seung Min.

393
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,900
Team Leader.

394
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,033
Mr. Kim Tae Seok is not home.

395
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,167
Good work.

396
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,200
- Got anything? 
 - Yes.

397
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,233
- Salute. 
 - Salute. Keep up the good work.

398
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,100
Thanks for the meal.

399
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,533
- Yeah, eat up. 
 - Enjoy.

400
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,900
The missing husband Kim Tae Seok 
 and Seo Ku Wan are half-brothers.

401
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,833
Half-brothers? So, they have different fathers?

402
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,733
Correct.

403
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,100
Seo Ku Wan's biological mother

404
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,567
had already relinquished parental rights 
 before giving birth to him.

405
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:53,333
So, Seo Ku Wan was transferred 
 from the hospital to an orphanage,

406
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,600
and his birth mother Kim Young Seon 
 got married just a few months later.

407
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,133
After marrying, she gave birth 
 to Kim Tae Seok the following year.

408
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:05,367
The biological mother Kim Young Seon 
 died from chronic illness a year ago.

409
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:09,900
Wait. The mother abandoned him, 
 so why target the half-brother?

410
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,100
"Reverse Life."

411
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,533
What's that?

412
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,700
When we checked Seo Ku Wan's internet history,

413
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,200
he'd repeatedly read this web novel 
 called "Reverse Life" dozens of times.

414
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,767
It's part of the 
 "reincarnation possession rebirth" genre.

415
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,200
Reincarnation... what?

416
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,900
Regression, possession, rebirth.

417
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,267
It's the so-called reincarnation genre, 
 a life that changes overnight.

418
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,300
For example,

419
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,100
someone from a poor background wakes up 
 one morning as the heir to a conglomerate.

420
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,767
But Noducheon, the moving warehouse case, 
 and Seo Ku Wan aren't really connected...

421
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,433
For now, focus only on Kim Tae Seok.

422
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,267
Use any means necessary to make him talk.

423
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,367
Kim Tae Seok's photo shouldn't be posted there.

424
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,700
- Got it? 
 - Yes, understood.

425
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,067
Mr. Kim Tae Seok.

426
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,533
Where is the husband of that family now?

427
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,867
Is he alive?

428
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:06,467
Mr. Seo, this behavior could work against you.

429
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:13,867
Mr. Seo, look at me 
 when I'm talking to you. Got it?

430
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,967
Mr. Seo.

431
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,800
You were abandoned, right? By your mother?

432
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:29,300
A mother. A wife. Cute kids. A happy family.

433
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,133
All of that could've been yours, right?

434
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,933
It was mine. Not "could've been".

435
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,933
It was just mine.

436
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:39,367
So, you wanted to take it all back? 
 Like in "Reverse Life"?

437
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:43,333
I took it? It was always mine.

438
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,733
Abandoned? That's your son.

439
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:50,700
That's what they call "giving up parental rights".

440
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,567
 Yeah, well, if I was left at an orphanage, 

441
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:57,000
then you abandoned a kid 
 with your useless husband.

442
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,467
- How did you... 
 - You abandoned him, right?

443
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,667
Because he's an autistic burden.

444
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,900
You heartless rat!

445
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,567
 - Was he ashamed?  
 - Get in there.

446
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,200
- Yes. 
  - You probably wanted to abandon him. 

447
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,900
It would've been better if he died.

448
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,600
Shut your darn mouth, you maniac!

449
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,033
- Manager! 
 - Let go of me!

450
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:16,167
Don't you see that's a predictable trick?

451
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,967
Manager Kim!

452
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,333
Hey.

453
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,100
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, what are you doing?

454
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,467
Just sit down. Sit.

455
00:31:57,867 --> 00:32:00,800
 However, here... 

456
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
 Are we really alone here? 

457
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,267
 Yes. 

458
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,133
 You're lying. 

459
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:14,067
Turn all these off and everyone get out.

460
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,667
You see that?

461
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:31,900
I've never seen Manager Kim get that worked up.

462
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,210
I knew you'd investigated our backgrounds,

463
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,660
but I didn't expect you to know about... that.

464
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:42,500
Ah, well, the district office 
 has all sorts of documents.

465
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,700
I filled in the gaps by doing some legwork.

466
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,367
Why Kim Tae Seok?

467
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,420
If that punk had never been born,

468
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:59,300
my mother would've come back for me for sure.

469
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,233
She might have.

470
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,380
So, did you even go so far

471
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,260
as to kill Mr. Kim Tae Seok?

472
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,633
Q... Queen Mantis...

473
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,733
How was your mother? What kind of person was she?

474
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,133
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

475
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,867
I know that she doesn't want others to know.

476
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:43,267
If I tell you, will you tell me 
 where Kim Tae Seok is?

477
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:54,400
Come on. We're having an important discussion.

478
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,033
Let's keep it down!

479
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,033
Don't mind them.

480
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:04,600
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, you know 
 how Jeong I Sin lives in prison. Right?

481
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,167
Espresso? I heard from the guards.

482
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:11,533
That's because we negotiated with her.

483
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,900
You should do the same, Mr. Seo.

484
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,800
Give one to get one.

485
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,267
Even I only make these offers 
 to Queen Mantis-level figures.

486
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:28,067
So, what do you think about your mother?

487
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,867
She's a criminal.

488
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,633
So, um...

489
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:52,833
15 kg, that would be about this much?

490
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,300
What do you mean?

491
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,333
The child's weight.

492
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,867
They said it was a 10-year-old.

493
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,950
The ankles were worn to the bone,

494
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,700
and they were chained.

495
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:16,350
 One nostril was crushed, 

496
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,900
and because it was disgusting to breathe,

497
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,133
he burned it with a heated spoon.

498
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:24,800
What are you talking about?

499
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,600
That beast's father.

500
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,967
The Queen Mantis herself killed that monster.

501
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,467
And you still call her just a criminal? Jeez...

502
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:43,867
Well, let's just be frank.

503
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:46,367
You've killed someone before, right?

504
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:50,067
Or almost killed?

505
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:59,300
Why so hesitant? That's why you became a cop.

506
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That look... Now you look like her son.

507
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:25,433
Your insight... I never thought of it that way.

508
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,633
You... You've got sharp instincts.

509
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,367
Seems like we understand each other.

510
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,567
Just drop a single clue, will you?

511
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:42,233
Where's Kim Tae Seok... No.

512
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,200
First, let's confirm if he's even alive.

513
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,833
What now?

514
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,867
Are we understanding each other?

515
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,800
Not at all.

516
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
He knows nothing.

517
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:44,167
No choice then. Let's get her.

518
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:49,133
He's a Queen Mantis fanatic.

519
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,167
He'll talk in front of her.

520
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,616
What?

521
00:37:55,616 --> 00:38:00,000
Do we have to keep relying on Jeong I Sin?

522
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,567
Even though it's info I got from her, 
 I have to pretend

523
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,033
I found it myself in front of the team.

524
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,933
And seeing her toss us little hints 
 and smirk like that,

525
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:10,300
I can't do that either.

526
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,133
Su Yul,

527
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,700
about that time...

528
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
The incident 23 years ago.

529
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,967
There's something I never told you.

530
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,300
Here. You worked hard today.

531
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,867
You really don't have to give her 
 something like this.

532
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,400
It's okay.

533
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
What are you doing? You should say "Thank you".

534
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,667
Thank you.

535
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes.

536
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,533
- Let's go. 
 - Goodbye.

537
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,367
Bye.

538
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,300
You love kids so much, but don't have any plans?

539
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,733
Raising you is already overwhelming.

540
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:15,767
A latte?

541
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,667
No, black coffee for me.

542
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,533
So, no plans for children?

543
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,467
Should I ask Su Yul?

544
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:27,033
Ugh, don't. He hates that kind of talk.

545
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,567
It's because of Cha Su Yul, huh?

546
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,500
But usually when people lose their parents,

547
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,233
don't they want kids even more 
 to fight loneliness?

548
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:38,667
Yes, that's me.

549
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,433
Sorry.

550
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,233
That's not what I meant, Jeong Yun.

551
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:47,100
It's fine. Because I think so, too.

552
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:51,733
On my parents' death anniversaries, 
 I think about it more.

553
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,433
I want a child.

554
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,700
But Su Yul, his memories with his parents...

555
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,910
Weren't good?

556
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:05,533
He doesn't say it, 
 but sometimes calls "Mom" in his sleep.

557
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,567
A tough detective crying for his mom while asleep?

558
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,533
Su Yul's adorable. So cute.

559
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:14,533
If they were alive, 
 I'd try to mediate their reconciliation.

560
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,900
Huh? What does that mean?

561
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,433
It's totally a blessing that 
 your in-laws aren't around.

562
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,900
What nonsense...

563
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,467
Hey.

564
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,867
Oh, right! You wanted black coffee, huh?

565
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,367
 Hello, hello. 

566
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,610
I'm not sure if it's the right call

567
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,030
to bring the suspect 
 in the ongoing investigation here.

568
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,367
This is a precautionary measure.

569
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,667
We meet like this.

570
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,767
Wait, where is this place?

571
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,600
This doesn't look like prison.

572
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,533
You copied my methods exactly?

573
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,867
As closely as possible.

574
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:29,500
Why did you do that?

575
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:36,167
The world needs to know what the Queen Mantis did.

576
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:40,867
Everyone needs to know 
 how you handled those worthless scumbags.

577
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,167
They need to know everything.

578
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,033
 I mean it. 

579
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,833
Yeah?

580
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,800
How did it feel?

581
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,700
Uh... amazing.

582
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,400
Totally thrilling.

583
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,667
Just like you said, it was no big deal.

584
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Why use an axe?

585
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,600
It ends too quickly that way.

586
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
That's because...

587
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,833
That's...

588
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:28,767
Blood must've splattered on your face.

589
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:31,067
Did it spray on your face?

590
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,233
How did it feel?

591
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,230
Um, well...

592
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,367
After the head rolled, how many 
 seconds did they keep breathing?

593
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,533
Twenty seconds?

594
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,633
Thirty seconds?

595
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,133
Tell me.

596
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:55,833
You enjoyed it because of me. 
 You should talk then.

597
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,433
You're lying, huh?

598
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:17,900
You didn't kill anyone, right?

599
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,567
No, it's not.

600
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,736
You just held a gun, right? Because 
 you were too scared to actually use it.

601
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:25,200
- No... 
 - You didn't even have bullets, right?

602
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,333
See? You think a coward like you can mimic me?

603
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,267
Get lost.

604
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,367
No, I killed him.

605
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,867
That punk Kim Tae Seok...

606
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:41,433
Dead. He must be dead.

607
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:45,567
Must be dead?

608
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,533
So did you just dump him in some river?

609
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:56,200
Maybe? You were too scared to finish it yourself?

610
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
No, that's not true.

611
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,767
No?

612
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:03,367
Then, where and how did you do it?

613
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:07,433
 Tell me. How did you do it? 

614
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,500
I fixed everything. Right from the start...

615
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:18,300
You can't tell, right? 
 Because you didn't kill him.

616
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,700
No guts, scared.

617
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:31,084
That's right, you are so cowardly,

618
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:35,133
and that's why your mother abandoned you.

619
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:40,167
She realized early on 
 her child would be this pathetic.

620
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,767
You. You tramp.

621
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,033
These pigs.

622
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,033
They're all...

623
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,733
Why?

624
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:01,167
All because of that cop, your son, huh?

625
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,167
Then, what about me?

626
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,333
I followed you all the way here!

627
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,333
Just because I'm not blood?

628
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,667
That's why you're treating me like this?

629
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,200
Ah, I get it. I'll expose everything.

630
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,300
The serial killer Jeong I Sin is alive!

631
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,267
And her son is the active-duty cop, Cha Su Yul!

632
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:32,167
Lee Jeong Yun.

633
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,967
I'll reveal even that pig's wife's name 
 to the whole world.

634
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,233
Jeong I Sin!

635
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,467
Let go of him! Let him go!

636
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:09,633
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

637
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,167
Let go! I said let go!

638
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,192
- Hey, snap out of it. 
 - Seo Ku Wan.

639
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:17,216
Seo Ku Wan!

640
00:46:17,216 --> 00:46:18,240
- Snap out of it! 
 - Seo Ku Wan!

641
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,967
Are you crazy?

642
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,667
- Director Park. 
 - Seo Ku Wan!

643
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,933
We need to end this.

644
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:26,800
We have to kill him now.

645
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,767
You heard everything, no? He knows it all.

646
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,000
 Get a grip, Seo Ku Wan. 

647
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,833
 Seo Ku Wan, are you okay? 

648
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,933
Seo Ku Wan!

649
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,267
Hey, you punk! Hey!

650
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:39,267
- Seo Ku Wan. 
 - Seo Ku Wan!

651
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,533
All exits are sealed.

652
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,967
Seo Ku Wan!

653
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:55,367
Don't come any closer, you pigs!

654
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,300
Calm down. Calm down and lower your gun.

655
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
Shut up.

656
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,033
Seo Ku Wan, this will only make it harder for you.

657
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:20,300
Who's there? Come out. Come out!

658
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Come out, you devil!

659
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,233
Wait a minute, wait.

660
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:28,867
It's too noisy. All of you.

661
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,433
Hey, Seo Ku Wan.

662
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,333
Right, it's too noisy.

663
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:40,467
It's not just you hearing it.

664
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:43,367
I hear it, too. Seo Ku Wan.

665
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:55,800
I know it, too.

666
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,600
You're lying.

667
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:25,760
Commissioner,

668
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,200
thank you for saving me and the kids yesterday. 
    

669
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,367
I'm truly grateful.

670
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,100
But my husband... I still don't know where he is.

671
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,800
Could something have gone wrong...

672
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
I still haven't heard anything about my husband.

673
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,067
Please, find my husband.

674
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm begging you, Commissioner. Please save him.

675
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,333
Please...

676
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,867
 Yes. 

677
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,300
Yes, understood.

678
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,233
All right.

679
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:04,133
At the headquarters' main gate, 
 Kim Tae Seok's wife is causing a scene.

680
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:06,333
They told us to stay away since it's chaotic.

681
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,832
What? Are we the criminals?

682
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:09,833
Where are you going?

683
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,933
Shouldn't we make Seo Ku Wan talk?

684
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:13,233
Seo Ku Wan isn't here.

685
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,233
- What? 
 - What?

686
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:17,480
Chief and Team Leader 
 took him somewhere earlier.

687
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,230
Didn't you hear?

688
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:21,840
Darn it.

689
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:30,600
Sir? Sir. You need to pull yourself together, sir.

690
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,100
What's this person's name?

691
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,767
It's Seo Ku Wan. Seo Ku Wan.

692
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:35,933
Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

693
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:39,033
Mr. Seo Ku Wan, pull yourself together. 
 Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

694
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,133
- The director... 
 - Where are you?

695
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,500
 Yeah, I'm following you. What about Seo Ku Wan? 

696
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,967
His condition is critical, but he's conscious.

697
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:46,200
 You saw when he talked 
 to Jeong I Sin earlier, right? 

698
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,133
Seo Ku Wan has nothing to do 
 with the copycat murders.

699
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:50,433
The real problem is her husband, Kim Tae Seok.

700
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,967
We need to make Seo Ku Wan talk quickly.

701
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:55,067
As long as Kim Tae Seok 
 comes back alive, no one will be hurt

702
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:56,800
and Seo Ku Wan will fade 
 from the media's attention.

703
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,200
If he won't talk?

704
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,467
Then, we make him talk.

705
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:01,133
What if he keeps dodging questions?

706
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:03,000
It's not about Kim Tae Seok...

707
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,033
Mr. Seo Ku Wan.

708
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:07,133
What if he only talks about me and that woman?

709
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,367
Don't worry. I've already informed the director.

710
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:12,033
Jeong I Sin also stayed at that hospital 
 during her incarceration.

711
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:14,367
Seo Ku Wan  will be completely cut off from the outside. 

712
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,267
 For now, focus on Kim Tae Seok... 

713
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:17,633
I'm getting a call from Manager Kim.

714
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,367
Just give a vague answer, okay?

715
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,067
Huh?

716
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:29,300
Yes, understood.

717
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,800
What did he say?

718
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,712
He apparently tried to harm himself 
 in the detention center?

719
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:38,000
They're transferring him to the hospital.

720
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,776
What?

721
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:41,440
Was he badly hurt?

722
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,167
Darn, that guy's insane.

723
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,667
Mr. Seo Ku Wan. We're almost there.

724
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,267
 We need to end this. 

725
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,933
 You heard everything, no? He knows it all. 

726
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:59,267
 Lee Jeong Yun. 

727
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,867
 I'll reveal even that pig's wife's name 
 to the whole world. 

728
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,233
 We have to kill him now. 

729
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,133
Mr. Seo Ku Wan! Mr. Seo Ku Wan!

730
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,700
What's happening?

731
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,867
- What's wrong? 
 - Cardiac arrest.

732
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:17,933
- Assist breathing. One, two, three, four, five... 
 - Mr. Seo Ku Wan...

733
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:19,400
Seo Ku Wan!

734
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,000
No! Seo Ku Wan!

735
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,133
How is he?

736
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,030
Luckily, the bullet only grazed him,

737
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,930
but his skull is fractured, and there's bleeding.

738
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:04,433
Treatment is done and he's alive, 
 but total rest is required.

739
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:08,267
A security guard is stationed 
 in his isolation room,

740
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:11,300
and security is tight, so don't worry.

741
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,933
Remember when Jeong I Sin asked 
 what he did to Kim Tae Seok,

742
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:26,167
Seo Ku Wan said "he must be dead" 
 rather than "he is dead,"

743
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,967
as if he wasn't really sure himself?

744
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:31,200
 No, I killed him. 

745
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,200
 That punk Kim Tae Seok. 

746
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,133
 Dead. He must be dead. 

747
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:48,300
 Did you just dump him in some river? 

748
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,933
Section Chief.

749
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,533
Seo Ku Wan couldn't counter 
 Jeong I Sin's statement.

750
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:58,200
If he really killed him, 
 he would've given a different answer.

751
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:03,000
But what if Seo Ku Wan just left

752
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,100
Kim Tae Seok in a situation where he could die,

753
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,267
without directly killing him?

754
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:17,100
That means Kim Tae Seok 
 could still be alive somewhere.

755
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,800
So we still have time.

756
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:26,100
But the only one who knows the location 
 is lying in there like that.

757
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:34,467
 I fixed everything. Right from the start... 

758
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:39,500
What? Why?

759
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,333
Uh, well...

760
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,267
Hey, Su Yul. What?

761
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,000
Yes, Ji An.

762
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,333
What's all this?

763
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,367
   

764
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:55,800
Almost every year since 2007, 
 he took photos at the same hospital?

765
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,600
Seo Ku Wan believes Kim Tae Seok stole his life.

766
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,467
He's convinced their lives were swapped.

767
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:06,133
And before Seo Ku Wan self-harmed, 
 he told me and the Section Chief

768
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:09,233
that he didn't kill him, but that he must be dead.

769
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:12,233
He claimed he had fixed everything from the start.

770
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:17,100
If he didn't kill him directly, 
 but left him somewhere to die,

771
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,300
then the place would be 
 where he believed his misfortune began,

772
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,067
which would be this hospital 
 where he was abandoned. Right?

773
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:27,267
Wait, look at these photos.

774
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,633
Taking pictures of one place obsessively for years

775
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,900
means this place is important to that punk.

776
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,400
What does everyone think about 
 Team Leader Cha's opinion?

777
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,333
If two days pass after a disappearance, 
 the survival rate drops to just 30%.

778
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,800
We're running out of time.

779
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,867
Please trust me and follow my lead.

780
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:47,533
I've never talked nonsense before, right?

781
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:48,800
What? Is investigation a religion?

782
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,600
What's there to blindly believe in?

783
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,333
Was the narcotics team's investigation 
 based on mere hunches?

784
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,133
Enough.

785
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,033
Let's move out now.

786
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,867
If there's even a small lead, we should check it.

787
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:03,600
Besides, Team Leader's theory isn't unreasonable.

788
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,933
Right. Let's search everywhere. Move out.

789
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:08,533
Report in real-time upon arrival.

790
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:09,700
Did everyone hear that?

791
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,800
Heungshin Sageori Yeonam General Hospital. Move.

792
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,533
Let's go.

793
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:24,367
The killer probably mimicked Jeong I Sin.

794
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,000
Since the third murder was a drowning,

795
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,733
let's assume drowning 
 and look for locations with water.

796
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,400
Let's go.

797
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,067
I'm from Southern Provincial Police Station.

798
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,933
I've checked the underground reservoir.

799
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,267
I checked the laundry room.

800
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,633
 How is it going? 

801
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,700
Ah, nothing. Nothing here.

802
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,733
 What now? 

803
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,233
Should we check for dishwaters?

804
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:42,933
 Hey, let's go. 

805
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:55,033
Ugh, this feels like a wild goose chase.

806
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:03,167
Hey, why don't we just pressure 
 Seo Ku Wan to make him talk?

807
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,300
He's in a coma from self-harm anyway.

808
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,067
Continuing the search here 
 seems like a waste of time...

809
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,733
Ji An, found anything?

810
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,400
Nothing so far.

811
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,800
I've scrubbed through days of footage,

812
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,400
 but no sign of Seo Ku Wan. 

813
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,128
 He's definitely here somewhere... 

814
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:23,432
 I killed him. That punk Kim Tae Seok. 

815
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:28,360
 Dead. He must be dead. 

816
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,667
 He couldn't finish it himself. 

817
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:35,267
 He must've left him 
 in a lethal situation somewhere. 

818
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,864
   

819
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,600
Good work. Well...

820
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,933
Is this going to the ward's laundry room?

821
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:53,267
Nah, that's too small.

822
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,033
We do the laundry at the laundry factory.

823
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:56,767
But there's no such thing in the directory.

824
00:57:56,767 --> 00:58:00,167
Who would mark that place on it?

825
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,500
Where is it?

826
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,784
- Downloading now. 
 - Good job.

827
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:09,533
What now? Let's at least return to base.

828
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:12,333
How can we go back without Team Leader?

829
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,467
Annex, laundry factory!

830
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,433
What?

831
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,467
Seong Kyu, over here.

832
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,567
Team Leader!

833
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:40,333
My god!

834
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,304
Jeez!

835
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,433
Mr. Kim Tae Seok! Mr. Kim!

836
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:55,033
Seong Kyu!

837
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,167
Seong Kyu, call an ambulance.

838
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,933
Don't die.

839
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:08,167
Mr. Kim Tae Seok!

840
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,733
Don't die.

841
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:15,533
Don't die!

842
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,533
You can't die!

843
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:22,200
Please, please.

844
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,867
 No! 

845
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:22,970


846
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,030
   

847
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,433
 They've set up the mirror like some kind of 4DX. 

848
01:00:35,433 --> 01:00:37,567
 It must be a message for us. 

849
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,500
 "Don't bother the wrong person 
 and waste your time doing stupid stuff". 

850
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,967
 I saw it on TV. 

851
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:43,567
 You didn't go and meet your mom again, right? 

852
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:46,700
 Lee Jeong Yun, does she know about me, too? 

853
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,233
 That's number 0 here. 

854
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:50,367
 It's only a number, 
 but there's no material at all. 

855
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:52,300
 You can't just slap a number on it 
 without any reason. 

856
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,900
 The first murder we don't know about. 

857
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,467
 How would Seo Ku Wan know about that? 

858
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,933
 There are more than just five people, right? 

859
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:01,000
 Jeong I Sin!
