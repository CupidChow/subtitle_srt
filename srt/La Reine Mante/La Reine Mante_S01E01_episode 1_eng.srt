00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:00,980
   

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,300
   

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,500
 Violent Crimes Investigation Team 1 
 has arrived at the scene. 

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,367
 Team Leader Seo from the forensic team 
 has already started processing the scene. 

18
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,167
 We'll begin securing the entrance roads 
 to Noducheon Riverside Park. 

19
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,567
 We've obtained CCTV footage 
 from nearby trails and the park. 

20
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,733
 Manager Kim, the reporters are already here. 

21
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,733
 Seong Gyu, control the reporters 
 and move the police line further back. 

22
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,733
 All right. 

23
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:25,033
 Hyeok, leave the crowd control at the entrance 
 to other officers and get here fast. 

24
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,700
 Yes. 

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,100
 What about the reporters? 

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,433
 They came after seeing 
 the victim's body posted on social media, 

27
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,300
 so it's hard to control them. 

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,833
 The cordon setup is complete. 

29
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,533
 Fortunately, the crime scene remains intact. 
   

30
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,500
 Chief, how much longer will you take? 

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,680
   

32
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,467
Wait a minute.

33
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:59,800
The victim is Kim Hyeon Woo, 43 years old.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,767
The immediate cause of death appears to be 
 strangulation via neck compression.

35
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:05,133
Neither his phone nor his wallet was found on him.

36
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,500
How was the victim identified?

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,067
He was wearing an electronic ankle monitor.

38
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:13,600
He'd been out of prison for 8 months 
 after a sexual assault conviction.

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
Hey, what are you doing at the scene?

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,533
Go do it over there.

41
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,233
You're here?

42
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,133
Any notable findings?

43
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,700
There's an injection mark on his neck, 
 and his tongue has been cut out.

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,967
We haven't found the severed tongue yet.

45
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,133
I'll measure body temperature 
 to estimate the time of death.

46
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,533
Team Leader Seo, a moment please.

47
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:46,800
First, check from the lower body upwards.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,533
Understood.

49
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:07,067
Section Chief, from below, 
 we've recovered the severed tongue.

50
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,667
Section Chief.

51
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,733
This...

52
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:21,000
Manager Kim, secure the scene thoroughly first.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,300
Yes.

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,333
 You can't come in. 

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,328
 Please step back. 

56
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:30,417
 Please step back. 

57
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,833
   

58
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,100
   

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,567
 Find anything? 

60
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:48,064
 The forensics team just discovered 
 a severed tongue in the victim's rectum. 

61
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:48,967
 Nothing else. 

62
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,467
 Good Lord. His tongue? His tongue? 

63
00:03:56,267 --> 00:04:01,467
 Well... I've never handled 
 such a bizarre murder case. 

64
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,800
 Jung Ho, this is your first time, too. Right? 

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 Yes. 

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
 What should we even do about this? 

67
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,367
   

68
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,667
   

69
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,400
   

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,633
   

71
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,667
   

72
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,000
 We will definitely catch the killer. 

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 - Let's catch the killer! 
 - Let's catch the killer! 

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,067
 Since last fall, centered around
Woongsan and Yeonpo, 

75
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,067
 the perpetrator behind these gruesome murders 
 has been urgently arrested 

76
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,433
 and is being transferred to 
 the special investigation headquarters. 

77
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:11,500
 Yes, Reporter Park. The public 
 has been calling the killer "Queen Mantis". 

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,800
 Why is that? 

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
 All identified victims 

80
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,867
 were men who had committed violence 
 against women, including their wives, 

81
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:22,100
 or were suspected of child abuse. 

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,167
 Mantises are commonly known 
 as insects that bite off 

83
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,767
 the male's head after mating. 

84
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,867
 The prisoner transport vehicle is arriving now. 

85
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:29,900
 - It's coming. 
 - It's coming. 

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,000
 Stop pushing! Don't push! 

87
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,312
 Don't push! Stay back! 

88
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,133
 - When did you start planning this? 
 - Say something to the victims' families! 

89
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,833
 Do you admit to all five murder charges? 

90
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,900
 Do you have any final words? 

91
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,467
 Do you admit to all five murder charges? 

92
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,467
 Chief, please give us a statement. 

93
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,333
 - Do you admit to all criminal charges? 
 - Chief! 

94
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,233
 Do you admit to all five murder charges? 

95
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,367
 Why did you kill them? 

96
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,200
 Do you confess to all crimes? 

97
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,433
 We've obtained a confession 
 from the suspect regarding the case, 

98
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:08,367
 but after thorough investigation, 
 we'll hold an official briefing. 

99
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,467
 Please say something to the bereaved families. 

100
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,133
 Please share your thoughts. 

101
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:16,433
 As our nation prepares for 
 the 2002 Korea -Japan World Cup, 

102
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,300
 we stand against violent crimes... 

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,360
   

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,733
   

105
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,567
Hyeon Woo,

106
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,533
you went to the Changhyeon area, huh?

107
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,467
Who did you have pork belly with?

108
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,633
I'll find out who you met with

109
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,613
and how your tongue got cut off.

110
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,267
I will uncover everything.

111
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,900
- CCTV doesn't lie. 
 - Uh... Manager.

112
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,500
Go and get some rest for a while.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
   

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,567
How many days has it been already?

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,933
Excuse me, Manager.

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,933
Can't you see I'm concentrating? 
    

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,333
Oppa,

118
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,100
give me strength.

119
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,133
Wow.

120
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,533
What did you do?

121
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,633
You ordered this knowing she'd react like this?

122
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,700
- Yes. 
 - Oh, come on.

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,433
- Manager. 
 - Manager Kim.

124
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,333
- Manager! 
 - Hey, Manager Kim! Call 911!

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,567
- Okay. 
 - Hey, Manager Kim!

126
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,167
   

127
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,900
 The administration stated readiness 
 to hold candid discussions 

128
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,100
 and proposed to convene cross-party talks 
 immediately after recovery 

129
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,467
 once the Prime Minister's health improves. 

130
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,440
 We previously reported 
 on the body found last night  

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,000
 near Noducheon in the city of Namseung. 

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,100
 Around 8:30 p.m., a resident 
 who was walking near the river 

133
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,200
 discovered the body and reported it to the police. 

134
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,133
 Upon receiving the report, 
 the police collected the body 

135
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,500
 and stated that an autopsy will be conducted 
 to determine the exact cause of death. 

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,033
 The police, noting signs that 
   

137
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,033
 the body had been moved 
 and injuries on the corpse, 

138
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,300
 are investigating the possibility of homicide 

139
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,033
 and are working to identify witnesses 

140
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,700
 and review nearby CCTV. 

141
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,033
 Today, Commissioner Hong Seung Pyo 
 of Southern Provincial Police Station 

142
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,367
 stated that the victim's identity 
 has already been confirmed 

143
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,667
 and that the investigation 

144
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,300
 is focusing on people close to the victim. 

145
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,060
   

146
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,767
Over here.

147
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,667
That way.

148
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,433
 Anyone there? 

149
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,320
Darn.

150
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,500
Hey, call an ambulance.

151
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,133
Yes, understood.

152
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,333
Sir, we're the police.

153
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,233
Can you see me?

154
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,233
Can you hear me?

155
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,167
Sir.

156
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,800
The ambulance is coming soon.

157
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
Your family is safe.

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,233
 You can make it. 

159
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,733
 We'll catch the person who did this, 

160
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,032
so stay awake.

161
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,033
Who did this?

162
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,333
Do you remember who stabbed you?

163
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,633
Sir.

164
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,967
Yellow hat...

165
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,467
Blue jacket...

166
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,240
Yellow hat and blue jacket.

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,300
Go quickly.

168
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,533
Here are two signs of drugs, 
 two more signs of drugs.

169
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,933
 Yellow hat, blue jacket. 

170
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:16,600
Excuse me. It's okay. You're okay.

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,200
We called an ambulance. 
 Just hold on a little longer...

172
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,833
Mom! Mom!

173
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,800
Sir!

174
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,633
Sir!

175
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,333
Mom!

176
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,767
Mom!

177
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,100
- Don't! 
 - Stop!

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,533
Ma'am, don't move.

179
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,800
- Stay still. 
 - Mom.

180
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,028
Sweetie, it's dangerous.

181
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,400
- Come to me. 
 - Mom.

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,433
Ma'am.

183
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:51,233
- Your husband just died. 
 - Mom.

184
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,533
Your husband is dead.

185
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,433
Even while dying,

186
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,767
he lied about someone else stabbing him.

187
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,500
Do you want your child to die, too?

188
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,267
Ma'am!

189
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,833
Mom!

190
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,667
Mom! Don't!

191
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,700
You monster!

192
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,533
Just die!

193
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,000
There's a child here! Are you insane?

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,267
What's wrong with you?

195
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,800
She said she suddenly felt foggy.

196
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,867
We haven't even seen 
 Manager Kim going home these days.

197
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,733
I know the situation,

198
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,833
but there won't be any team 
 reinforcements for the time being.

199
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,067
Section Chief, we're all really struggling.

200
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:49,832
Please don't insist. 
 The team leader position is vacant, right?

201
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:50,567
Yes.

202
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,100
I think Manager Kim Na Hee 
 would be perfect for it.

203
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,933
- Manager Kim? 
 - Yes.

204
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:57,567
Yes, she's basically acting 
 as team leader already,

205
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,400
and we're all fine with it.

206
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,500
If the higher-ups just support her this once,

207
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
we'll really work hard.

208
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,733
Got it.

209
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,333
I'll make the official appointment soon.

210
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,567
Thank you. Loyalty.

211
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,933
Thank you.

212
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,267
   

213
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,833
   

214
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,433
Why did you shoot?

215
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,000
What if the kid got hit? Why did you shoot?

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,100
Do you think if a cop kills an innocent kid,

217
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,233
you'd just resign and that's it?

218
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,233
Then, should I just let the child die?

219
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,667
- Section Chief Noh. 
 - What?

220
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,933
The child's mother's surgery went well, 
 and her life is out of danger.

221
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
She's not the mother.

222
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,533
What?

223
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,533
A mother who tries to kill 
 her own child isn't a mother.

224
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,133
If she's not the mom, it's okay to let her die?

225
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,400
Section Chief, stop exaggerating.

226
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,130
I shot her leg to stop her.

227
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,500
A mother trying to throw 
 her kid off the 4th floor roof...

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,667
The child almost died.

229
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,700
For this case, if there's an official investigation, 
 I'll comply. Okay?

230
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Jeez, you...

231
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,633
How many times must I say it?

232
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:34,233
We're not here to punish people; we prevent crimes.

233
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:38,233
You should've tried other options 
 before shooting, you punk.

234
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,880
Hey.

235
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,900
This time you're not getting away.

236
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,033
Why's that brat acting like that?

237
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,244
 Who'll take her now? 

238
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:51,133
 Who? 

239
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,500
 The drug addict's daughter. 

240
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,733
 They're going to apply for institutional care 
 via the Child Welfare Department... 

241
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,733
 Then, who takes him? 

242
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,433
 Her husband ran away, so there's no contact. 

243
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,737
 Do we just leave him there? 

244
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,500
 You're Jeong Ho, right? 

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,500
   

246
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,200
It's complete chaos, absolute chaos.

247
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,400
It's driving me crazy.

248
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,533
In the end, it's just a conspiracy theory.

249
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,167
Queen Mantis.

250
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,867
Have you met her since then?

251
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:35,167
No, ultimately the prosecution handled it.

252
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,233
Are you okay?

253
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,367
If it's too much, we can hand 
 this case over to another team.

254
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,367
It's not too much.

255
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,033
Our team can handle it.

256
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:47,567
Back then, you suffered the most, Jung Ho.

257
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:53,567
She insisted on talking only to me, 
 so there was no choice.

258
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,867
I wanted to see it through since I'd already started.

259
00:14:56,867 --> 00:15:00,867
Yeah, thanks to that, you even got promoted a rank.

260
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:05,433
A serial killer who killed five people

261
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,900
set up her prison like a hotel,

262
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,933
eating and drinking just like us?

263
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:15,033
And secretly, funded by taxpayers...

264
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,433
That woman was drawing human anatomy every day.

265
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,467
It's really creepy, really chilling.

266
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,667
And she's so picky about drinks,

267
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,333
and only drinks espresso?

268
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:40,400
 Jeong Ho, come here. 

269
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,433
Yes.

270
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,100
This was one of the things Jeong I Sin demanded

271
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,367
in exchange for her confession.

272
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,033
All the higher-ups who made the final decisions

273
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,833
have either retired or died,

274
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,033
leaving only you and me at the scene.

275
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,967
So when shit hits the fan,

276
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,200
it's you and me who end up covered in it.

277
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
It won't be leaked.

278
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,233
Right now, almost nobody in the organization knows.

279
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:16,233
If it comes out this case was 
 a Queen Mantis copycat murder,

280
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,100
people will be shouting the Queen Mantis' name,

281
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,500
demanding to know where she is, 
 asking for info to be released.

282
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,600
The Queen Mantis died 
 while serving time in prison.

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,667
That's what everyone believes.

284
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,567
I'm saying this because things 
 didn't turn out that way.

285
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,200
Once we catch the culprit, it's done.

286
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,867
We'll wrap it up.

287
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,000
Since you caught Jeong I Sin,

288
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,900
make sure to catch this copycat quickly, too.

289
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,133
It's been a while.

290
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,000
 There's a condition this time, just like before. 

291
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,233
Su Yul.

292
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,033
Cha Su Yul!

293
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:43,533
Our dear Inspector Cha Su Yul,

294
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,333
did you catch a lot of druggies today, too?

295
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,000
What's with the sudden visit?

296
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,567
Just, you know... I wanted to see you?

297
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,067
Is Jeong Yun doing well?

298
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,533
Wait, aren't you busy?

299
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,933
You've been stuck on the Noducheon case 
 for over a month, right?

300
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,300
Ugh, tell me about it.

301
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,800
It's driving me crazy.

302
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
That's why I came to see you.

303
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
You're way smarter than I am, right?

304
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,500
So, help me out a bit.

305
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,133
Ah, there's no time, just take a quick look.

306
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:17,000
What would I even know if I looked at it?

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,233
Forget it.

308
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,233
I'm done with this crap, too.

309
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,667
What now? Did you mess up again?

310
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,133
Yes, I messed up.

311
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,533
Ah, come on out. I need to go home early.

312
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,667
Ah, don't be like that, just a little...

313
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,233
Please.

314
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,967
Stop whining, mister.

315
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,033
I have to look at it if I'm going to send you away.

316
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,800
Let's see.

317
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,767
Ugh, this rat... he uses people's tongues to...

318
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,867
He's the type who enjoys it.

319
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:46,900
How does it feel?

320
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,067
Feels like... he gets so into it,

321
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,933
he loses himself and goes all in, just for fun.

322
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,767
Wait a second.

323
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,400
Ouch! It hurts.

324
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,867
Don't struggle.

325
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,033
I'll let you go once you hear me out.

326
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,033
What's this about?

327
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:07,933
He replicated a murder from 23 years ago exactly.

328
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,033
Just like you said, 
 he's having the time of his life.

329
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,933
This isn't the end of it.

330
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:16,567
But we haven't even gotten close to the culprit.

331
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,567
Hang in there.

332
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,600
Let's talk after you uncuff me, okay?

333
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Su Yul, wrap up what you're doing by this week,

334
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,567
and take a day off first.

335
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,100
What are you talking about?

336
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,800
Jeong I Sin agreed to help with this case.

337
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,467
Huh?

338
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,700
However, Jeong I Sin...

339
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,867
wants to communicate only through you.

340
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,033
Since the Commissioner approved it,

341
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,033
join our team.

342
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,563
Darn!

343
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,467
Uncuff me right now! Okay?

344
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,733
People are getting beheaded and drowned...

345
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,900
If we don't catch the killer now, 
 more victims will follow.

346
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,367
We have to act before it blows up.

347
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:09,033
Ignoring people we could save,

348
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,567
how is that different from killing them?

349
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you crazy, mister?

350
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What did you just say to me?

351
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,800
Are you telling me to meet her?

352
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,867
Ah, this guy... what a temper.

353
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,900
The key's in the pocket.

354
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,367
Su Yul,

355
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,267
think carefully.

356
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:29,233
 Jeong I Sin agreed to help with this case. 

357
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,967
 However, Jeong I Sin... 

358
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,600
 wants to communicate only through you. 

359
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,467
Huh?

360
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,967
What are you doing?

361
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,367
What's wrong?

362
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,600
What's wrong? What's wrong?

363
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,300
Wait, you said this was hard to get.

364
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,867
I did.

365
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:58,267
But I was blaming the soil too much.

366
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,500
The color doesn't come out because of this soil,

367
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,800
and the texture is rough because of that soil...

368
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,333
Actually, it's my skill that's the problem. Right?

369
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,433
- Should I just throw it all away? 
 - No, no...

370
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,500
Wait a minute.

371
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,867
This...

372
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,533
Just... put it all back again.

373
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,933
There we go.

374
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,967
Right?

375
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,400
Come here, Jeong Yun.

376
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,633
Take a deep breath.

377
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,800
One, two, three.

378
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,367
One, two, three.

379
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't do anything you'll regret.

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,333
One, two, three.

381
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:26,067
   

382
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:30,267
 Cha Su Yul, you should be a cop. 

383
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:33,300
 Since five people have died, 

384
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,167
 you need to save five people. 

385
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,467
 Ignoring people we could save, 

386
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:41,733
 how is that different from killing them? 

387
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,467
Commissioner, I heard the victim 
 was decapitated. Is that true?

388
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,300
Could this be the same perpetrator 
 as the Noducheon murder?

389
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,433
Since this is an ongoing investigation,

390
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,800
we'll hold an official briefing.

391
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,100
Then...

392
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,600
- Commissioner! 
 - Commissioner!

393
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
 Is this connected to the Noducheon case? 

394
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,600
 - Give us a statement. 
 - Make a statement before leaving! 

395
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,967
What does she want in return?

396
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,633
She wouldn't help us for no reason.

397
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,333
Jeong I Sin has two conditions.

398
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,967
One is you, and the other is the location.

399
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,967
She wants to meet outside the prison.

400
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,167
Good, I guess.

401
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,333
It'll be easier for us to come and go.

402
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,384
What about security?

403
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,833
Don't worry about that.

404
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,933
Everything's been arranged.

405
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,300
Are you okay?

406
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,667
I feel... nothing, really.

407
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,900
Her face keeps fading from my memory.

408
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,733
   

409
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,567
What's her purpose?

410
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,867
Why me...

411
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,167
You could've done it.

412
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,067
Who knows?

413
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,600
Maybe she just wanted to see you?

414
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,933
You're joking too much. Someone who would know...

415
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,000
It's no joke.

416
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,333
23 years is a long time.

417
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,400
People change.

418
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,400
Must've been boring...

419
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,033
23 years as a pretrial detainee.

420
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,000
Looks like an ordinary house, doesn't it?

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It was formerly used as a safe house 
 and later converted into a retirement home.

422
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,267
Like a prison run by an intelligence agency.

423
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,533
I know your mind is complicated,

424
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,367
but don't ruin things.

425
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,633
What's there to conflict me?

426
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:49,800
We deal with criminals every day. That's our job.

427
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,667
Right. Let's focus on our work.

428
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,667
We call her a death row inmate,

429
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:59,933
but she's probably outlived most of us.

430
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,800
Section Chief, keep security tight.

431
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,367
Don't worry.

432
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,467
Nothing will leak.

433
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,667
Absolutely not.

434
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,500
None.

435
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,033
You know what happens if this gets out, right?

436
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:19,133
I can't function properly without Jeong Yun.

437
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,433
I know.

438
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,367
I know how you got here.

439
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,233
That won't happen.

440
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,700
Trust me.

441
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,867
Ah, thanks for your hard work.

442
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,933
This is Supervisor Kim Wu Tae 
 from our Public Security Department.

443
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,933
Under special orders from the Commissioner, 
 he'll be managing security here

444
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,100
until the case concludes.

445
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,767
Does she come out this far?

446
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,767
Yes, one hour a day after lunch.

447
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,333
She also takes a short walk.

448
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,933
A walk?

449
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,700
Wait, there'd be a risk of escape...

450
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Are you guarding here alone?

451
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,367
24 hours straight, you're here 
 all alone without any shifts?

452
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:34,600
The fewer people who know 
 about this work, the better.

453
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
Let's go in.

454
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,233
Ms. Jeong I Sin,

455
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,700
we requested your cooperation 
 regarding the recent copycat murders,

456
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,400
and we're here to ask related questions.

457
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,733
Ah, so you're Jeong Ho.

458
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:23,233
I'm Inspector Cha Su Yul 
 from the Violent Crime Investigation Unit.

459
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,267
Have you reviewed the files?

460
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,967
Looks like you're married.

461
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:35,333
There's a ring mark.

462
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,533
Do you have kids?

463
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,733
Let's skip personal talk unrelated to the case.

464
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:57,667
I'm not here for family reunions.

465
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,700
Did you review the files?

466
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,233
He seems... to have probably tried hard

467
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:24,500
to copy it exactly.

468
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,867
Rather than struggling, 
 it looks like he enjoyed it.

469
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,033
Look at the neck incision here.

470
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:33,067
The clean cut suggests 
 it was done in one swift strike.

471
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,900
This is different from how I did it.

472
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,467
I used a saw.

473
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:41,033
When the saw blade cuts through 
 human vertebrae side to side,

474
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:44,100
the body vibrates.

475
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,233
A grinding rumble.

476
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:51,833
This guy doesn't seem to know that kind of thrill.

477
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,067
With an axe, it'd be a man. Right?

478
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,033
Judging by his strength, seems so.

479
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,833
You need to tell me something new,

480
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:05,200
not just what's in the report.

481
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,133
Is that all?

482
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:14,900
The photos and report 
 don't really show anything useful.

483
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,700
Let's not waste time with nonsense.

484
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,000
This is all the material 
 the investigation team can provide.

485
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,267
The culprit has already killed two people

486
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:31,967
using the exact same method as you, Ms. Jeong I Sin.

487
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,033
Bring more photos.

488
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,933
We'll talk again when we get there.

489
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:41,867
Inspector Cha Su Yul, see you around.

490
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,400
You were smiling at the photos.

491
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,300
Must be nice, huh?

492
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:50,933
Remind you of the old days?

493
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,000
Team Leader Cha.

494
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,133
You get all worked up,

495
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,167
and there's the smell of blood, 
 or something like that?

496
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,400
Is it wrong to get excited by the smell of blood?

497
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:08,067
They said you'd have to be upside down,

498
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,133
and they cut open my belly to get you out.

499
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,733
During surgery,

500
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:16,467
the anesthesia wore off halfway.

501
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:20,033
I just endured it,

502
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:24,333
worried that if I moved, you might get hurt.

503
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,433
I felt inside my body 
 with gloved hands, listening, feeling...

504
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:33,033
And that's how you were born.

505
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,367
The smell of blood?

506
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,433
I love it.

507
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:41,767
It's the same smell when you enter the world.

508
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,467
I see.

509
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,767
But here's the thing.

510
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,400
I've met countless criminals,

511
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,567
but as a cop, I don't care 
 about their lives or memories.

512
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,267
Ms. Jeong I Sin,

513
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:09,067
who particularly enjoys blood scent.

514
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,767
I'll examine more photos.

515
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,100
I'll take my leave for today.

516
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,133
Let's go.

517
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:19,200
Can I see the crime scene?

518
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,660
I mean, something came to mind...

519
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,633
and I want to confirm it.

520
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,233
Feed me.

521
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:47,567
Whether it's 23 years or 230, people won't change.

522
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,767
They enjoy all the benefits of the system, 
 yet show no remorse. You saw earlier, right?

523
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,500
Like people on a picnic,

524
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,433
she exploits our vulnerable position,

525
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,233
drags out time, and just tries to have her fun.

526
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,800
Whatever it takes,

527
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,900
I just need to catch the killer.

528
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,300
If we spend the time catering to that woman, 
 nothing gets done.

529
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,833
Will you really take her to the scene?

530
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,600
Of course I will.

531
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,700
Jeong I Sin... She's not doing this for fresh air.

532
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,100
23 years ago,

533
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,500
among Jeong I Sin's murders,

534
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,667
I only had evidence for one case.

535
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,733
And even then, it was just 
 circumstantial, no hard proof.

536
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,700
The whole country 
 was caught up in World Cup fever,

537
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,533
and news of serial killings 
 was a huge political burden.

538
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,767
Politicians were calling me every day,

539
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:50,267
and in desperation, I clung to 
 that flimsy suspicion like a rotten lifeline.

540
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:54,367
That's how I arrested Jeong I Sin.

541
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The moment I put the cuffs on her,

542
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,633
she smirked at me.

543
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:05,733
As if she had known this day would come all along.

544
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,233
Since I had nothing but circumstantial evidence,

545
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,567
I desperately needed her confession.

546
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:14,333
And Jeong I Sin knew it, too.

547
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:18,167
We had no choice

548
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,533
but to meet her demands...

549
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,233
Solitary cell,

550
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,733
music,

551
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,400
coffee...

552
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,933
Yeah,

553
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,000
and more...

554
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:36,567
Anyway, Jeong I Sin might make a deal,

555
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,100
but she was never a woman who owed anyone.

556
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,867
Eun Ae.

557
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,167
Oh my.

558
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,333
She's making herself right at home.

559
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,300
Sorry for asking this suddenly.

560
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
They said there's no space at the facility.

561
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,967
Please just take care of her until one opens up.

562
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,833
What's there to be sorry about?

563
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,900
She's adorable,

564
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,467
and the house felt too quiet anyway.

565
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,467
It's nice to remember old times.

566
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,767
But you're always taking a handful of pills.

567
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,533
An old body like mine 
 isn't anything to fuss about.

568
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:13,467
Whenever something bad happens, 
 if there's a kid involved,

569
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,167
that kid's always the biggest victim.

570
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,933
Here we go again.

571
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,433
A millionth time hearing this.

572
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,167
I didn't put much in here, 
 since it's just the two of you.

573
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,500
The corn was frozen right after picking,

574
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,300
so make sure you put it straight in the freezer.

575
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm leaving.

576
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,467
Stay for a meal at least. 
 You came all the way here.

577
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,200
No, I should go.

578
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,033
I still need to get Eun Ae fed.

579
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,800
She may look cheerful, 
 always laughing and playing,

580
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
but sometimes she says strange things.

581
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,967
Her mental state isn't good.

582
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:48,967
What kind of strange things?

583
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,033
She said someone tried to shoot her mother.

584
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,700
This isn't even America.

585
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,133
Anyway, don't worry.

586
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,333
I'll go now. Don't bother seeing me out.

587
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,133
The kid is telling the truth.

588
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,433
What do you think?

589
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,700
The color's different, right?

590
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,333
You're saying this is really your work?

591
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,300
I told you it is.

592
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:18,600
No way. Absolutely not.

593
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Wait.

594
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,733
I need to step outside and check it in the light.

595
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,900
Oh, I see.

596
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,067
You switched the clay, didn't you?

597
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,200
What soil?

598
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,133
Why does the texture feel completely different?

599
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,900
I changed the clay,

600
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,200
but it's like... I changed my whole mindset.

601
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:43,967
The color's nice too, right?

602
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,367
Yeah, it's beautiful.

603
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,367
Huh?

604
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,233
Has Grandpa come? 
    

605
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,233
Oh, wait.

606
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,267
I got so angry suddenly...

607
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:01,000
The kid could've gotten hurt.

608
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,867
Su Yul,

609
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,900
but you saved Eun Ae.

610
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,433
No, that's not it.

611
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,700
It's not the first time.

612
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,000
And I hate...

613
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,200
that about myself.

614
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,433
It's okay.

615
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,433
It's fine.

616
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:24,600
I met her.

617
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
Eun Ae's mom?

618
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,300
I... still have nightmares.

619
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,733
What?

620
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,467
That woman...

621
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,967
stabbing,

622
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,000
cutting people...

623
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,433
Su Yul.

624
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,967
...laughing...

625
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,067
Why did you meet her?

626
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,567
You know there's been a murder lately, right?

627
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:56,800
Some insane person is copying exactly 
 what she did back then.

628
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,100
That's why...

629
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,267
I needed her cooperation.

630
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,467
No!

631
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,833
Are you the only police in Korea?

632
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,467
You said you still have nightmares.

633
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,300
Don't worry.

634
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,333
I'm not a child anymore,

635
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:18,000
and it happened 23 years ago.

636
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,833
The terrifying woman

637
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,667
who killed people and laughed in front of me,

638
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:29,667
now she's just an old, insignificant criminal.

639
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,300
Confirming that could make me...

640
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,867
feel better, right?

641
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,867
You won't feel better.

642
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,967
What she did...

643
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,467
She is pure evil.

644
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:46,533
No one meets a devil and feels at ease.

645
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,967
Never, never meet her again.

646
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,233
Once is enough.

647
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,733
Got it?

648
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,600
Well...

649
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:15,400
Why?

650
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,233
Is someone there?

651
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,733
No.

652
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm fine. I can still walk.

653
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,367
I'm leaving now, so go on inside.

654
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,233
I'll eat what you brought. Thank you.

655
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,933
All right.

656
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,233
 No. 

657
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:36,000
He already said no before.

658
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,633
So if he says no, that's it?

659
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:41,033
There's no other way now, is there?

660
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,667
Let's just push through...

661
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,100
Hey, wait up.

662
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,600
Hey, hey, Manager Kim.

663
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:53,688
   

664
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,280
- Section Chief. 
 - Yes.

665
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,400
I'll ask you one more time.

666
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,267
Please let me meet Jeong I Sin.

667
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,733
The culprit is replicating Jeong I Sin's crimes 
 down to the smallest details.

668
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,733
We'll definitely find something useful.

669
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:09,900
Goodness.

670
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,867
I believe I already answered.

671
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,400
But...

672
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,700
Please reconsider just once.

673
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,967
Section Chief, if you'll permit me,

674
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,467
I'll prepare an interrogation questionnaire.

675
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,367
Oh my.

676
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,700
I told you,

677
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,933
just informing you that Jeong I Sin is alive 
 already puts pressure on upper management.

678
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:37,933
At the very least, the people 
 actually investigating need to know.

679
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:42,133
I had to push hard to even get 
 this much information to you.

680
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,267
Hey, but if you keep acting 
 like this, what does that make me?

681
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:47,667
If that's the case, 
 why did you even tell us she was alive?

682
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,900
Isn't it because 
 you were worried too, Section Chief?

683
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,867
   

684
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,733
What if she wants to?

685
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,533
All criminals are the same.

686
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,300
They itch to brag about their crimes.

687
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,800
Scratch their ego a bit, 
 and they'll spill everything 100%.

688
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:12,633
Then, let us at least request cooperation once...

689
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:16,933
Oh, come in.

690
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,800
All right, everyone's attention.

691
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,304
Starting today, we have new inspector, Cha Su Yul.

692
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,433
Huh?

693
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:29,767
But you said we wouldn't get replacements...

694
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,467
How do you do?

695
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,633
I'm Cha Su Yul, your new team leader.

696
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,833
I look forward to working with you.

697
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,333
Since he was suddenly appointed, 
 it'll be hard to adapt,

698
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,700
so give him lots of support. Okay?

699
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,867
Nice to meet you.

700
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,467
I'm Kim Na Hee.

701
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:52,267
I'm Cha Su Yul.

702
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,167
What are you all doing?

703
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,467
Who are you?

704
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,733
Jeong I Sin injects victims 
 with anesthesia to restrain their bodies,

705
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:07,867
and when they wake up, she kills them 
 through brutal acts like dismemberment.

706
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:10,200
She deliberately inflicts 
 pain before killing them,

707
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,233
going through such a troublesome process...

708
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,900
Excuse me, just a moment.

709
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Could we see the photos 
 from the second murder again?

710
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,800
Yes.

711
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,567
   

712
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,733
Yes, right there.

713
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,500
That mirror there.

714
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,767
There was no mirror 
 in the murder 23 years ago, right?

715
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,267
Yes, we thought that was unusual too.

716
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:37,133
The perpetrator probably wanted 
 the victim to see themselves dying.

717
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:41,433
There was no mirror during 
 the first Riverside murder,

718
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,567
and this is the first time 
 a mirror was used here....

719
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:48,633
Then, wouldn't that suggest 
 the guy isn't just copying,

720
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,700
but adding his own style, showing off somehow?

721
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,900
You could think that, 
 but this is a moving warehouse,

722
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,600
and that mirror was already there.

723
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,167
In its current position?

724
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,567
We didn't check...

725
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,700
You should've checked for relocation marks.

726
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:17,100
If the perpetrator deliberately 
 placed the mirror there,

727
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,067
that's a meaningful act, right?

728
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:23,100
He pretends to respect Jeong I Sin,

729
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,567
but in fact, he's showing off, thinking he's better,

730
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:28,767
that he killed the victim in a more painful way.

731
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,100
Couldn't that be considered 
 a display of arrogance?

732
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,400
What? Is this some kind of suffering competition?

733
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
What if that's the case?

734
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,500
Then he might push himself too far to prove

735
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,967
he's better and make mistakes.

736
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:47,633
However, we're not expecting more victims to appear.

737
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,000
Of course not.

738
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,600
That's why we're all gathered here.

739
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:58,667
What about the victims? Any common traits?

740
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,700
The victims from 23 years ago

741
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,767
shared experiences of violence 
 or abuse against women and children,

742
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:07,267
but in this case, aside from the first one, 
 there's no common pattern.

743
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,967
Since there's no consistent 
 link between the victims,

744
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,533
predicting the next one is difficult.

745
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:15,133
We can only estimate how they might be killed.

746
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:18,667
So, the third case from 23 years ago...

747
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,433
Drowning.

748
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:25,000
That means the third victim would have drowned...

749
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,167
Anyway, we still have no leads.

750
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,533
There's CCTV footage near the storage warehouse.

751
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,967
It's too dark. Can't we enhance it?

752
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,833
That's the best we can do.

753
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,400
Good work today.

754
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,933
It's our first day, so consider this 
 a team-building session.

755
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,067
Let's wrap up here.

756
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,700
I have a request for the team leader.

757
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,867
I want to meet Jeong I Sin.

758
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,700
The killer is copying Jeong I Sin's methods.

759
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,133
I think Jeong I Sin might know something.

760
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:00,367
What do you think?

761
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,667
Manager Kim, about that...

762
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:14,733
Is our investigation sufficient?

763
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:18,200
If it were sufficient, maybe.

764
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,233
But it's not.

765
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:21,933
I don't want to rely on criminals for answers.

766
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,933
Someone who's been locked up for 23 years

767
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:26,767
might not be helpful.

768
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:27,800
But...

769
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,900
We already settled this.

770
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,167
All right, let's go and greet the Commissioner.

771
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,233
What?

772
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,733
Our investigation isn't thorough?

773
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,200
He's saying we didn't do our jobs properly, huh?

774
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,200
What does that washed-up guy know?

775
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,267
Watch your tone.

776
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:50,700
Regardless, we're a team now.

777
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,967
Anyone want coffee?

778
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,933
I want some iced plum.

779
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:05,933
Quick to adapt, Manager Kim.

780
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:07,700
Exactly.

781
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,467
Then, what should I do with this?

782
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,933
I've been carrying this around just in case.

783
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,067
What?

784
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:20,267
   

785
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:19,333
   

786
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,333
Grilled bones are here.

787
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,633
Enjoy your meal.

788
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:33,633
Section Chief.

789
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,640
Since the Team Leader's here, 
 and it's our first meal together,

790
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,700
shall we have a drink?

791
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,900
Shall we?

792
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,767
Yes, let's do that.

793
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,033
- Nice. 
 - It's a team dinner! Awesome!

794
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:46,700
Ma'am, we'll have octopus jeotgal and ice.

795
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,367
All right.

796
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:54,733
More soju glasses, please.

797
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:55,633
- Ji An? 
 - Huh?

798
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:57,067
What's this glass?

799
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:57,980
Soju glass.

800
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,200
Soju glass.

801
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,967
Take it.

802
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,267
Looks like the narcotics team is all saints, huh?

803
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,533
Oh, our Deputy Chief Bae,

804
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:11,000
are you planning to dance shirtless 
 again on our very first meeting?

805
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,400
Ah, Section Chief.

806
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,833
That was supposed to be a surprise!

807
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,400
Here you go, Deputy Chief Bae.

808
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,733
I'll pour you a drink.

809
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:25,067
Sorry for suddenly jumping into the investigation.

810
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,800
Whether it's the narcotics team 
 or the violent crimes team,

811
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,533
I've learned that real cops 
 answer with an investigation.

812
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:32,733
As a police officer and as a team leader,

813
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,900
I'll respond through investigation.

814
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,533
Pouring drinks and talking big.

815
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:40,400
Let's officially welcome our Team Leader.

816
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
Welcome.

817
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,733
Thank you.

818
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,733
Who wants beer to start?

819
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:52,416
- Me. 
 - Me.

820
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,889
Here, let me.

821
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:57,933
Cheers.

822
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:59,833
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

823
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,310
   

824
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:14,333
Can't you think of anything?

825
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,400
Shh, be quiet.

826
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:33,600
You do remember something, right?

827
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:38,167
The culprit moved it deliberately.

828
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,333
I guess he was trying to show 
 he inflicted more suffering on the victim.

829
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,333
Yet he copied every other detail.

830
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:50,867
Under the condition 
 of using tools within this room.

831
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,833
You're not here just to see 
 how exactly he copied it.

832
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,433
The neck.

833
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,333
He could've severed it cleanly.

834
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,267
However, he chose to leave it partially intact.

835
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,333
I did the same once.

836
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:14,967
The dangling feeling...

837
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:21,933
Like tearing this out...

838
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,933
Why?

839
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:15,200
If the culprit wanted to mimic the 23-year-old case,

840
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,900
what references did they use?

841
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,100
News articles and published photos, obviously.

842
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,100
There was exactly one newspaper 
 that published the crime scene photos.

843
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
So?

844
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,500
Ms. Jeong I Sin!

845
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,433
Is that all?

846
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:06,600
What about the newspaper?

847
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,967
What are you talking about?

848
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:14,967
That's something the police handles, isn't it?

849
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:17,067
I'm the criminal,

850
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,167
you're the police.

851
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,367
Were we in that kind of relationship?

852
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:29,033
Ms. Jeong I Sin.

853
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:34,800
You know this permission 
 was really hard to get, right?

854
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,100
You need to give us something.

855
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,300
Fine, enough.

856
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,167
Yes, Team Leader.

857
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,533
Yes, the newspaper article?

858
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:00,533
   

859
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:02,033
Yes, we have it.

860
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:04,833
Sending it via PolMessenger now.

861
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,633
Why would he...

862
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:17,733
   

863
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:20,033
Enhance the brightness here.

864
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:22,033
Brighter?

865
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:24,967
Here. Zoom in here.

866
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,533
- This photo is flipped. 
 - Yeah.

867
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:44,533
A printing error, probably.

868
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,733
Was it an intentional design?

869
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:48,600
Wait a second.

870
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,033
What?

871
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,533
So that means the head was actually on the left,

872
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:57,100
not the right.

873
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,233
This guy didn't copy it from the newspaper.

874
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:05,133
He must have seen trial transcripts or investigation materials.

875
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,700
Yes.

876
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,767
Find some trial records or investigation 
 documents related to Jeong I Sin...

877
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:17,600
Already searching?

878
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,367
Got it.

879
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,867
Let's hurry.

880
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,530
   

881
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,300
 I think it was last year when he came here. 

882
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,533
 Jeong I Sin sent letters from Anwon Prison? 

883
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:25,333
 Jeong I Sin, whom the world believes to be dead... 

884
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,100
 - Hey. 
 - What the heck, you punk? 

885
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,500
 That woman isn't helping us. 

886
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,533
 She's using us. 

887
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,733
 How was your mother? 
 What kind of person was she? 

888
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:33,867
 If I tell you, 

889
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:36,133
 will you tell me where Kim Tae Seok is? 

890
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,267
 Shouldn't we make Seo Ku Wan talk? 

891
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,600
 Seo Ku Wan isn't here. 

892
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,533
 We need to end this. We have to kill him now. 

893
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,200
 Seo Ku Wan!
