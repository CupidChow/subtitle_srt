1
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey, you'll be better soon

2
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:29,608
I think so too

3
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:51,723
Sometimes where you are, where you want to be, and where they let you be

4
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,207
It's often not the same

5
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,517
Alright, let's introduce ourselves

6
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:09,267
Hello, my name is May, I'm 25 years old and I'm auditioning for the role of Poom

7
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:12,517
Hello, I'm Garn, I'm 21 years old and I'm auditioning for the role of Tor

8
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:16,156
Hello, I'm Tul, I'm 21 years old and I'm auditioning for the role of Mike

9
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:17,808
Mos

10
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:21,122
I'm auditioning for the role of Mos

11
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,316
Hello, My name is Fluke, I'm 20 years old and I'm auditioning for the role of James

12
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,093
Thank you

13
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:29,093
Alright, let's pair up

14
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,509
The casting team has matched you guys up already

15
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,342
And then we're going to do a workshop on Relationships

16
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,147
Come on then

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,257
Everyone holds hands and looks into each other's eyes

18
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,118
Tul, right?

19
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:49,618
Yup

20
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:52,522
Are your hands always sweaty when you're nervous?

21
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,923
Not really, I just went to pee

22
00:01:58,645 --> 00:01:59,440
Just kidding

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,945
I actually went to poo

24
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you messing with me now?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,222
I'm serious

26
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,277
Why didn't you wash your hands!

27
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,160
Just kidding, come on, we're gonna get in trouble

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,505
Close your eyes, stop messing around

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,814
Do you think we'll get the roles?

30
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,064
Of course

31
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,814
You were really convincing

32
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:32,286
But I felt nothing when I acted

33
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,440
So I pictured you as someone I like

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,751
It really helped a lot

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,195
If I get the job, do you think I will be able to do it?

36
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,556
Well, look at my face

37
00:02:56,815 --> 00:03:02,129
Earlier in the room, you said you pictured me as someone you like, right?

38
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:02,629
What's their name?

39
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:07,880
Ha, you're trying to trick me

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,769
I'm not gonna tell you

41
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,408
Damn, you got me

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,873
Alright, if we really get the parts

43
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:24,817
I would pretend to be that person you like for the whole shoot

44
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,951
You're sweet

45
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:29,750
Thanks

46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,305
But my crush is much sweeter than you

47
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:39,744
Ok, that's our deal then. Consider it done

48
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,547
Hey, what are you doing?

49
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,241
Have you never done this before? This?

50
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,250
What?

51
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:48,600
Promise?

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,028
Promise

53
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,778
Wait

54
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,110
Your hands are sweaty too

55
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,888
Not just mine

56
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,665
I forgot my bag

57
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,090
Garn

58
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,902
Mmm

59
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,957
Give me your hand, quick

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,080
My hands are not sweaty anymore, I'm getting better

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,774
Yeah, you're good, you're great, you're a legend

62
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,469
This is the third movie already, if they are still sweaty, you should go see a doctor

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,958
But yours are still sweaty

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
You must have low blood pressure

65
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,044
Yeah, I have low blood pressure

66
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:01,858
The set is ready for you guys. Tul and Garn, come on in

67
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,275
Yes

68
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:20,055
No matter how many movies we do together

69
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,388
My hands are still sweaty

70
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:31,201
Because of one thing you already know

71
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:37,784
And another thing I just found out

72
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:50,136
First thing is, I love you

73
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:57,045
And the set is the only place you allow us to love each other

74
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,198
And the other thing is

75
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
My sweaty hands

76
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,388
It's my heart

77
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,588
The human heart is so fragile

78
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,785
I think I'm going to quit acting

79
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:50,088
I'm done. I have enough stories to tell my kids

80
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,280
But you don't have kids

81
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:58,992
I'll use the time and money I've earned to go find myself a mother to have my kid

82
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,026
What about me?

83
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,982
If you quit, I've always paired up with you

84
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,982
If we split, it means that I'm done

85
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:19,315
Hey, you're a much better actor than me

86
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,093
You'll do just fine, the industry loves you

87
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:25,105
Apart from that, it's not like I'm going anywhere

88
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:31,650
They always say that 'I'm not going anywhere'

89
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:47,645
If you quit, I quit

90
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,363
I don't wanna act with anybody else

91
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,988
Hey, why don't you go do action movies

92
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,543
Like John Wick

93
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:12,154
Acting solo, it's so cool

94
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:16,654
You can also act with a dog, there's a dog in John Wick

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,923
You're so stupid

96
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,498
I pretend to be

97
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,609
You know it's impossible

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,219
And it's not like I don't love you

99
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:46,383
I love you

100
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,320
But I know what I want

101
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
And this is the most selfish thing that I've ever done

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,739
To pretend to be stupid

103
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,294
So you and me can always be together

104
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:10,489
I pretend to be stupid enough to believe you don't like me, or that you actually get sweaty hands because of low blood pressure

105
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,961
When we hold hands

106
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,718
I know! It's not like I don't

107
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,409
I've always know, Garn

108
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,936
You can continue to pretend that you're stupid

109
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:40,368
Don't act all clever now

110
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,980
I can only love you so much

111
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,230
But I do really love you

112
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:57,134
If you allow me to love you this much

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can love you forever

114
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,764
(3 years later)

115
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,816
Yo

116
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,371
Hey, what's up

117
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,042
I'm good

118
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,918
Can I just sit on this? Your wedding invitation?

119
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,085
Go on, I have like hundreds more in here

120
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,085
I'm not taking it then

121
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:21,159
I have hundreds of them but I'm giving you the first one

122
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,868
Are you coming to my wedding?

123
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,479
As a groomsman?

124
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,594
Do you want me to go?

125
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,566
That's why I'm inviting you

126
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,931
Okay

127
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:42,060
But I don't think I can make it

128
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,987
What?

129
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,886
I have to shoot a series

130
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,680
Well then why would you even ask if I want you to go or not?

131
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,778
I just want to know

132
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,859
Just knowing that you want me there is enough

133
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:00,000
So I will leave it here

134
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,583
I have to go invite more people

135
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,338
See you

136
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,240
Do you think my baby is cute?

137
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,678
Look, she has my eyes

138
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:28,059
So cute

139
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:38,189
Hey, the doctor said that I have heart problem

140
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:44,136
Well, you tend to love someone who doesn't love you back

141
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,718
I had a balloon angioplasty

142
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,107
but if my heart acts up again

143
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,107
I might have to bid everyone farewell!

144
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:04,601
I didn't want to ruin your special day with this news

145
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:09,244
But we haven't seen each other much lately

146
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,193
So I didn't know when I would get a chance to tell you

147
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:15,537
Crazy, your heart is so strong

148
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:21,315
If you loved me for so long, that heart of yours can keep on going for 20 more years, trust me

149
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,168
You're an idiot

150
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,679
I can love your child too, there's room for more

151
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,486
So my heart can be even stronger

152
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,960
Here, I brought something

153
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,091
Thank you

154
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:21,543
Daddy, why do we have the same name?

155
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,016
I named my daughter Garn

156
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:45,840
If you allow me to love you so much

157
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:51,740
I can love you forever
