1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,990
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:46,163
- Yes, we're heading to the entrance!
- Attention, valued customers.

3
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:48,374
We have confirmed

4
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

5
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:54,004
We apologize for the inconvenience.

6
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:02,638
Is my power back?

7
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,523
I held

8
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,692
her hand?

9
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:27,371
I can touch someone in my past?

10
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,334
Can I reach Se-yeon too?

11
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,005
Why can't I go back?

12
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,800
I did earlier.

13
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:23,219
Come on.

14
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,318
Take a deep breath.

15
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,363
Center yourself.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,074
Now, focus.

17
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,909
The sunshine.

18
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,829
The wind.

19
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:52,414
The beach.

20
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,263
I'm back. It worked.

21
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,104
Do Da-hae?

22
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:32,621
Does this mean I was happy at that moment?

23
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,626
Go back to another moment.

24
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,670
To a time without Do Da-hae.

25
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:48,971
I-na.

26
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,014
Think about her.

27
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,318
Yes!

28
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:09,658
I-na. Stand still.

29
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,495
Move your hands.

30
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,878
Congratulations.

31
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,057
Did I just smile at Do Da-hae?

32
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,017
Did I really do that?

33
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,019
I actually smiled?

34
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:39,939
What the hell?

35
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,321
Something's seriously wrong.

36
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,198
Why...

37
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,867
Why can I only go back
to moments with her?

38
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:57,748
Do Da-hae.

39
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,375
Who the hell are you?

40
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,877
- Ms. Do Da-hae?
- Yes.

41
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,797
She's with a client at the moment.

42
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,131
May I ask what this is about?

43
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,424
I have to ask her something.

44
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,679
Mr. Bok.

45
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:18,143
We need to talk.

46
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:20,437
Now? But I'm working right...

47
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,611
- Who are you?
- What?

48
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,071
Why are you the only one in color?

49
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:32,366
- Excuse me?
- Everything else is gray,

50
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,243
but you glow with vivid colors.

51
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,453
And I see you every time I open my eyes.

52
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,579
Why you?

53
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,541
Why can I touch you,
and why do I keep going back to you?

54
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,670
Are you

55
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:46,922
asking me out?

56
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,592
What a weird way to confess your feelings.

57
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:52,803
Hold on.

58
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,391
You're the one who should confess.

59
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,977
Something's fishy about you.

60
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,021
Just be honest with me.

61
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,397
About what?

62
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,315
Do you have powers like we do?

63
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,233
Is it hypnosis?

64
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,152
What on earth did you plant in my head?

65
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:13,866
Is this how you manipulated my mother?

66
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,284
You're out of line, Mr. Bok.

67
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,452
Tell me what you did!

68
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,370
What the hell did you do to me?

69
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,496
I never...

70
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:21,790
I can answer that.

71
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,669
I'll tell you what's going on.

72
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:32,343
Ms. Do didn't plant anything in your head

73
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,719
but love.

74
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,472
Love, my foot.

75
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,432
Just move in with us.

76
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:42,227
You can quit your job
at the spa as of today.

77
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,145
Ms. Bok.

78
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,229
Let's keep her close.

79
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,106
- As I-na's tutor.
- What?

80
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:49,234
Let her help I-na
with her school assignments

81
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,320
and keep her fed.

82
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,197
She can't skip breakfast all the time

83
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:55,783
and fill up on instant noodles
late at night.

84
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,538
Gwi-ju is a good kid.

85
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:06,001
He just doesn't seem that way
because of the pain in his heart.

86
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:13,634
I thought you could really get to know him
if you lived together.

87
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,639
Why are you so obsessed with Do Da-hae?

88
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,975
She can help us recover what we've lost.

89
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:24,853
You must be experiencing some changes too.

90
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,855
Have you noticed anything yet?

91
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,441
No.

92
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,776
No signs at all?

93
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,444
I said no.

94
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,240
Mr. Bok seemed a bit confused.

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,282
Just do as I say.

96
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:41,245
He's not in the right mind
to make sensible decisions.

97
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:43,831
Sunday at 1 p.m.

98
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:46,083
The fountain outside the mall you met her.

99
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,543
Why would I meet her?

100
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:48,794
Aren't you curious?

101
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:54,216
About why Do Da-hae was
wearing the family ring in my dream?

102
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:16,488
I'm sure she's the reason
my power is back.

103
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:19,158
Should I keep an eye on her?

104
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,704
It's probably not worth it.

105
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,374
My power is completely useless.

106
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,044
The moment I want to return to

107
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,255
is not a happy one.

108
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,384
The moment I want to return to...

109
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,263
The past I want to change...

110
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:44,892
Really?

111
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,101
Okay.

112
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,228
Yes, of course.

113
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:49,563
Okay, bye.

114
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,944
Guys.

115
00:09:58,447 --> 00:09:59,490
I'm going to be a dad.

116
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,116
- What?
- Really?

117
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,826
- That's incredible!
- Congrats!

118
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:03,911
I'm so happy for you!

119
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,247
Congratulations.

120
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:08,916
We're so happy for you.

121
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,834
Head over to the hospital.

122
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:12,503
My gosh.

123
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:13,837
Hey, newbie.

124
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:17,633
- I'll fill in for you. Get going.
- You're the best, sir!

125
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,384
Stop it.

126
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,511
Hold on.

127
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,514
Weren't you just on your way home
after your shift?

128
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:26,683
Wait until that baby's born,
and we'll see how you feel about home.

129
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:30,395
- Go on. You don't want to miss it.
- Welcome to parenthood.

130
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,775
Let me buy you a meal later.

131
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:35,734
Screw that.

132
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,110
- I want drinks.
- Drinks?

133
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,239
- I love you.
- Call me.

134
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,532
- We want beef!
- See you!

135
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:42,950
- Congratulations!
- Call us!

136
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:44,701
My goodness.

137
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,955
Let's finish up and stand by.

138
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,540
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

139
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,500
Another happy moment

140
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,919
for you to relive over and over again.

141
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,379
Absolutely.

142
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,632
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

143
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:00,342
or whenever she leaves my side

144
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:02,636
to hang out with her boyfriend.

145
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:05,639
Guess you'll be back all the time.

146
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:09,977
- Do you see me?
- I-na.

147
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:10,978
Look, she's smiling.

148
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,437
- Really?
- Yes, look.

149
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,939
Look at her.

150
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,119
Rescue team, get your asses up here!

151
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,539
Firefighting team, get inside
and find out where the fire started!

152
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:33,834
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

153
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,003
We've got people to save! Get a move on!

154
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,255
Requesting backup.

155
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:40,257
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

156
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:42,843
We need backup.

157
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,095
I repeat. We need backup.

158
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,555
The day I became a parent,

159
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:50,183
dozens of parents lost their children.

160
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:55,355
And...

161
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,775
Salute!

162
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:05,032
Proceed!

163
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,870
Don't leave us, honey!

164
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,706
How are we supposed to live now?

165
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,584
You can't leave us behind.

166
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:23,091
You promised you'd
always be there for our son.

167
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:27,095
No!

168
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,817
Another happy moment

169
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,277
for you to relive over and over again.

170
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:25,404
Absolutely.

171
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,115
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

172
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:32,577
or whenever she leaves my side
to hang out with her boyfriend.

173
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:34,663
Do you see me?

174
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,582
Guess you'll be back all the time.

175
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,709
All the time.

176
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,837
No matter how much time passes,

177
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,631
I'll never let go

178
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,093
of the moment you came to me, I-na.

179
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:52,973
This is the happiest moment of my life.

180
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,145
Why is this door in color?

181
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:05,152
I-na, Daddy's here.

182
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:10,490
I can touch it.

183
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,672
I can hold it.

184
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,968
I-na, Daddy's here.

185
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:31,928
Look at me.

186
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,811
- I-na.
- Look, she's smiling.

187
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,772
- Really?
- Yes, look.

188
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,231
- She just smiled.
- I-na.

189
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,901
Are you happy to be with Daddy?

190
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,203
Bring the safety cushion!

191
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,794
Multiple casualties
at Seonjae Girls' High School.

192
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,921
We need backup.

193
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,798
I repeat. We need backup.

194
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,580
Senior Firefighter Jeong?

195
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,000
- We're ready.
- Sir!

196
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,085
- The fifth floor is clear.
- One, two, three.

197
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,504
They inhaled too much smoke.

198
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:35,552
Sir, there's someone
in the fifth-floor storage.

199
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:36,469
No.

200
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,597
Fifth-floor storage?

201
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,890
Please help.

202
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:41,558
Don't go.

203
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:44,227
Hyeong-jin!

204
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:54,112
Let's go already!

205
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,921
- Can you walk?
- Grab your gear! Hurry!

206
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,642
Check the situation!

207
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,976
We don't have a clear view!

208
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,102
Get the hydraulics!

209
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,687
- I got it!
- On it!

210
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,356
The building may collapse further!

211
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,191
I don't think we can enter the building!

212
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,026
Check on the injured!

213
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:34,653
Radio the guys inside!
See if they're okay!

214
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,737
Hold this.

215
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:37,656
There are still kids in there!

216
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,324
Are you okay?

217
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,925
That moment is special.

218
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,301
I opened a door.

219
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:00,345
You said you couldn't do anything else.

220
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,058
Maybe I haven't tried everything.

221
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,145
There must be another door I can open.

222
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,024
I might be able to do something.

223
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,402
At least around the time
our daughter was born.

224
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:34,754
Let's go already!

225
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:43,847
Let's go already!

226
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:57,318
Let's go already!

227
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,867
Grab your gear! Hurry!

228
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,061
There must be something I can do.

229
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,192
There must be something I can touch.

230
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,370
But in the end,

231
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,706
there was nothing I could do.

232
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,724
Fire reported.

233
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:54,102
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

234
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:57,397
All units respond immediately.

235
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,440
Fire reported.

236
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,235
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

237
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:04,988
All units respond immediately.

238
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:07,448
Fire reported.

239
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:10,368
Fire reported at Dongnam Market.

240
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:13,329
All units respond immediately.

241
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,543
Where's the newbie?

242
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,005
He was just here.

243
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,882
Where the hell did he go now?

244
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,924
Should we go without him?

245
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:27,760
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:31,598
Another happy moment

247
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,017
for you to relive over and over again.

248
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:35,560
Absolutely.

249
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,980
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

250
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,734
or whenever she leaves my side
to hang out with her boyfriend.

251
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,074
I'm here again.

252
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,492
Get it together!

253
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,995
You're putting your colleagues in danger

254
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:55,997
by disappearing whenever you please!

255
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,916
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,920
Gwi-ju.

257
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:06,716
I know you're grieving over Jeong's death,
but it's time to let it go.

258
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:13,556
But that moment

259
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,017
won't let me go.

260
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,310
What?

261
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,728
I try not to think about it,

262
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:22,065
but I find myself in that moment
in the blink of an eye.

263
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,193
I keep seeing the kids in danger

264
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:29,614
and Senior Firefighter Jeong
jumping into the fire.

265
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,244
I have to live through that
over and over again.

266
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,122
But no matter what I do,

267
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,000
there's absolutely nothing I can do.

268
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,419
I don't know why
I keep getting dragged into it.

269
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,381
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do!

270
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:50,385
It's driving me insane.

271
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,223
Take some time off and see a therapist.

272
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:56,975
Either that,

273
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,601
or find another line of work.

274
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,362
I could no longer save anyone

275
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:12,156
in the past or the present.

276
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:16,911
Daddy.

277
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,421
Where did Daddy go now?

278
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,756
He probably went to I-na.

279
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:32,844
Is there another I-na?

280
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,138
Does he like her better than me?

281
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,392
It's not like that.

282
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,026
Daddy has a special power.

283
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,194
And he wants to use it

284
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,281
to help other people.

285
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,410
Like a superhero?

286
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,245
Is he saving people?

287
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:00,496
Yes.

288
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:03,249
Come here.

289
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:37,033
Even after several years,

290
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:42,080
I was still stuck in this moment.

291
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,332
I don't think we can enter the building!

292
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,167
Check on the injured!

293
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,294
Radio the guys inside!
See if they're okay!

294
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:03,267
Where are we going, Mommy?

295
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:06,229
To the zoo.

296
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:10,149
Let's all hold hands
and have cotton candy together.

297
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,860
That means all three.

298
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:15,029
Don't disappear again.

299
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:16,948
It's not like I want to.

300
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,868
- You know that.
- It's because you just can't let go

301
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,162
of the people you couldn't save.

302
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:26,582
If you disappear today,

303
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm leaving with I-na.

304
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,004
What?

305
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:56,112
Another happy moment

306
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,781
for you to relive over and over again.

307
00:25:58,781 --> 00:25:59,991
Absolutely.

308
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:03,703
The best moment of my life
and the worst are one and the same.

309
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,415
How weird is that?

310
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,169
Guess you'll be back all the time.

311
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,837
All the time.

312
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,089
No matter how much time passes,

313
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:17,508
I'll never let go...

314
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,510
There must be something
different about this moment.

315
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:21,679
Once I find the reason,

316
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,139
I might stop being dragged into it.

317
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:24,640
It's been seven years.

318
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,018
You didn't get anything done

319
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,353
in the past or in the present.

320
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,440
Is there a single happy moment
besides that one

321
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,817
that you can go back to?

322
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:39,280
If you're going to disappear today,

323
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,324
don't bother coming back.

324
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,034
I won't be here when you do.

325
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,968
Se-yeon.

326
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,846
Se-yeon!

327
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:05,097
- Daddy.
- I-na.

328
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:07,266
Daddy is here.

329
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,601
Mom...

330
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,603
Se-yeon.

331
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,648
What the hell happened?

332
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:22,240
Please talk to me, Se-yeon.

333
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:49,892
Just keep pushing forward.

334
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:53,104
If he can't even remember
holding your hand,

335
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,438
he's not in his right mind.

336
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:57,650
Neither is Ms. Bok,
with that precognitive dream nonsense.

337
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,443
And thank god for that.

338
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:02,238
"The Bok family
exhibits signs of mental illnesses

339
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:05,491
that affect their judgment
and administrative capabilities,

340
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:08,411
which could pose
significant financial risks."

341
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:10,079
"Therefore,

342
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:14,500
Do Da-hae, Bok Gwi-ju's spouse
and Bok Man-huem's daughter-in-law,

343
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:16,877
shall manage their assets

344
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:19,505
as their legal guardian."

345
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:22,633
We can't settle for
a 50-billion-won building.

346
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,726
Let's bleed them dry.

347
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:46,699
It won't be easy
to be appointed as the guardian.

348
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,784
Make sure you get enough evidence.

349
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:04,842
Do Da-hae?

350
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,552
Wait.

351
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,305
Why are you here?

352
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,182
I tried to be brave.

353
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,725
Since you

354
00:29:13,392 --> 00:29:14,435
let me into your heart.

355
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:16,187
What?

356
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,438
Hello.

357
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,690
- Welcome.
- How have you been?

358
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,775
Good. Good to see you.

359
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:23,736
Welcome, Ms. Do.

360
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:26,280
You brought flowers. Thank you.

361
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,782
I'm sorry.

362
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,662
Your son actually got me these.

363
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:34,955
I did?

364
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:36,707
He did?

365
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,418
He takes after me. He's a real romantic.

366
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:41,087
- Is that true?
- No.

367
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:44,507
Yes, it is.
You're finally back to your old self.

368
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:45,675
No, I'm not!

369
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:49,136
I've never gotten her flowers

370
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,930
or asked her to move in.

371
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,062
What are you talking about?

372
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,563
Have you been drinking?

373
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:02,108
Wash up and pull yourself together.

374
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:04,610
We need to talk.

375
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:10,074
She just won't listen.

376
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,742
I told her to run.

377
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:15,746
What is this about?

378
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,917
What the hell was that?

379
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,044
Why are you lying?

380
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,629
Lying?

381
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:26,632
I gave you those flowers? When?

382
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:27,591
Where?

383
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,136
At the fountain.

384
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,179
Don't you remember?

385
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:34,098
Don't be ridiculous.

386
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,350
I never even went close to you that day.

387
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,560
What?

388
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,188
As far as I remember,
we were pretty close that day.

389
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:44,692
You hugged me.

390
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,321
I hugged you?

391
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,073
Me?

392
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:53,033
Wow.

393
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:55,619
Seriously?

394
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:59,415
After you held me so tight?

395
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,625
Are you denying it

396
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,919
like you denied holding my hand?

397
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,508
Are you saying you're telling the truth?

398
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:10,634
Just like last time?

399
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,094
What is your deal?

400
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:15,181
Why do you keep denying what you did?

401
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,975
What do you have to gain
by making me out to be a liar?

402
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:28,486
What the...

403
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,991
No way.

404
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,787
Was it my future self again?

405
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,791
I thought he had made up his mind.

406
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,043
He's just embarrassed.

407
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,795
Don't let it bother you.

408
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:48,422
- Let's eat.
- Dig in.

409
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:50,007
Thank you.

410
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:50,925
You're welcome.

411
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,593
I whipped up what I could.

412
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,637
I hope you like it.

413
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:57,848
It's really good.

414
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:03,813
I-na.

415
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,940
Say hello.

416
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,858
She'll be living with us from now on.

417
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:19,578
Put your phone away once in a while.

418
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,039
Your glasses are so thick already.

419
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:24,875
You don't want your eyesight
to get any worse.

420
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:26,794
Can't you hear me?

421
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:28,170
She can't.

422
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,719
You know I-na is a bit slow, don't you?

423
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:39,306
She's not exceptional in any way.

424
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,225
Everyone else in the Bok family

425
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,978
is extraordinary in some way.

426
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,356
She's only 13 years old.

427
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,693
She just needs a grown-up
who can bring out her potential.

428
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,321
I might have a superpower after all.

429
00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:57,867
I'm invisible.

430
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,703
No one talks to me at school.

431
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:02,454
So you heard everything?

432
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,248
See you.

433
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,792
I-na, have some breakfast.

434
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:09,044
I-na!

435
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,887
Being invisible isn't all that bad.

436
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:19,930
Hey, it's Jun-woo.

437
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:22,474
He's so handsome as usual.

438
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:23,642
Right?

439
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:25,811
I guess he's pretty good-looking.

440
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:36,196
I can spy on someone

441
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,782
without anyone finding out.

442
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:43,037
- No one even notices that I'm--
- I-na.

443
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:46,373
Why do you keep spying on people?

444
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,127
I saw you watching our practice.

445
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,211
It was you, right?

446
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,840
Are you interested in
joining the dance club?

447
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:58,385
The thing is,
we need more dancers for our show.

448
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:00,220
You should join us.

449
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,726
Hey, I'm talking to you.

450
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,519
Look at me.

451
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,355
Your eyesight must be really bad.

452
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:10,356
Such thick glasses.

453
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,191
- Can I try them on?
- Stop it!

454
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,829
Please don't touch my glasses.

455
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,732
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

456
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:55,359
Move out of the way.

457
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:00,656
Please check her makeup.

458
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,449
Let me touch up your makeup.

459
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:03,659
Hurry.

460
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,331
Go. Stand by.

461
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,877
Go. Stand by.

462
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:19,591
Go. Stand by.

463
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:26,724
Go.

464
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,310
Are you okay?

465
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,578
Good work.

466
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,163
- I'll call you later.
- Good work.

467
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:33,582
- Great job, Dong-hee.
- You were amazing.

468
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:34,750
- See you.
- Great job.

469
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,001
- See you.
- Good work.

470
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:38,629
Thank you.

471
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,713
Ms. Bok.

472
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:41,131
Hello, sir.

473
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,299
Congratulations on your debut.

474
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:47,554
It was as if you were
floating on the runway.

475
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:48,847
Thank you.

476
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:50,057
Great job.

477
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:05,841
I'm Bok Dong-hee!

478
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:16,852
What the...

479
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:28,697
No.

480
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,490
No!

481
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:32,409
No.

482
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:34,786
No.

483
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:54,848
- Who is it?
- I'm your realtor.

484
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:56,600
- I brought some potential buyers.
- What?

485
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,352
- Come on in.
- Wait.

486
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:01,188
Hold on a second.

487
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,482
She said to sell it as soon as possible.
Didn't you know?

488
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:05,567
What? That's news to me.

489
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:07,402
You should contact the owner.

490
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:09,696
Here's the living room.
The kitchen is that way.

491
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,406
Mom!

492
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,534
Are you short on money, Mom?

493
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,497
Where's this coming from?

494
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:21,583
Please excuse us. This is a family matter.

495
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,336
Ms. Do is one of us now.

496
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,546
I'll give you some space.

497
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,092
Wait.

498
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:55,409
You let her move in just like that?

499
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:56,702
They're going to live together?

500
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,996
She's here to take care of I-na.

501
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,290
Who cares about the reason?

502
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,293
This family really is doomed.

503
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,921
And why did you put my apartment
up for sale without telling me?

504
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,464
And why the hurry?

505
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:13,802
Would you rather see
the gym building get auctioned off?

506
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,053
What do you mean?

507
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:18,682
Are we that pressed for money?

508
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:21,935
You don't have to worry.

509
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:24,563
I started having dreams again.

510
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,941
Just a touch from Da-hae
is enough to put me to sleep.

511
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:28,859
Hold on.

512
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,193
See?

513
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:32,571
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

514
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:35,615
Money will start pouring in soon.

515
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:38,201
Mom, what about real estate?

516
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:40,162
What happened to our properties?

517
00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,122
Did all our stocks tank too?

518
00:40:43,498 --> 00:40:44,708
Wait.

519
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,627
Did you invest in crypto?

520
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:49,713
Go away. I'm trying to sleep.

521
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,090
Where am I supposed to go?

522
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,302
I'm about to lose my home.

523
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,013
Darn it.

524
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,191
Mom?

525
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:14,654
Are you asleep?

526
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:47,813
Will I really go back in time

527
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:49,815
for Do Da-hae?

528
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:51,900
I got a voice recording that says

529
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,361
Ms. Bok caused
financial damage to her family.

530
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:55,862
The problem is,

531
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,031
the damage is more significant
than we thought.

532
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:01,326
We better look out
for the supernatural family.

533
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,873
So she's the one who'll change me?

534
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,210
I find that hard to believe right now.

535
00:42:12,254 --> 00:42:13,672
Supernatural, my foot.

536
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:15,298
Let's speed things up.

537
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,320
Dinner's ready.

538
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,158
Come and eat.

539
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:49,749
- You should stay for dinner.
- I'm on a diet.

540
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,465
Are you heading out?

541
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:57,549
Yes.

542
00:42:58,383 --> 00:43:00,093
I have free time for once.

543
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,180
- I'm sorry.
- See you later.

544
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,191
You're home.

545
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:15,984
Come and have dinner.

546
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,540
I can't seem to get I-na to eat.

547
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:32,667
What does she like?

548
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,711
Are you planning
to win her over with food?

549
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,923
She's not interested in food.

550
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:40,008
She's not interested in people either.

551
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:42,135
So how do you think she feels

552
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:44,346
about eating with people?

553
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:47,557
Sitting around the table,

554
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,559
sharing food with family,

555
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,103
and asking about each other's day?

556
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:53,355
We're not that kind of family.

557
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,150
You don't know, do you?

558
00:43:58,485 --> 00:43:59,986
What kind of food she likes.

559
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:11,289
Good grief.

560
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,143
Give them back.

561
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:34,062
You have such pretty eyes.

562
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,648
Why are you covering them?

563
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:39,359
Do you shoot lasers out of them?

564
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,194
Is that your superpower?

565
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,071
Give them back right now.

566
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:49,494
You're not invisible.

567
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:53,331
You just act like
everyone around you is invisible.

568
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:05,302
Wait a second.

569
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:08,471
Give me exactly 30 seconds.

570
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:11,808
And you can have these back.

571
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:18,898
Stay still.

572
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:24,237
Come on. I won't hurt you.

573
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,450
It's been 30 seconds.

574
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,160
Yes, ma'am.

575
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:37,917
You're done.

576
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,463
Ta-da. Have a look.

577
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,177
See? You're not invisible at all.

578
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:49,137
You could really stand out.

579
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:56,853
Stop covering your eyes.

580
00:45:57,479 --> 00:45:58,521
The eyes are the window

581
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:00,106
to the soul.

582
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:03,318
That's exactly why I cover mine.

583
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:04,319
I don't like that.

584
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:10,492
That makes sense.

585
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:15,163
Knowing what others think
can be pretty scary.

586
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:19,751
But the more you avoid them,
the scarier it'll get.

587
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:22,295
Once you look, it's not that bad.

588
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:25,256
You might even discover something good

589
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,050
in people's eyes.

590
00:46:57,956 --> 00:46:59,290
I knew it.

591
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,542
You hold the key.

592
00:47:05,463 --> 00:47:07,465
You mean the key
to the 50-billion-won building?

593
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:10,635
What...

594
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,054
did you just say?

595
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,197
Is she a psychic or something?

596
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,333
Hey, wait.

597
00:47:43,418 --> 00:47:44,711
Are you wearing makeup?

598
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,254
No.

599
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,173
You can't fool me. You look different.

600
00:47:49,924 --> 00:47:51,134
Okay, I got it.

601
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:53,136
You got your eyebrows done.

602
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,138
Did you do them yourself?

603
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:57,390
They look great.

604
00:47:58,558 --> 00:48:00,894
Don't be shy. Let me have a closer look.

605
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,358
Sorry.

606
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:10,862
I'd rather be invisible.

607
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:17,785
It's dangerous to stand out.

608
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:31,132
I don't have any glasses to hide behind.

609
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:46,439
She's right.

610
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:48,608
You look different.

611
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,860
Don't look me in the eye.

612
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:58,618
She's pretty.

613
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,373
You're Bok I-na, right?

614
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:04,791
What?

615
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,252
Yes.

616
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:10,672
I heard you joined the club.

617
00:49:10,672 --> 00:49:11,589
What?

618
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:13,591
Yes.

619
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:16,761
I see why you're so touchy
about your glasses.

620
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:18,805
You seem so lost

621
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:20,682
without them.

622
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:31,651
Hey, I-na.

623
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,778
Does this mean you'll join our club?

624
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:36,614
You made the right choice.

625
00:49:40,868 --> 00:49:42,996
Did I lose weight
because of all the stress?

626
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,881
I barely lost any.

627
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:55,508
You're right.

628
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:57,135
I'm surprised.

629
00:49:58,344 --> 00:50:00,638
You seem awfully interested
in my body weight.

630
00:50:00,638 --> 00:50:01,848
It's my job.

631
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,559
Hey, why don't you work out with me?

632
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,769
I'll give you a discount
since you're Mr. Bok's family.

633
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:10,106
Come on.

634
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:17,238
Hi, babe.

635
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:20,450
Let's have a nice dinner tonight.

636
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,368
- It's my cheat day.
- I have surgery.

637
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:24,912
Surgery?

638
00:50:26,372 --> 00:50:27,248
Right.

639
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,417
That's too bad.

640
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,419
Bye.

641
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:41,304
Hey, it's me.

642
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,351
About that lady you told me about
who has connections everywhere.

643
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:47,518
Can I meet her tonight?

644
00:50:48,728 --> 00:50:52,023
I made a dinner reservation at
the French restaurant at Emporium Hotel.

645
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:54,609
Of course it's my treat.

646
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:59,614
Did you enjoy your food, ma'am?

647
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:01,616
- I did.
- I loved it, Dong-hee.

648
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:02,700
Really?

649
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:05,495
But now I feel bad.

650
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:09,999
Maybe we should visit your clinic
with a few of our golf buddies.

651
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,377
That would be amazing.

652
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:15,254
Please do.

653
00:51:15,254 --> 00:51:19,842
Dr. Jo will make sure you can smile
without worrying about wrinkles.

654
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,135
Can he really do that?

655
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:22,845
- Trust me.
- Of course.

656
00:51:22,845 --> 00:51:24,597
You're beautiful as you are though.

657
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:30,019
I have something on my face.

658
00:51:40,905 --> 00:51:43,074
- Will you see them off for me?
- Sure.

659
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:46,369
Ma'am, I need to use the restroom.

660
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,079
Please excuse me.

661
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,372
See you at the clinic.

662
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:52,417
- See you.
- Okay, good night.

663
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:27,660
Let's go in.

664
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,038
Let me think for a second.

665
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,874
It was your idea.

666
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:34,917
What's there to think about?

667
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:40,673
I like girls who act without thinking.

668
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:42,216
What?

669
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:05,531
Wait a minute.

670
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:08,659
What the hell?

671
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,246
- Why would she just leave?
- What?

672
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,204
I packed all your stuff.

673
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:54,288
Take it.

674
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:56,290
Are you moving back home?

675
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,875
Just for the time being.

676
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,460
I need some cash.

677
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:03,422
While we're at it,

678
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:05,842
why don't we take a break too?

679
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:08,427
What?

680
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:10,096
To be honest,

681
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:11,597
I miss when you were lighter.

682
00:54:12,473 --> 00:54:14,350
And I'm not talking about your weight.

683
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,560
I'm talking about your heart

684
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,562
and soul.

685
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:19,939
I was your fan when you were a model.

686
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,190
Remember?

687
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,068
Nothing in this world
could weigh you down.

688
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:26,195
How should I put this?

689
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:28,531
That's right.

690
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,950
It was as if you had wings.

691
00:54:35,997 --> 00:54:38,124
I think I might have done this to you,

692
00:54:38,624 --> 00:54:40,001
and it pains me.

693
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:46,048
That's one way of saying
that you're bailing out

694
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,385
because this relationship
doesn't seem beneficial to you.

695
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:52,763
Way to beat around the bush.

696
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:54,891
Come on. That's absurd.

697
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:56,517
I just feel bad

698
00:54:56,517 --> 00:55:00,062
that you're losing yourself
while trying to accommodate me.

699
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:02,648
I'm giving you a chance
to take care of yourself.

700
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,108
It's all for your sake.

701
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:10,907
As you said, let's take a break.

702
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:13,951
Please leave now.

703
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:17,121
I have to hurry
if I want to salvage anything

704
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:18,581
from that sinking ship.

705
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,064
Dinner's ready.

706
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:49,779
Dinner's ready, everyone.

707
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:25,022
What were you holding that for?

708
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:26,774
Is that a fireplace poker?

709
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,442
Did you make it yourself?

710
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,465
Are you scared of fire?

711
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:55,636
I had a bit of a...

712
00:56:57,471 --> 00:56:59,140
bad experience with it.

713
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,641
So why use the stove to cook?

714
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:02,643
No one's going to eat anyway.

715
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:05,396
Don't families usually...

716
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,567
share a meal around a table
at least once a day?

717
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,445
But then again,

718
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:14,864
I haven't had a family for so long.

719
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,894
Should I prepare a new batch of stew?

720
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,604
You don't have to try so hard.

721
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:49,732
As I said,

722
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:53,402
we're not the kind of family
that sits around a table to break bread.

723
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:58,532
I asked her to make it.

724
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:10,336
Sorry.

725
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:13,130
I messed up the stew.

726
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,637
It's fine. I like these too.

727
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,378
Enjoy.

728
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,130
Enjoy, I-na.

729
00:59:22,741 --> 00:59:25,578
I gave her those flowers?

730
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:27,455
I mean,

731
00:59:27,455 --> 00:59:28,831
I'm going to give her those?

732
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,666
They were in full bloom when I got them.

733
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,626
They're wilting so quickly.

734
00:59:33,878 --> 00:59:34,920
That's why people

735
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:37,423
buy ones that haven't fully bloomed,

736
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,634
but that's like sacrificing
the present for the future.

737
00:59:42,303 --> 00:59:44,096
I felt like you gifted me the present.

738
00:59:45,097 --> 00:59:46,223
I liked that.

739
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,813
Ms. Bok only thinks
that I'm the one who saved you,

740
00:59:53,439 --> 00:59:55,983
- but you saved me too.
- Did I?

741
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,030
You let me...

742
01:00:02,823 --> 01:00:03,908
into your family.

743
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:30,392
Well...

744
01:00:31,352 --> 01:00:32,561
I actually...

745
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:33,854
That's what family is for.

746
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,318
We have each other's backs.

747
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,817
I can only return to the moments

748
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:22,027
I spent with Do Da-hae.

749
01:01:24,822 --> 01:01:26,073
She's the only one

750
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,701
who can see me.

751
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:36,292
She's the only one I can touch.

752
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:41,463
However...

753
01:01:42,506 --> 01:01:43,340
I'm...

754
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,677
Good evening. Would you like some flowers?

755
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:48,178
I'm not

756
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,389
ready yet.

757
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:58,272
You can't get those later.

758
01:01:58,272 --> 01:02:00,774
They'll be out of season soon.

759
01:02:00,774 --> 01:02:02,568
I'll give you a discount.

760
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:06,196
So it's now or never?

761
01:02:06,196 --> 01:02:07,615
They're yours for 10,000 won.

762
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:21,045
Jeez, I'm never coming back here.

763
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:23,756
I thought this was a wealthy neighborhood.

764
01:02:24,256 --> 01:02:26,592
Why is he hesitating over 10,000 won?

765
01:02:30,554 --> 01:02:32,056
Do you want them or not?

766
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,725
Where did he go?

767
01:02:36,435 --> 01:02:37,269
What?

768
01:02:38,646 --> 01:02:39,855
Where did he go?

769
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,065
Did he steal them?

770
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:51,885
Do Da-hae may really be

771
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:53,512
the only one

772
01:03:54,513 --> 01:03:56,014
who can save I-na and me.

773
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:12,614
But there's only one way I can save her.

774
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:26,378
It's by pushing her away

775
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:28,714
as far as I can.

776
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:57,993
You made it.

777
01:05:05,918 --> 01:05:07,169
I'm not giving her these.

778
01:05:08,378 --> 01:05:09,463
And I won't hug her

779
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:11,924
no matter what.

780
01:05:14,468 --> 01:05:15,511
Listen.

781
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:18,263
I can't save...

782
01:06:03,475 --> 01:06:06,144
My head is killing me.

783
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,647
Do you have a headache?

784
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:12,025
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Sounds good.

785
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:14,611
Where's my husband?

786
01:06:14,611 --> 01:06:15,863
He stepped out for a bit.

787
01:06:58,739 --> 01:06:59,907
I want some tea too.

788
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:02,034
Good evening.

789
01:07:03,827 --> 01:07:05,871
I'm moving back in.

790
01:07:06,496 --> 01:07:08,248
Like it or not.

791
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:11,209
Of course I do. Welcome back.

792
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:13,378
I'll get you some tea. Just a moment.

793
01:07:18,258 --> 01:07:19,384
I'll just take this cup.

794
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:21,386
That's for your mother!

795
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:31,480
Did you put something in it?

796
01:07:33,023 --> 01:07:34,024
Sorry?

797
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,947
I was wondering how you got her to sleep.

798
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,865
It must have been sleeping pills.

799
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:45,911
You'll be in serious trouble
if she finds out.

800
01:08:06,974 --> 01:08:07,975
Look.

801
01:08:09,434 --> 01:08:11,979
I just wanted to get you some hot tea.

802
01:08:11,979 --> 01:08:12,938
Right.

803
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:18,402
Let me get you a saucer.

804
01:08:30,163 --> 01:08:30,998
Here you go.

805
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:55,647
Don't fall asleep.

806
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:14,583
Don't fall asleep.

807
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,218
Is there anything expensive here?

808
01:10:07,552 --> 01:10:09,513
Something no one will miss.

809
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:20,023
Let's see.

810
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:24,486
Ms. Bok Dong-hee,
you've pocketed family assets

811
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,197
behind your mentally unwell
mother and brother's backs.

812
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:31,076
I'm sorry, but you're disqualified
from being their legal guardian.

813
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,393
Nothing here.

814
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:00,564
Not here.

815
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:03,650
Not here either.

816
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:06,630
Who was that?

817
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:09,799
Who's there?

818
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:19,434
She's a ghost.

819
01:12:20,143 --> 01:12:23,271
This house is haunted.

820
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:33,490
Are you okay?

821
01:12:38,995 --> 01:12:39,996
Well...

822
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:47,128
What's wrong?

823
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:17,951
Hold on.

824
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:20,328
Let me just...

825
01:13:22,038 --> 01:13:24,249
Excuse me.

826
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:37,804
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

827
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:11,338
One of two things happens
when people find out about our powers.

828
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:14,841
They either run away
or take advantage of us.

829
01:14:15,508 --> 01:14:17,802
I'll show you what kind of person I am.

830
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:20,472
Slowly, but surely.

831
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:22,307
Please show me every single detail.

832
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:24,351
I can see why Jun-woo is so into you.

833
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:27,145
You're really my first.

834
01:14:28,146 --> 01:14:30,065
Guess what I hate hearing the most.

835
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,652
It was an ominous dream.

836
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:37,155
Love has to come first

837
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:39,949
for us to reach

838
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,285
the future you talked about.

839
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:48,291
