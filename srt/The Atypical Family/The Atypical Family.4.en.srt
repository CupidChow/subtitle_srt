1
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,957
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,376
You made it.

3
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,140
I'm not giving her these.

4
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,434
And I won't hug her

5
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,936
no matter what.

6
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,021
Listen.

7
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:13,856
I can't save...

8
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,170
Mr. Bok.

9
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,970
That was a close one.

10
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,888
Thank you.

11
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,395
What's with the flowers?

12
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,024
Are they for me?

13
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,361
Oh my goodness.

14
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,573
How did you know these were my favorite?

15
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,702
- So this is how it happened.
- They're so pretty.

16
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:09,954
When did you...

17
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:36,605
I saved someone

18
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,607
in the past.

19
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,651
Gwi-ju.

20
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,862
Gwi-ju.

21
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,370
I was walking up here
when you appeared out of thin air.

22
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,460
Is your power back?

23
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,545
Dad.

24
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,174
I saved someone.

25
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,151
It's over here.

26
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,843
I had no idea.

27
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:49,511
No one could ever find it.

28
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,558
I've been compiling a digital archive

29
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:56,018
to keep up with the times.

30
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,566
So you did something
you couldn't do before?

31
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:03,484
Yes.

32
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:08,155
There were some precedents
from our ancestors.

33
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,615
There it is.

34
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,409
During the Injo reign
of the Joseon Dynasty,

35
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,787
there was a lady who could use telekinesis

36
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:18,666
whose power was
barely strong enough to lift pebbles.

37
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,001
However, when her village was attacked,

38
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,003
she moved rocks the size of houses

39
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,505
and rained them upon the enemy.

40
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:26,465
Her power evolved.

41
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:29,093
Her desperation must have
amplified its magnitude.

42
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:31,428
And you desperately wanted to save people.

43
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,764
I couldn't save anyone until now.

44
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,186
So why can I save

45
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,313
Do Da-hae?

46
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,233
Hey, follow me.

47
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:49,697
Awakening of power
induced by a particular encounter...

48
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:55,160
Let's see here.

49
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:58,372
There it is.

50
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,253
Your great-great-grandfather
was able to breathe fire.

51
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:07,589
At first, his power was not whole.

52
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,342
When he was little, his nose was so hot

53
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,761
that anyone who touched it got burned,

54
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:15,681
which forced him to live in hiding.

55
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,726
Later, he was enlisted as a soldier.

56
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,562
When his dear comrade-in-arms
held his hand,

57
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,481
he started breathing fire
through his nose.

58
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,609
The power of his flames was overwhelming.

59
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,153
So his power was somehow

60
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,155
- unsealed.
- That's not it.

61
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,948
His power finally became whole

62
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:35,075
when the right person came into his life.

63
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,621
But my power is far from whole.

64
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,167
I have no control over it.

65
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,252
It's a mess.

66
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,629
Love is meant to be uncontrollable.

67
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,214
I'm not in love.

68
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,638
There was also a lady
who was a shapeshifter.

69
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,475
Each time she encountered
the scholar she loved,

70
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:02,519
her powers turned her into
a different person.

71
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,940
Eventually, she forgot
how to go back to her original form.

72
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,736
Even after transforming
into hundreds of women,

73
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:13,530
she failed to capture the scholar's heart.

74
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:18,911
He had been harboring feelings
for a certain woman for a long time.

75
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:23,248
Out of yearning for the woman
who had disappeared so suddenly,

76
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:26,293
he painted a portrait of her.

77
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,670
Guess who the woman was.

78
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,090
Was it the woman in her original form?

79
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,007
Precisely.

80
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,135
In the end, not only did she find love,

81
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,054
but also her own self that she had lost.

82
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,061
Do Da-hae could be the one for you.

83
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,941
I'll go tell your mom.

84
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,152
Not just yet.

85
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,695
Like the door from that day,

86
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:55,656
we don't know what this means yet.

87
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,788
In that case, let's give it some time

88
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,373
until we can be certain.

89
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,125
Okay.

90
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,668
Either way, congratulations.

91
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:11,296
On what?

92
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:13,424
You got to use your power
in a meaningful way.

93
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:15,092
Just like you always wanted.

94
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,126
She's a ghost.

95
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:53,046
This house is haunted.

96
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:54,840
What the hell?

97
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,184
Ms. Do?

98
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:08,896
Wait.

99
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,482
You were...

100
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,486
upstairs just now.

101
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,300
You're...

102
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,594
a ghost.

103
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,013
Hey.

104
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:44,681
Ms. Do.

105
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,766
Ms. Do!

106
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,809
What's all this noise?

107
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,478
My goodness!

108
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:51,647
What happened?

109
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,232
Something must have startled her.

110
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,025
- She said she saw a ghost.
- A ghost?

111
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,446
She was probably talking about me.

112
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,783
I skipped a few meals because I was sick,

113
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,743
and I managed to fly about this high.

114
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:06,995
She must've seen that.

115
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,290
You should've been more careful.

116
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,167
It's too early for her to find out.

117
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,127
You're right.

118
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,965
If I'd known your son's girlfriend
would sneak into our vault,

119
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,925
I would've been more careful.

120
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,051
Why was she there?

121
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:22,719
She was probably just passing by.

122
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,556
Why were you flying in that room anyway?

123
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,934
I was trying to catch a mosquito?

124
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,356
Let's lay her down first.

125
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:35,607
Let's do that.

126
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:37,442
Careful.

127
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:39,027
Be gentle.

128
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:47,578
Should have run away.

129
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:54,042
I thought she was healthy,

130
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,211
but she's surprisingly frail.

131
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,422
It takes some getting used to.

132
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,882
I was just as shocked
when I first saw your father

133
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:03,927
growing colorful scales on his body
and flapping around

134
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,429
like he was the Little Mermaid.

135
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,097
He was otherwise so proper.

136
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:11,893
Should we call an ambulance?

137
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:13,895
Looks like she's asleep.

138
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:18,066
You think so?

139
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:23,905
She is.

140
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,616
Poor thing.

141
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,995
She must have been so nervous
in this new environment.

142
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:32,039
That's not it.

143
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:36,293
She drank the tea she made for Mom.

144
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,919
She drugged it.

145
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,920
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,549
Your sister's just anxious
that she'll lose the building to you.

147
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:44,968
Let's go.

148
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,267
- Good luck with her.
- You don't even have any proof.

149
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:53,977
Come on.

150
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:02,569
I'm telling you.

151
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,780
Don't eat or drink anything she gives you.

152
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,740
You never know what she put in it.

153
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,284
Just don't let her
see you flying around again.

154
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,787
She can't see that until she's one of us.

155
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:12,913
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:21,713
You were...

157
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,050
just upstairs.

158
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,595
I was upstairs?

159
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,140
Could it have been me from the future?

160
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,870
PALACE SAUNA

161
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:23,692
Are you okay?

162
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,031
I had a dream.

163
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,540
Tell me the winning numbers.

164
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:44,045
Or was it stocks?

165
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:51,344
It was an ominous dream.

166
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,208
Ms. Do?

167
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,753
What the heck was that last night?

168
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,412
Good morning.

169
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:04,918
Hey.

170
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,713
You completely passed out.

171
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,216
It was as if

172
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,803
you'd been drugged or something.

173
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,181
I was...

174
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,060
pretty tired.

175
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,282
Did you see it?

176
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:36,992
Sorry?

177
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,159
Did it surprise you?

178
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,163
Never seen anything like it?

179
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,208
What's wrong?

180
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,587
Take a closer look...

181
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:51,923
at my pedicure.

182
00:15:58,638 --> 00:15:59,556
Join me sometime.

183
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,403
That sounds great.

184
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:16,740
I'd love to.

185
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,724
Are you okay?

186
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:47,896
I can see you.

187
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,570
Did you see me here last night?

188
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,030
Not again.

189
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,116
Do you not remember?

190
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,286
- Or are you pretending again?
- It doesn't matter.

191
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,414
Just tell me what happened.

192
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,460
Well...

193
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:15,048
You were standing here...

194
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:20,887
Are you leaving for school, I-na?

195
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,765
Have some breakfast.

196
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:28,645
I-na.

197
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,315
You should eat before you go.

198
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,818
Don't you want to grow tall?

199
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,240
I-na.

200
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,660
- Over easy or sunny-side up?
- Sunny-side up, please.

201
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,912
Sunny-side up it is.

202
00:17:52,836 --> 00:17:54,212
Good morning.

203
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,882
I tossed and turned all night.

204
00:17:57,882 --> 00:18:01,052
And when I finally fell asleep,

205
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:04,639
I had an unsettling dream.

206
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,767
What did you dream about?

207
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,821
Do you enjoy saunas, Ms. Do?

208
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:22,866
Oh no.

209
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,159
Oh my gosh.

210
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:25,994
I popped the yolk.

211
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:27,662
I'll make you a new one, I-na.

212
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:29,456
In my dream,

213
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:32,917
you were at a sauna.

214
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:36,337
Have you heard of Palace Sauna?

215
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:39,049
Sorry?

216
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,218
Sauna?

217
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,681
- Why do you ask?
- I saw you get carried out of that sauna

218
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:49,142
and into an ambulance.

219
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,520
An ambulance?

220
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,107
But then again,

221
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,151
it's just a concerned old woman's dream,

222
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,445
so don't be so alarmed.

223
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:05,700
But it wouldn't hurt
to stay away from saunas for a while.

224
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:09,829
You can never be too careful, right?

225
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,834
Even in your sleep,

226
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:17,629
you must have been worried about me.

227
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,464
Thank you.

228
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,762
I have to cook another egg.

229
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:27,138
I'm late.

230
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,640
I'm leaving.

231
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,684
You shouldn't just go
on an empty stomach, I-na.

232
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,187
Wait a minute, I-na.

233
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,278
I-na.

234
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,991
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,494
At least take this.

236
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:54,958
Have a nice day.

237
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,001
Didn't I warn you?

238
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:02,423
- Huh?
- My family has superpowers.

239
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,052
- What?
- Run away while you can.

240
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:16,396
She's kidding.

241
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,067
I have to get out of here.

242
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:33,496
I have to run.

243
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:12,869
In my dream,

244
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:16,998
you were at a sauna.

245
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:20,168
Have you heard of Palace Sauna?

246
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,922
If I walk in here now,
does that make her dream

247
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,132
a real precognitive dream?

248
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:53,534
They might actually have superpowers.

249
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:57,080
She must have seen things
under the influence.

250
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,250
She said she saw me here in her dream.

251
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,920
Maybe she had hired someone to tail you.

252
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,004
Forget it.

253
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,634
It's delusion that runs in their family,
not superpowers.

254
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:13,805
We have more than enough evidence
that they're not in their right minds.

255
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:15,390
Let's move on to the next step.

256
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:18,142
Register your marriage

257
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,728
and be appointed as their guardian.

258
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:23,189
I have a better idea.

259
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,566
Why don't I find another target?

260
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,037
Hey.

261
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,248
Shut up and get us
that marriage registration.

262
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,750
- Mom.
- What?

263
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,377
Are you scared of ghosts?

264
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,004
A ghost's money is still money.

265
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,922
Don't forget that you still owe me.

266
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,981
You must be Da-hae.

267
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,867
I told him to go easy on the booze.

268
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,121
Are you here alone?

269
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,497
Aren't there any grown-ups?

270
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:33,468
Good grief.

271
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:38,056
CONDOLENCES

272
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:45,980
This is nowhere near enough.

273
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:52,111
Your father's debt is yours now,
so you'll have to pay me back.

274
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,112
Come here.

275
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:57,784
I said come here.

276
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:08,169
Sign this.

277
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,261
BENEFICIARY: BAEK IL-HONG
INSURED: DO DA-HAE

278
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,853
I did some digging.

279
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:29,232
Every investment they've made
in the past few years has tanked.

280
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:32,235
All they have left is their house

281
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:34,570
and the gym building.

282
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:39,033
At this rate, they'll be penniless soon.

283
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,077
We can't waste any more time.

284
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,538
We have to salvage what's left of it.

285
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:48,960
You can retire as my lead actress
and ride off into the sunset after this.

286
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,086
I'll retire too.

287
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:00,972
You might as well
relax for a bit in the sauna.

288
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:02,557
You're already here.

289
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:17,363
Welcome.

290
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:30,835
Get out.

291
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,962
- What?
- You can't come in.

292
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:37,133
What's your problem?

293
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:44,015
CHANGE INTO SAUNA CLOTHES
BEFORE ENTERING

294
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:54,483
I saw you get carried out of that sauna

295
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:56,402
and into an ambulance.

296
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:18,382
Hey.

297
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:21,886
- What are you doing?
- Call an ambulance.

298
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:24,764
I think I'm bleeding.

299
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,265
Wait. No, I'm not.

300
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,602
Precognitive dreams, my foot.

301
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:32,980
Do you know why bad dreams come true?

302
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,733
It's because it gets in your head.

303
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,735
You can't help but tense up and get hurt

304
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:39,987
when you're so worried about it.

305
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:41,989
Get up already.

306
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,374
You think so?

307
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,884
No, I still think
I might have cracked my skull.

308
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,386
UNCLE

309
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:18,734
What now?

310
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,531
You're sweating.

311
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:29,036
- Why don't you get off my--
- When you sweat,

312
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:31,539
it makes the floor slippery, sir.

313
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,833
Excuse me.

314
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,418
I'd like to order some gimbap.

315
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,838
Some noodles and eggs too.

316
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,298
Is no one here?

317
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:41,215
Excuse me!

318
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,967
Here are your drinks.

319
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:14,999
Your food's ready.

320
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,297
DO DA-HAE

321
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,468
I have a new piece of information.

322
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:41,859
BAEK IL-HONG

323
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,785
NOH HYEONG-TAE

324
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:53,329
Is my food ready yet?

325
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:54,872
One moment, please.

326
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,166
Please hurry up.

327
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,670
Use your signature move
when the time comes.

328
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,176
- Mom.
-"Mom"?

329
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,893
You said you didn't have any family.

330
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,661
I can explain.

331
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,162
The thing is...

332
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,211
Da-hae is...

333
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:44,630
She's...

334
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:48,008
Fire!

335
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,469
Everyone out!

336
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:53,013
Please don't panic!

337
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:55,099
Fire!

338
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:59,562
Everyone out!

339
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,107
To the emergency exit!

340
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:04,608
Everyone out!

341
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:40,978
Ms. Do.

342
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:45,566
Ms. Do.

343
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,193
I got you.

344
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,196
Get up.

345
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,210
I told you.

346
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,503
Call an ambulance.

347
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,216
Ms. Do.

348
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,302
Are you okay?

349
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:25,231
PALACE SAUNA

350
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:43,666
Want to come with us?

351
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,511
Please read and sign this.

352
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:56,595
Okay.

353
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:03,102
Write your name here.

354
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,019
GUARDIAN

355
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:10,067
I'm not really her mom.

356
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,238
I used to know her dad,

357
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:16,532
and that somehow got us here.

358
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:19,159
He got drunk and froze to death

359
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,495
on the street in the middle of winter.

360
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:25,124
The only people
who showed up at his funeral

361
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:29,753
were loan sharks
who came to take the condolence money.

362
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:32,131
There was no grown-up to take care of her.

363
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,300
She was all by herself.

364
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:36,969
Not long after that,

365
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,930
she went through a terrible accident.

366
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,413
You're up. Do you know where you are?

367
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:08,542
- Have you contacted her guardian?
- Not yet.

368
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,628
I don't have one.

369
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:18,177
Stay in bed.

370
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:19,470
Don't get up.

371
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:25,851
What are you doing?

372
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,611
I can't afford this.

373
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,112
What?

374
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,628
I'm her guardian.

375
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,181
Sucks for you.

376
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,477
You won't get my insurance money yet.

377
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,983
You can pay me back while you're alive.

378
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,491
Hey.

379
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,077
Be my daughter.

380
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:34,128
I only took care of her for a while,

381
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:36,005
but she still calls me Mom.

382
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,297
Poor thing.

383
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:41,427
She told me that she almost died once.

384
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:44,555
She did?

385
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:48,809
She hardly ever tells anyone about it.

386
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,813
What happened?

387
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,274
You don't know the details, do you?

388
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,276
Ask her yourself.

389
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:58,902
It's a touchy subject.

390
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:04,908
Do you know how her name came to be?

391
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:09,163
Her dad loved mugwort soup
with dodari fish in it,

392
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:11,582
and she happened to be born in the spring.

393
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,961
That's when the fish is in season.

394
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:18,464
He was about to
register her name as Do Da-ri,

395
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:21,341
but the civil servant
barely managed to talk him out of it.

396
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:23,844
In the end, he changed the last syllable.

397
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:28,766
He named her Da-hae, meaning "do it all,"

398
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,851
so she can do anything she wants.

399
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,021
It's a nice name.

400
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,356
No.

401
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,485
It's not such a nice name either.

402
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:43,530
It became more of a curse than a blessing.

403
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,659
She's had to do everything
on her own to survive.

404
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,957
I hope she'll find someone
to stay by her side.

405
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:03,842
MOTHER

406
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:16,939
Get up.

407
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:26,824
I told you, Mom.

408
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,243
There's something about the Bok family.

409
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:30,661
We better not mess with--

410
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,246
Get me the marriage registration.

411
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:34,790
That's your way out.

412
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,166
From that family

413
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,334
and from me.

414
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,382
Yes, Mother.

415
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:46,301
Ms. Do left without saying anything,

416
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:47,845
and she hasn't come back.

417
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:50,097
Do you think she went to the sauna?

418
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,974
- She did.
- What?

419
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:53,892
Is she okay?

420
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:56,979
She's in the ER.

421
00:36:57,646 --> 00:36:58,522
What?

422
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,482
Is it serious?

423
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:01,984
What happened?

424
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:06,280
I told her not to go there.

425
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,198
Calm down.

426
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:09,324
I'll call you later.

427
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:17,916
It really was a precognitive dream.

428
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:22,129
But why do I only see
Do Da-hae in every dream?

429
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:27,676
Keep applying pressure on it.

430
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:29,303
Thank you.

431
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:42,024
She left.

432
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:44,860
She had to go back to the sauna.

433
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,248
EMERGENCY ROOM RELEASE FORM

434
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,671
GUARDIAN: BOK GWI-JU

435
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,303
Just a moment, please.

436
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:16,391
Did you follow me?

437
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,770
It's just...

438
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:22,105
You left in such a hurry.

439
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:25,984
Why didn't you say anything

440
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,694
when my mother mentioned the sauna?

441
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:34,034
Has she been checking my background?

442
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:35,535
Be honest with me.

443
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,416
To tell you the truth,

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,085
I was a little worried

445
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,463
that my mother's dream would come true.

446
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:54,888
Are you saying

447
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:59,184
she really can see the future
in her dreams?

448
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:09,611
But I thought you had all lost your powers
because of your lifestyle diseases.

449
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,488
We got them back.

450
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,198
But they've changed.

451
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:19,204
I go back in time
for a different reason now.

452
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,457
It's Do Da-hae.

453
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:25,836
What?

454
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:29,715
Me?

455
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:34,761
When I held your hand at the mall

456
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:37,723
and showed up at the fountain
with flowers,

457
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,016
it was me from the future.

458
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:41,476
What?

459
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:43,437
It's not that I forgot what I did.

460
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,523
What had already happened to you

461
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:48,233
just hadn't happened to me yet.

462
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:51,320
Hold on.

463
00:39:53,238 --> 00:39:54,489
What are you talking about?

464
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,408
Think about it.

465
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:58,577
Didn't I disappear all of a sudden

466
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,078
both times?

467
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,330
When did you...

468
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:08,337
Is that also why

469
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,340
your reflection wasn't
in the mirror last night?

470
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,342
I'm not only invisible in the mirror.

471
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:15,177
You're the only one who can see me.

472
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,971
You're the only one
who can see or touch me.

473
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,389
You're in color,

474
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,558
while everything else
is in black and white.

475
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:23,352
But why...

476
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:26,855
Why me?

477
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:28,940
Why?

478
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,109
Why me, of all people?

479
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:32,652
I'm not sure.

480
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:35,197
But one thing is for sure.

481
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:36,948
Do Da-hae's past

482
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:38,784
is my future.

483
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,495
The moments I spent with you...

484
00:40:44,456 --> 00:40:45,832
pull me back into them.

485
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,934
You told her our secret?

486
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:06,686
How could you be so rash?

487
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:08,522
What if she gets scared and runs away?

488
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:10,440
We couldn't hide it any longer.

489
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,025
You told her about your dream.

490
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:15,237
How could I not tell her
about such a dream?

491
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:16,822
I know.

492
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:18,949
I wonder why you dreamed of it.

493
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:33,672
I have to go back.

494
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:35,549
Gwi-ju.

495
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,470
I can't go back to the past.

496
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:43,098
I have to go back to Se-yeon.

497
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:45,725
I have to undo everything.

498
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:47,310
Don't you remember?

499
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:50,147
You can only go back to happy moments.

500
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,066
And even if you did,
you couldn't change anything.

501
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:54,359
Just let it go.

502
00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:00,532
I found this in her bag.

503
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,993
If she was pregnant,

504
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:06,079
why didn't she tell me?

505
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,919
Because it was another man's child.

506
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:19,009
- What?
- She was seeing someone.

507
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:21,303
She was even planning to move in with him.

508
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:23,555
Didn't she say anything to you?

509
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:27,601
How do you know that?

510
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:45,827
I never dreamed about Se-yeon.

511
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:48,246
It made me anxious
that I couldn't see anything.

512
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,332
So you never considered her family.

513
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,251
Don't blame her for your dreams.

514
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:57,214
It's not her fault that you only dream
about how to make money!

515
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:00,050
What did you dream about
on the day she died?

516
00:43:01,218 --> 00:43:03,220
If you had dreamed about her just once,

517
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:05,347
we could've prevented her death!

518
00:43:05,972 --> 00:43:08,016
I can only see what I'm shown.

519
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:10,560
Even if I had dreamed about her,
it wouldn't have changed a thing.

520
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:13,146
Just like you can't change the past,

521
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:14,898
I can't change the future.

522
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,949
I had a nightmare a long time ago.

523
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,411
It was about someone's death.

524
00:43:29,412 --> 00:43:31,706
I did all I could do to prevent it,

525
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,459
but I couldn't stop what was meant to be.

526
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:37,837
I was overwhelmed by the futility and fear

527
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:41,174
of not being able to do anything
about a tragedy I know will happen!

528
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:44,636
Trust me, I've been there.

529
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,434
Why did you never tell me?

530
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:55,647
Because just thinking about it
broke my heart into pieces!

531
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:57,941
The dream was about my own father's death.

532
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,074
So basically,

533
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:09,536
we've been cursed for generations.

534
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:12,497
Depending on how you see it,
it could be a blessing.

535
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:18,086
How can it be a blessing
to have these useless powers?

536
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,672
What's the point of seeing the future
or going back to the past?

537
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:22,882
We can never change anything
or save anyone!

538
00:44:22,882 --> 00:44:26,553
You should be grateful
that you can have a glimpse at the past.

539
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:28,763
Wanting more than that
is pure greed and arrogance.

540
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:31,391
I'm actually grateful

541
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:36,605
that I only see the stock charts
and lottery numbers in my dreams.

542
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:40,692
Our ancestors have been
literally ripped apart and burned alive

543
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:43,278
trying to play heroes!

544
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:46,781
From now on,
only look back on your happiness.

545
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,659
Stop looking back on others' misfortunes,

546
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:53,038
and don't get in over your head
trying to save others!

547
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:55,123
I wish it would just go away.

548
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:11,139
It's been seven years

549
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:12,766
since I stopped dreaming.

550
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:14,351
I told you.

551
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:17,354
She can help us recover what we've lost.

552
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:20,565
Too bad it's not
the type of dream you want.

553
00:45:21,149 --> 00:45:23,443
I know you'd rather dream
about the lottery and stocks.

554
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:25,236
I'm sure I will soon.

555
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:26,529
Maybe this is your chance.

556
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:29,866
To use your power to help others,

557
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:31,910
not just for your own greed.

558
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,954
Are you still naive enough
to dream of being a hero?

559
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:37,415
Even after I told you about my dream,

560
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:39,084
you couldn't protect Do Da-hae.

561
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,002
Who knows?

562
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:42,796
I might be able to.

563
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,867
How do you like living with us?

564
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:14,619
It's been great.

565
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:15,870
Thanks to your kindness.

566
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,414
You don't have to do that.

567
00:46:17,414 --> 00:46:18,915
Be honest with me.

568
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,335
My family can be a handful.

569
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:24,671
The more you know,
the more confusing it gets.

570
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:31,428
But I think

571
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:34,139
I've figured you out.

572
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:36,266
Already?

573
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,145
I'll show you what kind of person I am.

574
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:41,855
Slowly,

575
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:43,064
but surely.

576
00:46:43,898 --> 00:46:47,235
Please show me every single detail,
slowly but surely.

577
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:48,361
I will.

578
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:50,280
It takes time to get to know someone.

579
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,823
And I'll be watching you.

580
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,493
See you.

581
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:56,661
Bye.

582
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,042
Watch your step.

583
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:04,377
I will.

584
00:47:30,236 --> 00:47:31,070
Bok Man-huem.

585
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:32,947
Precognitive dreams.

586
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:34,991
Has trouble dreaming

587
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:36,409
due to insomnia.

588
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,079
Um Sun-gu. No superpower.

589
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,498
Married into the family.

590
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:43,625
Bok Dong-hee.

591
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:45,168
Able to fly.

592
00:47:45,752 --> 00:47:46,628
Lost her power

593
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,255
due to obesity.

594
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:52,175
Bok Gwi-ju.

595
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:55,637
Able to return to a happy moment

596
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,139
from the past.

597
00:47:59,516 --> 00:48:00,725
No longer feels happy

598
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:03,311
due to depression.

599
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:09,484
But...

600
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:15,949
he might be starting to feel happy again.

601
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:21,788
STARTING TO FEEL HAPPY AGAIN?

602
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:28,503
The moments I spent with you

603
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:30,922
pull me back into them.

604
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:36,386
Bok I-na.

605
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,264
Her superpower...

606
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,225
Not so sure.

607
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:48,815
Bok Man-huem can see the future,

608
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:52,402
Bok Dong-hee can fly,

609
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:56,197
and Bok Gwi-ju can return to the past,

610
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:00,285
but Bok I-na has no superpower?

611
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,662
You don't want to?

612
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:04,163
I can't.

613
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:05,373
Why not?

614
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,668
People will be looking at me.

615
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:11,129
Don't worry.
No one's going to look at you.

616
00:49:11,129 --> 00:49:12,213
They'll be looking at me.

617
00:49:16,342 --> 00:49:18,303
I'm kidding.

618
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:20,555
I'm just trying to help you relax.

619
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:22,807
- But...
- Since you're new,

620
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,434
you can have a seat and watch.

621
00:49:27,103 --> 00:49:28,730
How did she win Hye-rim over?

622
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,065
Hye-rim is so open-minded.

623
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:32,233
We could use some help.

624
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:35,194
She could clean and get us drinks.

625
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:38,156
I guess. Teachers favor quiet kids too,

626
00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,617
so keeping her around
might not be a bad idea.

627
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,453
Shall we get started?

628
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:46,497
All right.

629
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:48,958
Start with the hips.

630
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:58,009
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

631
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:01,888
One, swing, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

632
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:11,888
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

633
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:14,734
Five, six, seven, eight.

634
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:18,279
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

635
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:21,282
One, swing, three, four, five, six...

636
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:24,994
"ONE"
EPIK HIGH

637
00:50:44,681 --> 00:50:45,682
Don't you hear me?

638
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:47,558
I was talking to you.

639
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:50,019
Sorry.

640
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:53,231
What are you listening to?

641
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:05,868
Nice.

642
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:07,245
What's it called?

643
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,668
Come on, what is it called?

644
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:18,005
You know your music.

645
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:20,299
Where do you find all of these?

646
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:46,451
Guys, let's change the song.

647
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:49,704
- I-na found a good one.
- Nice.

648
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:51,456
I never liked this song anyway.

649
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:53,458
- Let's have a listen.
- Let's do that.

650
00:51:57,712 --> 00:51:58,546
I'm so tired.

651
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,631
Want to get some tteokbokki, Hye-rim?

652
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,674
Sure.

653
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:02,759
Is everyone coming?

654
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:05,136
Of course. If you're in, we're in.

655
00:52:05,136 --> 00:52:06,345
Let's go!

656
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:08,931
- I'm hungry.
- Tteokbokki!

657
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:11,225
- Tteokbokki!
- Last one there is buying!

658
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:16,105
I have to go to the academy.

659
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,280
See you.

660
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,474
Buy me some cup noodles too.

661
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,561
Weren't you getting tteokbokki?

662
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:58,439
I came to look for a friend
who left without saying goodbye.

663
00:52:59,065 --> 00:53:00,316
A friend?

664
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:02,193
Which one are you getting?

665
00:53:02,193 --> 00:53:03,903
SUPER HOT NOODLES

666
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,992
You don't look like the type
to enjoy such spicy food.

667
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:27,510
You're so cute.

668
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,805
She thinks I'm cute?

669
00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:34,350
I can see why Jun-woo is so into you.

670
00:53:38,145 --> 00:53:40,356
- He's not.
- He seemed interested in you.

671
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:42,775
What do you think about him?

672
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:57,123
I liked him first.

673
00:53:57,623 --> 00:53:58,624
You can't like him.

674
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:01,878
Not if you want to be friends with me.

675
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:09,051
What do you think about Jun-woo?

676
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:12,597
Well...

677
00:54:17,977 --> 00:54:19,103
I think he's a jerk.

678
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:25,526
Hey, Jun-woo.

679
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:38,122
Oh no.

680
00:54:39,123 --> 00:54:40,499
I think he heard us.

681
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,919
This is why I never want to know

682
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:45,379
what people really think.

683
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,817
Hey, Bok Don't Eat.

684
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:09,153
Have a drink.

685
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,489
Here.

686
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:19,747
Is it serious between you and Dr. Jo?

687
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:26,921
If it is, you should reconsider.

688
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:29,382
I'm just concerned about you.

689
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,217
He seemed like a nice person,

690
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:34,220
so I wanted to ask him for some advice,

691
00:55:34,804 --> 00:55:37,765
but he suddenly dragged me
to a hotel room.

692
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:38,683
I saw you.

693
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:40,476
You did?

694
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,187
I wasn't sure because you just left.

695
00:55:43,187 --> 00:55:45,147
How could you just leave?

696
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:47,149
Why didn't you pull out all of his hair?

697
00:55:47,775 --> 00:55:49,402
Not mine! His!

698
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:50,987
I'm a victim too!

699
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:55,574
Guess what I hate hearing the most.

700
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:00,538
"Fatty"?

701
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:04,667
"A woman's worst enemy

702
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:07,086
is another woman."

703
00:56:07,878 --> 00:56:09,630
I'm at fault for our relationship.

704
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:12,341
I should've taken better care of myself.

705
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:15,761
It's not just your size
that's extra-large.

706
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:18,180
You have a big heart too.

707
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:21,767
But it's unhealthy
to be so hard on yourself.

708
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:24,478
Finding the reasons within yourself.

709
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:25,980
That's true self-esteem.

710
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,774
That's how you take control of your life.

711
00:56:28,774 --> 00:56:29,734
Do you understand?

712
00:56:38,576 --> 00:56:39,994
Pretty inspiring take on life.

713
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:59,346
I have to reclaim my true self.

714
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:02,099
Once I do that,

715
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,019
everything else will fall in line.

716
00:57:25,206 --> 00:57:28,167
But it's unhealthy
to be so hard on yourself.

717
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:32,421
A girl's gotta eat.

718
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,346
Mom?

719
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:57,279
What are you doing there?

720
00:58:00,783 --> 00:58:03,077
She found out about our secrets.

721
00:58:04,203 --> 00:58:06,414
So you want to kill her
without anyone knowing?

722
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:10,584
No, I think she got spooked.
She's locked herself in.

723
00:58:10,584 --> 00:58:11,710
What?

724
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:16,632
Has she still not run away?

725
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:23,013
Maybe she did.

726
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:30,104
Are you there?

727
00:58:33,649 --> 00:58:35,025
Ms. Do.

728
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:37,945
Ms. Do?

729
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:45,536
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

730
00:58:45,536 --> 00:58:46,871
Can I come in?

731
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:51,125
The doctor said
that I needed to rest today.

732
00:58:52,585 --> 00:58:53,502
Please excuse me.

733
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:57,006
She's here.

734
00:59:00,676 --> 00:59:04,680
One of two things happens
when people find out about our powers.

735
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:07,975
They either run away
or take advantage of us.

736
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:35,878
It's not that I forgot what I did.

737
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:38,380
What had already happened to you

738
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:40,674
hadn't happened to me yet.

739
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:42,510
Do Da-hae's past

740
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:44,803
is my future.

741
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:53,395
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

742
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:35,813
I used to be powerless,

743
01:00:36,939 --> 01:00:38,232
but now I have a purpose.

744
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:45,864
The only person I can save in the past.

745
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:47,950
Do Da-hae.

746
01:00:50,536 --> 01:00:51,537
The sauna.

747
01:00:57,543 --> 01:00:58,586
Get out.

748
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:00,838
- What?
- You can't come in.

749
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:05,968
What's your problem?

750
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:49,178
Can you put some lotion on my back?

751
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:54,933
WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM

752
01:01:56,935 --> 01:01:58,228
What did I just see?

753
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:02,733
Oh, crap.

754
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:07,863
This is bad.

755
01:02:18,582 --> 01:02:19,458
Why is it so hot?

756
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,461
So cold.

757
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,382
Get it together.

758
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:28,634
Focus and try again.

759
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:31,637
I have to save Do Da-hae.

760
01:02:32,638 --> 01:02:33,639
Do Da-hae.

761
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:03,919
If I'd known your son's girlfriend
would sneak into our vault,

762
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:05,754
I would've been more careful.

763
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:09,925
Dong-hee was telling the truth.

764
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:16,724
She's a ghost.

765
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:20,394
This house is haunted.

766
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:29,903
The only person I can save
while in the past.

767
01:03:29,903 --> 01:03:30,904
Are you okay?

768
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:36,243
But why her?

769
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:42,958
What's wrong?

770
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,007
Let me just...

771
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,177
Excuse me.

772
01:04:10,694 --> 01:04:11,528
Jeez.

773
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:33,300
Mr. Bok.

774
01:04:34,802 --> 01:04:36,970
My goodness. What happened?

775
01:04:37,596 --> 01:04:38,931
You're soaking wet.

776
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:42,935
Are you okay?

777
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:45,395
I'll do it.

778
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,448
What's wrong?

779
01:04:57,825 --> 01:04:59,827
The Bok Gwi-ju I saw

780
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:01,119
was from this moment?

781
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:08,961
Did you just get back from the past?

782
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:12,840
Actually,

783
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,384
you just came to me again

784
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:18,887
from the future.

785
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:21,223
With this.

786
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:27,312
You gave this to me.

787
01:05:33,819 --> 01:05:36,822
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

788
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:41,034
Marriage registration?

789
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,745
You said it was a present.

790
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,417
Hold on.

791
01:05:50,168 --> 01:05:51,169
This can't be.

792
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:54,590
I know it's hard to believe.

793
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:57,759
It hasn't happened to you yet.

794
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:02,723
But you'll probably find out soon enough.

795
01:06:04,182 --> 01:06:05,267
My past

796
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:07,895
is your future.

797
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:13,650
That may be true,

798
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,612
but this is out of order.

799
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:21,491
I can take responsibility for my past

800
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:23,201
but not for my future.

801
01:06:26,371 --> 01:06:27,623
There's more.

802
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:33,045
There's something else
that hasn't happened to you yet.

803
01:06:33,837 --> 01:06:35,756
I have a new piece of information.

804
01:06:39,092 --> 01:06:41,261
Do you know
why Gwi-ju quit being a firefighter?

805
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:45,849
He lost a close colleague in a fire,

806
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,769
and it shocked him into quitting.

807
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:50,479
Guess when that was.

808
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,689
When I was in high school,

809
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:54,358
there was a fire at my school.

810
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:58,987
Everyone assumed the fire alarm
was malfunctioning as usual.

811
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:02,199
As a result,

812
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:03,992
the evacuation was delayed.

813
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:07,913
It was an old building,

814
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:11,208
so it didn't have
a proper fire protection system.

815
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:14,211
Don't tell me.

816
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:17,798
Seonjae Girls' High School?

817
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,971
I don't want to play that card anymore.

818
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:25,472
Hey.

819
01:07:26,056 --> 01:07:28,225
Life has given you nothing but misfortune.

820
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:30,686
You should at least take advantage of it.

821
01:07:32,604 --> 01:07:35,983
Use your signature move
when the time comes.

822
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:37,526
Mom.

823
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,903
If he hadn't come to my rescue,

824
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:42,406
I would have...

825
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:45,784
died that day.

826
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,747
You reminded me of him

827
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:53,709
from the beginning.

828
01:07:57,629 --> 01:07:58,714
I think...

829
01:08:00,382 --> 01:08:02,592
you might have been that person.

830
01:08:04,636 --> 01:08:06,179
If what's already happened to me

831
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:10,225
hasn't happened to you yet.

832
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:29,077
Are you saying...

833
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:32,914
that I saved you 13 years ago?

834
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:34,166
I mean...

835
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:38,462
that I will?

836
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:49,681
Even then,

837
01:08:50,766 --> 01:08:52,934
registering the marriage first

838
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:54,770
doesn't seem right.

839
01:08:56,146 --> 01:08:57,647
Let's take it one step at a time.

840
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,192
Love has to come first

841
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,819
for us to reach

842
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:05,280
the future you talked about.

843
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:16,792
Let's see if we actually end up...

844
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:21,463
falling in love.

845
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,215
What?

846
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,616
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

847
01:10:19,312 --> 01:10:20,438
We even kissed.

848
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:23,191
Don't you know what comes after that?

849
01:10:25,485 --> 01:10:29,364
I've only been dreaming about you lately.

850
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:32,993
I saw something
when I looked at your hand.

851
01:10:32,993 --> 01:10:35,245
About the marriage registration.

852
01:10:35,245 --> 01:10:37,789
Shouldn't we let
your family know about it?

853
01:10:37,789 --> 01:10:39,708
This is great news!

854
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:43,670
Are you sure I'm the one who saved you?

855
01:10:45,505 --> 01:10:46,756
Stop evading the question.

856
01:10:47,465 --> 01:10:49,342
You want to trust Da-hae, don't you?

857
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:51,887
You want to save her.

858
01:10:51,887 --> 01:10:54,181
Do you think it's easy for me to believe

859
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:57,517
that you'll go back in time to save me?

860
01:10:59,102 --> 01:11:04,107
