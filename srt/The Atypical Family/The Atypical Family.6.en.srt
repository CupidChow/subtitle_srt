00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:54,675
<i>I'll save you.</i>

3
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,554
I only kept doubting you

4
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,723
and kept asking you about it...

5
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,103
<i>because I was that desperate.</i>

6
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:11,442
I was desperate to save someone.

7
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:16,155
I'll do everything I can

8
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,366
to find you in my past.

9
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:20,117
And then

10
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:22,495
I'll save you.

11
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,266
I'm okay now.

12
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,234
HOMEROOM TEACHER

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,279
Have a seat.

14
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,097
Hello, sir.

15
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:25,891
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

16
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,519
There was a bit of an emergency.

17
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:32,148
Yes, I'm at the school right now.

18
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,108
I'm on my way.

19
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:36,610
See you there.

20
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:41,198
That was...

21
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:04,722
Do you believe me?

22
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,683
You don't, do you?

23
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:10,186
Come on.

24
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,855
Do you think I'm making this up?

25
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:13,856
Yes.

26
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:15,107
Elaborately, at that.

27
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:18,819
It's different this time.

28
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,613
They're a family of superpowers.

29
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:21,864
Are you serious?

30
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:23,908
I'm telling you.

31
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,743
They actually have superpowers.

32
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:26,827
No.

33
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,371
I'm asking if you're serious about him.

34
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,542
What do you mean?

35
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:36,420
Honestly,

36
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,173
I don't know about some superpower.

37
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:41,217
But either way, you got him fooled.

38
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,885
He even said he'd save you.

39
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:48,015
- So what's the problem?
- I could get caught any minute.

40
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,600
They see right through me.

41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,268
Do you not want to get caught?

42
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:53,562
Because you have feelings for him?

43
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,689
Is that why you want to stop?

44
00:03:59,151 --> 00:03:59,985
Or isn't it?

45
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:02,738
Have you been listening at all?

46
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,244
Don't say anything stupid.

47
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,754
Is everything okay?

48
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,925
I'm done for.

49
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,637
After you showed up,
Ms. Bok's attitude completely changed.

50
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,975
- So?
- There's no point in me staying there.

51
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,184
Nothing will come of it.

52
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,687
I'll take care of it myself,

53
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,480
so stay out of it.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,316
Okay?

55
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,237
Oh, I get what you're saying.

56
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,364
A strategic withdrawal?

57
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:46,282
Yeah.

58
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,162
I see.

59
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,466
I-na.

60
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,523
<i>There must've been a misunderstanding.</i>

61
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,525
The watch was a birthday present.

62
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,320
The girl's name is Hye-rim,

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,572
and you don't have to worry about her.

64
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:29,074
She's actually been very nice to I-na.

65
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,327
She even invited I-na into her club.

66
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,913
What kind of club is it?

67
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,289
It's a dance club.

68
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,957
- Dance?
- Didn't you know?

69
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,877
Do you not talk to I-na a lot?

70
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:42,880
No, not really.

71
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,716
We need to talk.

72
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:49,011
Is there anything I should know
besides what you told your teacher?

73
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,681
<i>The teacher asked me
if I was bullying you.</i>

74
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,058
<i>I thought we were friends.</i>

75
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,979
- I-na.
<i>- Sorry. It's my dad's fault.</i>

76
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,109
<i>You had me scared.</i>

77
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,362
<i>But we're good, right?</i>

78
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,072
<i>Are we still friends?</i>

79
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:11,742
<i>Of course.</i>

80
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:23,587
Look, I-na.

81
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,925
Just talk to me for once.

82
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,886
I'm still your dad.

83
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,429
What's there to talk about?

84
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,100
You already ruined my school life.

85
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,144
I was just--

86
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:42,439
But who cares? I was an accident anyway.

87
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,071
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

88
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,990
She was at school earlier.

89
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,825
I'd rather talk to her.

90
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:17,474
<i>The phone you are trying to reach
is switched off.</i>

91
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,143
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

92
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,817
Gosh, my wrist.

93
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:28,527
Let me help.

94
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:31,113
What do you want?

95
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:37,369
Well, the thing is...

96
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:39,455
I was wondering

97
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,957
if Ms. Do was here.

98
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:46,045
I was hoping my past wouldn't hurt Da-hae,

99
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,296
but you accused her of stealing.

100
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,758
Well...

101
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,551
Let go.

102
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,637
- And let go of Da-hae.
- I'll get those.

103
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,325
Goodness. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,454
Hyeong-tae!

105
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,039
Clean this up.

106
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:34,176
<i>The phone you are trying to reach
is switched off.</i>

107
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:36,428
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

108
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,263
Hey, you.

109
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,031
What do you want?

110
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:44,997
I-na was the one

111
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,291
who stole the watch.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,126
I think it's her classmate.

113
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,420
She says it was a birthday present,

114
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,506
but I don't see why she'd go that far
unless she was forced.

115
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:55,591
Something's not right.

116
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:58,594
Can you talk to her?

117
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:06,226
Talk to her yourself.

118
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,645
She's your daughter.

119
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,606
Why are you being like this?

120
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:11,899
This is it for us.

121
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,943
I find it unpleasant

122
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:17,863
that someone knows my future
that I don't know of.

123
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,865
And it makes me uneasy

124
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:23,202
that another Bok Gwi-ju
might show up out of nowhere

125
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:28,248
to look into my past
that I'd rather forget.

126
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:29,750
To be honest,

127
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,336
it's just too much.

128
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:35,047
Think about what I've seen your family do.

129
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,883
Floating in the air,

130
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,637
appearing and disappearing out of nowhere,

131
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:42,846
and now, I-na...

132
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,101
What about her?

133
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,980
I'm just an average person.

134
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,149
I'm actually below average.

135
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,236
I can't deal with all these superpowers.

136
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:59,905
I understand that it's confusing.

137
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,699
But you're the one
who brought them all back.

138
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,954
And I'm going to save you with mine.

139
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,166
Are you?

140
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,876
Really?

141
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,504
Don't you find that odd?

142
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:18,757
I'm alive and well right in front of you.

143
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,551
Who exactly are you saving?

144
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:26,974
I think I was mistaken.

145
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:29,017
You can't be the one

146
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,019
who saved me.

147
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:36,358
You said you couldn't even go back
to the moment I-na was born.

148
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,693
That proves it.

149
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,405
Could you send my stuff over?

150
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,701
And please say goodbye
to your family for me.

151
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,244
I know it's not proper,

152
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:50,330
but I can't do it myself.

153
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:12,811
Hello?

154
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,188
<i>Mom, something's wrong with Gwi-ju.</i>

155
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:16,440
What's going on?

156
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,899
Well, he's...

157
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:18,984
<i>What about him?</i>

158
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,196
He's working out.

159
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:32,122
Are you trying to get in shape
to have another child?

160
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:36,710
You must be determined
to make this building yours.

161
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,983
I'd forgotten how bright
this room could be.

162
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,104
That's hot.

163
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,913
Ms. Do is away, so I thought I'd...

164
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:57,958
whip something up.

165
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:14,850
Dig in.

166
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:21,898
I'm late.

167
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:24,985
Have a nice day.

168
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:31,533
Did I burn them?

169
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:46,965
Jeez.

170
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,927
Mr. Bok.

171
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:53,638
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:55,932
I'll take that.

173
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,101
Come on.

174
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:10,655
I got it.

175
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,411
Hey!

176
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:19,122
Who threw these away?

177
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,752
They're still usable.

178
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,257
Where's my stuff?

179
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,736
Is that it?

180
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,112
Ms. Do.

181
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:52,739
Can we talk for--

182
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:58,662
I guess not.

183
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:25,313
PAIN RELIEF

184
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,035
What's the point of buttering me up?

185
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,302
Get out of here.

186
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:57,095
Who said you could come in here?

187
00:16:58,096 --> 00:17:00,056
I don't remember you asking for permission

188
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:03,685
when you came into my life out of nowhere

189
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,813
and interfered with my future.

190
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,403
Get out.

191
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:14,988
Go already.

192
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,323
Fine.

193
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:17,824
I will.

194
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,132
Who spilled water here?

195
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,717
It's a safety hazard.

196
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:37,594
Hold on!

197
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,098
The floor's slippery, ma'am.

198
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:43,850
- Okay.
- Thank you.

199
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,018
No problem.

200
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,776
The floor's slippery, sir.

201
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,235
Thanks.

202
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,195
Sure.

203
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:02,827
Come on.

204
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,665
What do I have to do for you to leave?

205
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,709
You could come with me.

206
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,547
I'm not the only one waiting for you.

207
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:27,936
I-na.

208
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,782
You told Dad about it, didn't you?

209
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,787
I should tell everyone you're a fraud.

210
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:53,503
Are you listening?

211
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,383
I thought you could hear my thoughts.

212
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,430
Right, it's a secret.

213
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,267
I'll be discreet.

214
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,608
- Did you get that?
- No.

215
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,621
I can't hear you with my glasses on.

216
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,539
Huh?

217
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,584
And you need to get a lot closer.
I'm severely nearsighted.

218
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,630
Is that right?

219
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,425
What did you say to Dad?

220
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,552
I didn't say anything.

221
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:47,974
Hey now.

222
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,646
Fine, read my mind
if you don't believe me.

223
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:54,564
Go ahead.

224
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:01,154
Then why did he come
all the way to school?

225
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:03,114
You don't need a superpower to know that.

226
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,325
He's just looking out for you.

227
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,455
Listen.

228
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,999
About that girl, Hye-rim.

229
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,376
It's not her fault. I wanted to do it.

230
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,796
Don't you think you're doing
too much to please her?

231
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:22,717
It's not like that.

232
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:31,059
How long have you been able to read minds?

233
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,393
It's been a while.

234
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,313
Why did you hide it?

235
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,240
When are you moving back in?

236
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:49,285
How can I scam anyone
with a mind reader around?

237
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:50,787
You have to revise your plan.

238
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,541
Becoming our legal guardian
doesn't seem very feasible.

239
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,876
Why don't you make use of our superpowers?

240
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,586
Start a circus. It'll be a hit.

241
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,587
Oh my.

242
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:04,050
Thanks for the advice
on how to scam your family.

243
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,426
Just keep our secret.

244
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,807
How long do you plan on hiding it?

245
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,478
I understand it can be scary
to know what people think.

246
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,231
You probably heard things
you'd rather not hear.

247
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:19,649
But I-na.

248
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,694
Isn't it hard to keep it all to yourself?

249
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,404
Sounds like you got me all figured out.

250
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,030
Now it's my turn.

251
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,032
Hey, stop.

252
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,242
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,912
I'm sorry I acted like
I had you figured out.

254
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:33,872
I mean it.

255
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:35,707
See you at home, scammer.

256
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:36,791
What?

257
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:55,393
Thanks.

258
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,937
I don't think she's being bullied.

259
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:59,189
Just keep an eye on her.

260
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:00,982
It's just not like her.

261
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,735
The dance club, the watch...

262
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,945
She finally made her first friend.

263
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:07,655
She just wanted to do well.

264
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,910
Especially because she's never celebrated
her own birthday properly.

265
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,288
She just got a little ahead of herself.

266
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,999
She's just a kid.

267
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,668
Are we done now?

268
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:22,712
I'm gonna go.

269
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,380
Wait.

270
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:26,591
Come home with me.

271
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,885
I only agreed to help you one last time.

272
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,430
You're the only reason I found out

273
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,973
that I-na stole the watch.

274
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,100
I went back to a moment

275
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:38,311
we were together.

276
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,687
Which time?

277
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:46,611
That's not important.

278
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,114
My point is,

279
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:53,493
you led me to I-na.

280
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,621
I should be able to go back
to when she was born

281
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,248
with your help.

282
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,256
Watch over I-na.

283
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:09,509
Stealing the watch

284
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:12,261
might just be the tip of the iceberg.

285
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,723
She needs her dad, not me.

286
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:23,982
I don't know how to be a dad.

287
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,274
Neither do I.

288
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:27,735
I've never had a proper dad.

289
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,207
Ms. Do.

290
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,339
All I wanted

291
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:51,300
was for my dad to be happy.

292
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:58,558
I'll give that a try.

293
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:02,145
I'll find my way back
to the moment I-na was born.

294
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:03,730
I'll go back!

295
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:05,815
And I'll save you!

296
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:39,807
Gwi-ju just went out
for another early morning workout.

297
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:42,351
Ms. Do must be helping him
recover from depression.

298
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:50,026
Try to relax and get some sleep.

299
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,821
Ms. Do must be busy
helping out at the sauna.

300
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:57,075
I bet she ran away
because we found out about her scheme.

301
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:00,745
The smell makes me sick.

302
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:03,331
At a time like this,

303
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:06,250
Ms. Do's tea always worked like a charm.

304
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,962
You haven't gotten any sleep
ever since she left.

305
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,089
That's not it.

306
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,675
It's since that ex-convict
from the sauna was here.

307
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:19,722
Do you want me to do some probing?

308
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:20,681
Don't bother.

309
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,184
I was dying to get rid of her anyway.

310
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,393
Good riddance.

311
00:25:36,572 --> 00:25:39,742
Let Dong-hee do it.

312
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:45,873
That was so refreshing.

313
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,626
- Thank you. That hit the spot.
- Sure.

314
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:52,964
Number 88!

315
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,011
I'll pay extra. Let me go first.

316
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:01,556
- Wait for your turn.
- Just let me go first.

317
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,274
I guess she wasn't lying.

318
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,734
She makes quite a bit of money.

319
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,371
What is going on today?

320
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:27,540
We have so many customers.

321
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,253
I know. Your wrist hurts, doesn't it?

322
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,839
Why is Dodari dragging this out?

323
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:40,845
At this rate, you'll be scrubbing
people's bodies until you die of old age.

324
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:51,939
Grace, that little...

325
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:53,274
Are you number 88?

326
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:54,901
No.

327
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:58,946
I thought I saw someone I knew.

328
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,824
That was Grace, wasn't it?

329
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,253
What are you doing?

330
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:21,344
Were you trained to use your right hand
although you were left-handed?

331
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:22,595
Yes. What?

332
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,263
Your calves must cramp up all the time.

333
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,098
- Especially the left side.
- They do.

334
00:27:26,098 --> 00:27:29,060
Your shoulders are uneven,
and so are your hips.

335
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,646
No wonder
your lymph nodes are all clogged.

336
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:34,815
How do you know all that?

337
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:41,822
Lie down.

338
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,076
I can take 3 kg right off of you.

339
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:32,331
<i>What is this?</i>

340
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,752
<i>It feels like</i>

341
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,338
<i>I'm flying.</i>

342
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:51,851
My body feels so light.

343
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,026
Was it to your liking?

344
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,986
Yes.

345
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:05,906
Let's see.

346
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:08,242
Do you take credit?

347
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,037
Actually,

348
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,664
we're cash only.

349
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,250
Consider it a freebie.

350
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,379
And tell your mother

351
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,465
that I'm not sending Da-hae back

352
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,885
until they make the marriage official.

353
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:28,638
Hold on.

354
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:31,515
How did you...

355
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:40,232
Guess who I saw there.

356
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,442
Scoot over.

357
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,199
Just what I needed.

358
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,163
Who did you see?

359
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:56,874
Grace.

360
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:02,713
The new trainer at the gym.

361
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:07,009
She showed up
at the exact same time as Do Da-hae.

362
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,844
Can't she go to a sauna?

363
00:30:09,428 --> 00:30:11,889
She was talking about someone
she called Dodari.

364
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:13,683
Who do you think that is?

365
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:16,477
They're all in on it together.

366
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:20,231
It was no coincidence
that Grace showed up at Ji-han's clinic.

367
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,358
All the pieces
are falling right into place.

368
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:25,194
They were worried
that I might get the building,

369
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:28,197
so she lured Ji-han to a hotel.

370
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:29,865
Did he cheat on you?

371
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:32,368
And you spent so much money on him.

372
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:35,538
Stop.

373
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,331
Ji-han is a victim too.

374
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:40,876
Grace came onto him
to sabotage my marriage.

375
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,169
Or is that what you want to believe?

376
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,506
Are you sure it was Grace?

377
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,133
I'm positive.

378
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:50,469
At least I heard her voice.

379
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,059
Was I too quick to trust Do Da-hae?

380
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,894
But you saw her in your dreams.

381
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:04,191
You don't usually try to deny

382
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,402
what you see in your dreams.

383
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,196
But it was all so blurry.

384
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:13,325
- I must've been wrong this time.
- What?

385
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:17,204
No, you weren't.

386
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,315
He used his power.

387
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,404
What the...

388
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:55,576
Gwi-ju.

389
00:31:58,412 --> 00:31:59,413
What just happened?

390
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:01,916
How long has it been back?

391
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,667
Since he met Da-hae.

392
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,087
Did you know about this?

393
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:08,839
- Yes.
- What?

394
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,759
Where did you go? Or when?

395
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:14,053
To Do Da-hae.

396
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,098
I can only return to the moments
I spent with her.

397
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,518
Just like you only dream about her.

398
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:22,686
All this talk about Do Da-hae...

399
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:26,190
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

400
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,109
And why did you hide it from us?

401
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,986
Well, that's because...

402
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:36,909
Gwi-ju can do more than
return to the past now.

403
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:38,035
What else?

404
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:43,082
What is it? Tell us.

405
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,668
We were waiting

406
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:50,589
until every one of us experienced changes.

407
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:53,425
- Whatever.
- Come to think of it, Dong-hee.

408
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:56,178
- Did you lose some weight?
- Huh?

409
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,015
Really?

410
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,021
This is just the result of my hard work.

411
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:09,024
Do Da-hae had nothing to do with it.

412
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:14,280
I-na might be going through
some changes too.

413
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,742
- Welcome.
- Let's try these on.

414
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,412
- That's so cute.
- So cute.

415
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:23,789
It's perfect for you.

416
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,708
Let's take a selfie.

417
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:28,627
Look at the camera.

418
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,296
One, two...

419
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,841
Come on. Look at the camera.

420
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,010
What are you doing, I-na?

421
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,178
Join us.

422
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,891
Yes, I-na. Come on.

423
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:56,655
One, two, three.

424
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,658
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

425
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:00,910
Let's take a picture.

426
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,536
That's a good backdrop. Let's go.

427
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:03,537
Welcome.

428
00:34:03,537 --> 00:34:04,705
How's the cotton candy?

429
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:07,499
- Do you like it?
- I got something even better.

430
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,001
- Here you go.
- Wow.

431
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,462
- Show it to Mommy.
- Let me see.

432
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:12,838
- Let me hold it.
- No.

433
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:14,590
Give it a name and show Mommy.

434
00:34:15,674 --> 00:34:16,508
It's Toto.

435
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:18,636
- Toto? Let me see Toto.
- Show Mommy.

436
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,471
Let me have a look.

437
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:30,940
Why...

438
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:40,282
Thanks.

439
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,663
I'll meet you guys there.

440
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,000
I-na.

441
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,172
Can you bring Jun-woo to the carousel
without anyone else knowing?

442
00:34:58,175 --> 00:35:00,803
I'm going to ask him out.

443
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,182
What?

444
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:19,863
I thought you wanted to ride.

445
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:21,657
Who are we waiting for?

446
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,621
Hye-rim has something to tell you.

447
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:34,878
What about you?

448
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,463
Do you have anything to tell me?

449
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:38,674
What?

450
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:45,889
Why are you so nice to me?

451
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,393
- Isn't it obvious?
- But...

452
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:52,730
the other day...

453
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:55,816
at the convenience store...

454
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:57,526
You mean when you called me a jerk?

455
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,320
I know you didn't mean it.

456
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:03,198
I can tell by your eyes.

457
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,330
By any chance,

458
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:15,961
do you have any ancestors
with the last name Bok?

459
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:17,046
What are you talking about?

460
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:21,884
I mean,

461
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:24,928
can you read people's minds

462
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:28,265
when you look into people's eyes?

463
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:33,270
You can tell...

464
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,523
by my eyes, can't you?

465
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:38,358
Huh?

466
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:40,903
That I like you.

467
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:08,347
Here she comes.

468
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:16,438
She's here.

469
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:19,274
- Mr. Bok?
- Oh, hey.

470
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,859
Why are you here again?

471
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,070
Are you working out?

472
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,198
I wouldn't call it a workout.

473
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:27,533
It's more like a warm-up.

474
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,201
It gets stuffy in the gym.

475
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:34,498
But I did start working out recently.

476
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:37,918
Although it'll take me a while

477
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:40,587
to get back into my old shape.

478
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:42,422
I'm almost there though.

479
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:45,384
Man, that's tiring.

480
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:47,427
She's gone.

481
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,814
Teach me how to make seaweed soup.

482
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:00,816
Come on.

483
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:03,152
I want to make some
for I-na's birthday next year.

484
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,611
Leave before my mom sees you.

485
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:07,322
Come on. I love seaweed soup.

486
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:09,449
My mom is

487
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:13,495
a lot scarier than you think.

488
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,372
- Talking about me?
- Oh my.

489
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:16,582
Hello.

490
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:24,256
You should get the basics down
before you make seaweed soup.

491
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,996
I feel like we're digging our own graves.

492
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,415
Just focus on Da-hae.

493
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:02,085
She's clearly the one who will
get the Bok family back on its feet.

494
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:03,921
I'll take the lead.

495
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:05,672
Just stand behind me and stay quiet.

496
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,591
Come on.

497
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,557
PALACE SAUNA

498
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:16,475
<i>Enjoy.</i>

499
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,976
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

500
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,020
Hello.

501
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,105
I'm Gwi-ju's dad.

502
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,441
- Hi.
- Last time,

503
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,777
I was away when you visited.

504
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:28,570
As the head of the family,

505
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,073
I wanted to formally greet you.

506
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,119
I'm not big on formalities.

507
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,705
You don't even want to be here.

508
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:41,917
Ms. Bok clearly seems unhappy.

509
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,752
Not at all.

510
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:46,255
She's just badly sleep-deprived.

511
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:49,841
By the way, where's Ms. Do?

512
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:53,011
Didn't your daughter relay the message?

513
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:56,807
You can't meet Da-hae
until you make it official.

514
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:57,891
Right.

515
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,477
But who cares about formalities?

516
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:02,229
Plus, our kids are in love.

517
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:05,232
We can't break them up.

518
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:06,441
That is true.

519
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:11,655
We can't seem to get rid of
that clingy son of yours.

520
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:14,032
Come on in.

521
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:20,539
All the way over there.

522
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,714
Gwi-ju!

523
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,591
Honey.

524
00:40:31,591 --> 00:40:32,551
Oh my.

525
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,094
- Come this way.
- My gosh.

526
00:40:34,094 --> 00:40:35,387
- Come on.
- Ms. Bok.

527
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:36,471
My eyes.

528
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,878
It's so humid in here.

529
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,139
She needs to get her sleep somewhere.

530
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,476
She looks like
she could drop dead any minute.

531
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,064
Thank you for the gesture,

532
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:30,650
but she's a fussy sleeper.

533
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,653
Pick up your son on the way out.

534
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:39,785
We're ready to...

535
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,455
register their marriage.

536
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:54,633
The real head of the Bok family
is finally talking.

537
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:58,428
We've already got the papers ready.

538
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,252
She's going to be a while.

539
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:32,295
She's sleeping.

540
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:33,380
What?

541
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:35,298
My mother?

542
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,225
Did you put her to sleep?

543
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:54,985
That's not good.

544
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,168
This is incredible.

545
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:30,645
Just so you know,
we've all agreed to the marriage now.

546
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,528
Hey.

547
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:40,197
Let me get you some more soup.

548
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:41,281
I got it.

549
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,828
- Thank you.
- No problem.

550
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,583
Ms. Do puts my wife to sleep
just by the touch of her hands.

551
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,626
I see.

552
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:54,794
Now I know where she got that from.

553
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:58,048
Is the kimchi to your liking?

554
00:43:58,048 --> 00:43:59,132
Yes.

555
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:01,176
- It's perfect.
- Great.

556
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:02,928
You should take some home.

557
00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:04,429
Thank you so much.

558
00:44:11,478 --> 00:44:13,063
Careful, it's hot.

559
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:22,614
Everything tastes great.

560
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:24,282
Thank you. Help yourself.

561
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:35,418
Honey.

562
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:36,545
Honey!

563
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,046
Honey!

564
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:41,633
Honey!

565
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:43,426
You're up.

566
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:46,221
- Did you have a dream?
- Yes.

567
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,098
Are you okay?

568
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:50,433
What did you see?

569
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:53,770
I saw Da-hae.

570
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,733
Honey.

571
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:15,917
I'll be in touch.

572
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,861
Never set foot in that place again.

573
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:44,362
What did you dream about?

574
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:46,448
I'm absolutely sure this time.

575
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:49,617
- I saw everything clearly.
- So what exactly did you see?

576
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,208
Did you even have a dream?

577
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,920
You had your doubts too.

578
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,422
You haven't registered your marriage

579
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:04,049
because you weren't sure.

580
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:07,427
What if that's changed?

581
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,804
I'm sure now.

582
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,514
What?

583
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:16,186
I just saw how all of this ends.

584
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:17,729
Do you really have to do this?

585
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,149
I have to see this through myself.

586
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:23,777
There's something I have to see.

587
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:36,039
What did you see anyway?

588
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:29,092
These are your favorite, right?

589
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:31,803
<i>You saw what?</i>

590
00:47:32,804 --> 00:47:33,805
For real?

591
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,391
Gwi-ju and Do Da-hae...

592
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:39,185
Are you sure?

593
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:40,937
Yes.

594
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:45,233
It was a grand wedding.

595
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:48,153
<i>Marry you?</i>

596
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:49,946
Why are you surprised?

597
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:54,075
Didn't you know this would happen

598
00:47:54,075 --> 00:47:57,370
when I brought you
the marriage registration from the future?

599
00:47:59,622 --> 00:48:02,041
Did Ms. Bok really

600
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,544
dream about our wedding?

601
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:08,590
The future's already decided.

602
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,758
And I'm quite excited about it.

603
00:48:12,844 --> 00:48:14,429
Just accept it, Ms. Do.

604
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:26,483
What if I don't want to?

605
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:29,652
Like I said, you don't have to save me.

606
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:32,697
Even if you don't,

607
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:35,533
- I'm right here, and I'm just fine.
- I know.

608
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:37,660
You're alive.

609
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:39,996
And that's what keeps me going.

610
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:45,710
The fact that you're alive

611
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:49,297
proves that I'll save you one day.

612
00:48:51,382 --> 00:48:53,301
You're right here by my side.

613
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:55,470
If that's not hope,

614
00:48:56,471 --> 00:48:58,223
I don't know what is.

615
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:02,143
I decided to hold on to that hope.

616
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:05,021
Even if the future's been decided,

617
00:49:05,688 --> 00:49:08,107
I can't just sit around
waiting for it to arrive.

618
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:11,694
So I'm going to do

619
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:14,364
what I can do now.

620
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:18,326
Be it getting married...

621
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:21,663
or falling in love.

622
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,960
To 50 billion won!

623
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:34,133
Dodari.

624
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:37,762
You go, girl.

625
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:41,266
I guess playing hard to get paid off.

626
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:43,601
No, her sincerity paid off.

627
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:47,105
There's no sincerity in a marriage fraud.

628
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:50,316
But your groom-to-be
seems totally serious.

629
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:53,319
He started working out,

630
00:49:53,903 --> 00:49:55,655
and he doesn't reek of alcohol.

631
00:49:55,655 --> 00:49:57,115
He's like a new man.

632
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,828
I think I'm going to turn in
for the night.

633
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:03,037
I'm not feeling well.

634
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:41,326
<i>Congratulations, scammer.</i>

635
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:06,934
Have you gotten attached
to the Bok family or something?

636
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:11,397
Hardly.

637
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:14,609
Just by the way,

638
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:19,405
you don't have to marry him
if you don't want to.

639
00:51:21,157 --> 00:51:23,910
You'd just have to be
stuck with me a little longer.

640
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:28,623
But I'm actually pretty sad to let you go.

641
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:33,211
Think about all we've been through.

642
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:39,967
And all the insurance money
that's been stacking up.

643
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,481
WEDDING VOWS

644
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:56,651
The weather is lovely today.

645
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,111
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

646
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:02,115
Could you move the big table over here?

647
00:52:02,115 --> 00:52:04,075
- Yes, sir.
- Put the flowers over here.

648
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:05,368
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful.

649
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:06,452
- Yes, sir.
- Careful.

650
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:11,040
I assume you only used
the top-shelf produce?

651
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,999
Yes, of course.

652
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,459
I love the colors.

653
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:31,352
Yes?

654
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:36,691
Did you pick one out?

655
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:38,276
Well...

656
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:43,698
I don't think they'd suit me.

657
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,617
I've been there.

658
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,121
I felt so suffocated in my tuxedo
that I wanted to rip it off.

659
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:53,458
But listen.

660
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,586
I've witnessed my wife's dreams come true

661
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:59,088
time and time again in my life.

662
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,799
But they didn't always
come true on their own.

663
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:05,178
At times, someone had to
make those dreams come true.

664
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:07,013
Were you...

665
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,975
My wife had me by her side.

666
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:14,270
And you're the one for Gwi-ju.

667
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:18,941
I'd like to tell you

668
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:23,029
what it is like
to be a part of the Bok family.

669
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:32,455
Let me see that.

670
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:38,628
This is going to hurt.

671
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,174
But some steps are inevitable

672
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,678
in order to reach your destination.

673
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:53,059
Think of it as ripping off a Band-Aid.

674
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:55,019
It'll be over soon.

675
00:54:03,027 --> 00:54:04,278
You can have these back.

676
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:09,075
- But why?
- Why do you think?

677
00:54:21,003 --> 00:54:22,547
I never know what you're thinking.

678
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:24,715
But you seem to see right through me.

679
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:28,553
Honestly, it's kind of creepy.

680
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:46,779
Oh my goodness.

681
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:50,283
You said it'd be a small ceremony,

682
00:54:50,283 --> 00:54:52,451
but look at all this.

683
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:58,541
We just wanted to
make it as official as we could.

684
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:01,669
Just like you wanted.

685
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,632
Did you get some sleep last night?

686
00:55:06,632 --> 00:55:09,343
I was so excited about the wedding

687
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:11,178
that I tossed and turned.

688
00:55:12,138 --> 00:55:13,890
Would you like a massage?

689
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:19,270
Your massage the other day
really cleared my head.

690
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:24,901
Thanks to you,
everything's become crystal clear.

691
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:26,569
I can't thank you enough.

692
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:29,697
Everything's as clear as day.

693
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:38,497
Please excuse me while I freshen up.

694
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:40,291
Sure.

695
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:11,405
I-na.

696
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:12,949
Was it you?

697
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:27,213
Is this about your dad getting married?

698
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:29,090
Not really.

699
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,342
So you didn't feel like
you were losing your dad?

700
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:33,970
He was never around to begin with.

701
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:39,600
Anyway, don't worry.

702
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:41,936
No one's taking your dad away.

703
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,660
I'll work out with you.

704
00:56:59,662 --> 00:57:00,997
I'm expensive.

705
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,582
Where are you going?

706
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:05,751
Demonstrate for me.

707
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:07,044
I'm putting on some weights.

708
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:17,138
All right.

709
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:19,974
You go down

710
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,768
and then up.

711
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:25,396
Seen enough?

712
00:57:26,188 --> 00:57:28,065
I thought you were just a power,

713
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:30,609
but you're pretty good.

714
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:31,694
Nice form.

715
00:57:32,695 --> 00:57:34,864
I have strong legs.

716
00:57:35,906 --> 00:57:37,366
You can go heavier then, right?

717
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:44,957
This should be easy for you.

718
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,506
Show me what you've got.

719
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:55,634
I think this is a bit too heavy for me.

720
00:57:55,634 --> 00:57:56,552
I'll spot you.

721
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:09,940
Right.

722
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:11,442
Did you hear?

723
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:13,652
My brother's getting married today.

724
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:15,738
So why aren't you there?

725
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,031
I'll go soon.

726
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:18,991
I'm going to crash that wedding.

727
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:21,702
I have evidence that the woman is a fraud.

728
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,704
What evidence?

729
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,249
Guess what I found in her room.

730
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:29,502
Drugs.

731
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,088
No way.

732
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:33,714
Drugs?

733
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:35,508
Probably just sleeping pills.

734
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:37,426
Sleeping pills?

735
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:39,970
Oh.

736
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:43,724
So that's what she's been giving my mom.

737
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,812
Wait. Come back!

738
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:50,606
Please help me.

739
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,242
What's taking her so long?

740
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:04,870
I'm sorry, Ms. Baek.

741
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,205
Please wait a moment.

742
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:09,041
We have to get started soon.

743
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:13,337
No.

744
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,848
Mom.

745
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:28,811
Bad news.

746
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:30,896
- It's really bad.
- Can I help you?

747
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,195
Hello, I'm a trainer at The Bok's Gym.

748
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,698
I'm here to congratulate Mr. Bok.

749
00:59:40,698 --> 00:59:43,117
Yes, I do remember you.

750
00:59:43,117 --> 00:59:45,327
You have a good memory.

751
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:47,580
We only briefly crossed paths at the gym.

752
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,291
No, I saw you in my dream.

753
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,001
Your dream?

754
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,544
See you around.

755
00:59:58,048 --> 00:59:59,842
Bok Don't Eat found out.

756
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:18,110
I'm going to prove she's a fraud.

757
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:20,905
No matter what.

758
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,736
She's beautiful.

759
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:47,866
Just like she was in my dream.

760
01:01:59,378 --> 01:02:01,171
<i>Gwi-ju lost his power</i>

761
01:02:01,171 --> 01:02:04,174
because of a certain moment
from many years ago.

762
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:07,553
It was the happiest moment of his life.

763
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:10,139
Do you mean the moment I-na was born?

764
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:15,686
That moment gave him hope.

765
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:20,691
But his hope soon turned into despair.

766
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,947
<i>The happiest moment of his life
turned into a monster</i>

767
01:02:27,823 --> 01:02:29,366
<i>and swallowed him up.</i>

768
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:36,624
<i>He kept being pulled back
into that moment.</i>

769
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:42,129
<i>Day in, day out.</i>

770
01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:48,093
Eventually, he ceased to exist anywhere.

771
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:51,889
<i>In the present,
he was consumed by the past.</i>

772
01:02:52,514 --> 01:02:54,767
<i>In the past, he was like a ghost</i>

773
01:02:54,767 --> 01:02:57,019
<i>who couldn't touch anything.</i>

774
01:02:58,312 --> 01:02:59,229
And eventually...

775
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:00,606
Se-yeon.

776
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,525
Se-yeon!

777
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,862
There was a door in that moment,

778
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:09,406
and it was just like you.

779
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:12,409
It was a glimmer of hope
that glowed with vivid colors.

780
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:18,874
If he loses his hope again,

781
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:20,834
he might not be able to recover.

782
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,771
Ms. Do.

783
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:43,732
Yes?

784
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:45,442
What were you thinking about?

785
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,644
Gosh, I'm tired.

786
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:24,523
There has to be something.

787
01:04:58,557 --> 01:04:59,558
This is...

788
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:03,103
I found it.

789
01:05:04,188 --> 01:05:07,357
The evidence that Do Da-hae fooled us all.

790
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:13,030
Bok Don't Eat!

791
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:17,951
Damn it.

792
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:20,162
Wait a minute.

793
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:21,955
Wait.

794
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:24,082
I said wait!

795
01:05:26,335 --> 01:05:27,336
What's that?

796
01:05:28,712 --> 01:05:30,756
It's all over, Grace.

797
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,841
Get out of my way.

798
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,888
- Just a second.
- Let go!

799
01:05:37,888 --> 01:05:39,389
- Please.
- What's wrong with you?

800
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,849
Wait a minute.

801
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:43,644
You're making a huge mistake.

802
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:45,521
Look at this, Mom!

803
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,732
Look what I found in Do Da-hae's suitcase!

804
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:52,986
Let go.

805
01:05:52,986 --> 01:05:54,279
I said let go!

806
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:56,406
Give it here!

807
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,131
I did it.

808
01:06:24,768 --> 01:06:25,894
Did you just hear that?

809
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:27,980
Not now.

810
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,690
This is a crucial moment.

811
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:32,985
What exactly did you see in your dream?

812
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,362
It wasn't just the wedding, was it?

813
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:37,155
You'll see soon enough.

814
01:07:01,305 --> 01:07:02,514
Take a look around.

815
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:05,934
You might see me

816
01:07:06,518 --> 01:07:07,644
somewhere around here.

817
01:07:09,021 --> 01:07:10,147
What do you mean?

818
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:11,773
I think I'll remember this moment

819
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:14,276
for a long time.

820
01:07:21,491 --> 01:07:22,618
As a happy moment.

821
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:39,593
No, you're not here.

822
01:07:42,346 --> 01:07:44,514
- What?
- Your future self isn't here.

823
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:46,850
You won't be here.

824
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:48,685
Because...

825
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:55,484
I'm actually a fraud.

826
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:06,828
What did you say?

827
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:10,791
You were my mom's third target.

828
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,085
You jumping into the water

829
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:15,545
was the golden opportunity
we'd been waiting for.

830
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,674
The suspicious guy in front of
the ladies' room I-na was in

831
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:20,968
was one of us.

832
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:23,095
- Ms. Da-hae.
- Just as your sister suspected,

833
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:25,514
I spiked Ms. Bok's tea
with sleeping pills.

834
01:08:27,683 --> 01:08:30,018
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Ms. Bok?

835
01:08:30,644 --> 01:08:32,312
You can see the future.

836
01:08:39,903 --> 01:08:41,071
I'm sorry.

837
01:08:45,325 --> 01:08:46,952
You can't save me.

838
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:58,964
Hey.

839
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,522
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

840
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,094
<i>You were...</i>

841
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,307
<i>the only one I could reach in the past.</i>

842
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:53,685
<i>I can only go back
to the times I spent with you.</i>

843
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:55,729
<i>You're the only one
who can see or touch me.</i>

844
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:59,107
<i>I can see him.</i>

845
01:10:01,234 --> 01:10:02,611
<i>I can even touch him.</i>

846
01:10:03,737 --> 01:10:05,405
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

847
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:10,035
<i>It's all over now.</i>

848
01:10:11,953 --> 01:10:12,788
<i>I will never</i>

849
01:10:14,498 --> 01:10:16,416
<i>go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.</i>

850
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:23,006
