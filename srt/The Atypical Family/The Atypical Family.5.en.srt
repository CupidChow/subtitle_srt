1
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:40,939
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:48,356
Even then,

3
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:51,901
registering the marriage first

4
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,527
doesn't seem right.

5
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:57,073
Let's take it one step at a time.

6
00:00:57,073 --> 00:00:58,741
What do you mean?

7
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:04,038
Love has to come first

8
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:06,582
for us to reach

9
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,000
the future you talked about.

10
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,553
Let's see if we actually end up

11
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:21,889
falling in love.

12
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:23,474
What?

13
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:17,695
He bought it.

14
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:23,409
He denied holding my hand

15
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:27,538
and giving me flowers.

16
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:30,124
None of that had happened to him yet.

17
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,792
Then what if...

18
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,303
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

19
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,026
HUSBAND: BOK GWI-JU

20
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:02,198
...I told him his future self
stamped the form with his seal?

21
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,705
Am I really going to...

22
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,806
go back in time
to save Do Da-hae from the fire?

23
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,684
But I don't know when I'll get found out.

24
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:32,478
They're no ordinary people.

25
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,611
What the hell?

26
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,631
They have superpowers.

27
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:46,468
They'll always be one step ahead of me.

28
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:08,282
They might even find out about my past.

29
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:10,910
Yes?

30
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:15,539
Just a second.

31
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,552
Who is it?

32
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,850
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,061
I shouldn't be bothering you,

34
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,606
but I can't seem to fall asleep.

35
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,697
Would you like some tea?

36
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,287
How does your head feel?

37
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,997
Much better now.

38
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,249
You must be shocked.

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,962
I heard he told you about our family.

40
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,921
Yes.

41
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:05,756
I guess...

42
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,967
it's a bit confusing.

43
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,970
It's hard to believe
that such powers even exist.

44
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,224
Let alone...

45
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:18,519
that they run in the family.

46
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,104
Don't be afraid.

47
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:23,691
It's like a talent
that runs in the family.

48
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:29,780
Just like how there are families
of teachers, doctors, or artists.

49
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,409
On top of that,

50
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,745
we can't even use our powers
properly right now.

51
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:41,375
But you predicted that I'd get hurt.

52
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:47,423
How far ahead and in how much detail

53
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:50,592
can you see the future?

54
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,595
I have no control over what I dream of.

55
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,973
I just see what I'm shown.

56
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,101
I see.

57
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,774
But I've only been
dreaming about you lately.

58
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,278
I actually just dreamed about you.

59
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:14,992
You did?

60
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:17,661
What exactly...

61
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,165
did you see?

62
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,917
I only dozed off for a bit,

63
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,627
so I couldn't see much.

64
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,298
I had the same dream the other day,

65
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,884
but I couldn't see anything clearly.

66
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,886
It was all so hazy.

67
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,598
But if I can get some quality sleep

68
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,184
with the help of your special tea,

69
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,686
I might be able to get a good look.

70
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,439
- Sorry?
- I saw it.

71
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,565
What?

72
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,400
I saw something

73
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,903
when I looked at your hand.

74
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,071
Sorry?

75
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,159
There's a ring that's been passed down
in our family for generations,

76
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,662
and you were wearing it.

77
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:04,458
Everything else was blurry,
but that was for sure.

78
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,253
I'm sure you know what that means.

79
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:16,845
Yes.

80
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,600
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

81
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,520
I can't just blindly follow
what I think is the future.

82
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,024
Marrying a woman
because I'm going to anyway?

83
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,776
That's nonsense.

84
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:54,133
I can't fall in love with her
just because I will one day.

85
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,637
As I expected,

86
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,139
I felt no love from that kiss.

87
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,605
What the hell?

88
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,734
Let's see if we actually end up

89
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:14,695
falling in love.

90
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,655
What?

91
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,213
I just happened to recall that moment

92
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,466
when I closed my eyes to sleep.

93
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:39,136
The kiss didn't mean anything to me.

94
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,807
Let's see if we actually end up

95
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:27,976
falling in love.

96
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,881
Goodness.

97
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:54,187
There's a ring that's been passed down
in our family for generations,

98
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:57,816
and you were wearing it.

99
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:06,825
The precious family ring must be in here.

100
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:09,995
You seem very interested in this room.

101
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:16,168
Sorry? Could you say that one more time?

102
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:21,965
Did you just say
you were interested in me?

103
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,093
I think that's what I heard.

104
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,219
Let's take a walk.

105
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,351
It's nice to be on a walk together.

106
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,061
Isn't it?

107
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:39,066
When should we tell the family?

108
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,360
About last night?

109
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:52,245
I mean,

110
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,581
about the marriage registration.

111
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:58,502
Shouldn't we let
your family know about it?

112
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:02,297
Not yet.

113
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:03,965
Especially not my mother.

114
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,222
She doesn't seem to know
about the changes you're going through.

115
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,933
If she finds out,
she'll try to rush things.

116
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:14,935
It's my decision.

117
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,104
Not my mother's or my future self's.

118
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,816
Falling in love and getting married

119
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,943
just because I will one day?

120
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,278
That makes no sense.

121
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,989
Let's take it one step at a time.

122
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:29,533
Fine.

123
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,702
Does this count as a date then?

124
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:33,912
By your books?

125
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,587
Or are we not ready to lock arms yet?

126
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:45,924
But wait.

127
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,467
Let's think about this.

128
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,846
Why do you think you gave me
the marriage registration?

129
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:54,182
You probably didn't want us
to worry about the order of things

130
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:56,476
and make that future happen sooner.

131
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,894
What if that future is fake?

132
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:01,940
Only you know the truth
about the marriage registration.

133
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,860
When I go back in time,
you're the only one who can see me

134
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,986
or touch me.

135
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,072
Do you not believe me?

136
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,411
Tell me about the fire at your school.

137
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:17,956
What?

138
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,000
Where exactly were you
at the time of the fire?

139
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,669
I'd like some details on what happened

140
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,172
and how I saved you that day.

141
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,596
Are you sure I'm the one

142
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:34,639
who saved you?

143
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:42,939
This isn't the next step I was expecting.

144
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,358
We even kissed.

145
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:49,321
Don't you know what comes after that?

146
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,205
I'm afraid we'll have to take a step back.

147
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,123
To before the kiss.

148
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,793
Like it never happened?

149
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,841
I kissed you to see
if I could feel anything.

150
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,676
So what's the verdict?

151
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,221
Meh.

152
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,390
"Meh"?

153
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,228
I see.

154
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,280
Where are you going?

155
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,907
Back to cleaning.

156
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:35,367
You're going the wrong way.

157
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,845
Where did it go?

158
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,183
Good grief.

159
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,727
Where could it be?

160
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:06,982
I can't find it anywhere.

161
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:11,361
Dong-hee.

162
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,030
Hey, what's up?

163
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,824
Have you seen my watch?

164
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:17,284
Which one?

165
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,369
The golden one
with the brown leather strap.

166
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,122
I have no idea.

167
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,584
What are you hiding? Show me.

168
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,043
I didn't take it.

169
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,879
It's too old-fashioned for me.

170
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,506
All your watches look the same.

171
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:32,591
How can you remember?

172
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,510
No wonder you have trouble sleeping.

173
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,429
Just let it go.

174
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,180
It's no big deal.

175
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,974
So you did take it.

176
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,267
Give it back.

177
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,351
It wasn't me.

178
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,061
- Give it here.
- I said it wasn't me!

179
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,314
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you? It wasn't me.

180
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,649
It wasn't me, I swear!

181
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,407
I told you it wasn't me.

182
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,451
Who else could it be?

183
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:00,994
Ms. Do.

184
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,831
I'm coming in, Ms. Do.

185
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:11,671
Where did she go?

186
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,469
Do Da-hae...

187
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,680
Forget it. There's no way she took it.

188
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,142
How dare she steal from my house?

189
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,520
It reeks of alcohol in here.

190
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,818
What are you doing here?

191
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:36,613
Cleaning.

192
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,699
And what are you hiding?

193
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,868
This?

194
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,536
It's nothing.

195
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:44,829
It's just trash.

196
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,248
- Let's see it.
- What?

197
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:49,084
Let me have a look.

198
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,795
- My goodness!
- What are you doing?

199
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:53,672
I'm getting your watch back.

200
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,174
And clearing my name.

201
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,051
What's this all about?

202
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,886
Mom's watch is missing.

203
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,305
Who in our family could have stolen it?

204
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:03,640
You.

205
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:09,562
She was snooping around the vault

206
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,773
in the middle of the night.

207
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:13,400
Me?

208
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:17,153
No, it wasn't me.

209
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,039
I wish you wouldn't look at it.

210
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,874
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

211
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,170
Oh no.

212
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,426
This can't be.

213
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:42,387
Oh my goodness.

214
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,264
This is great news!

215
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:47,058
When did this happen?

216
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,435
This can't be happening.

217
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:51,688
Hold on.

218
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,524
Why is this...

219
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,319
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,780
I found it on your desk,

221
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:02,824
and I was going to hide it

222
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:05,326
in case someone saw it.

223
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,843
Bok Gwi-ju. Is that really your seal?

224
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,054
Did you stamp it?

225
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,263
No, I didn't.

226
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,223
Well, I did.

227
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,684
I mean, I may have.

228
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,519
I mean, I might.

229
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,021
But I haven't yet.

230
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,152
What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,154
The thing is...

232
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,364
Have you been drinking in broad daylight?

233
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:45,116
Why are you rambling?

234
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,618
Let me think.

235
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:48,912
Where should we begin?

236
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:50,663
Should we book a venue first?

237
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,583
We should at least
have a small celebration.

238
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,711
No, we should go
straight to the district office.

239
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,630
Make it official.

240
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,006
Let's meet her family first.

241
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,424
This is insane!

242
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,012
Sorry?

243
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,014
It only seems appropriate.

244
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:11,935
But she doesn't have any family.

245
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:12,852
Yes, she does.

246
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,896
She calls her Mom.

247
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:23,905
Well...

248
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,287
She took me in
when I had no one to turn to

249
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,374
after my father passed away
in high school.

250
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,252
I do call her Mom,

251
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,504
but we're not actually related.

252
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,713
So don't mind her.

253
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:44,634
What is she like?

254
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:49,722
Well...

255
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:52,976
So...

256
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,196
The sauna I saw in my dream?

257
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,781
I have a bad feeling about this.

258
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,243
Do you ever not have a bad feeling?

259
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:13,413
Maybe my dream was a warning.

260
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:16,249
We better do some digging.

261
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:30,805
Should I do some digging too, Mom?

262
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,266
Just put my watch back.

263
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:40,899
I-na!

264
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,066
What is this?

265
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,735
Your birthday's coming up.

266
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,279
I wanted a vintage watch
just like this one.

267
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,907
With a gold frame
and a brown leather strap.

268
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,742
This is amazing.

269
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,494
Thanks, I-na.

270
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:58,458
This is the first time I had a friend
who totally gets me.

271
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,751
The first time?

272
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,711
It's so pretty.

273
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,714
You're my first friend ever.

274
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:08,134
This is the best birthday present
I've ever gotten.

275
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:10,386
Hey.

276
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,681
- See you.
- Bye. See you tomorrow.

277
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:22,732
Hey, I-na.

278
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,609
Yeah?

279
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,526
I said see you.

280
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,656
See you.

281
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,040
I talked to Jun-woo for you.

282
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,334
I told him you're just a bit awkward.

283
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,961
Thanks.

284
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,590
By the way, I love your sneakers.

285
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,425
Hey.

286
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:51,094
You know...

287
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:55,765
Would it be too much
if I asked to borrow them?

288
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,435
- Do you want to borrow them?
- What?

289
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:01,312
I mean...

290
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,524
I guess I could try them on.

291
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,610
I don't know if they'll...

292
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:09,445
No way.

293
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,531
They fit perfectly.

294
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:13,616
- So cute.
- You can borrow them.

295
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:14,742
Are you sure?

296
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,411
Thanks, I-na.

297
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,745
We're so perfect for each other.

298
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:18,746
Don't you think so?

299
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,207
I love them.

300
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,088
PALACE SAUNA

301
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,016
Hello, sir. It's been a while.

302
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,101
I could use some help.

303
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,978
Could you look into something urgently?

304
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:43,771
Right now?

305
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,356
Yes, I'll be right over.

306
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,233
Right. Thank you.

307
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:50,528
Just a quick look should suffice.

308
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,906
A quick look at her eating out
or having coffee won't lead to anything.

309
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:54,824
BAEK IL-HONG

310
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:57,577
I'll catch her entering a motel

311
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,996
or getting intimate in a car.

312
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,832
Let me catch some bigger fish for you.

313
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,418
That won't be necessary.

314
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,377
Come on.

315
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:09,130
It may be more painful,
but it'll help you move on.

316
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,382
- Plus, it'll get you alimony.
- What?

317
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,677
- Isn't this woman your cheating wife?
- No way.

318
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,556
She's going to be
my son's mother-in-law, sort of.

319
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:22,477
I wanted to make sure she didn't have
debt from gambling or anything.

320
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,145
My wife is no cheater,

321
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:26,064
but she tends to be a worrywart.

322
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:37,033
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

323
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:40,703
Baek Il-hong.

324
00:24:41,204 --> 00:24:42,497
Hold on a second.

325
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,165
Baek Il-hong.

326
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:45,625
Il-hong.

327
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,585
The name rings a bell.

328
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,007
Could it be that Baek Il-hong?

329
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,407
Who is it?

330
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:21,661
Well...

331
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:33,673
Honey, this may be shocking,
but you have to hear this.

332
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:36,050
I looked into the woman
Do Da-hae calls her mother,

333
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:38,177
Baek Il-hong.

334
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:39,679
And she's an ex-convict.

335
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:41,973
What did you say?

336
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,600
This retired detective said
she was a fraud and a loan shark.

337
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,687
She was notorious
for always collecting what she's owed.

338
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,773
She has never failed
to get her money back.

339
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:53,818
Anyone who didn't pay up wound up dead.

340
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:56,779
I'm with her right now.

341
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,406
At the house.

342
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:00,867
Why would she...

343
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,871
Hello?

344
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,333
I'm sorry I showed up unannounced.

345
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,378
I was hoping we could talk.

346
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:17,633
I'll leave you to it.

347
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:37,570
Please.

348
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:41,073
I thought I should pay you a visit.

349
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,326
I hear my daughter
has been causing you trouble.

350
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:45,286
Not at all.

351
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:48,623
She's been of great help to us.

352
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,000
She is quite good with her hands.

353
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,462
That's why the spa was
so desperate to keep her too.

354
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,215
But she quit her well-paying job
to move in with strangers

355
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,801
to do chores for them
before she's even married.

356
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,430
I consider her family.

357
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,891
Employers say that all the time

358
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,810
about their employees.

359
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,231
If this were a workplace,

360
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,608
at least she'd be paid and have insurance.

361
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:19,445
But as things stand,
there's no guarantee for her future.

362
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:20,363
Mom.

363
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:27,161
Would you like her
to get officially married?

364
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:28,996
That is important.

365
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,375
If she wants to inherit my building.

366
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:34,585
Your building?

367
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:36,921
Didn't you know?

368
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:40,132
You were talking with such confidence

369
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:42,718
that I assumed you had us all figured out.

370
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:44,553
Given my line of work,

371
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,973
I do pick up a lot of information.

372
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,851
But your family remains a mystery.

373
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:53,896
All I know is that you stay home

374
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:56,482
without ever interacting
with your neighbors.

375
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:03,030
Are you hiding a toad
that lays golden eggs in the house?

376
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,615
I think you mean a goose.

377
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:11,414
You're more coherent
than people say you are.

378
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:15,167
I heard your insomnia
was messing with your head.

379
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,713
Rumors are just rumors.

380
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,965
There's another rumor I heard.

381
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:24,385
It's about your late daughter-in-law.

382
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:28,472
You were quite harsh to her.

383
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:31,851
You never considered her family
until she died.

384
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,187
May I ask why?

385
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:36,814
That's enough, Mom.

386
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:40,943
I apologize on her behalf.

387
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:42,987
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,075
I'm sure you won't treat
Da-hae the same way,

389
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:50,036
but she's such a softie.

390
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:54,248
She ended up getting hurt
by some jerks in the past,

391
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:56,083
not once but twice.

392
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:01,964
And I don't want her to waste her time
only to get hurt again.

393
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,344
I won't let that happen.

394
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,138
I heard a rumor myself.

395
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:12,933
I now see
that it's not completely groundless.

396
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,103
I heard you had an interesting past.

397
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:20,107
I'm not proud of it,

398
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:22,068
but you're right.

399
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,737
I'm an ex-convict.

400
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:27,823
I used to have a daughter,
and she was sick.

401
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:31,369
She died while I was in prison.

402
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,331
As I was grieving,
I decided to turn over a new leaf.

403
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:37,708
I chose my current occupation

404
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,337
to atone for my crimes
by helping others get clean.

405
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:43,631
And with the money I make,

406
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:47,009
I take care of kids like Da-hae
like they're my own.

407
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,514
I guess you never know
when you'll find your calling.

408
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:54,725
Some wealthy ladies
spread the word about my business,

409
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:58,938
and now I make enough money
to let Da-hae live a comfortable life.

410
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,734
I can contribute a generous amount
when they get married.

411
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:09,407
You must really consider her your own.

412
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,703
You must have
very high expectations for her.

413
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:16,288
I only expect one thing from her.

414
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:18,791
And it's for her
to get married by the books.

415
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:25,214
It's the only way she won't get
pushed around in your family.

416
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:33,681
You two were really hitting it off.

417
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,268
Now that you've met her,

418
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,603
should I register my marriage?

419
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,314
Just like you wanted?

420
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,152
Gosh, my head.

421
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,030
My head.

422
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:13,846
Mom.

423
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:15,181
What?

424
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,975
A heads-up would have been nice.

425
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:20,936
They were digging up dirt on me,

426
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:23,063
so I had to get the drop on them.

427
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:24,565
I wanted to speed things up

428
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:27,485
before the allegedly supernatural family
lost all their money.

429
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,570
I was almost there.

430
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,238
Did you use your signature move?

431
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:35,034
Did you play
the school fire survivor card?

432
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,287
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

433
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,664
Didn't you want this to be your last job?

434
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:43,334
- Do you want to keep working for me?
- Come on.

435
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:46,337
Hi, I-na.

436
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,508
So you're I-na.

437
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,095
I'm going to be your grandma soon.

438
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,473
You're so cute.

439
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:59,350
You're absolutely adorable!

440
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,520
- Let me give you some pocket money.
- You don't have to.

441
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,729
Grandma's rich.

442
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,238
I'll be right with you, I-na.

443
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,284
- Go on.
- Just do your job.

444
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:30,381
I-na.

445
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,925
Where are your sneakers?

446
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,389
I forgot to change my shoes.

447
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:48,816
I wonder what she got today.

448
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,861
HERE'S A GIFT, DA-HAE

449
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,161
It stinks!

450
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,621
They reek of milk.

451
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:04,832
Come on, it's not the milk that stinks.

452
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:07,751
That smell's coming from her,
not the milk.

453
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,336
Isn't that right, Da-hae?

454
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:10,796
Let's go, guys.

455
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:12,756
- Cheese feet!
- Come on.

456
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,967
Why won't she ever say anything?

457
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,469
- Say something!
- Say something!

458
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,811
Does she not have shoes?

459
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:28,147
Something stinks in here.

460
00:33:28,147 --> 00:33:29,857
Someone get her some shoes.

461
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:42,036
ONCE
HYE-RIM INVITED BOK I-NA

462
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,791
HAN JUN-WOO: YAY

463
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:49,585
Hi.

464
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,004
Let's go to the theme park on my birthday.

465
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:52,922
Okay.

466
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:54,381
I'm in.

467
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:55,883
That sounds fun.

468
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,635
- Nice!
- What about you, I-na?

469
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,802
I-na.

470
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,682
I guess you didn't hear me knock.

471
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,771
What's up?

472
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,401
I have a question.

473
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:17,821
Did something happen at school?

474
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:28,791
Wait, are you hurt?

475
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,668
Let me see.

476
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:32,920
It's an old scar.

477
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:36,548
Really?

478
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,471
You're being bullied, aren't you?

479
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:44,390
I have friends.

480
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,975
I do.

481
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:47,476
Huh?

482
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,438
Can I go back to texting my friends?

483
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:53,983
Sure.

484
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,195
I knew it. You hold the key.

485
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,699
You mean the key
to the 50-billion-won building?

486
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,755
It's a spider. A huge one.

487
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:17,840
It's enormous.

488
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,260
You have a spider in your hair, I-na.

489
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:23,929
- What are you doing?
- What?

490
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:31,437
Nothing.

491
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:33,230
Have fun.

492
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:43,240
- Where did she go?
- Hello?

493
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,908
- Where'd you go, Bok?
- You ignoring us?

494
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:45,993
This is frustrating.

495
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,870
I'm in.

496
00:35:57,713 --> 00:36:00,257
Five, six, seven, eight.

497
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:06,013
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

498
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,149
This hurts my shoulders.

499
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:19,359
How do I fix this?

500
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:22,946
Look.

501
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,909
Promise me you won't hurt yourself again.

502
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,080
I promise.

503
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,836
I feel fine already.

504
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:41,673
Ready for another set?

505
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:43,926
- Another one?
- Grab this.

506
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:46,261
Let's do it together. Squeeze.

507
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:50,182
- Squeeze.
- Squeeze.

508
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:53,393
- I'm squeezing.
- You're doing great. Keep going.

509
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:54,895
Grace.

510
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:58,524
Want to grab a drink?

511
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,442
I'm on a diet.

512
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,236
You need protein after working out.

513
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,446
How about some barbecue?

514
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,867
You can count it as a training session.

515
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:12,913
Hang out with me for three hours,
and count it as three sessions.

516
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,085
Actually, I have 12 sessions left.

517
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:23,340
You could stay with me all night.

518
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:25,676
Can you even last that long?

519
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:27,803
What?

520
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,013
Hey.

521
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:32,808
Let's be real. You're hardly a trainer.

522
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:34,309
If I get injured at the gym,

523
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,353
it might cost you big-time.

524
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,729
Can you afford that?

525
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,857
What are you grabbing me for?

526
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:41,817
You can't even lift pink dumbbells.

527
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,194
You little...

528
00:37:47,823 --> 00:37:49,324
- What the hell?
- I'll give you a refund.

529
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,785
You were so busy staring at her

530
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:54,746
that it seemed impossible
for you to focus on your workout.

531
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:57,166
I'm worried you'll actually hurt yourself.

532
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,458
Well, she dresses like--

533
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,715
We're not responsible for any accidents

534
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:08,427
that weren't caused by defective equipment
but by your own carelessness.

535
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:11,096
Transferring your membership
will cost you 200,000 won,

536
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:14,141
and canceling it will incur a fee of 10%.

537
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:16,768
And guess what?

538
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:20,731
VAT is not included.

539
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,861
Jeez.

540
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,199
Thanks.

541
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,367
Hey.

542
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:36,830
Want some barbecue?

543
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,168
No, thanks.

544
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:04,233
You could use some studying.

545
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:06,693
Don't you want to be more professional?

546
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:09,821
This is just a side job.

547
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:11,114
My passion is acting.

548
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:18,330
You're an actress?

549
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,044
But I only get indecent roles.

550
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,421
Apparently, I don't look like a lead.

551
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,924
They say my body is too distracting.

552
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:32,469
I can be romantic, damn it.

553
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:35,889
People always judge a book by its cover.

554
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:37,641
My brother's the same way.

555
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:40,686
He fell for this innocent-looking minx,

556
00:39:40,686 --> 00:39:42,229
and he's about to marry her.

557
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,982
Mr. Bok is getting married?

558
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,359
She's marrying him for the money.

559
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,780
She's already nibbling away
at my family's fortune like a rat.

560
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:56,034
What exactly did she do?

561
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,911
She stole my mom's watch.

562
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:59,538
And everyone thinks I did it.

563
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:00,914
It's so dumb.

564
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:02,082
No way.

565
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:04,751
Why would she take such a risk
for some measly watch?

566
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:07,337
She'll get a 50-billion-won building
once she's married.

567
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:14,428
Fifty billion won?

568
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:18,849
How do you know that?

569
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:24,855
Well, that's the market price
for the gym building.

570
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,400
And it belongs to your mother.

571
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:31,820
Everyone at the gym knows.

572
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,710
Do you still not want to work out with me?

573
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:48,920
A spot just opened up.

574
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,172
I'll give you a discount.

575
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:51,798
Hold on.

576
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:56,428
Why are you being so friendly?

577
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:00,015
I have to make a living.

578
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,267
Cheers.

579
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,786
Are you already done eating?

580
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,750
You should have some tea.

581
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,591
Is it possible to develop
a tolerance to tea?

582
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:40,138
It doesn't seem to do the trick anymore.

583
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:48,271
I'm home.

584
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:50,816
Hi.

585
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:55,028
Come have a seat.

586
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:01,201
Go and get some rest.

587
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:04,871
Okay.

588
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:15,632
Close the door.

589
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,936
An ex-convict?

590
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:13,732
She's gone straight now.

591
00:43:14,232 --> 00:43:16,985
Are you trying to destroy our family?

592
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:19,654
How could you let a criminal
into our family?

593
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:21,114
Let's get this straight.

594
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:23,575
Do Da-hae isn't a criminal.

595
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:25,827
She may as well be.

596
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:31,124
We thought she was on her own,

597
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:34,252
but a crook's been
watching her back the whole time.

598
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:37,088
Mom, we have to kick her out.

599
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:41,927
But I saw it clearly in my dream.

600
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:44,763
You mean her wearing our family ring?

601
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:47,766
What if she stole that too?

602
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:54,189
The dream you had

603
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:57,275
wasn't telling you
that she'd be a part of our family.

604
00:43:57,275 --> 00:44:00,529
It was telling you
that she'd steal from us.

605
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:01,655
It was a warning.

606
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,449
Good grief.

607
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:09,412
- It wasn't me, was it?
- What do you mean?

608
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:12,749
The one who saved you
from the fire 13 years ago.

609
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,962
What makes you think that?

610
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,258
I-na was born that day.

611
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,844
For me to have saved you,

612
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:27,847
I'd have to return to that moment.

613
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,268
But I can't do that
no matter how hard I try.

614
00:44:32,852 --> 00:44:34,312
Is it true

615
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:36,523
that I saved you?

616
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,735
You said you didn't want to follow

617
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:44,614
the path that was laid out
by the future anyway.

618
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,741
What matters is the present.

619
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:52,455
How does Bok Gwi-ju
feel about me in the present?

620
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,293
You're evading the question again.

621
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:59,796
Do you know what that moment means to me?

622
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,465
Do you know what it took from me

623
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:04,968
and what it'd mean for me
to save someone at that moment?

624
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:07,178
I was desperate to save everyone.

625
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:10,515
But even after all the years
I was stuck in it,

626
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:13,226
I couldn't save anyone.

627
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,980
I couldn't save anyone
I desperately wanted to.

628
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,109
So how could I have saved you?

629
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:23,778
Because...

630
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:27,699
you love me.

631
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:30,410
If you were lying, just come clean to me.

632
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,501
I understand your doubt.

633
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:41,463
If there's only one person you can save,

634
00:45:41,463 --> 00:45:43,465
why would it be

635
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,425
someone like me?

636
00:45:50,805 --> 00:45:52,849
Do you think I'm not worth saving?

637
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:54,559
Because my mom's a criminal?

638
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:58,188
Then don't bother.

639
00:46:03,943 --> 00:46:05,153
Stop evading the question.

640
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:09,991
You did that at the park too.

641
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,121
Who the hell are you?

642
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:17,374
Why you, of all people?

643
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,583
I don't know either.

644
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:22,087
How should I know?

645
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:23,296
I can hardly believe it myself.

646
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,091
Do you think it's easy for me to believe

647
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:30,470
that you'll go back in time to save me?

648
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,555
Well, it's--

649
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:41,022
It's not.

650
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,609
She evaded my question then.

651
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:46,736
Tell me about the fire at your school.

652
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:48,446
She must be hiding something from me.

653
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:49,823
What?

654
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:52,075
Where exactly were you
at the time of the fire?

655
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:54,702
I'd like some details on what happened

656
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:57,122
and how I saved you that day.

657
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:07,632
Are you sure I'm the one

658
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:09,509
who saved you?

659
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,982
Why won't she say anything?

660
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:31,614
Where are you going?

661
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:33,700
Back to cleaning.

662
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:14,699
Could it be that she's in pain

663
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,870
just from thinking about it?

664
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:37,263
I thought you'd left.

665
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:39,867
Where have you been?

666
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,873
Did you go back to me again?

667
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,251
So?

668
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,712
What did you see?

669
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,800
What was I doing?

670
00:49:57,343 --> 00:49:58,636
When was it?

671
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:08,271
I mean...

672
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,987
Fine, don't tell me.

673
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:17,739
But know this.

674
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:22,035
That moment from 13 years ago

675
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:25,663
wasn't easy for me either.

676
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:28,333
I know.

677
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,128
At least, now I do.

678
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:21,469
Tie up those shoelaces nice and tight.

679
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:22,845
If you're going to run away.

680
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:25,556
Why would I run away?

681
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:28,559
What's that?

682
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:31,938
I'm bringing I-na her school shoes.

683
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:40,196
I think I'll wear
something without shoelaces today.

684
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,871
I don't see Ms. Do anywhere.

685
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:50,832
Did she step out?

686
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,964
I was also quite shocked at first

687
00:51:57,964 --> 00:52:00,800
after finding out
about the woman she calls her mom.

688
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,719
But if you think about it,

689
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,346
she's striving to redeem herself.

690
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,724
Even though she can't change her past,

691
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,268
she's trying to make changes
in the present.

692
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:12,186
I'd say she's better than some of us.

693
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:20,570
Be honest with me.

694
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,613
You want to trust Da-hae, don't you?

695
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:25,450
You want to save her.

696
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,244
So what's holding you back?

697
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:30,997
What if

698
00:52:31,998 --> 00:52:33,374
I mess up again?

699
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:35,960
I can assure you

700
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,380
that you're going to mess up again.

701
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:43,760
What?

702
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:49,307
But whatever happens with Da-hae
can be undone.

703
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:51,809
You can go back in time and fix it.

704
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,353
You can make a belated apology

705
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:56,272
and make things right.

706
00:52:56,856 --> 00:53:00,860
With Da-hae, you can mess up
and make a fool of yourself

707
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,944
as much as you want.

708
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:08,034
Mistakes can be undone.

709
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,162
All you have to do is love her.

710
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:13,539
But think about it.

711
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,292
I can't even go back
to my moments with I-na.

712
00:53:18,878 --> 00:53:20,046
How can I save Da-hae?

713
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,091
Da-hae might lead you back to I-na.

714
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:34,018
Try calling her.

715
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:42,568
Let's see if we actually end up
falling in love.

716
00:53:45,446 --> 00:53:48,533
Will I be able to love again?

717
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,203
Do I deserve that?

718
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,321
So it was you, I-na?

719
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:29,073
Why would you do this?

720
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,576
You could've just asked me to buy it.

721
00:54:31,576 --> 00:54:33,452
You're not even into those things.

722
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:38,082
I hope she likes it.

723
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:40,501
Don't tell me

724
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:42,712
you're being bullied.

725
00:54:44,755 --> 00:54:47,049
Why do you never tell me anything?

726
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,315
Excuse me.

727
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:04,191
Do you know a girl called Bok I-na?

728
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,443
- No.
- No.

729
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:12,116
I BROUGHT YOUR SHOES.
MEET ME OUTSIDE.

730
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:13,743
I don't know which class she's in.

731
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:17,955
Hey, girls.

732
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:20,750
Do you know a seventh grader
called Bok I-na?

733
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,751
- No.
- No.

734
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,711
Thanks.

735
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,048
Excuse me.

736
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:29,216
Do you know Bok I-na?

737
00:55:29,216 --> 00:55:30,927
- Bok I-na?
- I don't think so.

738
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,678
- Who's that?
- We have no idea.

739
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:35,806
Bok I-na?

740
00:55:35,806 --> 00:55:37,892
Isn't she Hye-rim's lackey?

741
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:39,018
Is that her name?

742
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:41,062
She's invisible.

743
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:43,105
- No wonder they don't know her.
- Exactly.

744
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:52,990
I-na.

745
00:55:57,703 --> 00:55:58,663
Here.

746
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:01,415
You didn't have to.

747
00:56:05,878 --> 00:56:07,630
- Hi.
- Hello.

748
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,132
Is she your mom?

749
00:56:11,884 --> 00:56:13,135
GOH HYE-RIM

750
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:15,763
She's so pretty.

751
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:20,184
- She's not my mom.
- What?

752
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:22,853
Then who is she?

753
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:26,023
I-na.

754
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,733
Can we talk for a second?

755
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:42,331
It was for her, wasn't it?

756
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,874
Goh Hye-rim.

757
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,043
You stole the watch for her.

758
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:48,212
- No.
- She took your sneakers too.

759
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:50,589
I'm trying to help you.

760
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:51,507
You know nothing.

761
00:56:53,592 --> 00:56:55,845
- Would you rather talk to your dad?
- Don't tell him.

762
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:59,098
He needs to know what you're--

763
00:56:59,098 --> 00:57:01,183
If you tell him,
I'll tell everyone you're a fraud.

764
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,145
What?

765
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:06,605
You want to marry him
so you can become our guardian.

766
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,281
Who told you that?

767
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:16,407
I'm the only one who knows.

768
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:18,075
For now.

769
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:22,163
Wow.

770
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:25,124
I've been keeping quiet
to see how things play out.

771
00:57:25,124 --> 00:57:28,377
I wanted Grandma to get what she deserved
for her obsession with powers.

772
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:30,421
Plus, I got to see a real-life con artist.

773
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:32,673
I also kind of felt sorry for you.

774
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:35,092
What?

775
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:40,056
You said you'd been married twice.

776
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:42,475
Were those marriages fake too?

777
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:51,942
You married your first husband
to get back at your mom,

778
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:53,652
who left you to be with her lover.

779
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:55,905
And the second time was

780
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,908
to get back at your alcoholic dad
who neglected you.

781
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:04,038
What...

782
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,209
What are you?

783
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:10,836
But the third time isn't
going as you planned, is it?

784
00:58:10,836 --> 00:58:12,421
Your feelings are getting in the way.

785
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:24,350
How did you do that?

786
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,851
Keep your mouth shut,

787
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:28,354
and I'll keep mine shut.

788
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,981
Have you been hiding your power?

789
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,799
Excuse me.

790
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:02,304
The visitor parking is through the gate
and around the corner.

791
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:03,347
Okay.

792
00:59:03,347 --> 00:59:04,557
HANA MIDDLE SCHOOL VISITOR LOG

793
00:59:04,557 --> 00:59:06,183
NAME: DO DA-HAE

794
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:10,604
NAME: DO DA-HAE
PURPOSE OF VISIT: SHOES FOR BOK I-NA

795
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:13,274
Mom might not believe me,

796
00:59:13,274 --> 00:59:14,859
but you have to, Uncle.

797
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:17,820
We messed with the wrong people.

798
00:59:19,363 --> 00:59:22,158
We never should have
gotten involved with the Bok family.

799
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:26,162
I got busted.

800
00:59:27,455 --> 00:59:28,581
They know everything.

801
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:31,792
They know what I'm up to,
no matter when and where.

802
00:59:32,418 --> 00:59:34,211
The past, the future...

803
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:39,175
They even know

804
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:42,511
things that I've never said out loud.

805
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:45,264
I'm freaking out.

806
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:47,308
They see right through me.

807
00:59:53,939 --> 00:59:55,649
You have to believe me!

808
00:59:55,649 --> 00:59:57,860
- I mean...
- Ms. Do?

809
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:07,661
Wait!

810
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:09,288
Ms. Do!

811
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:10,998
Wait!

812
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:21,425
- Don't follow me.
- Ms. Do!

813
01:00:49,453 --> 01:00:50,871
Ms. Do!

814
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:52,748
Ms. Do!

815
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:23,529
Yes, hello?

816
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:27,908
I'm locking up the gym storage now.

817
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:30,494
I might be late for
the seventh-grade safety training.

818
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:32,705
Yes.

819
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:35,040
Right.

820
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:36,709
Okay, thank you.

821
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,152
What the hell?

822
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:08,907
UNCLE

823
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,412
Hey, it's me.

824
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:14,997
Can you come pick me up?

825
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:17,333
I'm at I-na's school.

826
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:19,835
Hello?

827
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:21,545
Uncle?

828
01:02:33,974 --> 01:02:35,142
Stop.

829
01:02:41,607 --> 01:02:42,691
Just let her be.

830
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,027
Hello? Is anybody there?

831
01:03:27,027 --> 01:03:29,279
I'm locked in.

832
01:03:29,863 --> 01:03:32,366
Can you please open the door?

833
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:35,405
I'm bored to death.

834
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,661
Sorry.

835
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:42,871
Where do you think you're going?

836
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,960
I'm bored. Let's play a game.

837
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:50,170
Come with us.

838
01:05:52,172 --> 01:05:53,465
Let's go.

839
01:05:53,465 --> 01:05:54,758
Come on.

840
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:58,095
Let's hurry.

841
01:05:58,095 --> 01:05:59,763
Ta-da.

842
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:02,808
Cool spot, right?

843
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:12,484
What are you doing?

844
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:15,153
Let's call it hide-and-seek.

845
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,867
If anyone notices
that you're missing and asks,

846
01:06:20,826 --> 01:06:22,160
"Where's Da-hae?"

847
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,247
the game is over.

848
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:28,250
That means you win, and I'll let you out.

849
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:33,255
But what if no one looks for her?

850
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:35,215
Then the game goes on.

851
01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:36,425
Forever.

852
01:06:39,511 --> 01:06:40,345
Where are you going?

853
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:43,015
Come on.

854
01:06:43,557 --> 01:06:45,809
The whole world can be a seeker.

855
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:47,603
I'm sure someone will look for you.

856
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,106
See you.

857
01:06:52,024 --> 01:06:52,858
Let's go.

858
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:56,278
SEONJAE GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

859
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,332
Attention. Bow.

860
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,208
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

861
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:23,805
He has no idea.

862
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,158
It's acting up again.

863
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,202
When will they have it fixed?

864
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,705
The fire alarm, the doors...

865
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:50,499
They're always fixing something.

866
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:52,250
Hey.

867
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,379
I smell something burning.

868
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:57,297
Me too. What could it be?

869
01:07:59,174 --> 01:08:00,592
There's smoke in the hallway!

870
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:03,762
Hey!

871
01:08:03,762 --> 01:08:04,805
Stay in your seats.

872
01:08:14,856 --> 01:08:17,150
Guys, there's a fire! Everyone out!

873
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:20,696
Head to the main entrance!

874
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:25,617
Don't run! No, hurry!

875
01:08:25,617 --> 01:08:27,202
What are you waiting for?

876
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:41,383
Hello? Is anybody there?

877
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:44,177
I'm locked in here.

878
01:08:44,678 --> 01:08:46,471
Please open the door.

879
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:47,931
Please!

880
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:51,935
Please open the door!

881
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,320
Hurry! Head to the main entrance!

882
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,240
Hurry up!

883
01:09:06,992 --> 01:09:09,077
To the main entrance!

884
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:10,746
This way! Hurry!

885
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:18,170
Please help me!

886
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:19,337
Help me!

887
01:09:30,348 --> 01:09:31,975
Damn it. Whatever.

888
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,485
Help!

889
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,404
Please help me!

890
01:10:07,594 --> 01:10:09,387
Help me.

891
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,947
No one came looking for me.

892
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,827
I was alone until the end.

893
01:10:40,043 --> 01:10:44,256
It was a fitting end to my miserable life.

894
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:46,007
Or so I thought.

895
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:03,066
Do Da-hae.

896
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:16,580
Try to breathe.

897
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:18,290
Breathe.

898
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:35,515
How...

899
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:40,729
How did you find me?

900
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,108
No one...

901
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:48,737
No one came looking for me.

902
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:55,035
I thought...

903
01:11:55,535 --> 01:11:58,413
nobody would ever come.

904
01:12:03,043 --> 01:12:08,423
It's just like the last time.

905
01:12:12,552 --> 01:12:16,056
There was a fire.

906
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:20,268
And I was locked in the storage.

907
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:25,190
Sir, there's someone
in the fifth-floor storage.

908
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:26,983
No. Don't go.

909
01:12:26,983 --> 01:12:28,235
Fifth-floor storage?

910
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:29,486
- Please help.
- Please.

911
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:40,455
Seonjae Girls' High School?

912
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:43,833
Fifth-floor storage?

913
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:56,054
How do you know that?

914
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:05,397
It seems like...

915
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,151
I'll have to be the one...

916
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:15,657
to have saved you.

917
01:13:22,455 --> 01:13:23,665
I'll save you.

918
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:28,003
At that moment...

919
01:13:29,754 --> 01:13:31,673
a hope that I didn't deserve

920
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:34,509
quietly emerged in my heart.

921
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,512
I sincerely wished

922
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:39,931
that this man...

923
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,605
was the one who saved me.

924
01:14:11,338 --> 01:14:13,798
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

925
01:14:43,828 --> 01:14:44,871
Jeez.

926
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:47,332
Something's wrong with Gwi-ju.

927
01:14:47,332 --> 01:14:48,625
He's working out.

928
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,795
Ms. Do must be helping him
recover from depression.

929
01:14:55,131 --> 01:14:57,425
What do I have to do for you to leave?

930
01:14:58,426 --> 01:15:00,387
I'm absolutely sure this time.

931
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:01,888
I saw everything clearly.

932
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:05,433
If he loses his hope again,

933
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,269
he might not be able to recover.

934
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:11,940
I have to see this through myself.

935
01:15:12,982 --> 01:15:14,651
There's something I have to see.

936
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:22,325
