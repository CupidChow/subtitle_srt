1
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,170
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:15,047
It's the same dream again.

3
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,569
Could it be that it hasn't happened yet?

4
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,946
Are you suggesting we collaborate?

5
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,407
I can only return to the moments
I spent with Da-hae.

6
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,952
With a little cooperation from her,

7
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:49,457
my power can be quite useful.

8
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,833
What's in it for us?

9
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:55,838
Real estate, lottery, stocks, crypto…

10
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,007
I'll help you steal the future.

11
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,719
If you let me borrow Da-hae.

12
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:05,264
And what exactly does that entail?

13
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:07,224
I'd like to share moments of her time.

14
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,101
Preferably, happy ones.

15
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:11,228
Ew, that's so cheesy.

16
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:13,940
Let me get this straight.

17
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,609
Are you asking for my blessing?

18
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:20,237
It seems like a pretty good deal for you.

19
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,323
You must be forgetting something.

20
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,620
We know how your family has been
accumulating wealth

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,580
all these years.

22
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,040
Exactly.

23
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:35,836
It'd be a lot quicker
to extort money from you people

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,550
by threatening to tell the press
all about the family with superpowers.

25
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:42,885
Don't you think so?

26
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,431
You want to slaughter the goose

27
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,933
just for a few golden eggs?

28
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,602
Suit yourselves.

29
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:02,863
Shall we discuss the terms in detail then?

30
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:04,323
You're talking about my time.

31
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,994
It's not as simple as it sounds.

32
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:12,164
He's basically saying

33
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,792
that he'll use my time
as a checkpoint whenever he wants.

34
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,503
And he's willing to pay for it.

35
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:20,423
Do you know what that's like?

36
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,259
He appears and disappears out of nowhere,

37
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:26,887
traveling back in time
from the future I don't even know of.

38
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,806
It's like seeing a ghost.

39
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:35,062
Do you think we can take advantage of him?

40
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,230
He has superpowers.

41
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,692
Wake up.

42
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,986
He's the one taking advantage of us.

43
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,697
And I'm not going to let him.

44
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,410
Never.

45
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,498
Good night.

46
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:02,213
What's her problem?

47
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,968
This is our chance
to cash in on their superpowers.

48
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,234
What are you getting at?

49
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,444
It's simple.

50
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:27,031
You just need to spend some time with me.

51
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,533
As often and as much as possible.

52
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:34,830
I don't think so, Gwi-ju.

53
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,434
Is this how you reestablish relationships?

54
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,477
I'm fine with that.

55
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:41,561
Da-hae.

56
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,605
Bok Gwi-ju.

57
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,110
It's all over now.

58
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,194
I know.

59
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:50,612
Speaking of which,

60
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,574
I have to undo the past.

61
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:56,744
I'm going to undo the moment…

62
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,164
things ended for us.

63
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,767
Where's Gwi-ju?

64
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,397
Did you let him go?

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,524
Why?

66
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:30,152
He's a golden goose
that can win us the lottery every week.

67
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,948
You're not scared of anything.

68
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,617
I doubt their powers freaked you out.

69
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:41,080
So why do you keep
making ridiculous choices?

70
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:49,380
Are you getting soft because...

71
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:50,965
I have feelings for Bok Gwi-ju.

72
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:55,928
Yes, I got soft.

73
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,263
I was crazy.

74
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,059
I don't know what I'm thinking either.

75
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,980
But that's why I crashed the wedding.

76
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,148
Like you said,

77
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,510
it's dangerous to mix
business with pleasure.

78
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:16,640
You said the last time you flirted
with your business partner,

79
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,100
you did time for three years.

80
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:20,436
That was just an occupational hazard.

81
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:24,857
What if this is a trap?

82
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,528
Why would he reach out
to the scammer who lied to him?

83
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,406
We need to keep it together.

84
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,119
But I don't know
if I can do that around him.

85
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:41,165
Does he mean that much to you?

86
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:49,048
Guess so.

87
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,758
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:53,176
I'll get it together.

89
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,763
So I need you to help me…

90
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:58,681
move on.

91
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:40,307
I had no idea we had a rat in our house.

92
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,060
I'm talking about Do Da-hae.

93
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,437
How do you think
she managed to steal the ring?

94
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,191
We paid a fortune for that safe.

95
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:51,777
Are you sure you didn't
leave it open after cleaning?

96
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,536
Change the passcode.

97
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,961
She never even told me the passcode.

98
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:20,472
- How long will you be here?
- Here you go.

99
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:21,700
Until Chae-yun's class is over.

100
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,517
- When's that?
- Around 4:30 p.m.

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,144
- Let's go in.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,855
- Welcome.
- Sauna on a hot day like this?

103
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:29,523
- It's already summer.
- Welcome.

104
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,024
Hello.

105
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,443
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

106
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,571
Lucky number 77 for you.

107
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:38,157
Number 88 for you, also a good one.

108
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,408
And number 70 for you.

109
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,993
Just a second, please.

110
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,119
Here are your clothes.

111
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,005
I'm just trying to make a checkpoint
I can come back to.

112
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:55,924
Never seen him before.

113
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:56,842
Is he new?

114
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,635
He has a long way to go.

115
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:00,971
Let me give you new keys.

116
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,478
Here you go.

117
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,065
- Thank you.
- You're the best.

118
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:12,816
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

119
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,193
Thank you.

120
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,280
Odd numbers for top lockers,
even for bottom ones.

121
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,782
Odd for taller customers,

122
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:21,658
even for the elderly.

123
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,413
- This place always makes me feel better.
- I know.

124
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,039
Welcome.

125
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,125
Have a good time.

126
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,418
Excuse me.

127
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,087
- I'll pay today.
- Are you sure?

128
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,838
You're the best.

129
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:40,886
Hello.

130
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,019
Time to eat.

131
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:58,779
That's good stuff.

132
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,949
Another mouth to feed.

133
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:07,788
Are you sure you want to
eat our humble food at our shabby table?

134
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,207
Thank you.

135
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,841
You're supposed to help me, Mom.

136
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,343
Let's just see how this goes.

137
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,971
We're here to help if things go south.

138
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,267
What does that mean?

139
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,561
It's a mother-daughter thing. Eat up.

140
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:33,981
Check this out, Gwi-ju.

141
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,899
"Gwi-ju"?

142
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,945
Well, what should I call him?
It'd be weird if I got all formal.

143
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,782
This stock just hit the moon this week.

144
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:48,495
Can you go back to last week
and let Dodari know?

145
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:00,966
Let me give it a try.

146
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:37,961
I guess I wasn't that happy last week.

147
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,422
My wedding was broken off then.

148
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,634
Happiness is so vital to our lives,
don't you think?

149
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,928
So…

150
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:49,890
He's not going to give away
his golden eggs so easily.

151
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,434
He's screwing with us.

152
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,316
Da-hae isn't cooperating.

153
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,399
Eat your food.

154
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,237
Happiness starts from eating well.

155
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:06,949
Man, that was refreshing.

156
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,534
- What do you want?
- Let's have some rice punch.

157
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,218
- Let's get some eggs too.
- Sounds good.

158
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
Hey.

159
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:16,707
Where are you going?

160
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,460
To work.

161
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:45,195
I'll have what he's having.

162
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,279
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:50,284
I'm sorry I'm late.

164
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,290
You're 30 minutes late.

165
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,043
Have a seat.

166
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,843
I was picking out
a gift for your daughter.

167
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:19,771
You didn't have to.

168
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,567
I just love kids.

169
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:27,611
Actually,

170
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,574
I only had 30 minutes to spare,

171
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,409
so I have to get going.

172
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:36,663
I promised my mother
I'd stay for exactly 30 minutes.

173
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,625
To be honest,
I'm not interested in getting married.

174
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,630
That makes two of us.

175
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:47,507
What a relief.

176
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:52,346
Your mother has been
asking me to meet you every Sunday,

177
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,140
but I couldn't tell her
I planned to remain single.

178
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,226
She thinks it's against God's will.

179
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:05,483
My bad.

180
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:14,701
Thank you.

181
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:20,582
Don't worry about me. You can go.

182
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,126
I'll stay here and enjoy my coffee.

183
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:25,961
Right.

184
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:27,463
Okay then.

185
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:41,977
What are you doing?

186
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,531
- Did I do that?
- Are you okay?

187
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,784
Wait, you'll hurt yourself.

188
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,956
Don't move. It's not safe.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,335
I'm so sorry.

190
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,712
Let me buy you a meal.

191
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:08,672
Actually, you need new shoes first.

192
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,134
It's okay now.

193
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:13,969
You should get going.

194
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:19,391
I guess I wasn't the one
who spilled the wine.

195
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:24,478
Who is this?

196
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,564
Me?

197
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,734
I'm her third husband.

198
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,903
- You said you planned to remain single.
- I do.

199
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,363
Well, I was about to be.

200
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:35,741
But she broke it off.

201
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:45,375
Nice meeting you.

202
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,132
What was that?

203
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,968
Now that I messed up my third marriage,

204
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,971
I'm looking for a fourth husband.

205
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,558
Does anyone fall for
such an old-fashioned method?

206
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,436
The third one sure did.

207
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,189
You seemed a lot more sincere with me.

208
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:09,775
That's exactly
what I wanted you to believe.

209
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,518
You fell right into my hands.

210
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:16,907
And don't read too much into
being able to find me in the past.

211
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,451
You were just confused and misled.

212
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:20,952
You weren't really happy.

213
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,038
So you can look elsewhere

214
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:24,790
for your happy times.

215
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,918
There must be some moments in your life

216
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,711
that made you happy.

217
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,307
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:44,391
Oh my.

219
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:45,852
Hello.

220
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,022
Don't you remember me?

221
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:50,941
Do I know you?

222
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,859
Yes, we met at the beach.

223
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,071
Don't you remember?

224
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,657
Let me think.
We met at the Haeundae Beach.

225
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,120
I think I remember.

226
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:05,204
Right?

227
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,836
What did you do with my husband?

228
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:12,921
Did you hit it off by the beach?

229
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,467
Another business trip to the nightclub?

230
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:22,013
Are you the one who's been
messaging him every night?

231
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,657
- No, I'm...
- Excuse me for cutting in.

232
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,018
I'm her third husband.
Or I was going to be.

233
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,188
But you can't park here because…

234
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,566
- Run.
- Excuse us!

235
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,150
Hey, get back here!

236
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:35,402
- Hold on.
- Damn you.

237
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,404
- Wait.
- Let go!

238
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,087
Having fun?

239
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,466
Let's go to dinner, Da-hae.

240
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:00,760
I don't want to.

241
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,304
What about our deal?

242
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,015
Just work with me here. Please?

243
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:14,691
Ten million won per hour,

244
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,568
and I'll think about it.

245
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:25,826
Okay.

246
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,088
This is where you really got me.

247
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:40,674
Have a seat.

248
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,390
Make your ten million won.

249
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,747
If you're worried about me,
you don't have to be.

250
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,625
I'm only choosing to spend time with you

251
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,544
because I can benefit from it.

252
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,005
This is just business.

253
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,467
If you're trying to save me,

254
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:24,051
you don't have to.

255
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:28,515
I stay with the people at the sauna
because I benefit from it.

256
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,518
I chose them as my family.

257
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,187
I'll leave them when I want to.

258
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,406
But how did you end up
being family with those people?

259
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,741
You mean, how did I get involved
with scum like them

260
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:49,244
and become a criminal?

261
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,372
I'm sorry, but I'm scum too.

262
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,500
You talked about happy moments
that you couldn't forget.

263
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,545
The day you learned to ride a bike.

264
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,381
The first time you tried shaved ice.

265
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,050
You didn't lie then, did you?

266
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:07,178
You looked really happy

267
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,848
when you talked about that.

268
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:18,606
I wanted to ride a bike
just like other kids.

269
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,526
But unlike them,

270
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,571
I didn't have parents who could teach me.

271
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,033
I fell again and again

272
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,494
until I finally managed.

273
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,456
It was a brutally happy moment.

274
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:37,375
And the shaved ice?

275
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,878
It was the boring, old-fashioned kind.

276
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,549
It was from a bakery
near South Gangneung Terminal.

277
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,845
Those tiny little moments were

278
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,473
the only happiness I ever felt.

279
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,898
But I bet you've always had everything.
You even have a superpower.

280
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,692
That's probably why moments like that

281
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,445
seem like real happiness to you.

282
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:11,868
The first thing my power taught me
was frustration.

283
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,038
I realized that I couldn't be happy

284
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:17,791
if I was the only one who was happy.

285
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,002
That's why I became a firefighter.

286
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,255
Although I didn't last long.

287
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,467
Are you that desperate to save others?

288
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:33,765
Just so you can feel superior
by helping the less fortunate?

289
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:37,644
You know what I think?

290
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:40,563
You let your power get to your head.

291
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:45,860
Maybe.

292
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:06,422
He went to the restroom.

293
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:27,110
Way to go, you idiot.

294
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:28,736
Hyeong-jin.

295
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:35,618
Here are your meds, newbie.

296
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:41,249
How could you fall off a tree
on your first day?

297
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:42,917
Aren't you even embarrassed?

298
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:45,753
Why would you climb the tree

299
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:48,006
when the team wasn't even ready?

300
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,841
Do you have a superpower or something?

301
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,051
So…

302
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:54,636
Is she okay?

303
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,556
How should I know?

304
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,104
Don't get up.

305
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,232
Thank you so much.

306
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:07,817
Thank you.

307
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,821
The kitty is like her little sister.

308
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,157
I see.

309
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,867
I'm relieved that everyone's okay.

310
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:18,661
Except for this one.

311
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,457
Are you laughing?

312
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,084
Do you think you're Tarzan or something?

313
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:28,129
You looked like an idiot,
climbing the tree with rubber gloves on.

314
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,673
I couldn't tell who was saving whom.

315
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,760
- "Come here, Happy!"
- I didn't sound like that.

316
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:34,928
That was spot on.

317
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,180
You're exaggerating.

318
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:59,994
This is nowhere near enough.

319
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:03,914
Hey.

320
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,669
Your father's debt is yours now,
so you'll have to pay me back.

321
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:08,753
Come here.

322
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:14,342
I said come here.

323
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:22,557
Sign this.

324
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,572
BENEFICIARY: BAEK IL-HONG
INSURED: DO DA-HAE

325
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,800
Who are you?

326
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,212
I'm home.

327
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,799
Did you have a good time with Gwi-ju?

328
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:02,593
I was on a date
with my potential fourth husband.

329
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:04,220
The deaconess's son.

330
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:08,099
I didn't tell you to do that.

331
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:11,310
I need to move on.

332
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:15,606
I'll get married
without a problem this time.

333
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,733
I know I threw a wrench in our plan.

334
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,279
We were supposed to part ways
after my third marriage.

335
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:26,701
Do you think Dodari is up to something?

336
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:30,788
Even if Gwi-ju brings golden eggs
from the future,

337
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:33,082
he'll only be visible to her.

338
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,836
How much do you trust her?

339
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:41,799
We shouldn't leave the future
of the two families to those two.

340
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,011
Let's see what we can do.

341
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:51,642
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

342
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:53,895
She has nothing to do with us now.

343
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,576
You were with her all day.

344
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:24,592
It's the same dream again.

345
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:29,472
I was just about to get a good look.

346
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:38,773
Honey, get me some water.

347
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:44,737
Honey?

348
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,489
Honey?

349
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,345
Sun-gu.

350
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:15,226
Don't be so disheartened
that your family doesn't get you.

351
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:19,605
It's always the ones closest to you
who understand you the least.

352
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:24,819
Even some saints weren't acknowledged
in their own hometowns.

353
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:28,489
But I bet people remembered
their wives' names.

354
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:31,534
I'd like to be remembered for something.

355
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:37,873
I'm just the shadow to her bright light.

356
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:39,916
Nothing more.

357
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,424
Don't say that.

358
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:52,013
The way I see it,
you're the brightest light there is.

359
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,401
Oh my goodness!

360
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:09,071
Are you the light of my wife's life?

361
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:11,949
Honey.

362
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,784
This is a misunderstanding.

363
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:17,163
Ms. Shin and I just meet up
to work up a sweat...

364
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:20,625
Work up a sweat doing what?

365
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,628
- Answer me!
- It's not what you think!

366
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,463
We're just buddies

367
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:27,923
who enjoy a hobby together
in a respectable manner.

368
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,718
There's no romance between us whatsoever.

369
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,845
- What?
- Am I right?

370
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:35,264
Say something, Ms. Shin.

371
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:36,974
Oh my goodness.

372
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:40,978
Stay away from my wife, you bastard!

373
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:43,314
I don't know if you're buddies or lovers,

374
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:47,401
but we'll let the court decide
once I file charges against you.

375
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,195
You bastard.

376
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:50,655
Let's go, honey.

377
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:53,532
- Okay.
- No, wait.

378
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,451
I'll pay you.

379
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:57,578
Please don't press charges.

380
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:01,999
Someone definitely pushed me.

381
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,197
Hey there, I'm here to work out.

382
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,699
Can I get a one-day pass?

383
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:36,909
I've been to other gyms,

384
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:40,413
but this one's the least crowded.

385
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:41,622
It was you.

386
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:44,792
You pushed me off the edge.

387
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,668
What?

388
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,848
- Stupid CCTV!
- Get over here!

389
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,434
I'm sorry, Dong-hee. I really am.

390
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:04,812
I thought you'd elegantly float
like on the day of the wedding.

391
00:32:04,895 --> 00:32:06,063
What if I did?

392
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:08,190
Were you going to film it
and blackmail me?

393
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,944
- Oh my gosh!
- You little…

394
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,322
Stop right there!

395
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,493
- Damn it!
- Come here!

396
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:40,973
Please forgive me just this once.

397
00:32:44,935 --> 00:32:46,771
I'll do anything.

398
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,782
You better fix everything.

399
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,170
Our deal isn't going to fly.

400
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:13,714
What do you mean?

401
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,927
Da-hae just won't cooperate.

402
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:21,889
I can only follow her around for so long.

403
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:24,391
Don't worry.

404
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:28,687
She'll have no choice
but to accept the deal.

405
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:33,400
Where are you going?

406
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:37,028
Hey.

407
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:39,323
The guy I'm meeting today

408
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,866
is a devout Buddhist.

409
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,868
We're getting some temple food for lunch.

410
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,163
How about some barbecue for dinner?

411
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,043
Hyeong-tae.

412
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:57,383
Help them spend some happy times together.

413
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:03,032
Are you happy yet?

414
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,075
Not really.

415
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:11,165
That's not good.

416
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
How about now?

417
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:37,358
Not really.

418
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,667
How about now?

419
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,252
Not at all.

420
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:01,966
Not with my companion
looking so miserable.

421
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:09,764
What?

422
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,361
Hey, bro.

423
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:24,947
Let's get some shaved ice.

424
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,366
"Bro"?

425
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,159
The best shaved ice Da-hae ever had.

426
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:31,954
I'm wondering if that'll make her happy.

427
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:43,548
Lead the way.

428
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,550
Right now?

429
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:48,929
You don't even know...

430
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:50,013
We'll be right back.

431
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,058
But…

432
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:55,394
I don't think you will be.

433
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:09,199
Are we still not there?

434
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:29,553
SEOUL TO GANGNEUNG

435
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:05,422
BLANCHE BAKERY

436
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,601
Here's your shaved ice.

437
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:21,814
Can I get this to go?

438
00:38:22,314 --> 00:38:23,690
Sorry, but that's not possible.

439
00:38:32,157 --> 00:38:34,118
I'll return the bowls later.

440
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,912
Sure, go ahead.

441
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:51,801
Hey.

442
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,887
Can you go get us bus tickets?

443
00:38:55,722 --> 00:38:56,722
Me?

444
00:38:57,891 --> 00:38:58,892
Hurry up.

445
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,936
Before the ice melts.

446
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,149
Come on, bro.

447
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,708
WINNING NUMBERS

448
00:39:57,993 --> 00:39:59,203
You don't even know...

449
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:00,537
We'll be right back.

450
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:01,455
But…

451
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:04,124
I don't think you will be.

452
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:15,385
I finally ditched him.

453
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,190
This is it, right?

454
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:31,525
Yeah.

455
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,211
Guess it melted a little.

456
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,510
- Can you check me out?
- Sure.

457
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:42,764
I'll pay double for this one.

458
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:46,226
Okay.

459
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:52,107
That'll be 7,000 won.

460
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:05,370
Why don't you stay a while, dear?

461
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,917
Try some of this shaved ice.

462
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:12,501
Here.

463
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:14,838
Go on.

464
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:22,054
Here, dig in.

465
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,802
Seonjae Girls' High School, right?

466
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:07,182
I saw the news.

467
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:10,394
There was a fire at your school.

468
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:13,438
You poor thing.

469
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,400
You must have been so scared.

470
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,614
I'm sorry. Eat up.

471
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:27,869
I could only find happiness
by selling out my misfortunes.

472
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,164
So I'm not quite sure

473
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:35,460
if I was happy or not.

474
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:42,426
I know what that day 13 years ago…

475
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:45,846
means to you.

476
00:43:48,223 --> 00:43:50,892
But I was never grateful
that I survived that day.

477
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:55,397
I survived with nothing left in my life.

478
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:57,941
It was exhausting.

479
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,590
Maybe that's why I conned people
using the person who saved me.

480
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,866
To spite him for saving me.

481
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,875
Do you still have my stuff at home?

482
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,334
There's something

483
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:19,880
that the person who saved me left me with.

484
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,261
Hyeong-jin left you something?

485
00:44:28,555 --> 00:44:30,182
The ring that he was wearing.

486
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:34,436
Please give it to his family.

487
00:44:56,249 --> 00:44:57,249
Wow.

488
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:00,462
Is this what superpowers feel like?

489
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:05,759
I feel like I just went back in time.

490
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:37,249
Maybe not.

491
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,131
Maybe I haven't moved on
from my past at all.

492
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:58,395
This week's winning numbers.
For 2.3 billion won.

493
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:03,232
Take it.

494
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:10,073
Are you really going to
join hands with my mom?

495
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:14,744
It's for you. Pay off your debts.

496
00:46:17,622 --> 00:46:19,249
Stop selling out your misfortunes.

497
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,294
If you must sell something,

498
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:24,587
sell your happiness.

499
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:26,464
To me.

500
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:27,882
For ten million won per hour.

501
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:30,844
Go buy a lottery ticket first.

502
00:46:32,012 --> 00:46:34,264
And do it before 8 p.m.
You know that, right?

503
00:46:36,808 --> 00:46:38,143
Why are you going this far?

504
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:44,107
Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:47,569
I'm paying up.

506
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,073
Like I said, this is just business.

507
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:08,340
Hey.

508
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:10,133
Did you get the tickets?

509
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:15,555
I'll go return the bowls.

510
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:39,037
What's wrong?

511
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:42,082
He was right there.

512
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,334
But then he wasn't.

513
00:47:45,752 --> 00:47:47,295
When he came back,

514
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:49,798
the shaved ice was gone.

515
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:52,634
I mean…

516
00:47:53,426 --> 00:47:55,095
Where did it go?

517
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,871
WINNING NUMBERS

518
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:27,061
Please review it and get back to us.

519
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:28,146
I will.

520
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:30,023
I'll be in touch as soon as possible.

521
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:32,442
- Thank you.
- Drive safely.

522
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,668
Ms. Bok, can we get a picture with you?

523
00:49:51,836 --> 00:49:53,636
- Stand over here, please.
- You're beautiful!

524
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:13,149
Excuse me.

525
00:50:14,484 --> 00:50:15,735
These are on the house.

526
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:17,445
- Sorry?
- Enjoy.

527
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:18,780
Thank you.

528
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:02,949
Ji-han.

529
00:51:03,032 --> 00:51:04,576
What a coincidence.

530
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,911
Dong-hee.

531
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:13,710
I've been thinking about you today.

532
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:18,172
Can we talk?

533
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:21,759
I can't believe we met here.
What are the chances?

534
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,137
Please.

535
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:40,653
I've been wanting to
talk to you for a while.

536
00:51:43,364 --> 00:51:44,407
So…

537
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,078
I don't know

538
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,290
how to say this.

539
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:56,418
What is it?

540
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:03,551
Come on, you can tell me anything.

541
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,056
It's about…

542
00:52:09,557 --> 00:52:10,683
our marriage.

543
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:14,519
Marriage?

544
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:29,410
Remember how you said

545
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:32,997
we'd be getting
that 50-billion-won building?

546
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,418
Is that offer still valid?

547
00:52:39,462 --> 00:52:40,463
Right.

548
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:45,593
Yes.

549
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:48,554
Of course.

550
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,898
No matter how hard I try,

551
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,234
my feet are glued to the ground.

552
00:53:06,948 --> 00:53:08,533
I thought I hit rock bottom,

553
00:53:09,826 --> 00:53:11,411
but I keep on falling.

554
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:17,333
When will I be able to fly again?

555
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:29,137
You haven't eaten, have you?

556
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:31,055
Drink this.

557
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:32,807
I'm fine.

558
00:53:35,935 --> 00:53:38,730
You could actually die.

559
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,625
The floor's cold.

560
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:01,544
Let's lie down somewhere else.

561
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:33,910
Feel any better?

562
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:36,579
Yes, kind of.

563
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:42,543
By the way,

564
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,214
why couldn't you fly the other night?

565
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,693
I clearly saw you floating
on the day of the wedding.

566
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:53,571
Like you said,

567
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:55,990
I'm fat.

568
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,243
I never said that.

569
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,412
You're Bok Don't Eat.

570
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:06,417
Don't worry.

571
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:09,921
I'll help you lose weight

572
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:11,422
and get married.

573
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:18,261
You will?

574
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:21,515
I'll get you that building.

575
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,643
We can split it.

576
00:55:23,726 --> 00:55:24,894
What do you think?

577
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,230
That sounds great.

578
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:31,400
But there's one problem.

579
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:37,781
I don't like you.

580
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:44,537
Rice punch.

581
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,209
Use your own hands.

582
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:03,516
DANCE CLUB ONCE

583
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,475
I'm leaving.

584
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,638
HAN JUN-WOO LEFT THE CHAT.
GOH HYE-RIM LEFT THE CHAT.

585
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:19,156
Hey.

586
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,243
I just bumped into something.
What could it be?

587
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,839
- You broke my phone.
- Wait.

588
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:37,049
I think I just heard something.

589
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:39,635
Guys, did you hear that?

590
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:41,721
I think so, but I don't see anything.

591
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:43,639
But I think I heard something.

592
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:45,516
What? I didn't hear anything.

593
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,727
Are you guys hearing things?

594
00:56:56,444 --> 00:56:57,445
Do you see it now?

595
00:57:00,573 --> 00:57:01,824
Let's go, guys.

596
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:29,310
Where's Ms. Da-hae?

597
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,156
She went to the market.

598
00:57:44,992 --> 00:57:46,702
When will she be back?

599
00:57:47,286 --> 00:57:48,286
Soon.

600
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:54,960
Are you bored?

601
00:58:04,428 --> 00:58:05,721
One, two, three.

602
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:08,349
You lost.

603
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:10,226
Now you get flicked.

604
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:11,935
Flick.

605
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:32,164
One, two,

606
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,917
three.

607
00:58:41,924 --> 00:58:42,924
My turn.

608
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,597
One, two,

609
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:50,683
three.

610
00:58:58,566 --> 00:58:59,692
See you around.

611
00:59:19,962 --> 00:59:21,755
- Who was that?
- My guest.

612
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,425
- Bok Dong-hee?
- Go on in.

613
00:59:24,508 --> 00:59:25,801
You have a guest too.

614
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,100
One, two,

615
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:34,685
three.

616
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,106
One, two…

617
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:41,734
three.

618
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:47,698
- One, two...
- Hold on.

619
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:51,660
Something's not right.

620
00:59:53,412 --> 00:59:54,412
Hey, I-na.

621
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:02,463
- Ms. Da-hae.
- What are you doing here?

622
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:12,598
Sometimes,
you just don't feel like going home.

623
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:14,808
Especially at her age.

624
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:32,535
Did you call them over?

625
01:00:32,618 --> 01:00:33,786
No way.

626
01:00:35,204 --> 01:00:37,289
I guess they come here

627
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:40,167
to find what the Boks don't have.

628
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:43,212
What do they not have?

629
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:46,298
Happiness, for example.

630
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:50,719
You seem to be cooking up something new.

631
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:52,471
Care to share?

632
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:55,432
What's the genre this time?

633
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:59,478
If I had to say,
I guess it'd be a family drama.

634
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,105
What?

635
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,358
You're not the only one getting soft.

636
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,721
Gwi-ju has feelings for you too.

637
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:09,780
Mom.

638
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:12,783
You're making this harder for me.

639
01:01:12,866 --> 01:01:14,702
I'm trying to move on, so why...

640
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:17,204
You're the only one he can reach
and vice versa.

641
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:22,167
But you care so much about each other
that you push each other away.

642
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:25,296
I felt so sorry for you
that I had to step in.

643
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:28,048
Family is the answer.

644
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:33,679
So we're taking the family hostage?

645
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,725
There's a nicer way to put it.
It's called "familial love."

646
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:40,477
Who knows?

647
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:43,772
We might actually end up
becoming one family.

648
01:01:43,856 --> 01:01:46,650
Then we'll be in the same boat forever.

649
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:48,068
Forever?

650
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:52,114
Are you never going to let them go?

651
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:54,199
This is a win-win.

652
01:01:55,117 --> 01:01:59,538
There's nothing in this world
that I want to see more than you two

653
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:01,123
being happy together.

654
01:02:08,088 --> 01:02:11,342
He seemed to love seaweed soup.

655
01:02:40,162 --> 01:02:41,162
Here.

656
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:43,165
Take it.

657
01:02:43,248 --> 01:02:45,459
I'm short on cash at the moment,

658
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,877
so take the car for now.

659
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,712
And leave Gwi-ju...

660
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:50,881
Please keep him away from me.

661
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:56,095
He's trying to cut a deal with my mom.

662
01:02:56,595 --> 01:02:59,515
If that goes through,
it'll endanger all of you.

663
01:03:00,974 --> 01:03:04,103
You're the only one
who can settle the situation.

664
01:03:04,186 --> 01:03:06,563
Why are you telling me this?

665
01:03:07,147 --> 01:03:09,817
Are you betraying your own
to join hands with me?

666
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:11,568
He's just annoying.

667
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:15,406
He thinks he's some superhero in spandex,

668
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:17,032
meddling with people's businesses.

669
01:03:18,283 --> 01:03:19,326
You know how he is.

670
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:23,038
He never listens to me.

671
01:03:23,122 --> 01:03:24,289
You know how he is.

672
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,918
But you have a powerful weapon.

673
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,001
Use it to your advantage.

674
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:33,173
I can't dream if I can't sleep.
You know that.

675
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:44,685
Are you drugging me right in my face now?

676
01:03:45,894 --> 01:03:49,022
Would you rather
I replenish your energy with my hands?

677
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:51,066
Don't you lay a finger on me.

678
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:56,071
It was sleeping pills

679
01:03:56,655 --> 01:03:57,948
that put you to sleep.

680
01:03:58,907 --> 01:04:01,577
I don't have some special energy,

681
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,288
and I'm not some special person
who can save your family.

682
01:04:05,831 --> 01:04:09,001
Drugs couldn't have given me
such special dreams.

683
01:04:12,129 --> 01:04:14,882
Well, how about this?

684
01:04:20,262 --> 01:04:22,639
It's the winning ticket.
Worth 2.3 billion won.

685
01:04:23,724 --> 01:04:24,724
You're lying.

686
01:04:26,185 --> 01:04:27,186
How would you…

687
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:31,315
Wait, was it Gwi-ju?

688
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:36,069
Perhaps it was hope

689
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,406
that put you to sleep.

690
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,490
Hope?

691
01:04:42,117 --> 01:04:45,078
Hope that the Bok family
can get back on its feet.

692
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:47,623
This should give you

693
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:51,210
much more hope than the words of a fraud.

694
01:04:54,004 --> 01:04:57,007
Why are you giving me this?

695
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:00,551
Take it

696
01:05:01,303 --> 01:05:02,304
and leave me alone.

697
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:12,189
Get some sleep.

698
01:05:12,856 --> 01:05:14,399
If you want to save your family.

699
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:40,259
I told you not to call me.

700
01:05:40,342 --> 01:05:41,635
You're right.

701
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:44,471
Talking on the phone feels too impersonal.

702
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:46,264
Should I come over?

703
01:05:46,306 --> 01:05:49,309
I'd love to meet your wife.

704
01:05:49,393 --> 01:05:50,769
Fine.

705
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:53,856
I'll do as you say, so give me some time.

706
01:06:09,663 --> 01:06:10,663
Honey.

707
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:19,297
Are you asleep?

708
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:00,756
She's sleeping.

709
01:07:01,882 --> 01:07:04,927
Did you get rid of Da-hae's stuff
in the guest room?

710
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:08,597
Yes, your mom kept pestering me
to throw everything away.

711
01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:12,893
Why? What are you looking for?

712
01:07:13,936 --> 01:07:14,978
A ring.

713
01:07:15,562 --> 01:07:16,562
A ring?

714
01:07:19,858 --> 01:07:20,984
Do you mean that one?

715
01:07:22,986 --> 01:07:26,031
Dong-hee found it in Da-hae's suitcase

716
01:07:26,114 --> 01:07:27,908
on the day your wedding fell through.

717
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:32,079
Da-hae must have stolen it from the safe.

718
01:07:32,162 --> 01:07:33,162
What?

719
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:34,873
She stole what?

720
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,945
The family ring.

721
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:25,859
Do you still have my stuff at home?

722
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:28,320
There's something

723
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,990
the person who saved me left me with.

724
01:09:32,908 --> 01:09:34,618
The ring that he was wearing.

725
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:35,952
Do Da-hae…

726
01:09:38,288 --> 01:09:39,289
I don't get it.

727
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:43,126
The person who saved Da-hae left her with

728
01:09:43,752 --> 01:09:45,045
our family ring?

729
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:46,880
That means

730
01:09:47,923 --> 01:09:49,341
the person who saved her

731
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:52,052
wasn't Hyeong-jin.

732
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,030
I should charge you extra for overtime.

733
01:10:15,992 --> 01:10:17,160
Is this it?

734
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:23,625
- The ring you were left with?
- Yes.

735
01:10:25,293 --> 01:10:26,586
You found it.

736
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:27,921
Are you sure?

737
01:10:29,339 --> 01:10:31,883
That the person who saved you
gave you this ring?

738
01:10:33,844 --> 01:10:34,970
Yes.

739
01:10:35,053 --> 01:10:36,221
Did you see his face?

740
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:39,641
It's like there was
something over his face.

741
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:42,602
I was also dizzy from all the smoke.

742
01:10:44,354 --> 01:10:46,439
But I do remember him
putting the ring on my finger.

743
01:10:46,982 --> 01:10:48,525
He asked me to hold onto it.

744
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:18,012
Gwi-ju!

745
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:23,517
I'll be damned.

746
01:11:27,147 --> 01:11:28,899
I think I'll have to save you.

747
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:31,525
What?

748
01:11:31,568 --> 01:11:32,652
My power must have…

749
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:36,281
really gotten to my head.

750
01:11:40,702 --> 01:11:42,412
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

751
01:12:10,523 --> 01:12:11,775
Now it's time to save you

752
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:13,568
using that happiness.

753
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:15,946
You've fooled me all this time.

754
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,198
Stop pretending you care about me.

755
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:20,700
Everyone tiptoes around you
because of your dreams.

756
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:22,327
How do you not know that?

757
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:25,705
I wish I stayed invisible.

758
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:29,167
I don't know what went wrong.

759
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:30,835
Why don't we fly together?

760
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:32,587
Fly with me.

761
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:34,129
Just once.

762
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:37,217
You should save your family, not me.

763
01:12:37,926 --> 01:12:40,470
Turns out, I can change the past
without using my powers.

764
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:42,889
By doing what I can right now.

765
01:12:42,973 --> 01:12:44,891
Stay away from the Bok family.

766
01:12:45,517 --> 01:12:46,517
I won't…

767
01:12:47,477 --> 01:12:48,645
be your daughter anymore.

768
01:12:50,188 --> 01:12:55,193
