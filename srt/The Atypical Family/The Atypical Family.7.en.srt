1
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,916
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:12,660
Take a look around.

3
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:16,163
You might see me

4
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:17,748
somewhere around here.

5
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:19,959
What do you mean?

6
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,545
I think I'll remember this moment

7
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:24,714
for a long time.

8
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:32,847
As a happy moment.

9
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:35,683
What an idiot.

10
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,521
No, you're not here.

11
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:55,286
Such a waste of energy.

12
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,663
Why have a wedding
if you knew it would be ruined?

13
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:01,167
What happens in my dreams is inevitable.

14
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,209
You know that.

15
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:05,004
You could've at least given us a heads-up.

16
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,299
We wasted so much money on these flowers.

17
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,094
And what about the dress she ran away in?

18
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:13,971
We rented that out, right?

19
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,306
How much did that cost?

20
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:17,933
It's a small price to pay
to ditch the swindlers.

21
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:21,103
And this was the wake-up call
that Gwi-ju needed.

22
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,648
Why haven't you put all of these away yet?

23
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,566
Get to it!

24
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,236
Are you sure about this?

25
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,114
Whatever her intention was,

26
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:35,159
she gave you back your dreams
and Gwi-ju his past.

27
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,245
What's the point of going back
to a moment of being fooled?

28
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,665
And what's the point of dreaming
about the woman who fooled us?

29
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:44,460
What about her wearing the family ring?

30
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:47,296
How will you explain that?

31
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:49,715
I can explain that.

32
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,260
Look what I found

33
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,221
in Do Da-hae's suitcase.

34
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:03,395
She stole it.

35
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,397
I told you.

36
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:06,982
The dream was warning you

37
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:08,275
to beware of that woman.

38
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:12,780
But...

39
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,534
Gwi-ju isn't simply
going back to his past--

40
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:18,452
Just clean this up already.

41
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:31,423
That was a close one.

42
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,178
But at least it's all over now.

43
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,013
Right?

44
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,975
I was hoping for a clean break.

45
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,395
I didn't see you fly in my dream.

46
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,313
Why did you have to fly in front of her?

47
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,275
You never could
when I constantly begged you to.

48
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,359
What?

49
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,486
Would you rather I broke something

50
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:54,572
- by falling on the floor?
- Quiet.

51
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:01,537
Those crooks are the last people
who should find out about our secrets.

52
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,748
There's just no pleasing you.

53
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,691
- Mom!
- Mom!

54
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:31,775
Come here!

55
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:35,779
- Mom!
- Mom!

56
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,531
She's a fraud.

57
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:39,200
She can fly.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,367
Get over here.

59
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,286
Where's Dodari?

60
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:43,746
Did she run away alone?

61
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:47,124
Where do you think you're going?

62
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:49,877
She's working with Do Da-hae.

63
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:53,172
She can fly, Mom.
I saw it with my own eyes.

64
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:55,299
- Shut up.
- Let go!

65
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,550
Let her go.

66
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,302
We can't just let her go.

67
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,012
We have to call the police.

68
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,060
Please stop causing a scene.

69
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,312
If you leave now,

70
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:13,359
I'll let you off the hook
for making a fool of all of us.

71
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:16,737
This is why you insisted
on holding the ceremony here

72
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,281
without inviting any guests, isn't it?

73
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,991
You already knew.

74
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,077
That the wedding would be ruined.

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,751
So you really have been
hiding it in your house.

76
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,796
A toad that lays golden eggs.

77
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,800
I think you mean a goose.

78
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,476
Mom!

79
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,818
What the hell is this?

80
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,405
It's just like I said.

81
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:01,657
How much of it was a lie?

82
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,034
Did you lie about
the marriage registration too?

83
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:07,788
What about the fire 13 years ago?

84
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,043
You weren't lying about that, were you?

85
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:18,090
You were...

86
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,219
the only one I could reach in the past.

87
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,639
I can only go back
to the times I spent with you.

88
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,433
You're the only one
who can see or touch me.

89
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,602
That was real.

90
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,232
Your past is my future.

91
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,818
What has happened to you
will happen to me.

92
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,863
I saved you 13 years ago.

93
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,031
No, I will!

94
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,159
That's my fate.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,833
That has to be real.

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,461
Right?

97
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,341
Answer me.

98
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,761
Say something!

99
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,601
It's my repertoire.

100
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,812
- What?
- A pitiful high school girl

101
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,689
who survived a fire.

102
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,153
Nothing melts a person's heart
faster than that.

103
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:24,573
So I'm not the first--

104
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:25,657
Didn't I tell you?

105
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:27,701
You were my third.

106
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,084
Does that mean

107
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,669
you've said the same thing

108
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:39,755
to others before?

109
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,215
It wasn't exactly the same.

110
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,841
I used to say,

111
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:46,345
"You look like the person
who saved my life."

112
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:49,014
So that's different.

113
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:53,936
Are you saying...

114
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,064
you lied about everything?

115
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:21,255
And I kept going back

116
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,341
to those moments of lies

117
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,094
over and over again.

118
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:30,764
Like an idiot.

119
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,029
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

120
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,761
Explain yourself.

121
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:53,305
I just want to know.

122
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:57,017
Why did you sabotage the wedding
that you had in a bag?

123
00:09:57,017 --> 00:10:03,106
And it seemed like Ms. Bok knew
that you would ruin the ceremony.

124
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,316
So what?

125
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:06,109
Does she really have a superpower?

126
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,072
Or are you one of the Boks now?

127
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,910
Let's stop here.

128
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:20,916
I want to quit.

129
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:26,296
Is this what I get for taking you in
after that fire?

130
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,344
If you regret saving me,

131
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:33,845
just kill me here and now.

132
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,352
Or I could do it myself
and save you some trouble.

133
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:41,853
Oh, right.

134
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,940
Then you wouldn't get a penny out of it.

135
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,734
What if they really have superpowers?

136
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,321
Maybe they're not delusional.

137
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,033
Maybe she can really see the future.

138
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:39,036
Precognitive dreams?

139
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,454
Da-hae didn't screw up.

140
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:43,332
Their superpowers got in our way.

141
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,128
Superpowers?

142
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,382
Yeah, I saw it too.

143
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:57,971
That chubster was floating in the air.

144
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:04,519
Mom, we could make a fortune off of this.

145
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,900
I have to see it for myself.

146
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,551
I thought you'd be knee-deep in booze.

147
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:40,138
You're clearly knee-deep
in something though.

148
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,058
Please don't tell me it's that scammer.

149
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,021
Don't go back anymore.

150
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:51,233
Not that I think you can anyway.

151
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:55,570
Where did he go?

152
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:58,907
Are you okay?

153
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,034
So heavy.

154
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,287
It was me.

155
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,164
I'm fine.

156
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,374
Don't mind me.

157
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,468
What are you doing?

158
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:21,096
You'll catch a cold if you don't dry off.

159
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,819
I'd rather he started drinking again.

160
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,239
Why is he brooding over it?

161
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,617
It might take him a while to get over her.

162
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:45,537
Just like that door.

163
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,831
The door from 13 years ago?

164
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:49,583
What's that got to do with anything?

165
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,668
What does it have to do with Do Da-hae?

166
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,044
Honey.

167
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:54,379
To Gwi-ju, Do Da-hae--

168
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,755
I don't want to hear it!

169
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,090
Don't bring her up ever again.

170
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,510
What's going on at the sauna?

171
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,054
Nothing yet.

172
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,809
We don't know
what her mother will do next.

173
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,270
I'd better get some sleep.

174
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:13,523
And you'd better lie low.

175
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,484
They don't scare me.

176
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,072
You keep an eye on I-na.

177
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:48,934
Are you in?

178
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,730
Do you want to get malatang?

179
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,275
No.

180
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:00,779
But you like spicy food.

181
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:01,988
No.

182
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:03,824
Not with you.

183
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:10,330
What about with Hye-rim?

184
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:14,084
She asked me to bring you.

185
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,379
She was worried you seemed down all day.

186
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,173
Really?

187
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:25,262
Let's go, I-na.

188
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,014
- What's taking so long?
- I know.

189
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:30,433
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

190
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,893
You want me to come?

191
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,813
- Can I do that?
- What?

192
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:35,939
Why would you ask that?

193
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,025
Wait.

194
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:40,902
Something's off.

195
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:42,612
Is everything okay?

196
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,281
Are you sick?

197
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,369
Do you have a fever?

198
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,040
Don't come.

199
00:15:58,837 --> 00:15:59,838
You're coming, right?

200
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:02,382
No.

201
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:04,843
What?

202
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,053
- Give her back her glasses.
- Right.

203
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,180
I shouldn't touch her glasses.

204
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,390
Sorry, I-na.

205
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,142
Let me put them on you.

206
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:16,229
Get lost.

207
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:21,026
- What the hell?
- Are you okay, Hye-rim?

208
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,152
- Are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

209
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,405
What a freak.

210
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,449
Why would she do that to Hye-rim?

211
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:29,492
She's such a weirdo.

212
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:31,077
That's enough.

213
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,747
She must be feeling under the weather.

214
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,957
You're so understanding, Hye-rim.

215
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,543
She takes you for granted.

216
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,387
I-na.

217
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,475
Do you want to move to a prettier house?

218
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,645
What about Daddy?

219
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,273
Daddy...

220
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:04,694
can't come with us.

221
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:33,473
Hey, kid.

222
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,225
Are you okay?

223
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:38,520
Are you hurt?

224
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,480
Today just keeps getting worse.

225
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:46,319
What's wrong?

226
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,822
Oh my.

227
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,449
Are you hurt?

228
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,743
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay, kid?

229
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:56,788
- Are you hurt?
- Should we call your parents?

230
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:57,998
Stay there.

231
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,625
Are you okay?

232
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,168
Do you need an ambulance?

233
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,086
What's wrong with her?

234
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:04,087
Are you okay, kid?

235
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,297
Watch where you're going.

236
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,757
Is she out of her mind?

237
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:09,217
Kids these days are scary.

238
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:12,053
- Are you hurt?
- She must be in too much pain to talk.

239
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,138
What should we do?

240
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,522
The number you are trying to reach...

241
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,482
Why won't she pick up?

242
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,739
Is this the academy?

243
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:34,909
I'm calling to ask
if Bok I-na is done with her class today.

244
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:37,287
Pardon?

245
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:40,540
Honey.

246
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,555
Gwi-ju.

247
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:57,057
I-na is missing.

248
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,975
She didn't go to the academy.

249
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:13,364
Where in the past
are you wandering around now?

250
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:28,797
This can't be right.

251
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,175
There, I got you. Watch your step.

252
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:34,385
Hold on.

253
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,888
Oh my goodness.

254
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:38,765
I wasn't happy then.

255
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,524
Could it be

256
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:51,444
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

257
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:53,113
It was all a lie.

258
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:55,907
Enjoy.

259
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:57,283
Enjoy, I-na.

260
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,751
I almost forgot. Just a second.

261
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:11,756
Why do I keep

262
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,259
coming back to these moments?

263
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,060
Where could he be?

264
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,311
Are you looking for me?

265
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,651
You're back.

266
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,909
Why do you keep looking back
at the ruins of the past?

267
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,452
I don't know.

268
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,497
It just happens whenever I close my eyes.

269
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,541
Get it together.

270
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,751
While you were wandering in the past,

271
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:50,587
I-na went missing.

272
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:55,049
What?

273
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,096
- That felt nice.
- It was great.

274
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,598
- How refreshing.
- The meal's on you, right?

275
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:03,183
Sure, it's my treat.

276
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:05,435
What do you want to eat?

277
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:13,067
My goodness.

278
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:16,696
Look who's here.

279
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:20,742
I-na.

280
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,437
Here you go.

281
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,733
Want me to peel it?

282
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:01,491
I heard you're the one

283
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:04,953
who told Da-hae
your family lost their superpowers

284
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:06,579
to lifestyle diseases.

285
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:11,000
I wonder how they got their powers back.

286
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:17,048
Your grandma can see the future,
your dad can go back to the past,

287
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,217
and your aunt can fly.

288
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:23,429
What about you, sweetheart?

289
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,599
What's your superpower?

290
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:30,770
Well?

291
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,939
Didn't Ms. Da-hae warn you

292
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,565
not to look me in the eye?

293
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:45,243
What will you do?

294
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:47,662
Turn me into stone?

295
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,540
Or make me vanish, like "poof"?

296
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:57,922
Go on then.

297
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:00,633
Do it.

298
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:14,397
Poof.

299
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:28,661
Come out.

300
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:50,058
They actually have superpowers,

301
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,685
and we're the only ones who know that.

302
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:57,523
And now, that little gem
just walked in here on her own.

303
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,030
She doesn't have any powers.

304
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,785
Guess what the most common cause
of lifestyle diseases is?

305
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,165
Family.

306
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,959
And you're the one

307
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,837
who got that kid out of that hellhole.

308
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,173
Am I right?

309
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,345
What's your point?

310
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:30,348
I'll give you a second chance.

311
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:35,937
If the Bok family accumulated wealth
using their superpowers,

312
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:41,234
we could squeeze
a lot more out of them than we planned.

313
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:45,279
They wouldn't dare to call the police.

314
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:50,785
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

315
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,253
Are you out of your mind?

316
00:25:01,254 --> 00:25:02,088
No, just blind.

317
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,385
What are you doing here?

318
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,183
Hey.

319
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,146
You can't be here.

320
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,064
Were you locked up?

321
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,696
Where are your glasses?

322
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:29,615
I lost them.

323
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:33,411
What happened?

324
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:37,623
I'm not being bullied.

325
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:46,215
- Stop looking at my eyes.
- You can yell, but you can't scare me.

326
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,431
You were the only one I could think of

327
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,933
when I lost my glasses.

328
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,895
You're the only person
I can look in the eyes

329
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:01,397
without being scared.

330
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,449
Does your dad know you're here?

331
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:14,869
I bet he's gone again.

332
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,872
Gone? Where?

333
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,373
He's been stuck in the past lately.

334
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,213
When in the past?

335
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:27,924
When do you think?

336
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,392
I looked the other way for you.
Why did you screw it up?

337
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:46,734
Jeez. What?

338
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,570
Could it be that you left him

339
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:51,656
out of love?

340
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:53,574
Look me in the eyes.

341
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,078
I've never had such a cheesy thought.

342
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:01,707
- Come on.
- I think you might have.

343
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,000
This isn't going to work.

344
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,796
Let's get you a new pair of glasses.

345
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,172
Enjoy.

346
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:19,767
Are you heading out?

347
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:21,310
What?

348
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,606
She needs a new pair of glasses.

349
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,819
I-na.

350
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:32,905
You still haven't shown me

351
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:35,074
how you shoot lasers out of your eyes.

352
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,585
She can't see anything right now.

353
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:48,838
All right.

354
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,178
Don't mind us.

355
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:59,307
- Get her a nice pair of glasses.
- Okay.

356
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:00,933
See you later.

357
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:02,685
See you.

358
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:14,405
Do you like those?

359
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:20,911
How much are they?

360
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,957
780,000 won.

361
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:33,924
Are they too expensive?

362
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:36,719
Not at all.

363
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:39,305
They look great on you.

364
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:43,559
Just a second.

365
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:47,772
Here you go.

366
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:55,196
Wow.

367
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:57,073
You look great.

368
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,706
Are you expecting someone?

369
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,291
What?

370
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,753
I-na! Bok I-na!

371
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,299
Did you call Dad?

372
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,012
I'm done coddling you.

373
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,556
Don't come back again.

374
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,601
I heard that old lady's thoughts.

375
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,147
She's testing your loyalty.

376
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,109
This is your last chance.

377
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,569
If you just let me go,

378
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,154
you'll be in huge trouble.

379
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:40,991
What... Hey.

380
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:44,620
She's far too dangerous
for you to look her in the eyes.

381
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:46,956
And I thought you were
scared of eye contact.

382
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,459
I-na.

383
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:52,044
Are you okay?

384
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,507
Are you wearing new glasses?

385
00:29:58,509 --> 00:29:59,802
Ms. Da-hae got them for me.

386
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,680
Did you lure her with new glasses?

387
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,348
What did you do to her?

388
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:05,516
She didn't do anything.

389
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:07,518
And I went to the sauna on my own.

390
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:09,520
Why?

391
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,730
What for?

392
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,191
To eat some eggs,

393
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,569
drink some rice punch,

394
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:18,612
and play some games.

395
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,124
I was fattening her up
so I could eat her later.

396
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:34,670
Dad.

397
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,423
- She's not such a bad person.
- Go wait in the car.

398
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,925
Now.

399
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:42,928
Come on.

400
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:13,751
I returned her safely this time,

401
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:15,753
but I won't next time.

402
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:18,464
You don't want to find out

403
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,466
what will happen then.

404
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,636
Let me ask you one last question.

405
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:31,310
Is it true that you survived a fire

406
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,521
thirteen years ago?

407
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:38,818
What about the fifth-floor storage?

408
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,159
One of my colleagues
who took my shift that day

409
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:49,370
died in that fire.

410
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,999
He heard someone was locked up in there

411
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:57,419
and dashed into the collapsing building.

412
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,173
If I wasn't the one who saved you,

413
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:03,634
it might have been him.

414
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:08,514
He had a family.

415
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:10,850
A wife

416
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:12,852
and a toddler son.

417
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,858
I can't believe
he gave his life to that girl

418
00:32:19,817 --> 00:32:21,360
for her to end up like this.

419
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:27,241
Live a meaningful life.

420
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,493
I'm begging you.

421
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:34,707
It seems like our time
has come to an end, Ms. Do.

422
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:38,002
I'll erase all the moments
we spent together,

423
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,130
and I'll never think about them again.

424
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:43,799
I will never

425
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:46,844
go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.

426
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:54,935
Ms. Da-hae.

427
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,139
Don't let me go.

428
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:38,354
Jeez.

429
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:46,403
Is this how you ask for a favor?

430
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:49,657
- What the hell?
- You can do the talking yourself.

431
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,741
Go ahead.

432
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:56,413
What are you doing? Out of the way!

433
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:59,708
Okay. Just a second.

434
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:03,295
What the heck?

435
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,637
At least tell me why I have to stop you.

436
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:13,097
I don't want to.

437
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:15,099
- Talk to me.
- I don't want to!

438
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:18,227
It looked like someone just yanked her.

439
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:19,186
Fine.

440
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,021
I'll talk to you.

441
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,690
- Really?
- Yes.

442
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,233
Okay.

443
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:38,205
Is it a ghost?

444
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:42,167
Stay still. I'm leaving.

445
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,462
Come on.

446
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,257
You're fast.

447
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:50,259
Do you have something to say?

448
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:55,597
No, I don't.

449
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:00,602
What was that?

450
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:02,396
Go on.

451
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:05,649
You can leave.

452
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,317
Just say it.

453
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:08,986
You don't have to yell.

454
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,241
Is it...

455
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,745
me?

456
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,126
No way.

457
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,211
Why would I come back?

458
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,469
You should go check on your sister.

459
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:35,846
And why is that?

460
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:42,644
Apparently, she's in danger.

461
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,313
Well done.

462
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,159
Hey.

463
00:35:58,202 --> 00:35:59,578
I'm just working out.

464
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,372
Of course I'm okay.

465
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:06,335
What is this about? You never call me.

466
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,046
I was just worried about you.

467
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:11,924
You should worry about yourself.

468
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,011
Hello?

469
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,222
Hello?

470
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:23,477
Was he really worried about me?

471
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:30,109
He must be really out of it.

472
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:34,780
All right.

473
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:38,784
Keep going.

474
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,577
You've got this.

475
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:49,461
She's fine.

476
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,548
What kind of danger is she in, exactly?

477
00:36:53,132 --> 00:36:54,049
You're gone.

478
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:55,884
You said you should go see her.

479
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:57,177
How convenient.

480
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,597
You can say I'm here whenever you want.

481
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:04,059
You don't have to believe me.

482
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,312
I don't care what's going to happen.

483
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,438
For what it's worth,

484
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:11,608
I told you exactly what you told me.

485
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:17,781
Wait!

486
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,492
Are you leaving just like that?

487
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,912
You can't just go!

488
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:26,123
Hey!

489
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,128
Wow.

490
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,463
You've lost so much weight.

491
00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:35,090
Look at you.

492
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,175
Hey, you.

493
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,470
What's the point of running?

494
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,514
You can literally fly.

495
00:37:42,514 --> 00:37:45,309
You're so fly, Bok Don't Eat.

496
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:46,935
You've got some nerve coming here.

497
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,313
I was just getting my stuff.

498
00:37:49,313 --> 00:37:50,606
These are expensive.

499
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:54,526
How dare you come here
after ruining my relationship with Ji-han?

500
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:58,197
If I were half as good as you,

501
00:37:58,197 --> 00:38:00,574
I'd never be hung up on a guy like him.

502
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:03,327
Why date such scum
when you can fly anywhere you want?

503
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,497
I used to dream of flying
when I was a little girl.

504
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:11,168
Can you take me up in the air
like Superman just once?

505
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:13,003
You're in spandex already.

506
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:18,342
Get lost.

507
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,844
Or I'm calling the cops.

Hi, Ji-han. It's me.

00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:38,547
Hi, Dong-hee.

515
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:39,464
Can we meet?

516
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,383
We need to talk.

517
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:44,094
Well, what's this about?

518
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:46,305
You won't believe it.

519
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:47,889
You were a victim too.

520
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,308
You were set up.

521
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:51,518
Anyway,

522
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:54,354
- I'll tell you the details--
- Should we talk at my clinic?

523
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,273
- What?
- Can you come over?

524
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:57,232
Right now?

525
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,235
Sure.

526
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:01,945
I'll be right over.

527
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,452
I have to hurry.

528
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,459
Should I have waited
until I've lost more weight?

529
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,503
It's under maintenance.

I can't keep Ji-han waiting.

00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,807
Should I just fly over?

535
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,146
Dong-hee.

536
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:03,275
Gwi-ju.

537
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:05,444
Are you okay?

538
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:34,431
- Dong-hee.
- Oh no.

539
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:36,016
Bok Dong-hee! Hey!

540
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:39,102
Did she hurt her head?

541
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:42,355
She needs to go to the hospital.

542
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:46,443
Are you hurt?

543
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:53,783
Stay with me, Dong-hee.

544
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:07,923
You're not driving.

545
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:10,258
I'm fine.

546
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:11,510
Get in.

547
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,179
Come on.

548
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,105
Mom.

549
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:27,400
Guess what Dodari is doing with whom.

550
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,443
I know.

551
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,348
It looks like malnutrition.

552
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,017
Sorry?

553
00:44:04,813 --> 00:44:05,689
Jeez.

554
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,441
She should have taken it easy.

555
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:11,069
There doesn't seem to be
any visible trauma.

556
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:13,989
If she fell on you from a height,

557
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,199
the impact must have been significant.

558
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:18,243
Are you in pain?

559
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:20,036
Not really.

560
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,373
Let's have a look anyway.

561
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:24,791
This way, please.

562
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,013
How did you know
Aunt Dong-hee was in danger?

563
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,100
Something...

564
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:43,852
just felt wrong.

565
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,860
Hey, put them back on.

566
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,321
I'm sorry. Put them back on.

567
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:57,532
Did you do it?

568
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:08,835
No one can see your dad
in the past, right?

569
00:45:09,336 --> 00:45:11,171
And no one can touch him?

570
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:13,840
But I can see him.

571
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:15,759
I can even touch him.

572
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,803
I'm not sure why.

573
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:23,683
Wow.

574
00:45:55,965 --> 00:45:58,343
The number you are trying to reach...

575
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,179
They should be back by now.

576
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:03,223
Who should be back?

577
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:08,478
Did you get some sleep?

578
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,565
Did you see anything in your dream?

579
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:15,777
What's going on?

580
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:18,113
The thing is,

581
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,991
- I-na is with Do Da-hae right now.
- What?

582
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:24,452
Gwi-ju went to pick her up
when Da-hae called him,

583
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:25,829
but I can't reach him.

584
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,418
- Hey.
- Mom.

585
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:33,336
I'm at the hospital.

586
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:34,254
What happened?

587
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:36,881
I fell from a height.

588
00:46:38,258 --> 00:46:39,717
How did that happen?

589
00:46:39,717 --> 00:46:41,344
I tried to fly,

590
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:43,346
but I couldn't.

591
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:45,598
But Mom.

592
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,476
Do you know who I saw before passing out?

593
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,979
Do Da-hae.

594
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:53,106
Do Da-hae was there.

595
00:46:53,773 --> 00:46:55,650
She kidnapped I-na,

596
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,360
and she tried to hurt you?

597
00:46:58,403 --> 00:46:59,737
What are you talking about?

598
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,990
Did you call the police?

599
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:06,077
Do you still care so much
about our secret being exposed?

600
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:11,166
They're coming at us because they know
we can't go to the police.

601
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,084
Calm down. Which hospital are you at?

602
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:14,127
Let me see.

603
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,631
Where am I?

604
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:22,552
Is Dong-hee hurt?

605
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:23,511
Is it serious?

606
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:28,016
Give it back. I'm calling the cops.

607
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,727
Do you even know where I-na is?

608
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:31,811
She's with Do Da-hae.

609
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,062
Exactly, she's with...

610
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:39,694
And you're okay with that?

611
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:44,908
She's the one who hurt me.

612
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:47,660
I felt someone push me over the edge.

613
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,037
It's the opposite.

614
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:52,624
She's the one who saved you.

615
00:47:54,584 --> 00:47:56,002
What are you talking about?

616
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,089
It's a long story.

617
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:27,325
I-na!

618
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:32,205
I-na.

619
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:33,665
Are you okay?

620
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,125
Stay away from my family.

621
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,255
How dare you try to
put your filthy hands on her?

622
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,506
She's just a child.

623
00:48:46,636 --> 00:48:47,637
Maybe...

624
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,599
you should have kept a closer eye on her.

625
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,434
It was too easy.

626
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:56,104
All I did was look her in the eye.

627
00:48:57,146 --> 00:48:59,983
The kid without powers
must have been your easiest target.

628
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,403
I guess superpowers aren't all that.

629
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:08,241
You can see everything
in the future or in the past,

630
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:10,410
but you can't see
what's right under your nose.

631
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,995
What?

632
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:14,289
What a shame.

633
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:19,377
If I'd known you'd be so easy,
I would've held out longer.

634
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:25,174
Be prepared.

635
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:26,759
Once my mom bites,

636
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:28,720
she never lets go.

637
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:39,731
What did she say to lure you?

638
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,192
I went to her.

639
00:49:44,694 --> 00:49:46,988
How could you be so immature?

640
00:49:46,988 --> 00:49:49,157
Did you get sick of being spoiled

641
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:51,367
and finally decide to break bad?

642
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:54,412
You sure picked up
some bad habits early on.

643
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:55,580
You little thief.

644
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,165
You're a thief too.

645
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:01,377
- What?
- The lottery numbers and stock prices.

646
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:04,172
You stole the future.

647
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:07,133
I just used my power--

648
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,676
Join hands with Ms. Da-hae.

649
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:11,554
Then you can steal the future again.

650
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,015
What are you talking about?

651
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:20,813
You knew, didn't you?

652
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,608
That Ms. Da-hae can see
Dad from the future.

653
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:26,319
What did you say?

654
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,416
The mothers are so in sync
with each other.

655
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:42,960
She slapped me in the exact same spot.

656
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:52,011
Hop on.

657
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:15,993
I've been meaning to tell you.

658
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,540
You should've told me from the beginning.

659
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:24,085
I was worried it'd keep you up at night.

660
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:26,671
Gwi-ju's power wasn't exactly stable.

661
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:28,965
I wanted to be sure before I told you.

662
00:51:28,965 --> 00:51:31,676
Who are you to decide that?

663
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,886
What do you know?

664
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,597
Get out. I need to think.

665
00:51:38,057 --> 00:51:39,308
I know.

666
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:43,479
You think I'm a good-for-nothing
who doesn't know anything.

667
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:46,232
I've always lived in your shadow,

668
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:49,569
pretending to be oblivious
to everything I see.

669
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,739
Maybe that's why I kept it from you.

670
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:56,117
That's how I've always protected you.

671
00:51:56,117 --> 00:51:59,287
I don't have time
for your whining right now.

672
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:01,956
Where did it go?

673
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,140
Listen, honey.

674
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,477
You don't have to know everything.

675
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,729
And you can't know everything.

676
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:29,525
What do I not know?

677
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,361
Nothing gets past me.

678
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,532
The mutation of powers...

679
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:42,163
always comes at a price.

680
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:04,310
I stood Ji-han up.

681
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:06,521
He must be so worried.

682
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:09,524
Something came up. Sorry.

683
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:10,733
Let's take a rain check.

684
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,373
What?

685
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:27,875
Are you okay?

686
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,503
Are you here to gloat?

687
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:32,171
About you saving me?

688
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:34,924
You're fine.

689
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,301
I'm gonna lose weight.

690
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:42,765
I was too heavy to fly.

691
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:45,017
Take it easy, or it'll backfire.

692
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:46,769
And don't skip your meals.

693
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:50,481
I told you to worry about yourself.

694
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,153
Is your arm feeling any better?

695
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:00,157
Bok Gwi-ju.

696
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:06,873
I have a question.

697
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:12,295
How come that fraud is the only one
you can touch in your past?

698
00:54:13,296 --> 00:54:15,590
Physical contact between a man and a woman

699
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,425
can be a dangerous thing.

700
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:22,972
Bok Gwi-ju!

701
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,058
Thanks.

702
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:29,395
When I inherit the building,

703
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:32,023
I'll give you a discount on rent.

704
00:54:36,444 --> 00:54:37,320
Good night.

705
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:44,994
That little brat.

706
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,331
I guess he's changed a bit.

707
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:51,334
You did it.

708
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:55,296
You saved someone with your power

709
00:54:55,296 --> 00:54:56,589
like a superhero.

710
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:04,347
Save Ms. Da-hae too.

711
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,807
She must be locked up again.

712
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:09,894
- Locked up?
- Or even worse.

713
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:12,563
First, she ruined the wedding,

714
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:14,398
and now, she let me go.

715
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:16,776
That's none of your business.

716
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,236
Don't go near those people again.

717
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,324
Do you still not get
why she ruined the wedding?

718
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:27,411
Even after reliving it so many times?

719
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,438
Why are you back?

720
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,190
It's all over now.

721
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:40,735
I ruined everything.

722
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,778
Exactly.

723
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:45,698
Kind of seemed like you overdid it.

724
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,951
You could've run away quietly,

725
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:51,871
but you decided to make a huge scene.

726
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,707
As if you wanted to sabotage your scheme.

727
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,251
Was I just...

728
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,587
saved by a con artist?

729
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:45,841
What did you get in return
for letting the kid go?

730
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:52,473
You've gotta have something.

731
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,725
I have very high expectations for you.

732
00:57:58,896 --> 00:57:59,730
What is it?

733
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,358
Are you being shy or modest?

734
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:05,403
The Bok family's been hiding

735
00:58:05,403 --> 00:58:07,446
a toad that lays golden eggs.

736
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,866
And you're the one
who ended its hibernation.

737
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,868
On top of that,

738
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:16,080
you're the only person
Bok Gwi-ju can reach in the past.

739
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,167
Why have you been keeping

740
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,253
such important information from me?

741
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:25,339
You shouldn't keep
secrets from your mother.

742
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,093
I'm hurt.

743
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,559
Someone's here.

744
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,482
The toad is here.

745
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,651
I think you mean the goose.

746
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:49,905
Let's cut a deal.

747
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:53,534
I never lose out on a deal.

748
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:57,538
Even at a glance, my family has suffered
more damage than you have.

749
00:58:58,122 --> 00:59:00,499
Compensation for emotional distress aside,

750
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:04,920
the wedding actually cost a fortune.

751
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:06,797
But I'll call it even.

752
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,263
If you agree
to reestablish our relationship.

753
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:18,058
We clearly need each other.

754
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:20,269
So from now on,

755
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,771
let's be business partners.

756
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:33,073
Are you suggesting that we collaborate?

757
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,784
I can only return to the moments
I spent with Da-hae.

758
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,956
With a little cooperation from her,

759
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,169
my power can be quite useful.

760
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:23,040
- What are you getting at?
- It's simple.

761
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,544
You just need to spend some time with me.

762
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:29,463
As often and as much as possible.

763
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:34,468
I don't think so, Gwi-ju.

764
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:37,888
Is this how you reestablish relationships?

765
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:39,890
I'm fine with that.

766
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:41,600
- Da-hae.
- Bok Gwi-ju.

767
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:47,022
- It's all over now.
- I know.

768
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,149
Speaking of which,

769
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:52,111
I have to undo the past.

770
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,531
I'm going to

771
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:57,658
hold on to you.

772
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:04,957
- What?
- I'm going to undo the moment...

773
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:08,377
things ended for us.

774
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,769
It seems like our time
has come to an end, Ms. Do.

775
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:29,565
I'll erase all the moments
we spent together,

776
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,443
and I'll never think about them again.

777
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:35,112
I will never

778
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:38,157
go back to a moment
I spent with Do Da-hae.

779
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:23,744
What do you want?

780
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:28,499
You said...

781
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,753
you'd never come back.

782
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,174
But here I am.

783
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,517
Why me?

784
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:51,814
Why do you keep looking back
at times with me?

785
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,777
I need your help.

786
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:01,323
With what?

787
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:27,266
Don't let me go.

788
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:49,913
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

789
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:19,443
Let's go to dinner, Da-hae.

790
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:21,737
I don't want to.

791
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,782
I'll help you steal the future.

792
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:26,200
If you let me borrow Da-hae.

793
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,828
I chose them as my family.

794
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:32,080
I'll leave them when I want to.

795
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,082
Another mouth to feed.

796
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:37,503
Why would he reach out
to the scammer who lied to him?

797
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,172
I don't know if I can
keep it together around him.

798
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:41,673
I've been wasting my time

799
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:43,675
for the past few years.

800
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,260
It's a bit late,

801
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,887
but I want to put it to better use.

802
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:49,431
I think I found my way

803
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:51,016
back to happiness.

804
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:57,731
