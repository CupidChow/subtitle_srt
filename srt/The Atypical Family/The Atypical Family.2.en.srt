Look, Mom.

16
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:51,395
I won the giant carp.

17
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:58,778
My giant carp...

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,323
Didn't I warn you

19
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,117
there will be a car accident
near the stationery store?

20
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:07,411
I told you to stay away from it.

21
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,623
I told you to take the long way around!

22
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,166
My giant carp...

23
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,834

Here you go.

31
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:56,877
Is that me?

32
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,295
Let me see.

33
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,005
At nine, I first learned

34
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,717
that I could to return to a happy moment

35
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,011
from my past.

36
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,566
Finally.

37
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,943
At last!

38
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,654
Thank goodness.

39
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:26,407
Thank you.

40
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,450
Thank you so much.

41
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:37,877
TRY AGAIN

42
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,840
Better luck next time.

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,466
Here you go.

44
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,143
- Hey!
- Wait for me!

45
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,812
- Pass me the ball!
- Over here! I want to play too!

46
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,783
- Oh yeah!
- Let me see.

47
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,121
Reliving the happy moments

48
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:15,956
was incredibly sweet.

49
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,541
I want one too.

50
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,168
- However...
- Bok Gwi-ju.

51
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,545
It's your lucky day.

52
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:23,422
Have a taste, Gwi-ju.

53
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:24,840
Go ahead.

54
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,766
It's so sweet.

55
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,811
- Stop it.
- Let me have a piece!

56
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,564
- I want a giant carp too!
- Guys!

57
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:41,649
Wait for me!

58
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,900
Seon-u!

59
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,277
Jae-hui!

60
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:46,862
Can't you hear me?

61
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,244
Excuse me.

62
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:55,621
Excuse me, sir.

63
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,539
Can't you see me?

64
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,333
Can't you hear me?

65
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,502
Happy!

66
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,838
Happy!

67
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,805
Happy!

68
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,683
What was a moment of happiness for me

69
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,518
was sometimes

70
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,020
a moment of sorrow for others.

71
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,981
Please help.

72
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:27,444
Please help my Happy.

73
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,200
- Happy.
- Happy.

74
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,161
Poor Happy.

75
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,338
Happy!

76
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,674
Happy!

77
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:07,776
Happy.

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't die.

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,322
Happy!

80
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,903
But I couldn't change the past.

81
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,364
This moment

82
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:57,034
no longer brought me joy.

83
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,536
Even the most special moments

84
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:02,831
- became dull after a few repetitions.
- Happy!

85
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,416
The guilt of being happy

86
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,585
while others were miserable

87
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:08,921
made it feel

88
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,590
even worse.

89
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:16,512
And once the happiness faded,

90
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,472
I could never

91
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,058
return to that moment again.

92
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:25,729
- Are you ready?
- No.

93
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,901
- I'm ready now.
- I-na, let's go to Daddy.

94
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,403
- Come to Daddy.
- Here you go.

95
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,613
- Goodness.
- You have to support her here.

96
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:36,657
- Do I put my arm here?
- Yes, and here.

97
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,783
- Like this?
- Yes.

98
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,619
- There you go.
- Oh my gosh.

99
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,830
I-na, do you see Daddy?

100
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,332
Do you see me?

101
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,875
Another happy moment

102
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,919
for you to relive over and over again.

103
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,629
Absolutely.

104
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,298
I'm sure I'll be back all the time.

105
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:56,635
I-na, Daddy's here.

106
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,846
I-na.

107
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,639
Look, she's smiling.

108
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,057
- Really?
- Yes, look.

109
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,395
But even this moment

110
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,355
is out of reach now.

111
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:43,265
See you, Dad.

112
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:53,484
I-na.

113
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:55,861
Watch where you're going.

114
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,030
Don't walk around looking at your phone.

115
00:08:58,655 --> 00:08:59,948
That's how you get hurt.

116
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,877
I should never have been born.

117
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,463
I don't deserve birthday presents.

118
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,512
It's called a smart "phone."

119
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,597
Use it for making calls.

120
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,807
And you never even call me.

121
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,147
Okay.

122
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,678
May I help you?

123
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:04,721
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

124
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:07,975
No.

125
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,023
- I'm sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

126
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:15,941
Sorry.

127
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,693
I'm so sorry.

128
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,822
He's on the move.

129
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:30,539
Do you have another child?

130
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:33,458
An elementary schooler?

131
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,419
A kindergartner?

132
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,882
Don't tell me those are for I-na.

133
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,226
Looking for a better present?

134
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:56,189
These aren't much better
than that stuffed rabbit.

135
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,700
Do you need help?

136
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,206
Do you want to marry me?

137
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,750
No.

138
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,710
I'm just here to shop.

139
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,462
So do that.

140
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:30,974
Oh my.

141
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:32,642
How about these?

142
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,191
It's weird when kids dress like grown-ups.

143
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,567
I meant for me.

144
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,070
I'm shopping like you said.

145
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:49,701
Wait.

146
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,204
- Should I help you pick out a present?
- Nope.

147
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,538
Let me help you.

148
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,146
Give me that.

149
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:31,660
Can I get another beer?

150
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:43,672
For I-na.

151
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,305
I said I hated it
when kids dress like grown-ups.

152
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,017
Every kid wants to look like a grown-up.

153
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,894
Mind if I sit here?

154
00:12:58,854 --> 00:12:59,688
Suit yourself.

155
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:00,814
It's all yours.

156
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:04,776
Wait.

157
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,864
Come on.

158
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,868
After I got you those shoes?

159
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:14,828
You can at least buy me a nice cold drink.

160
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:19,833
I have trouble exchanging favors,

161
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,793
being depressed and all.

162
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,007
At least take these with you.

163
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,932
They're for I-na.

164
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:11,885
Here's your drink.

165
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,594
- What's going on?
- Fire!

166
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,388
Everyone out!

167
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,973
There's a fire!

168
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,600
Everyone evacuate now!

169
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,483
Please evacuate in an orderly fashion!

170
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:09,901
This way, please!

171
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,111
Please remain calm!

172
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,363
Move slowly!

173
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,945
Yes, we're heading to the entrance!

174
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,823
Attention, valued customers.

175
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,158
We have confirmed

176
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:25,203
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

177
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:27,872
We apologize for the inconvenience.

178
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:30,583
We have confirmed

179
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,004
that the alarm from earlier
was due to a malfunction.

180
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:36,673
We apologize for the inconvenience.

181
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,835
Hello.

182
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,920
So nice to finally see you again.

183
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,256
I've been waiting so long.

184
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,549
I'm sorry.

185
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,467
I've been getting a lot of new clients.

186
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:50,098
I guess I wasn't the only one
who recognized your special energy.

187
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,267
It's all thanks to you.

188
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:56,020
But honestly, I'm a bit upset.

189
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,983
I want to keep
all your precious energy for myself.

190
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,654
Look how rough your hands have become.

191
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:10,076
By the way, why did you call me here?

192
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,246
Would you like a massage
after your workout?

193
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:16,291
Let's talk inside.

194
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,340
Hello, Ms. Bok.

195
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,718
- Welcome, ma'am.
- Hello.

196
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:30,263
Hello, Ms. Bok.

197
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,874
Are you the new personal trainer?

198
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,667
What's your name?

199
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,752
Grace.

200
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,503
Grace?

201
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,590
That's a pretty name.

202
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,974
Grace?

203
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,977
That name doesn't really suit you.

204
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,020
It can't be your real name.

205
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:20,855
Why use a fake name?

206
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,608
What's your name then?

207
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:25,735
Bok Dong-hee.

208
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,028
Bok Don't Eat?

209
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,326
You're so lucky to have a name
that suits you so well.

210
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,787
I'm jealous.

211
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,622
It's Dong-hee, not Don't Eat.

212
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,422
Let me think.
When did I purchase this building?

213
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:51,427
Gwi-ju used to be a firefighter for a bit
when he was a young man.

214
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,681
But I wanted him
to live a safer and healthier life,

215
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,516
so I opened this gym for him.

216
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,143
The building's value has gone up
quite a bit since then.

217
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,522
I see.

218
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,817
I'll pass this building down to Gwi-ju
once he gets married.

219
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:12,365
I understand what you're trying to say.

220
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,867
I do appreciate you
thinking so highly of me,

221
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,912
but this all feels very rushed.

222
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,456
Not just for me, but also for I-na.

223
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:24,252
What she needs is a caring mom.

224
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:26,921
She pretends to be mature,
but she's still a kid.

225
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm actually concerned
that she's slower than kids her age.

226
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:35,430
I'm worried that we still haven't heard
the big news from her.

227
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:38,850
Has she not gotten her first period yet?

228
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,938
Given your age,
you should have a child soon.

229
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:46,983
There's a reason I'm so desperate
to have another grandchild,

230
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,901
but that's for another time.

231
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:55,575
Marriage isn't something
I take lightly, Ms. Bok.

232
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,954
To be honest, this isn't the first time
I've been set up with someone.

233
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:02,957
They must have thought

234
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:06,419
that I'd easily jump into a marriage
because I've been married twice.

235
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,628
No way.

236
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:09,922
That's not what I'm thinking at all.

237
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:13,301
If anything, that should make
your next marriage even more precious.

238
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,095
I'll make sure to do it the right way.

239
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,223
We'll throw you a lavish wedding
with a lot of guests.

240
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,310
I've already worn
fancy wedding dresses twice,

241
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,020
so I don't really care about that.

242
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,898
After all I've been through,

243
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,358
I realized that formalities
are meaningless.

244
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,860
I think what's more important

245
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,738
is to try living together.

246
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:36,449
- What?
- Absolutely.

247
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,452
You can't really get to know anyone
until you live with them.

248
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,536
Mom!

249
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,082
Hello.

250
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,125
I need to talk to you.

251
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,504
- We're in the middle of something.
- Just come here.

252
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:52,423
What's the matter?

253
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,675
- Just come with me.
- What is it?

254
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:56,094
Let's go already.

255
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:07,313
You said this building would be mine.

256
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,606
I'm going to get married.

257
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,024
And when is that happening?

258
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:12,527
I haven't even seen Ji-han in ages.

259
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:15,279
His clinic just opened, so he's busy.

260
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,406
Or he's not interested in marrying you.

261
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:22,078
You're the one who has no interest
in me getting married.

262
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:24,622
You barely know that woman.

263
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:25,832
How can you trust her?

264
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,959
She saved your brother's life.

265
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,293
Okay, let's talk about that.

266
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,170
The woman who saved Gwi-ju from drowning

267
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,507
just happens to work
at the massage parlor you frequent?

268
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,134
Do you think that's a coincidence?

269
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:37,969
It's not a coincidence. It's fate.

270
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:39,303
I dreamed about her!

271
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,889
You lost your power ages ago!

272
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,685
Marriage? I'll beat them to it.

273
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:07,832
Hey.

274
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,419
Did you just get here?

275
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:13,754
Do you know
how fierce of a battle I have to fight

276
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:16,424
to come to work as a depressed person?

277
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:21,053
For the first time in a while,

278
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,430
I won that battle today.

279
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,183
I see.

280
00:25:30,855 --> 00:25:32,106
Where are you going?

281
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:33,107
I'm going home.

282
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:36,444
I spent all my energy on getting here.

283
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,156
By the way, thank you.

284
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,219
For holding my hand.

285
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,304
What?

286
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,432
You held

287
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,351
my hand.

288
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:09,435
No, I didn't.

289
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,147
You guys held hands?

290
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:24,825
My gosh, when did you two get so close?

291
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,035
It's not like that.

292
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,328
Don't be shy.

293
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,247
If he went so far as to hold your hand,

294
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:31,207
he's pretty much in love with you.

295
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:39,090
What is she on about?

296
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:42,051
Now that we know how he feels about you,

297
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,262
leave the next step to me.

298
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,098
Please don't get ahead of yourself.

299
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:51,686
Anyway, you look a bit tired.

300
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:54,313
Have you been losing sleep again?

301
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:56,148
I have.

302
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:57,984
Just a second.

303
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,861
Let me give you some tea.

304
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:02,280
Have a seat, please.

305
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:07,994
This is incredible.

306
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,541
She sleeps like a baby
every time she meets Do Da-hae.

307
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,093
May your dreams bring fortune.

308
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,479
Hey.

309
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:37,940
I heard you guys held hands.

310
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,442
Good job.

311
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:42,945
Don't be absurd.

312
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:44,864
That never happened.

313
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,866
I quite like her.

314
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,327
She helps your mom rest.

315
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:50,953
Good luck.

316
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,802
Did you have to be so stern?

317
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,305
Marriage requires sincerity,

318
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,890
even if it's a fraud.

319
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:15,519
Bok Don't Eat or whatever her name is
might beat you to it.

320
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,316
It's your job to put the brakes
on Bok Dong-hee's marriage.

321
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,611
And to do that,
you should watch your figure.

322
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:29,617
If it took you this long to hold hands,
when will you finally

323
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,494
get him into bed?

324
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,832
There was more to it.

325
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,671
He had this look on his face.

326
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,383
Like he was drowning
and grasping at straws.

327
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,140
It's too dark in here!

328
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,747
You've turned this room into a casket!

329
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:20,876
We better bring someone else
into this room soon.

330
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:24,422
You've been living in the shadow
of the dead for much too long.

331
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:27,967
She had another man's child,
for crying out loud.

332
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:32,012
Get off to a fresh start.

333
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:33,723
Once you have a child,

334
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:36,475
you'll want to live again.

335
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,643
I do have a child.

336
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:40,479
Her name is Bok I-na.

337
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,815
Isn't she your granddaughter?

338
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,400
I love I-na dearly.

339
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:48,487
But there has to be a reason
she still hasn't shown any powers.

340
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:50,698
There's no way she's one of...

341
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,325
She's my daughter.

342
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,120
Don't you ever say that again.

343
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,247
If you care so much about her,

344
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,167
stop lying around like a corpse.

345
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,545
Get back on your feet and be a proper dad.

346
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:08,966
Just how much did you drink?

347
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:12,511
Why the radio silence after holding hands?

348
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:14,930
I told you.

349
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,265
Be patient.

350
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,184
It hasn't even been that long.

351
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,643
It's taking longer than usual.

352
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,192
It's Ms. Bok.

353
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:29,403
I told you.

354
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:36,410
What's the point of meeting
Ms. Bok so often?

355
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,790
She needs to win the guy's heart.

356
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,374
As Da-hae said,

357
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,336
whether she can marry him
might be up to his daughter.

358
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,171
Do some more digging.

359
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,509
Find out how we can scratch their itch.

360
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:54,804
All right, class.

361
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,182
Has everyone decided
which club they want to join?

362
00:30:58,182 --> 00:30:59,099
- Yes.
- Yes.

363
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,227
Does anyone need more time?

364
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:03,813
No.

365
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,855
We're all done.

366
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:05,981
I think we're good.

367
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:09,902
In that case,
head over to your club rooms.

368
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:18,035
I'm off to the movie club. Bye.

369
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,246
- Which club are you in?
- The computer club.

370
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,623
Really? I want to change mine now.

371
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,500
The one I'm in is such a drag.

372
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:27,920
Hey, I want to join the computer...

373
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:29,880
We're late. We better run.

374
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,882
I am! What are we watching today?

375
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,425
Alice in Wonderland.

376
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:42,726
MOVIE CLUB
CINEPHILE

377
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:46,313
Hey, close the door!

378
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:58,492
DANCE CLUB
ONCE

379
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:32,985
I-na.

380
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,070
What are you doing here?

381
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,197
Why are you still here?

382
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,867
Is everything okay?

383
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,496
Do you want to talk
in the counseling office?

384
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:45,831
Come on.

385
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:47,666
Is she new?

386
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,584
She's in our class.

387
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:15,110
- Hello?
- He picked up.

388
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,779
Hello, Mr. Bok.

389
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,906
You finally picked up.

390
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,658
I'm I-na's homeroom teacher.

391
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,869
Right, hello.

392
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,788
I wanted to talk to you about something.

393
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:29,291
Club participation
is mandatory at our school.

394
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,378
During club time today,
I-na seemed lost in the hallway

395
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,797
because she hadn't joined one.

396
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:38,550
This could be a bit upsetting,

397
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,596
but I-na can't seem to
get along with her classmates.

398
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,348
She's not being bullied or anything,

399
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,683
but how should I put this?

400
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:47,851
It's as if she were invisible.

401
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:50,604
I know you're busy,

402
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:53,148
but please take more interest
in her school life.

403
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,235
You're also not registered
on our newsletter app.

404
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,904
I've even been giving I-na hard copies,

405
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,198
but she's yet to return them
with your signature.

406
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:02,616
I'd appreciate your help.

407
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:03,826
Yes, of course.

408
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:06,912
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:08,497
Okay.

410
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:25,014
I LOVE YOU, MOM
I LOVE YOU, DAD

411
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,171
GUARDIAN SIGNATURE

412
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,155
I put all the liquor away.

413
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,661
- Let's go out.
- What?

414
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,624
Drinking alone is bad for you.

415
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:37,753
Why don't we get you a drink outside?

416
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:44,551
This way, please.

417
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:55,771
Here we are.

418
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:00,067
The rest of your party is here.

419
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,694
Is someone in there?

420
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,199
You made it.

421
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,589
I never said I'd drink with you.

422
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,883
The groom enters!

423
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,806
You obviously like each other,

424
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:34,977
but you seemed to be holding back
to respect each other's boundaries.

425
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:37,938
So I thought you could
spend some time together over drinks.

426
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:40,983
Drinks?

427
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:42,651
Why not?

428
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:51,326
Have fun, you two.

429
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:53,829
- Stay and join us.
- No, thanks.

430
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:56,665
Please.

431
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,993
I'm not entirely comfortable
with this either,

432
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:34,494
but I had no choice.

433
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,332
Should I pour you a drink?

434
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,478
That won't do.

435
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,857
My mother was right.

436
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:05,567
It's never a good idea

437
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:08,487
to hold back.

438
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:09,047
Hello.

439
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,841
Is he done for the day?

440
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,092
No, he's with his last patient.

441
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,430
I guess I'll wait.

442
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,728
Why is that in the corner?

443
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,732
Dr. Jo told us to put it away.

444
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,906
I totally forgot.

445
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,283
I asked him to put it away.

446
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,996
I thought the colors were fading.

447
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,122
Of course.

448
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:18,533
Bear with me.

449
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:34,341
- That tickles.
- It's okay.

450
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,190
He's not with a patient, is he?

451
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,566
He is, but...

452
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:54,945
What's going on?

453
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,142
Dong-hee.

454
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:26,893
Bok Don't Eat, is that you?

455
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,396
"Bok Don't Eat"?

456
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,982
Is this why you told me to take time off?

457
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:33,442
What are you talking about?

458
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:34,943
I'm with a patient.

459
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,155
It's way past closing hours.

460
00:41:38,155 --> 00:41:40,198
Oh no. Do you need to close up?

461
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:42,492
Let me buy you dinner or something.

462
00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:44,411
Why would you do that?

463
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:48,790
I just feel bad
for keeping him here so late.

464
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:52,502
Give me a call.

465
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,634
It seems like someone already had dinner.

466
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:02,429
What did you have?

467
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:04,973
Black bean noodles?

468
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:27,496
I had no idea a medical examination

469
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,748
could be so amusing and intimate.

470
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,666
She was there about her knee creases.

471
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,294
I was just humoring her
because she was an influencer.

472
00:42:34,294 --> 00:42:36,755
She has 300,000 subscribers,

473
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,090
so I thought she could help
promote the clinic.

474
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,989
Let's get married
earlier than we had planned.

475
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:07,118
You would never have to
worry about rent again.

476
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,745
Well?

477
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:13,333
Just getting married
won't get us that building.

478
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:14,834
We'd have to have a child.

479
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:16,586
Exactly.

480
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:19,005
- Before we get too old--
- I want to get married

481
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:20,924
with a clear conscience.

482
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,511
I won't marry you until I've paid back

483
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:26,888
all the money
you loaned me for the clinic.

484
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:27,973
Never.

485
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:51,580
Focus on your upper body as you pull.

486
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,290
Do you see how it's moving?

487
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,250
Okay, good.

488
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,085
Now it's your turn.

489
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:59,629
Try grabbing the bar.

490
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:00,797
Hi there.

491
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:07,804
Let's get a wider grip on that.

492
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:14,769
One.

493
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:16,563
Two.

494
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:17,522
Three.

495
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:20,150
Four.

496
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:21,735
Five.

497
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:24,070
You're doing great.

498
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:27,068
I-NA

499
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:29,737
The number you are
trying to reach is not available.

500
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:31,823
Please leave a message after the tone.

501
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,409
I-NA

502
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,920
BOK I-NA

503
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:50,341
BOK I-NA

504
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:53,136
The number you are trying to reach...

505
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,143
It's called a smart "phone."

506
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:03,062
Use it for making calls.

507
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,356
And you never even call me.

508
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,780
DAD

509
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:19,787
Dad.

510
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:23,583
I'm in the restroom at Jungang Park.

511
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,752
- Can you come get me?
- Is this I-na?

512
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:29,672
What's the matter?

513
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:31,925
Where's my dad?

514
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:34,093
Well, the thing is...

515
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:39,015
He can't come to you right now.

516
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,684
So I'll come to you.

517
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,686
I'm nearby.

518
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:44,729
I'll be right there.

519
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,856
But why do you need...

520
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:48,858
Is something wrong?

521
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,069
Never mind.

522
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:00,995
Mr. Bok.

523
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,542
I-na just called.

524
00:48:07,544 --> 00:48:08,419
I-na?

525
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,046
I-na...

526
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,383
She just called you

527
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,718
and asked you to come get her.

528
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:20,098
She almost sounded like
she was being chased by someone.

529
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,766
I-na...

530
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,103
You don't even know where she is!

531
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:28,523
I-na.

532
00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:29,983
- I-na.
- Excuse me.

533
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:31,568
- Yes?
- You haven't paid.

534
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,027
- Right.
- It's 640,000 won.

535
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,028
What?

536
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:38,825
Sorry.

537
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,578
Here you go.

538
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,420
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION
640,000 WON

539
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:04,809
Mr. Bok.

540
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:08,396
Are you okay?

541
00:49:11,024 --> 00:49:12,483
Just stay here.

542
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,818
I'll go check on her, okay?

543
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,114
I-na called me.

544
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:19,824
She called me.

545
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:21,826
I have to go to her.

546
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,453
- I have to...
- There, I got you.

547
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:24,996
- Watch your step.
- She needs me.

548
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:26,789
Hold on.

549
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:28,499
Oh my goodness.

550
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:32,545
Steady.

551
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:33,546
Watch your step.

552
00:49:55,652 --> 00:49:57,570
Oh my gosh!

553
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:07,455
It's that way.

554
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,963
Over there.

555
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:17,715
I-na.

556
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,094
Is she out of toilet paper?

557
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,222
Over there, Mr. Bok.

558
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,724
The restroom's over there.

559
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:33,147
That bastard.

560
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:41,447
Hey.

561
00:50:42,156 --> 00:50:44,867
Why are you loitering
around the ladies' room?

562
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:46,494
Well?

563
00:50:49,455 --> 00:50:50,456
You little...

564
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,334
Good grief.

565
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:59,590
Are you okay?

566
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:03,094
I'm not letting you go.

567
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,011
Don't.

568
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:06,931
You're dead meat.

569
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:29,245
Are you leaving to save someone again?

570
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:31,164
Who will save me then?

571
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:50,057
I-na can't seem to
get along with her classmates.

572
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:52,185
It's as if she were invisible.

573
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:57,273
Dad?

574
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:27,386
Don't you dare come
near my daughter again, got it?

575
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:38,856
Dad.

576
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:42,485
I-na.

577
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:46,656
Good job. Now leave.

578
00:52:48,324 --> 00:52:49,283
I-na.

579
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:52,328
Are you okay, I-na?

580
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:56,415
Who's that man?

581
00:52:59,836 --> 00:53:01,045
Don't worry about him.

582
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,548
I beat him to a pulp.

583
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:05,383
But why?

584
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:06,884
What did he do?

585
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:12,056
You can be honest with me.

586
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:13,808
Everything's okay now.

587
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,810
So come on out.

588
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:16,727
Come on.

589
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:20,439
- Let's go.
- Just a second.

590
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:23,442
I-na.

591
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,611
Why did you ask your dad to come?

592
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:35,037
Hello.

593
00:54:09,697 --> 00:54:10,531
I-na.

594
00:54:12,158 --> 00:54:13,284
Stand still.

595
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:15,620
Move your hands.

596
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:24,587
Congratulations.

597
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,332
Hey, I-na.

598
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:05,044
- Congrat--
- Don't say it!

599
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:19,684
Thank you.

600
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,353
Bye.

601
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:33,698
Good night.

602
00:55:37,785 --> 00:55:38,953
Want to grab a drink?

603
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:47,503
Are you going to share this time?

604
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:06,355
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

605
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,733
I heard something breaking.

606
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:12,236
Didn't you see how
that guy in the helmet went flying?

607
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:14,613
That was the sound...

608
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:17,867
of his helmet getting cracked.

609
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,838
Anyway, thank you for helping I-na.

610
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:33,632
But stop making me thank you.

611
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,135
I'm not capable of feeling gratitude.

612
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,180
If I were, I wouldn't have depression.

613
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,806
Frankly, I find it uncomfortable.

614
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,683
I can't do anything for you.

615
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,981
But you already did.

616
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,402
You were kind enough to hold my hand.

617
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:57,490
Why do you keep lying about that?

618
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,079
Are you playing dumb?

619
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:04,789
Where and when exactly?

620
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,170
At the mall.

621
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,338
When the fire alarm went off.

622
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:15,883
It's not like we slept together
or anything.

623
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:17,426
We just held hands.

624
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:19,261
Why do you keep denying it?

625
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:21,847
Unbelievable.

626
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:28,187
Could it be

627
00:57:28,896 --> 00:57:32,191
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

628
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:35,778
You can travel back in time, right?

629
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:42,910
That's not true.

630
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,037
I heard you could go back
to a happy moment.

631
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,622
No, I can't.

632
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:47,790
Right.

633
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,209
You've lost your power.

634
00:57:51,877 --> 00:57:54,004
What if you recovered from depression?

635
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:56,507
What if you were happy again?

636
00:58:03,597 --> 00:58:05,266
Could it be that you were happy

637
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:07,518
when you were with me?

638
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:11,147
No way.

639
00:58:11,772 --> 00:58:13,649
Close your eyes and think hard.

640
00:58:19,655 --> 00:58:20,781
Who knows?

641
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:22,366
You might be able to go back.

642
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,246
Even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to hold your hand.

643
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,376
I can't touch anything in the past.

644
00:58:40,092 --> 00:58:42,428
Bok Don't Eat is still going strong.

645
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:45,598
She's going to throw up.

646
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,448
Why is that in the corner?

647
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:03,782
Dr. Jo told us to put it away.

648
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,578
I want to fly.

649
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:09,705
Just like I used to.

650
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,710
I want to fly!

651
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,184
Stay with me.

652
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:31,894
Keep it together!

653
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:35,940
Breathe with me. Deep breaths.

654
00:59:45,658 --> 00:59:46,951
Good. Slowly.

655
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,126
You're doing great.

656
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:27,449
Don't you want to go back?

657
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,370
To the good old days?

658
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,372
Like I said, I can't.

659
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:35,165
I don't find

660
01:00:35,749 --> 01:00:37,543
any of my past moments

661
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:40,421
happy anymore.

662
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:45,676
Are you seriously saying
you have nothing left

663
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,511
that you remember fondly?

664
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,314
What about the day
you learned to ride a bike?

665
01:00:58,981 --> 01:01:00,816
You never forget that moment.

666
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,445
No? In that case...

667
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:08,407
The first time you tried shaved ice.

668
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:12,536
You remember that?

669
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,832
I'd never had it until high school.

670
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:29,678
What about the day I-na was born?

671
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,765
Another happy moment

672
01:01:32,765 --> 01:01:35,017
for you to relive over and over again.

673
01:01:35,976 --> 01:01:36,810
Do you see me?

674
01:01:37,853 --> 01:01:38,937
I-na.

675
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:50,407
You're unbelievable.

676
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,085
Actually,

677
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:05,839
I might have the ability
to travel back in time too.

678
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,178
Seeing I-na reminds me of my childhood.

679
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,431
I grew up without a mom too.

680
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:17,685
My dad was drunk all the time.

681
01:02:21,021 --> 01:02:22,022
I was alone.

682
01:02:23,816 --> 01:02:24,900
Even then,

683
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,737
I grew up fine, all on my own.

684
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:32,533
Or so I thought.

685
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:35,536
But whenever I see I-na,

686
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,164
I keep going back

687
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:42,000
to my lonely childhood.

688
01:02:52,428 --> 01:02:54,596
I can see where Ms. Bok is coming from.

689
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:57,808
I-na definitely needs someone.

690
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:04,815
Remember that stuffed rabbit I got her?

691
01:03:06,608 --> 01:03:08,277
When she was little,

692
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:11,113
I was never there for her.

693
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,825
So I got her a stuffed rabbit,

694
01:03:16,118 --> 01:03:17,995
saying it'd protect her on my behalf.

695
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:22,249
I see.

696
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:24,084
I gave her another one

697
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,463
because I still can't be there for her

698
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:29,923
when I'm such a mess.

699
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:37,139
But she threw it away.

700
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,560
You're right.

701
01:03:42,436 --> 01:03:43,896
I-na needs someone

702
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:47,691
who can protect her on my behalf.

703
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:50,652
But...

704
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:56,492
I don't want you
to throw your life down the drain.

705
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:00,037
That being said...

706
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:02,748
stay away from me.

707
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,417
Don't make me want to hold on to you.

708
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:13,050
But you already did.

709
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,019
You held my hand.

710
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:28,065
Remember?

711
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:38,242
GUARDIAN SIGNATURE
BOK GWI-JU

712
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:51,547
I held her hand?

713
01:04:53,465 --> 01:04:55,968
But why would she
commit herself to such a lie?

714
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:58,095
Could it be

715
01:04:58,804 --> 01:05:02,307
that you came from the future
and held my hand?

716
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,272
But that makes no sense.

717
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:10,983
Close your eyes and think hard.

718
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:12,901
Who knows?

719
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:15,445
You might be able to go back.

720
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:49,289
No way.

721
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,334
How can this be?

722
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,871
Fire!

723
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:32,207
Everyone out!

724
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:33,250
There's a fire!

725
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,919
Everyone evacuate now!

726
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:38,922
Please evacuate in an orderly fashion!

727
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:40,507
This way, please!

728
01:07:40,507 --> 01:07:41,883
Please remain calm!

729
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:46,888
At the mall.

730
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,016
When the fire alarm went off.

731
01:07:49,725 --> 01:07:51,643
Please come this way.

732
01:07:53,562 --> 01:07:55,063
This way, please.

733
01:07:55,063 --> 01:07:57,733
Please remain calm!

734
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:59,526
Let's slow down a bit!

735
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,033
You held

736
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,536
my hand.

737
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:56,601
You were kind enough

738
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,979
to hold my hand.

739
01:10:36,641 --> 01:10:38,560
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

740
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:10,133
I can touch someone in my past?

741
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,801
Aren't you curious?

742
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:15,764
About why Do Da-hae was
wearing the family ring in my dream?

743
01:11:15,764 --> 01:11:17,057
Do Da-hae.

744
01:11:17,057 --> 01:11:18,516
Who the hell are you?

745
01:11:18,516 --> 01:11:21,228
Why can I touch you,
and why do I keep going back to you?

746
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:22,896
What the hell did you do to me?

747
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:24,731
Are you asking me out?

748
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:26,858
I tried to be brave,

749
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:29,319
since you let me into your heart.

750
01:11:30,028 --> 01:11:31,071
They're going to live together?

751
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,074
This family really is doomed.

752
01:11:36,243 --> 01:11:37,619
Let's bleed them dry.

753
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,913
Make sure you get enough evidence.

754
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,374
They might actually have superpowers.

755
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,918
She just won't listen.

756
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:48,046
I told her to run.

757
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:55,178
