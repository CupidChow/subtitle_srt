1
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:41,004
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:15,735
Gwi-ju!

3
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:21,574
The haze that kept fogging up my dreams

4
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:23,868
turned out to be smoke.

5
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,120
And you were there.

6
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,663
Is this the same dream

7
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:29,540
where you saw the ring?

8
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,000
Stay away from Do Da-hae.

9
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:32,793
There will be a fire.

10
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,378
A huge one.

11
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,675
Don't worry about that fire.

12
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,886
It was put out a long time ago.

13
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,769
This is the ring she had.

14
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,439
Yes.

15
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:55,691
She stole it from the safe.

16
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:57,193
No, she didn't.

17
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,361
The ring was in the safe.

18
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:01,614
It has been all along.

19
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:07,953
They're identical.

20
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,956
- Down to the finest scratches.
- But...

21
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,958
how is this possible?

22
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,169
Where could she have gotten this?

23
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,338
From the person who saved her life.

24
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:19,799
Thirteen years ago.

25
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:22,343
Thirteen years ago?

26
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,971
The fire you saw in your dream
was at Seonjae Girls' High School.

27
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:27,598
No way.

28
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,725
I've never seen the past in my dreams.

29
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,769
It may be her past,

30
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,647
but it's my future.

31
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,986
I saved Do Da-hae in her past

32
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,781
and I will in my future.

33
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,032
Are you saying

34
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,453
that you're destined
to save her from that fire?

35
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,372
Don't worry.

36
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,666
Da-hae is alive and well.

37
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,251
That's the proof

38
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,753
that I'll survive the fire.

39
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,640
It's all in the past.

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,058
The fire's out.

41
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,617
This is the Bok family ring.

42
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:32,496
I'm the one who gave you this ring.

43
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,164
But...

44
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,625
that was just a lie.

45
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,543
It wasn't a lie.

46
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,170
At least not to me.

47
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,928
Two identical rings.

48
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:52,308
Do Da-hae only had the ring

49
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:55,311
because Gwi-ju brought it to her
from the future?

50
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,564
Does that mean

51
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:02,359
Gwi-ju is destined
to go back in time and save her?

52
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,906
The door in his past
must have been his way to Da-hae.

53
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,536
Their wedding fell through,
but their bond remains unbroken.

54
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,415
Their fates were intertwined 13 years ago.

55
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:17,958
Together,

56
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,796
they might actually get
the Bok family back on its feet!

57
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,839
The lottery ticket.

58
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,362
You're late, and you came empty-handed.

59
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:51,075
I thought the two billion won in cash
was slowing you down.

60
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,210
First prize.

61
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,504
Worth 2.3 billion won.

62
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,391
The number you are trying...

63
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,415
Honey.

64
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,793
When did you wake up?

65
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,734
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

66
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,367
That's the stuff.

67
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,911
We haven't worked together in forever.

68
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,539
I feel like I'm in my golden days again.

69
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,375
- Don't you think so?
- Absolutely.

70
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,376
By the way,

71
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:28,005
where did you find this idiot?

72
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,632
How did he get his hands on this
all of a sudden?

73
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,259
What's his secret?

74
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:35,929
Although,

75
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,682
this falls a bit short.

76
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,518
Because after taxes,

77
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:44,271
this is far less than the two billion
that he promised.

78
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,608
It's just a bit iffy, that's all.

79
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,401
Yes.

80
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:51,737
It is a bit iffy.

81
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,166
We're just friends who dance together.

82
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,919
- There's nothing more--
- Do you think I'm stupid?

83
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,297
If that's true,
how come I'm being sent such pictures?

84
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,008
Ms. Shin's husband, that bastard...

85
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,180
He blackmailed me.

86
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,057
And he sent you those pictures

87
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:22,476
even though I paid up like he told me to.

88
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:24,603
You paid him?

89
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:26,855
With what money?

90
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:28,440
The lottery ticket.

91
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,943
Did you take it?

92
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,657
I didn't want to get you
involved in this mess.

93
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:38,409
You've lived

94
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,494
such a sheltered life.

95
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,496
You've fooled me all this time.

96
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,665
Stop pretending you care about me.

97
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,502
Honey.

98
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,922
I'm sorry I kept my hobby from you.

99
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,048
But listen.

100
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,719
I spent a lifetime helping you
make your dreams come true.

101
00:07:58,804 --> 00:07:59,847
Don't I deserve

102
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:03,267
a small dream of my own?

103
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:04,852
When did it begin?

104
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,188
- It hasn't been so long.
- Was it

105
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,316
after I stopped having dreams?

106
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,194
Well, that's not exactly...

107
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,697
You knew there was no way
I could dream about you,

108
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,408
so you thought
you could fool me completely.

109
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:23,370
I trusted you to have my back
while I was asleep.

110
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,707
All I could see was darkness,
with my eyes open or closed.

111
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,668
I could never be awake or asleep.

112
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,587
Even when I was going through hell,

113
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,964
I trusted you and tried to sleep.

114
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:37,134
- Honey.
- You stabbed me in the back

115
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:41,430
when I was at my lowest!

116
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,691
You're right.

117
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:55,194
I'll be honest.

118
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:00,949
I always felt like you were watching
every move I made.

119
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,702
You always knew
what would happen in my life

120
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,204
before I ever found out.

121
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,832
I had to keep my distance
from everyone I met

122
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,668
because I had to protect
the family's secret.

123
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,297
It was suffocating

124
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:17,716
to be in the palm of your hand.

125
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,261
I thought we shared

126
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,473
the same dream.

127
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,893
But you felt suffocated the whole time?

128
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:30,938
Well, you're free now.

129
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:34,816
Get out of the palm of my hand.

130
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,951
- Are you serious?
- Start packing!

131
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,607
I'm done packing.

132
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:42,676
Grandpa?

133
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:54,813
Where are you going?

134
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,777
I'm going on a short trip.

135
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:17,669
Go to bed.

136
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,339
And cut down on instant noodles.

137
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:41,693
Oh.

138
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,445
"Oh"? Is that all you've got?

139
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,157
It's dazzling and sexy. It's sizzling.

140
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,409
Hot!

141
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:57,250
What is this doing here?

142
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,086
What?

143
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,921
Does it seem familiar?

144
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,600
I assumed Ms. Bok had a lucky dream,

145
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,436
but it was a golden egg
you and Gwi-ju had together, wasn't it?

146
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,274
That's my girl. Great job.

147
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,985
Impressive.

148
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,946
You never disappoint, Mom.

149
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,200
How did you do it?

150
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,039
I told you I'd be here to help
if you ever got soft.

151
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,431
Where's Dad?

152
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,141
On a trip, apparently.

153
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,143
By himself?

154
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,813
Hey, Ji-han.

155
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,858
Of course I'm ready.

156
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,359
See you in a bit.

157
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,116
I shouldn't eat.

158
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,174
He's not on a trip.

159
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:30,051
Where is he then?

160
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:42,481
You got played by Mom.

161
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,399
She took the money,

162
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,195
and she got rid of the pillar
that supported your family.

163
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:51,114
Do you get it now?

164
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,868
You put your family in grave danger
by trying to save me.

165
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,870
Your sister

166
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:58,955
and even I-na

167
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,708
are in my mom's crosshairs.

168
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,170
Do you still want to save me?

169
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,380
How did that lottery ticket
end up at my house?

170
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,758
You should have paid her back and left.

171
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,176
It's not that easy.

172
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,304
She knows keeping us together
will get her golden eggs.

173
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,390
As long as we're together,

174
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,726
she won't let go of you or your family.

175
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,146
Are you still going to

176
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,524
go back in time and save me?

177
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:27,943
Why?

178
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:31,530
You want to put your family ring
on my finger?

179
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:34,866
No.

180
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:36,952
You don't have to do that.

181
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,663
- But...
- The rings just look alike.

182
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:42,666
I don't remember much about him,

183
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,710
but he had a red spot
on the back of his neck.

184
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,213
You're not the one...

185
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:51,299
who saved me.

186
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,221
You should save your family, not me.

187
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,807
Your father is just the beginning.

188
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,893
He wasn't my mom's final target.

189
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,437
He was just the first step
toward the real target.

190
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,110
Her real target

191
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,780
is the one who can get
golden eggs in her dreams.

192
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,408
It's your mother.

193
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,095
Let me explain.

194
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:39,598
The understanding of psychology
and empathy is a must

195
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:43,184
to keep up with the future
in this rapidly changing society.

196
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:45,896
I aim to combine science and humanities

197
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,773
to create brand-new values in this world,

198
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:52,360
and I'd like to invite you
on this journey, ma'am.

199
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,406
Mom.

200
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:57,782
Are you listening?

201
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,870
My head is killing me.

202
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,582
Ji-han is an expert in his field.

203
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,751
His explanation must have been
hard to keep up.

204
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,461
Did I go in too deep?

205
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,672
To sum it up,

206
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,676
we have a comprehensive perception
of the consumers of the beauty market

207
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,012
- with a future-oriented--
- Here's the deal.

208
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,305
Simply put,

209
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,891
we'll have all kinds of
beauty services you can imagine,

210
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,810
such as plastic surgery,
cosmetics, spa, gym, and diet food.

211
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,271
Everything you need to be beautiful...

212
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,148
Crammed into one building?

213
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,486
We actually prefer to call it

214
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,863
a hybrid smart-care solution--

215
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,700
And where do you plan on executing
that grand plan of yours?

216
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,500
In the gym building.

217
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,087
You said it'd be mine when I got married.

218
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,964
He cheated on you.

219
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,633
With Grace, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is.

220
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,221
Who?

221
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,933
Right, Grace.

222
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:09,104
I only met her a few times
to promote my clinic.

223
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:13,108
Has Dong-hee told you
what runs in our family?

224
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,320
- Pardon?
- You haven't earned her trust, have you?

225
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,200
Even the man I trusted
to share my dreams with my whole life

226
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,703
turned out to have different priorities.

227
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:27,163
I'm surrounded by frauds

228
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,499
inside and outside of the family.

229
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:30,667
What?

230
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,918
Me?

231
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,428
Will you wait outside, Ji-han?

232
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:52,564
You're out of line, Mom.

233
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,109
Your dad already gave me a headache.

234
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,402
Don't make it worse.

235
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,445
What did he do?

236
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,658
He's not really on a trip, is he?

237
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:05,827
Makes sense.

238
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:08,371
He must've been desperate
for some breathing room.

239
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,831
I get him 200%.

240
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:11,332
What?

241
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,585
Everyone tiptoes around you
because of your dreams.

242
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,420
How do you not know that?

243
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,675
I even gave up on my own dream
just to live yours.

244
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:23,053
You gave up on your dream because of me?

245
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,055
Have you forgotten?

246
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,891
How you stepped all over my dream?

247
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,394
You told me to drop everything
and get married.

248
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:35,023
You told me to have a grandchild
to pass down our legacy.

249
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,568
I'm realizing your outdated dream,
so keep your end of the bargain.

250
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,236
You promised me 50 billion won.

251
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:43,281
Why do you think
I'm working my butt off to lose weight?

252
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,700
Have you even lost weight?

253
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,874
You don't even see me, do you?

254
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:54,584
Dong-hee!

255
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:56,211
I'll make your dream come true.

256
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,546
I'll start a family,

257
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,673
just like you wanted.

258
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,718
Then I'll finally be free from your grasp.

259
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,029
PAST DUE NOTICE

260
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,823
PAST DUE REMINDER

261
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:48,596
Excuse me, ma'am.

262
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,348
You haven't paid.

263
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,183
Sorry?

264
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,185
I mean...

265
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,314
Did that swindler leave without paying?

266
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,826
Your credit card won't go through.

267
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,995
Do you have another one?

268
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,833
Here, use this one.

269
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,090
Fancy seeing you here.

270
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,009
I was meeting some friends here.

271
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:31,097
My goodness.

272
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,057
Have you been losing sleep again?

273
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,186
You look awful. Are you all right?

274
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,997
The number you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

275
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,416
Please leave a message after the tone.

276
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,159
PURPLE DISCO

277
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,799
She used to pretend to be so innocent.

278
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:01,813
Sorry, I didn't see you.

279
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:02,730
Are you okay?

280
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,274
You should look where you're going.

281
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,775
Watch her flip out again.

282
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,902
Just like she did with Hye-rim.

283
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:10,947
Seriously? That's so scary.

284
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,284
She has a guy who looks like a thug
watching her back.

285
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:16,661
- How does she know a thug?
- Is it her dad?

286
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,955
Is her dad a gangster?

287
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:24,627
Where are you going?

288
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,380
Stop teasing her, guys.

289
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,464
Enough is enough.

290
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,091
Are you okay, I-na?

291
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,220
Are you okay, Hye-rim?

292
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,430
There she goes again.

293
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,057
- She's crazy.
- You should go to the nurse's office.

294
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:46,983
Hello, sir.

295
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:51,612
Sorry?

296
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,659
I-na is missing?

297
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,536
She left the school without permission.

298
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,246
Have you called her?

299
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,706
Her phone's turned off.

300
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:03,958
- What?
- It's broken.

301
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,295
It's broken, not turned off.

302
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:09,005
Her phone.

303
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,008
First, her glasses break,

304
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:14,343
and now, it's her phone?

305
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:17,180
No way.

306
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,766
Is she being bullied?

307
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:24,520
I know a few places she might be.

308
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,942
Welcome.

309
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:34,280
I heard she had malatang with her friends.

310
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,449
Instant noodles are the best
for solo dining.

311
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,826
"Solo dining"?

312
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,329
It means eating alone.

313
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:43,623
You know that, don't you?

314
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,420
Hi, can I ask you something?

315
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,506
- How long have you been tailing her?
- Have you seen her?

316
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:52,840
You're her dad.

317
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,218
- This is something you should know.
- I'm not sure.

318
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:56,928
Thank you.

319
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:16,989
I need a pick-me-up.

320
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,428
- Welcome.
- Hello.

321
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,806
I need to ask you something.

322
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:45,685
- Have you seen this girl?
- I-na's favorite is dirty iced tea.

323
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:48,813
Dirty iced tea?

324
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:51,315
Iced tea with a shot of espresso.

325
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,193
But she's too young for caffeine.

326
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,697
Does she hang out with kids
who act like adults?

327
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,740
She's usually alone.

328
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:32,356
What does I-na usually do here?

329
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,152
Does she ride a bike or something?

330
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:39,030
She doesn't know how to ride.

331
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:44,911
She plays with her phone.

332
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,454
Alone.

333
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,834
She hides behind her phone

334
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,294
to avoid eye contact.

335
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,466
She's probably hiding somewhere right now.

336
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,219
This was the last place I could think of.

337
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,807
Could it be the sauna lady's doing?

338
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,312
I'll check the sauna.

339
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:23,741
You should check your home.

340
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:25,952
She might have come back.

341
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:48,975
Is someone in there?

342
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,351
She's a VIP.

343
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:53,980
Was it you?

344
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:56,190
Where did you find her?

345
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:57,984
Picked her up on the street.

346
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,319
What are you planning?

347
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:02,738
She just fell asleep.

348
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,533
Get out of the way.

349
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,632
What is she doing here?

350
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:23,426
Is she really asleep?

351
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:27,054
She was severely sleep-deprived.

352
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,266
I tried to take her to the hospital,

353
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,184
but she'd rather die than take medicine.

354
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,521
Are you sure you didn't drug her?

355
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:39,608
As far as I remember,
you were the one who drugged her.

356
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,322
Listen.

357
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:47,658
I just want to see you and Gwi-ju
being happy together.

358
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,328
I mean it.

359
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:53,080
I only brought Ms. Bok here
so we could bond.

360
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:58,753
But I guess my daughter is
too immature to understand,

361
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,380
given how she stole the golden egg

362
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,091
and gave it to the Bok family.

363
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,302
Gwi-ju gave me that

364
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,597
so I could pay off my debts.

365
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,434
I could've left you if I wanted to.

366
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:15,353
So why didn't you?

367
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:18,189
I guess you've grown on me.

368
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,028
You think my debt was keeping me here,

369
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:25,821
but you're wrong.

370
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:27,782
Nothing kept me here.

371
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:30,159
I decided to stay with you.

372
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,745
- Really?
- Yes.

373
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:36,999
I felt sorry for you.

374
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:40,419
Really?

375
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,672
You wanted to keep me around so badly
that you used money as a leash.

376
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:49,011
You thought suffocating me
was the only way to keep me around.

377
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,723
It was pitiful.

378
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:57,269
You must miss your dead daughter a lot.

379
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:00,856
Probably why you're so desperate
to keep me close.

380
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,860
That's why I stayed with you
and called you Mom.

381
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,363
Sometimes, you actually felt like a mom.

382
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:10,157
And I thought you thought of me

383
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:13,577
as your daughter,
or at least a stand-in for your daughter.

384
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,663
But I guess that's not the case.

385
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:19,333
You didn't keep me around to be with me.

386
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:23,045
You just wanted to walk all over me.

387
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:25,589
If that's what you want,

388
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:27,383
fine.

389
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:30,261
I won't...

390
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:34,140
be your daughter anymore.

391
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,433
And then what?

392
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:39,895
Do Da-hae!

393
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,566
Do you not care what happens to our guest?

394
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,325
Stay away from the Bok family.

395
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:58,330
Or I'll make your life miserable
with everything you taught me.

396
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,207
In the cruelest way possible.

397
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,752
How could you say that to me?

398
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:05,963
I learned from the best.

399
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:10,551
Hyeong-tae!

400
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:14,638
Why are you just standing there?

401
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,084
Have you found her?

402
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,002
She didn't come home.

403
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,297
It'll be dark soon.

404
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,174
Have you tried going back in time?

405
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:33,884
I wasn't with you

406
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,053
around the time she went missing.

407
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:42,184
You should at least look for clues
in different times.

408
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,521
Can you go back
to a time you were with her?

409
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,940
Or is that still not possible?

410
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,150
I exactly haven't spent...

411
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,445
too much time with her.

412
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:56,407
I wish I could go back and find out

413
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,159
what she was going through alone

414
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:01,912
and why she's hiding.

415
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:17,845
What is it?

416
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:23,392
That's...

417
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:24,643
I-na's birthday.

418
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,064
I hope you can see it now.

419
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,068
There are others who need your help.

420
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,117
Wait.

421
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,244
What is it?

422
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,162
You're here.

423
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:47,583
I am?

424
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,921
I-na's in the gym at school.

425
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,797
- We have to hurry.
- Okay.

426
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,935
Hey, guys.

427
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,520
Do you know
why Jun-woo quit the dance club?

428
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,897
I thought his mom told him to.

429
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,815
I shouldn't tell,

430
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,527
but he asked someone out in the club

431
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,904
and got turned down.

432
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:18,489
For real? Who?

433
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:20,324
Who do you think?

434
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:22,576
No way.

435
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:26,455
It wasn't me.

436
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,000
Who else would be in Jun-woo's league

437
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,669
other than Hye-rim?

438
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:32,586
I knew it.

439
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:34,838
No wonder he's been so down.

440
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,548
What a bitch.

441
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,300
How could she break Jun-woo's heart?

442
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,594
We can't do a show without him.

443
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:41,637
We're screwed.

444
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:43,347
- We should just cancel it.
- Totally.

445
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:45,099
- Let's just eat.
- Yeah.

446
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,186
Come eat with us, Hye-rim.

447
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,479
Hurry, or it'll get soggy.

448
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:53,440
- Come join us.
- Come before I finish everything.

449
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,484
Is there no fish cake in this tteokbokki?

450
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,403
Jun-hui ate all of it.

451
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:00,280
- You're so greedy.
- I wish there was more.

452
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,574
I'm so full.

453
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,201
You ate so much.

454
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:06,203
You ate the most, Jun-hui.

455
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,080
What are you talking about?

456
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,582
Let's just get going.
We don't want to be late.

457
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,336
Last one there cleans up!

458
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:15,587
Wait for me!

459
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,638
Someone's in here.

460
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,766
Hello?

461
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:12,269
I'm locked in here.

462
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:16,648
Hello?

463
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:41,507
I'm...

464
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:45,427
I'm here.

465
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,306
I'm right here.

466
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:51,642
I-na.

467
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:10,494
I-na! Bok I-na! Dad's here!

468
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:12,162
Dad's here, I-na!

469
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:14,748
The doors are locked.

470
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:16,166
We need to call someone.

471
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,334
- I'm here for you!
- I-na.

472
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:20,045
- We'll be right there. Don't worry.
- You!

473
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,632
What's going on here?

474
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:27,052
Excuse me, sir.
A student's locked in here.

475
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:30,097
I made sure no one was here
before locking up.

476
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:32,182
See? No one's here.

477
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,359
- I-na.
- Dad?

478
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,830
You're okay now.

479
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,540
Hello.

480
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,715
Why were you there?

481
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:07,050
Who locked you in?

482
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,763
Answer me.

483
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,473
What happened at school?

484
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,018
Can I drop out of school?

485
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:17,978
What?

486
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:23,483
Why?

487
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,444
Tell me.

488
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:28,780
There are too many eyes.

489
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:32,201
What?

490
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:34,828
Eyes?

491
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:37,789
I-na.

492
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:56,767
It's all your fault.

493
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:00,270
Me?

494
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,190
I wish I stayed invisible.

495
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,277
Did you read a friend's mind?

496
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:11,281
I wanted her to like me.

497
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:14,826
I wanted to understand her.

498
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,122
I don't know what went wrong.

499
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:23,877
How does that make you feel?

500
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,175
No one will know how you feel
if you don't tell them.

501
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:34,888
Not everyone has a superpower.

502
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:37,015
I don't know how I feel either.

503
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,977
You can read everyone else's mind.

504
00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:41,812
How can you not know how you feel?

505
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,232
I looked into my own eyes,

506
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,152
hoping to figure out how I felt.

507
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:54,157
But...

508
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,287
I couldn't hear anything.

509
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,387
I used to be invisible too.

510
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:19,558
In high school,

511
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:22,686
I got locked inside the storage.

512
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:24,980
But no one...

513
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,525
even noticed I was there.

514
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:31,653
And then a fire broke out.

515
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,370
It would've been the perfect ending
for an invisible girl.

516
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,790
I was about to disappear
without anyone knowing.

517
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:45,709
But then

518
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,920
someone ran through the flames

519
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,923
just to find me.

520
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:57,220
I thought I was invisible,
but someone saw me.

521
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:00,724
Who was the person

522
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:02,934
who saved you?

523
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,403
I don't know.

524
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,368
But I know this.

525
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,203
You have someone like that.

526
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:25,207
Someone who'd run through flames
just to find you.

527
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:34,424
And when they come looking for you,

528
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,260
don't be so afraid of them.

529
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,554
What you heard

530
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,557
might be just a tiny piece

531
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,894
of everyone's mind.

532
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:52,567
You know, like a fleeting emotion.

533
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:01,993
What did she say?

534
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,162
Who did that to her?

535
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,789
Don't push her too hard.

536
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,042
Don't ask her questions.

537
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:10,502
Just...

538
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,504
look at her eyes.

539
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,883
- Her eyes?
- Don't say anything.

540
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:20,804
Just look into her eyes.

541
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,027
Your messy iced tea.

542
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,281
You mean "dirty."

543
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:44,327
Just drink it.

544
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:45,996
I'm good.

545
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:47,998
Take it.

546
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:49,791
No, it's too late for--

547
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:02,387
Let me clean those.

548
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,430
Stop it!

549
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,335
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:39,841
For leaving you on your own.

551
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,013
You must've been scared...

552
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,976
and lonely.

553
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,066
I hope it's not too late for me
to be by your side.

554
00:43:02,906 --> 00:43:06,535
I'm not entirely sure how to do this.

555
00:43:08,078 --> 00:43:09,371
I'm a bit lost.

556
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,376
But I'll do my best.

557
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,087
From now on,

558
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:18,838
I'll try

559
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:21,258
to spend more time with you.

560
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:25,178
Now you say that?

561
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,643
I'll do whatever it takes
to find my way back...

562
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:35,021
to the moment you were born.

563
00:43:36,356 --> 00:43:37,232
What for?

564
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:42,153
When I held you for the first time...

565
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:44,614
It was...

566
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:49,369
the best moment of my life.

567
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:54,165
You mean the worst moment.

568
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,922
I-na, did you just...

569
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,968
That moment took you away.

570
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:07,887
Hold on.

571
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,390
Do you hear this?

572
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,267
Can you hear me?

573
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:18,815
Yes.

574
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:21,610
What was that?

575
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,653
How did you do that?

576
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:27,490
Your eyes.

577
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:31,077
My eyes?

578
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:32,996
Is that why you avoid eye contact?

579
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:34,956
When did it begin?

580
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,042
Why have you been hiding it?

581
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,336
Why didn't you tell anyone
you had a superpower?

582
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,755
Because I wished it would go away.

583
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:47,552
The moment that took you away...

584
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:54,142
It took Mom away too.

585
00:44:54,976 --> 00:44:56,102
I-na.

586
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,231
Do you want to move to a prettier house?

587
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,608
What about Daddy?

588
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:03,777
Daddy...

589
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:07,697
can't come with us.

590
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,411
This is your fault.

591
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:16,873
It's because you were born on that day.

592
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,545
Because I was born?

593
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:24,881
What?

594
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:29,636
Should I never have been born?

595
00:45:30,136 --> 00:45:31,221
I-na.

596
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:35,809
- I-na.
- Where did you learn to drive?

597
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:00,959
I-na.

598
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:08,466
It's all my fault.

599
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:11,886
People should be allowed...

600
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:15,849
to hide their feelings.

601
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,143
I bet Mom

602
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:20,895
and my friends

603
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:24,274
didn't want me to know.

604
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:27,986
But...

605
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,989
I just had to hear their thoughts.

606
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,617
I'm a monster!

607
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:39,080
- No.
- I never should have been born.

608
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,582
No, I-na.

609
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:43,918
It's not your fault.

610
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:52,886
It's not your fault.

611
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:02,228
I shouldn't have...

612
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:06,149
let you keep...

613
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,361
all of this to yourself.

614
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,239
It's my fault.

615
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:15,950
I'm so sorry.

616
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,829
I was so stupid.

617
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:28,171
The moment you were born...

618
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:31,299
You have no idea...

619
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,596
how much that moment means to me.

620
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:34,571
Mom.

621
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:37,490
Mom.

622
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,325
You still have me.

623
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:43,121
I'll be your lead actress from now on.

624
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,457
No more stupid melodramas.

625
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,835
How about something a bit more sexy?

626
00:48:51,337 --> 00:48:53,506
Bok Don't Eat lost a ton of weight.

627
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,968
I'll get her in perfect shape,

628
00:48:56,968 --> 00:49:00,054
fit her into a wedding dress,
and bring home 50 billion won.

629
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:02,974
Problem solved, right?

630
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:06,060
I don't think so.

631
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:07,770
What?

632
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:12,567
Ms. Bok woke up.

633
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,333
You sure are gutsy.

634
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,918
You slept like a baby in a den of frauds.

635
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,796
This place must have good energy.

636
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:37,342
I had a vivid dream
the last time I was here too.

637
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,385
Did you have a nice dream?

638
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,182
You said you had a daughter, right?

639
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,893
She died young.

640
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,020
What about her?

641
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:52,315
I think she's alive.

642
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:56,527
- What?
- In my dream,

643
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,989
you were crying,

644
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:03,826
holding your grown-up daughter.

645
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:08,122
You said you were relieved
that she was alive.

646
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:12,960
Her daughter who died
while she was in prison?

647
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,380
She's her only weakness.

648
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:19,759
But she mentioned her
the first time we met.

649
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:22,261
How can that be her weakness?

650
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,806
It's no longer a weakness
once it's out in the open.

651
00:50:24,806 --> 00:50:26,516
It becomes a weapon.

652
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:31,270
My mom will come at you no matter what,

653
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,980
so you have to strike first.

654
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:35,817
Take advantage of her weakness,

655
00:50:36,317 --> 00:50:37,777
and she's bound to be swayed.

656
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,407
That way, you'll gain the upper hand.

657
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,329
Did you follow me here

658
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,456
just to pull something like this?

659
00:50:50,456 --> 00:50:53,251
I'm just telling you
what I saw in my dream.

660
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,253
Just like I did at the wedding.

661
00:51:55,396 --> 00:51:56,355
Keep moving.

662
00:51:57,732 --> 00:51:58,733
What are you doing?

663
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:00,818
Getting you into a wedding dress.

664
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,156
A wedding dress?

665
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:08,534
Let's...

666
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:13,039
put that dress on.

667
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,177
Forget that.

668
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:29,931
Get me some water.

669
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,371
Here.

670
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:08,386
Are you hoping to get some crumbs
off my 50 billion won?

671
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:09,387
I'll help you.

672
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:12,473
So don't hog it all.

673
00:53:17,186 --> 00:53:19,856
I guess you're not totally useless.

674
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:23,901
I lose my appetite when I see your face.

675
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:30,157
If you think about it,
we have a lot in common.

676
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:34,579
We're both extras
in our families, aren't we?

677
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,873
- We're clearly not the favorites.
- Hey.

678
00:53:37,456 --> 00:53:40,209
Don't put us in the same category.

679
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:56,767
Hey.

680
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,270
Why don't we fly together?

681
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:02,857
Together?

682
00:54:06,027 --> 00:54:07,028
Fly with me.

683
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,113
Just once.

684
00:54:17,163 --> 00:54:19,415
Careful.

685
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:26,255
Slowly. Be careful.

686
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,393
Careful.

687
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,604
- Careful.
- Wait, Dad.

688
00:54:49,946 --> 00:54:51,405
You got it.

689
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:05,753
You did it!

690
00:55:07,046 --> 00:55:08,089
Keep going, I-na!

691
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:11,217
I did it!

692
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:15,763
I did it!

693
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:17,264
Keep going, I-na!

694
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:18,808
Keep going!

695
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:23,396
Look at her go.

696
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:31,570
Keep going!

697
00:55:36,826 --> 00:55:37,827
I-na!

698
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,052
Wait, I-na.

699
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:11,736
Do you hate me that much?

700
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,164
I wanted to give you these.

701
00:56:39,138 --> 00:56:40,139
I'm sorry.

702
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:42,975
I've been trying my best.

703
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,145
I've been trying not to talk to you

704
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:48,522
and not to go near you at school.

705
00:56:48,522 --> 00:56:49,857
And it's been killing me.

706
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:54,070
But I'll keep trying.

707
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,947
I'll try to avoid you as much as I can,

708
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:00,159
so don't run away.

709
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:09,543
I like you.

710
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:15,257
What?

711
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:24,141
I like you.

712
00:57:28,604 --> 00:57:29,814
You knew, didn't you?

713
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:31,857
About I-na's powers.

714
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:37,822
Yeah.

715
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:39,031
Thanks.

716
00:57:39,615 --> 00:57:40,741
Thanks to you,

717
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:43,786
I saved her this time.

718
00:57:46,956 --> 00:57:47,957
Maybe.

719
00:58:00,803 --> 00:58:01,762
By the way,

720
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:04,348
earlier...

721
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:10,187
when you came from the future...

722
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,190
- We have to hurry.
- Okay.

723
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,044
You seemed a little sad.

724
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,554
Another happy moment

725
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,223
for you to relive over and over again.

726
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:48,601
Absolutely.

727
00:58:49,935 --> 00:58:52,480
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

728
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,107
or whenever she leaves my side

729
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:57,234
to hang out with her boyfriend.

730
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,447
I-na.

731
00:59:02,323 --> 00:59:03,407
You're so pretty.

732
00:59:05,993 --> 00:59:07,661
Guess you'll be back all the time.

733
00:59:08,204 --> 00:59:09,788
All the time.

734
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,209
No matter how much time passes,

735
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:16,504
I'll never let go

736
00:59:18,297 --> 00:59:19,924
of the moment you came to me, I-na.

737
00:59:23,636 --> 00:59:25,763
This is the happiest moment of my life.

738
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:29,683
It's the one

739
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:31,936
that I'll never lose.

740
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:36,899
I finally found my way back
to the moment I-na was born.

741
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:40,694
It was such a precious and happy moment.

742
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:43,155
I don't know why it took me so long.

743
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,207
No!

744
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:11,892
I found it.

745
01:00:17,523 --> 01:00:19,066
Where did you go?

746
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,611
To the happy moment

747
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:25,239
that I had to recover...

748
01:00:28,117 --> 01:00:29,952
for both I-na and me.

749
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:39,086
The moment I-na was born.

750
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,846
Now it's time to save you

751
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:51,599
using that happiness.

752
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:00,441
Not that again.

753
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,778
Will you stop saying that?

754
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,281
Why would you go back in time and save me

755
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,199
when I'm alive and well?

756
01:01:10,242 --> 01:01:11,410
What's the point?

757
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,123
Do you still not get it?

758
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,835
Because I do.

759
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:32,723
It's to meet you 13 years after that.

760
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:34,892
To meet you

761
01:01:36,185 --> 01:01:37,561
and fall in love with you.

762
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:58,165
PURPLE DISCO

763
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:01,335
- Honey!
- Who are you looking for, ma'am?

764
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:03,045
Honey!

765
01:02:03,796 --> 01:02:05,631
Honey!

766
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:08,467
Come out, Um Sun-gu!

767
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,386
Honey!

768
01:02:10,386 --> 01:02:11,720
- Honey!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

769
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,805
Honey!

770
01:02:12,805 --> 01:02:14,640
- Come out, honey!
- Don't cause a scene, ma'am.

771
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,727
- You can't do this, ma'am.
- Sun-gu, come on out!

772
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,438
Honey!

773
01:02:22,481 --> 01:02:23,482
Honey.

774
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:25,526
Gwi-ju...

775
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:28,445
Our Gwi-ju...

776
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:30,114
What?

777
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,741
Gwi-ju...

778
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:35,494
He's going to die.

779
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,833
Gwi-ju is going to die.

780
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:45,754
Gwi-ju is going to die...

781
01:02:45,754 --> 01:02:46,714
Stop it.

782
01:02:49,216 --> 01:02:51,301
Focus on protecting your family.

783
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:54,847
I will.

784
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:56,348
I'll protect them with my life.

785
01:02:58,058 --> 01:02:59,226
And that family...

786
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:01,937
includes you.

787
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:17,244
This is the ring I put on your finger
13 years ago.

788
01:03:24,376 --> 01:03:25,669
It's the same ring...

789
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:31,049
I'll put on your finger someday.

790
01:04:13,342 --> 01:04:15,135
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

791
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,415
There's only one thing we can do.

792
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:49,878
Keeping him happy
for as long as he's around.

793
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,549
How can I stay by his side,
knowing he'll die because of me?

794
01:04:53,549 --> 01:04:55,509
I can't do that.

795
01:04:55,509 --> 01:04:57,928
Why did you have to
have a dream like that?

796
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:01,932
Don't you think you're being punished
for your own greed?

797
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,143
I thought you had superpowers.

798
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:07,646
What were you doing?

799
01:05:08,522 --> 01:05:11,441
Why couldn't you save her?

800
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:12,818
I'm sure

801
01:05:13,694 --> 01:05:15,654
I'll come back to this moment someday.

802
01:05:20,492 --> 01:05:22,286
I'm really happy right now.

803
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:30,794
