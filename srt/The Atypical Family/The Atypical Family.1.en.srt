1
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,251
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:47,480
Bok Dong-hee.

3
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:48,898
Fly.

4
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,463
Bok Gwi-ju.

5
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:14,882
Go back to the past.

6
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:23,182
Close your eyes.

7
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,642
Come on.

8
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:31,649
Hey, don't.

9
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:32,817
Bok I-na.

10
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:34,443
It's your turn.

11
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:37,154
You're in middle school now.

12
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:40,324
It's about time you proved yourself.

13
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:46,539
Your grandma's a bit cranky
because she didn't sleep very well.

14
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,168
What about you, Mom?

15
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,504
I can't even get a glimpse
of the future anymore.

16
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,464
The Bok family is doomed

17
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:57,550
unless we recover what we've lost.

18
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,803
We might as well

19
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:03,055
all jump into the sea.

20
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,266
Honey!

21
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,231
You should eat before you jump.

22
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,276
I hear the fish here is amazing.

23
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:02,239
It all just seems so bleak!

24
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:07,328
If the future seems so bleak
with your foresight,

25
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,455
you should be the first to jump.

26
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,999
We should be fighting for our lives,

27
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,251
not worrying about dying.

28
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:16,295
We must do whatever it takes to go back

29
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,380
to the times when we were our true selves.

30
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,300
We used to be able to go back
to the good old days

31
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,635
in the blink of an eye.

32
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,179
Let's go back to the way we used to be!

33
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,729
Did he go back in time?

34
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,402
Help! Someone's drowning!

35
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,571
Someone's drowning over there!

36
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,281
That is a person, right?

37
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,826
Hey, it is!

38
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,244
Someone's drowning here!

39
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,246
Somebody help!

40
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,602
"The good old days"?

41
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,951
What do we do?

42
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,123
Oh my gosh.

43
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,625
He's not breathing.

44
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,918
Is he dead?

45
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,630
Is he alive? Someone do something!

46
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,014
Hey, wake up.

47
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,163
Hey.

48
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,339
Se-yeon.

49
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,468
Se-yeon.

50
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,304
- Gwi-ju!
- Slow down.

51
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:21,188
Are you okay?

52
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:34,576
Gwi-ju.

53
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:35,703
Gwi-ju!

54
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:40,708
Thank you, doctor.

55
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,465
Why would you jump into the sea?

56
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:50,968
I didn't. It was an accident.

57
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:52,886
Yeah.

58
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,347
That's what I told I-na.

59
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,018
That her drunk dad
suddenly felt like snorkeling.

60
00:06:59,018 --> 00:06:59,935
Watch it.

61
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,655
At least you're okay.

62
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,574
Be more careful from now on.

63
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,674
I didn't even get her number.

64
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,801
Ms. Bok has an appointment today.

65
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,178
The insomnia lady?

66
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,138
I heard she'll tip anyone a million won

67
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:38,515
- to get her to sleep on the massage bed.
- Dream on.

68
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,060
There's no way anyone is getting that tip.

69
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,604
"When did you open this bottle of oil?"

70
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,731
"It might have gone bad
in this hot weather."

71
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,608
And when she sees it's fine, she goes,

72
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:50,486
"How can it not have gone bad
in this weather?"

73
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,446
"It must be loaded with preservatives."

74
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,365
"There's no way this is natural oil."

75
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:55,783
It just goes on and on.

76
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,242
Can't she just take sleeping pills?

77
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,495
That prejudiced old woman?

78
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:02,206
She's too worried
about dependency and side effects

79
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,457
to take drugs like that.

80
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,125
Yikes. I'm not taking her.

81
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,752
- Neither am I.
- Me neither.

82
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,087
I don't want to either.

83
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,550
Someone's gonna have to.

84
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,219
Well?

85
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:16,887
Should I do it myself?

86
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,644
Would it be okay if I treated her?

87
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:25,979
Newbie.

88
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,065
I know you're good, Da-hae,

89
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,192
but you've been doing all the hard work.

90
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:31,902
Are you sure about this?

91
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,196
How else will I learn?

92
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,204
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

93
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,664
I'm Do Da-hae.

94
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,083
Would you like a cup of tea?

95
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,795
If it's one of those tasteless
herbal teas, no, thank you.

96
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,090
I made it using medicinal herbs
from Mount Jiri.

97
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,717
I love hiking.

98
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,264
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

99
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,809
These herbs are
supposed to help with that.

100
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,069
I guess it doesn't smell too bad.

101
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:18,657
Were you recently on a trip?

102
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,994
Your skin seems rough and reddish.

103
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:29,084
I'll go get some oils
that help soothe damaged skin.

104
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,776
You're quite strong.

105
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,320
Should I be more gentle?

106
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,780
No, this is fine.

107
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,366
I know there are many good oils
and products out there,

108
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,036
but I believe it's all in the hands.

109
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:05,621
I agree.

110
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:14,755
I like to think of my hands
as the carriers of energy.

111
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,549
Most of our clients come here

112
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,677
because they're tired
and want to feel rejuvenated.

113
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,639
That's why I go to the sea

114
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,265
or to the mountains

115
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,643
whenever I have time.

116
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:29,770
To absorb all the good energy

117
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:34,024
and deliver it with my hands.

118
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,776
I see.

119
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:42,157
I've been feeling heavy
like my body was being weighed down.

120
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,912
But your massage feels like no other.

121
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:51,792
I can sense a special energy
emanating from your fingertips.

122
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,212
It's something
you couldn't find in my family.

123
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,422
What might that be?

124
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:58,715
Good health.

125
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,095
Good health?

126
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,055
Yes, good health.

127
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:10,143
It's what my family needs
more than anything.

128
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,443
Are we already done?

129
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,822
You're up, Ms. Bok.

130
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:23,782
Did I fall asleep?

131
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,367
No way.

132
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,663
Goodness. How long was I out for?

133
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,877
Thank you, ma'am.

134
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,841
What's the name of the therapist
who treated me earlier?

135
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:43,677
Here she comes.

136
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:48,140
- It's Do Da-hae, ma'am.
- I see.

137
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,517
Hold on.

138
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,441
It was you, wasn't it?

139
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,276
At the beach the other day.

140
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:02,696
Gwi-ju!

141
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:06,658
I did go to a beach recently.

142
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,410
It was you.

143
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,413
My goodness.
I can't believe I found you here.

144
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:14,750
I've been looking for you.

145
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,418
I'm not sure I follow.

146
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,587
When my son jumped into the sea...

147
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,882
Your son jumped into the sea?

148
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:22,841
Right.

149
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:26,720
Did I help your son
get his shoes out of the water?

150
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,638
Exactly.

151
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,892
- He's very fond of those shoes.
- Yes.

152
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,685
Please take this.

153
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,146
Wait a second. This won't do.

154
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:42,736
You really don't have to.

155
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,696
You probably couldn't sleep comfortably.

156
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:48,492
You can only be so comfortable
on a bed that's not your own.

157
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:52,329
Would you visit me at home then?

158
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:02,214
You do house calls, don't you?

159
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,592
Yes, of course.

160
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:12,557
I'll see you at your home, ma'am.

161
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,330
Hello, Ms. Bok.

162
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,165
It's Do Da-hae from Illusion Spa.

163
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:30,677
Hello?

164
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,923
Ms. Bok?

165
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,110
Welcome.

166
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,950
Hi, it's good to see you.

167
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,576
- This way, please.
- Okay.

168
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,281
What a beautiful garden.

169
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,949
Do you take care of it yourself?

170
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,775
Do not come out under any circumstances.

171
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,703
Would you like a cup of tea?

172
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,041
One minute, please.

173
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,445
Excuse me.

174
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,076
Do you need a hand?

175
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:49,167
The electric opener
should be here somewhere.

176
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:11,731
It can't be safe to leave it like that.

177
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,696
Damn it.

178
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,783
I'll open it for you.

179
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,203
Forget it.

180
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,135
See?

181
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,220
I told you it wasn't safe.

182
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:51,646
Just leave it.

183
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,148
Please don't move.

184
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:54,607
You'll hurt yourself.

185
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:55,984
And you seem drunk.

186
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:58,194
My goodness.

187
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,031
What happened?

188
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,700
Did you do this, Gwi-ju?

189
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,617
Are you okay?

190
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,497
Wait a second.

191
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,051
All right.

192
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,095
It's okay now.

193
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,223
My, thank you so much.

194
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:29,100
You helped him again.

195
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,897
Have you said hello yet?

196
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,487
She's the lady who saved you.

197
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:41,863
Ms. Do Da-hae.

198
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:43,323
Isn't that such a pretty name?

199
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,493
This is my son, Bok Gwi-ju.

200
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,454
Goodness, you're a mess.

201
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,999
It's good to know that you're doing okay.

202
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,754
You must be here to collect your reward.

203
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,298
This lady here will pay you.

204
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,969
That's no way to talk
to the person who saved you.

205
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,054
Bok Gwi-ju.

206
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:07,013
Excuse me.

207
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,807
Gwi-ju!

208
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,724
Wait.

209
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,476
Gwi-ju!

210
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:22,922
Your parents must be very proud.

211
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:25,466
They have such a great daughter.

212
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,803
They both passed away.

213
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,514
Oh my.

214
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,224
I'm so sorry.

215
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:34,893
Anyone else in your family?

216
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,395
I'm on my own.

217
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:40,064
I used to be married,

218
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,483
but it didn't work out.

219
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,110
But you're so young.

220
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,909
I've actually been married twice.

221
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:53,369
How come?

222
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:02,462
Babe, guess what I have
prepared for you tonight.

223
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,548
Ta-da...

224
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,510
Babe.

225
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:12,138
My first husband

226
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,308
cheated on me every chance he had.

227
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,977
I said stop running!

228
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,983
My second husband

229
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,069
turned into a different person

230
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:27,904
whenever he got drunk.

231
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:34,827
I was too eager.

232
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:37,497
I really wanted a family.

233
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,251
Is that so?

234
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:45,838
Actually,

235
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,968
my son, Gwi-ju,
has been in and out of a marriage too.

236
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:52,762
His wife died in an accident.

237
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,975
It was a long time ago.

238
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:00,311
He got married in his early twenties

239
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:02,188
when he didn't know any better,

240
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:05,400
so his marriage
wasn't exactly smooth sailing.

241
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,904
And yet, he can't seem to
get over his loss to this day.

242
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:14,450
I guess that's just
how dedicated he is to love.

243
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,339
I'm home.

244
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,759
I'm sorry I'm late.

245
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,179
Where's the lady who saved Gwi-ju?

246
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,222
She left.

247
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,099
Did you not ask her to stay for dinner?

248
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,934
But...

249
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,729
I bought a ton of groceries.

250
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,689
She left as soon as we were done,

251
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,983
saying she had a client waiting.

252
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:49,986
PALACE SAUNA

253
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:52,530
I'm so tired from waking up so early.

254
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,955
She's lost her loved ones,

255
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:02,957
just like Gwi-ju has.

256
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,961
Mom.

257
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:08,504
I'm hungry.

258
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:10,548
Welcome.

259
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,676
- Please hurry up.
- Okay. Thank you.

260
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:17,138
Hey, I'm busy.
Just eat some instant noodles.

261
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,765
Fine.

262
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,143
She's no junk food.

263
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,313
She's like homemade food, so to speak.

264
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:15,238
She's not like Gwi-ju,
who can't move on from his past.

265
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:20,535
Even after getting hurt by people,

266
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:24,372
she still seems to
dream of having a family.

267
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,292
Are you sure you're not just

268
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,670
intrigued by the fact
that she's all on her own?

269
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,799
Because no one will
come knocking on our door

270
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,467
even if something happened to her?

271
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,304
That's why you chose me.

272
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,340
This is new.

273
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,968
You were sleeping like a baby.

274
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:21,179
I was almost worried
because you wouldn't wake up.

275
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:22,805
I had a dream.

276
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:25,141
- A dream?
- It was all blurry,

277
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:28,269
so I couldn't get a good look at anything.

278
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,730
But you haven't had a dream in forever.

279
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,690
You should be grateful
that you had one at all.

280
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:37,904
What did you see?

281
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:40,156
I saw that woman. Do Da-hae.

282
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:43,242
She was wearing our family ring.

283
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:44,577
No way.

284
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:46,037
I'm positive.

285
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:50,791
She's the savior who's come
to restore all of our powers.

286
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:55,046
I should officially invite her
this Saturday.

287
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:14,523
Hey, I-na.

288
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:16,901
About this Saturday.

289
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,071
If there's...

290
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,617
anything you want or need,

291
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:27,703
please let me...

292
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:35,711
Hey.

293
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:37,129
By the way...

294
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,424
I didn't...

295
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:43,719
jump into the water that day.

296
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:47,431
Okay.

297
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:21,465
Excuse me.

298
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:26,929
Sorry.

299
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:46,532
Excuse me.

300
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:48,492
Aren't you the owner of The Bok's Gym?

301
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:51,162
I heard you were hiring personal trainers.

302
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:58,961
RÉSUMÉ

303
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,340
You can start tomorrow.

304
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:04,300
Just like that?

305
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:08,054
It's all about looks, isn't it?

306
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:16,354
A personal trainer needs more than looks.

307
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,608
May I have a look at that?

308
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,193
Who are you?

309
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,154
I'm the owner of this building.

310
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,576
Well, soon-to-be.

311
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,788
"Summer Hot Body Contest..."

312
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:38,626
A home workout channel with...

313
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,588
Hold on. 300,000 subscribers?

314
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,256
I'm pretty famous in that field.

315
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:53,724
I heard you can
buy subscribers these days.

316
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,149
You're famous too, right?

317
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:07,113
- No, I'm not.
- I think you are.

318
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,240
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

319
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:12,952
You're mistaken.

320
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,621
You run a mukbang channel, don't you?

321
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:16,956
It is you.

322
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:21,377
No wonder the sound of you
eating chips was so appealing.

323
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,296
So nice to meet you.

324
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:25,673
I'll see you tomorrow.

325
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,467
Ms. Mukbang Babe.

326
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,513
That little...

327
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,443
How come you're at work?

328
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:49,780
The business would be better off
if you stayed home.

329
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,323
How come you're at the gym?

330
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:54,076
Did you mistake it for a snack bar?

331
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:56,871
This will be
the last bag of chips I ever eat.

332
00:30:57,913 --> 00:30:58,956
I'm going on a diet.

333
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,666
Don't bother. You'll fail.

334
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,209
You'll get even fatter afterward.

335
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,712
You'll lose muscle only to gain more fat,

336
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:08,132
getting you more out of shape
and more prone to weight gain.

337
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,508
It's all meaningless.

338
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,553
It's so that I can get married.

339
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:14,722
And once I do, this building will be mine,

340
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:16,891
and your squatter of a gym

341
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:19,059
is getting kicked out right away.

342
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:27,860
Is that rent money?

343
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,158
Can you buy a present on my behalf?

344
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:39,622
Right, liposuction.

345
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,333
I see your concerns.

346
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,793
You came to the right place.

347
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,004
Please have a look.

348
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:51,467
I'm worried it might go wrong.

349
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:55,429
If you only get the advised amount
of 2,500 cc removed per session,

350
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:56,388
it's totally safe.

351
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,937
- Then why haven't you gotten it?
- Me?

352
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,652
I have undergone the procedure myself.

353
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:14,782
Are the results only temporary?

354
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:17,159
When you go on a diet,

355
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:20,538
you're merely reducing
the size of fat cells.

356
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,249
Liposuction, on the other hand,

357
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,836
permanently reduces
the number of fat cells,

358
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,088
which prevents you
from gaining the weight back.

359
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:35,928
What the heck?

360
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,555
I'm sorry, ma'am.

361
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,599
I can't believe
it landed right on your face.

362
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,226
Please give us a call!

363
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:52,403
Ji-han.

364
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,280
You seem tired these days.

365
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:56,699
Why don't you take some time off?

366
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:58,117
I'm fine.

367
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,329
I can't take any time off
until the business is on track.

368
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:03,455
That's just the thing.

369
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:06,584
The clinic can't get on its track

370
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:11,088
because the patients lose their trust
as soon as they see you.

371
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,511
I'll handle all the consultations myself
for the time being.

372
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:19,930
- Yes, doctor.
- Yes, doctor.

373
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,273
SUPERMODEL BOK DONG-HEE

374
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,122
Your card is maxed out.

375
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:46,790
What?

376
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,211
That's weird.

377
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:54,882
Could you try this one?

378
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,517
This one is maxed out too.

379
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,565
I don't understand.

380
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,195
Hurry up, will you?

381
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,159
I can't use this money.

382
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,252
Here you go.

383
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:36,715
I'm working, Mom. What's this about?

384
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:40,010
What? You're inviting who?

385
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:43,097
Our savior?

386
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:45,349
Thank you. That's all we need.

387
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,810
Thank you so much.

388
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,061
Have a good one.

389
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,066
What if she's vegetarian?

390
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,651
Maybe we should've kept it vegan.

391
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:58,153
This is more than enough.

392
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,115
What if it's too much
and makes her uncomfortable?

393
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,658
She might think I'm showing off

394
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,660
if she's not used to these things.

395
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,286
How's the air quality today?

396
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,247
I checked it three minutes ago.

397
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,749
Are you also worried the sky might fall?

398
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:24,054
What's all this?

399
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,724
It's a birthday party.

400
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,811
Didn't I tell you to dress up?

401
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,021
You're her dad.

402
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,398
We've never celebrated her birthday.

403
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:38,652
We were just letting you
have your mourning period.

404
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:41,321
But let's change that from this year on.

405
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:43,240
I'm home.

406
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:45,409
The gate was open.

407
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,079
Is our savior here yet?

408
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,205
Savior?

409
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:53,792
I invited a guest.

410
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,837
Hopefully, she'll be the savior
to save the otherwise dull party.

411
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:00,966
Where's her present?

412
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,801
It'll arrive soon.

413
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:05,721
Do you even know this person well?

414
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,141
Did you run a background check?

415
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:13,187
I can take care of it. Just keep quiet.

416
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,026
What's the tracking number?

417
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,278
Overseas shipping can take a while.

418
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,324
You have no idea, do you?

419
00:36:26,408 --> 00:36:28,494
Mom hasn't told you
what she's got cooking up.

420
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:33,123
- Didn't I tell you to keep quiet?
- What?

421
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:38,837
You spent the money on food, didn't you?

422
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:42,466
Is there anything else I should know?

423
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:47,137
What's taking I-na so long?

424
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,597
I-na!

425
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,266
I-na! Bok I-na!

426
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:52,643
Hello.

427
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,066
Welcome.

428
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,819
Goodness, you didn't have to.

429
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:03,946
It's beautiful. Thank you.

430
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,364
Thank you for inviting me.

431
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:06,865
I should thank you too.

432
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:08,617
Hello.

433
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,953
You saved my little brother
from drowning, right?

434
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,998
It seems you hit the jackpot.

435
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,628
Are you really going to marry Gwi-ju?

436
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:23,173
- Sorry?
- Please have a seat.

437
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,008
This way, please.

438
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,301
Okay.

439
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,872
I thought you could use
each other's presence

440
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,291
since you share the experience
of losing loved ones.

441
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,043
Does that mean

442
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,881
you're trying to set us up?

443
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,467
We should introduce our family first.

444
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,056
It's my daughter's birthday today.

445
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,391
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

446
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:17,060
I have a daughter.

447
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,229
Bonding with a stepchild
is hard to begin with,

448
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:21,440
and she's a 13-year-old adolescent.

449
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,943
She'll rebel no matter how hard
you try to understand her.

450
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:27,362
If you try to discipline her,

451
00:38:27,362 --> 00:38:29,573
you'll be labeled as an abusive stepmom.

452
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:34,328
- Me?
- I-na wouldn't do that.

453
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:36,997
I-na!

454
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:39,041
Come down, will you?

455
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,549
See? She's locked herself in,
ignoring everyone.

456
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:50,928
I'm Gwi-ju's big sister,

457
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,679
Bok Dong-hee.

458
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,349
People say sisters-in-law can be mean,

459
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,267
but this woman will bleed you dry.

460
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,479
She's been practically donating
the family fortune to men.

461
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,521
What?

462
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,066
You're making that up.

463
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,027
She's opened a wine bar, a café,

464
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,695
and most recently, a clinic.

465
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:10,906
Thanks to that,
she's dabbled in a few things.

466
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:13,659
What are you right now?

467
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:15,160
A coordinator?

468
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:17,079
Wait, why aren't you at work?

469
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,540
You got fired.

470
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,125
Shut up.

471
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:25,587
See?

472
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,634
Can we have a word, Gwi-ju?

473
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,635
Come with me.

474
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,685
I'll go check on I-na.

475
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,613
We ended up making fools of ourselves,

476
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:54,074
but my family wasn't always like this.

477
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:57,911
We're all just a little bit broken.

478
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,541
You should eat something.

479
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,584
Don't starve yourself.

480
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,795
I have to lose weight.

481
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:09,589
I used to fly everywhere.

482
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,095
If only I could fly again...

483
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:19,599
Did you use to be a flight attendant?

484
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,524
I'm sorry,

485
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:30,694
but could you get me some water?

486
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:36,575
Sure.

487
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,356
I see.

488
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,400
You don't want a party, do you?

489
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:14,154
But it's your birthday.

490
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,698
Come blow out the candles on your cake.

491
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:23,246
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

492
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,088
Did you make seaweed soup?

493
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,468
I want your seaweed soup.

494
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:38,428
Really?

495
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:40,680
Of course I made some.

496
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,307
Will that get you downstairs?

497
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,448
Do you need anything?

498
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,908
I was just getting some water.

499
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:02,119
- I'll take that.
- No, I got it.

500
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:04,162
It's over there.

501
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,108
Bok Gwi-ju!

502
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:41,700
How could you pick this date
to invite another woman home?

503
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:44,786
I wanted to help you move on.

504
00:42:44,786 --> 00:42:47,289
You simply couldn't seem to,

505
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:50,542
so I wanted to help you
by finding someone else for you!

506
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:52,461
Today is I-na's birthday as well.

507
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,379
Don't you care about your granddaughter?

508
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:57,132
You tried to kill yourself
right before her birthday.

509
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:58,216
No, I didn't.

510
00:42:58,216 --> 00:43:00,218
So why did you jump into the sea?

511
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:05,557
You're too obsessed with your dead wife
to pay any attention to those around you.

512
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:10,729
You tried to leave your parents
and child behind and follow her!

513
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,609
Do as I say for once!

514
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:20,197
Se-yeon would never have died
if she hadn't married you.

515
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,247
I tried to stop you.

516
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:32,626
I told you I couldn't see a future
for your marriage.

517
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:34,753
But you went ahead and got her pregnant,

518
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:36,796
saying you'd make your own future.

519
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:39,049
And how did that turn out?

520
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:42,761
Your relationship was doomed
from the beginning!

521
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:44,137
Honey.

522
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:52,187
I-na.

523
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,143
My birth was the beginning
of their misfortune?

524
00:45:16,271 --> 00:45:17,272
I know that.

525
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,027
My lobster...

526
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:24,362
My steak...

527
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,198
Oh no.

528
00:45:27,782 --> 00:45:29,826
Dad.

529
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,619
- What do we do?
- Cover that up.

530
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:34,122
Yes.

531
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:35,373
One at a time.

532
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:36,458
Okay.

533
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:43,840
Hurry, Dad.

534
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,050
- I'll bring this in.
- That's it.

535
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:46,718
Way to go, Dad!

536
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:53,808
Honey!

537
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:56,144
Mom!

538
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,604
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

539
00:45:57,604 --> 00:45:59,022
- Honey!
- Mom!

540
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,106
- Honey!
- Are you okay?

541
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,108
I'm okay.

542
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:03,401
I'm just a bit dizzy.

543
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:04,652
You're sleep-deprived.

544
00:46:04,652 --> 00:46:06,529
- We'll take you to the doctor.
- I'll get the car.

545
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,573
Let me help you. Be careful.

546
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,241
One, two...

547
00:46:12,077 --> 00:46:14,162
- The stove.
- Sorry?

548
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:16,164
I left the seaweed soup on the stove.

549
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,041
- Please turn it off.
- Okay.

550
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:32,407
Thanks.

551
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:38,037
- I was just--
- What were you putting in this one?

552
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:40,623
What?

553
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:52,969
You must've seen me
adding something to the tea.

554
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,262
That was licorice extract.

555
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:56,473
It adds a hint of sweetness.

556
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:57,891
Okay, bye.

557
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:35,220
LEE SE-YEON

558
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,851
Gwi-ju?

559
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:56,991
We told you not to show up
looking like a mess.

560
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,550
He's just upset.

561
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,134
He's worried

562
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,221
that Se-yeon would feel bad
to see you like this.

563
00:49:24,185 --> 00:49:25,019
How's I-na doing?

564
00:49:25,603 --> 00:49:26,646
I'm sorry

565
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:28,690
I couldn't bring her.

566
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:33,570
Se-yeon was always reserved,
just like I-na.

567
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:41,744
But I still don't understand

568
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:44,205
how you survived the accident
without a scratch.

569
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:48,084
Se-yeon once told me something strange.

570
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:50,587
That you had this special power.

571
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,215
Is that true?

572
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:01,347
It's more like a special curse.

573
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,394
It's already been seven years.

574
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,105
It's not a crime to survive.

575
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:11,274
So just live.

576
00:50:39,677 --> 00:50:40,970
You're still here.

577
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:46,351
I heated up the seaweed soup. Want some?

578
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,478
There's some rice too.

579
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:51,064
Who knows what you put in it?

580
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,032
It smells delicious.

581
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:19,926
Fine.

582
00:51:20,802 --> 00:51:22,095
I'll eat first.

583
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:06,347
Your dad wasn't trying to kill himself.

584
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:08,933
I happened to be there that day,

585
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:11,602
and I saw everything.

586
00:52:12,979 --> 00:52:15,440
He only went into the water because--

587
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,357
Run.

588
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:19,944
What?

589
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:22,613
Run before you get more involved
with this family.

590
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:26,075
What do you mean?

591
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,287
Didn't you notice

592
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:32,165
anything off about my family?

593
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:34,709
I'm not sure.

594
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,669
Like what?

595
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:39,130
Are they hiding any secrets?

596
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:43,301
I'm only telling you this
because the soup wasn't too bad.

597
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,678
My family...

598
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:52,560
has superpowers.

599
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:57,565
Superpowers?

600
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:59,192
But they lost them

601
00:52:59,984 --> 00:53:01,235
because of their diseases.

602
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:04,822
- Diseases?
- Modern lifestyle diseases.

603
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,205
You don't like me, do you?

604
00:53:14,248 --> 00:53:16,334
Why do you think my grandma
is so obsessed with sleep?

605
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:18,669
Because she's suffering from insomnia?

606
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,964
Because she has to sleep to have dreams.

607
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,758
That's how she sees the future.

608
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:28,221
So she sees the future in her dreams,

609
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:30,306
but she happens to have insomnia?

610
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:34,101
Aunt Dong-hee became too heavy to fly

611
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:35,353
because of her obesity.

612
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,357
What about you?

613
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:42,109
What's your lifestyle disease?

614
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:43,986
Smartphone addiction?

615
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:45,613
And what's your superpower?

616
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,993
Hold on. No way.

617
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:53,621
Do you have X-ray vision?

618
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:57,959
Is that why you've been avoiding

619
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:00,837
looking directly at me this whole time?

620
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:04,382
I don't have any powers.

621
00:54:04,382 --> 00:54:06,342
That's why Grandma is so anxious.

622
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:12,557
What about your dad?

623
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:15,768
He could go back
to a happy moment from his past

624
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:17,812
by recalling it with his eyes closed.

625
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,607
Why can't he do that anymore?

626
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:24,777
Because he can't find happiness
in any moment of his past.

627
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:27,655
He's depressed.

628
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,441
You're back.

629
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:04,942
What are you doing here?

630
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:06,903
I warmed up some seaweed soup.

631
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,698
The kid hadn't eaten anything
on her birthday.

632
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:12,700
I-na ate something?

633
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:14,452
Seriously?

634
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:19,582
Don't tell me

635
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:22,960
that's a birthday gift
for a middle schooler.

636
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,675
I heard you lost the power
to go back in time,

637
00:55:29,675 --> 00:55:32,011
but it seems more like
you're stuck in the past.

638
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:34,847
Who told you that?

639
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:37,433
Your daughter.

640
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:42,521
She's got quite an imagination.

641
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:46,484
I hope your time will start moving again.

642
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:48,277
For I-na's sake.

643
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:51,364
I've got depression.

644
00:55:53,074 --> 00:55:54,825
When you get married to someone,

645
00:55:55,326 --> 00:55:57,495
you vow to protect that person.

646
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:00,456
But I can't protect anyone.

647
00:56:04,585 --> 00:56:05,628
But I saw you...

648
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:09,090
protecting someone.

649
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:11,050
My Bunny-bunny.

650
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,886
- It's too dangerous.
- We have to save her.

651
00:56:13,886 --> 00:56:16,472
- My dolly.
- Please stop.

652
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:18,766
But Bunny-bunny...

653
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:19,892
Let's get something to eat.

654
00:56:19,892 --> 00:56:22,144
- But my dolly...
- Let's go.

655
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:24,355
Bunny-bunny!

656
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:39,597
Mom! Dad! There she is!

657
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,808
I found Bunny-bunny.

658
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:45,394
A superhero must have saved her.

659
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:47,063
A long time ago,

660
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:49,357
somebody saved my life too.

661
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:56,989
I was sure I was going to die,

662
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,742
but someone came to my rescue.

663
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:05,164
But for some reason,
I felt guilty about surviving.

664
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:10,544
I wished someone more worthy
had survived in my place.

665
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:16,425
All I had left in my life
was loneliness anyway.

666
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:19,637
Still,

667
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:22,473
someone risked his life to save me,

668
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:23,808
so I had to live.

669
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:26,727
Life may be meaningless,

670
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:29,188
but I try to live as happily as I can

671
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:31,065
for his sake.

672
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:37,571
You remind me of him, Mr. Bok.

673
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:42,243
You're just like him, aren't you?

674
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:44,453
You save other people

675
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,664
and help them carry on.

676
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:56,632
I...

677
00:58:59,468 --> 00:59:00,594
can't save anyone.

678
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,888
You're mistaken.

679
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,100
You may have saved me,

680
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:09,395
but that doesn't mean I'll save you.

681
00:59:10,688 --> 00:59:12,064
Don't count on it.

682
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:38,674
Can I count on you to do the dishes?

683
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,804
Great job, my lead actress.

684
01:00:25,804 --> 01:00:27,014
Have some rice punch.

685
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:28,891
Here you go.

686
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:38,901
Can I have some too, Mom?

687
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,402
You should watch your figure.

688
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:48,327
But she gets whatever she wants
because she's the lead?

689
01:00:49,036 --> 01:00:50,746
Why do I always get the crappy roles?

690
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:53,749
Watch.

691
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,255
"You remind me of the person
who saved my life."

692
01:01:01,966 --> 01:01:03,300
My heart...

693
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:13,811
That's just bad writing.

694
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:17,022
Who'd fall for that?

695
01:01:17,022 --> 01:01:20,943
Hey, do you think only women
dream of living a fairy tale?

696
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,570
Men also dream of being the prince

697
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,448
who slays the dragon to save the princess.

698
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:30,661
That's how both her exes fell for her.

699
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,956
Babe.

700
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:54,935
You said it yourself.

701
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:57,730
That I looked like the person
you owed your life to!

702
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:09,491
Right.

703
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:13,454
I don't actually owe you anything,

704
01:02:13,454 --> 01:02:14,663
but I'll repay you.

705
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,392
Plaintiff's counsel,
you may question the defendant.

706
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:38,520
Do you remember injuring Ms. Do Da-hae

707
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,564
by throwing a liquor bottle at her

708
01:02:40,564 --> 01:02:42,566
while drinking at home on December 8th

709
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:45,110
as seen in this picture?

710
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,153
No.

711
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:48,697
I don't remember anything.

712
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,408
The wound appears
pretty serious in the picture.

713
01:02:51,408 --> 01:02:52,993
She must have been in great pain.

714
01:02:52,993 --> 01:02:55,079
Are you sure you don't remember anything?

715
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:58,666
I swear, I don't remember anything at all.

716
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:02,127
There's something fishy

717
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,171
about that Bok family.

718
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:05,589
What do you mean?

719
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:09,551
Did you find out anything else, Uncle?

720
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:13,889
Bok Gwi-ju's daughter told me

721
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,350
that her family had a secret.

722
01:03:17,976 --> 01:03:19,019
They have superpowers.

723
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:21,480
Come to think of it,

724
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:25,275
it doesn't sound like complete nonsense.

725
01:03:29,363 --> 01:03:31,407
I was curious how they became so rich

726
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,201
when the gym
was their only source of income.

727
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:37,287
Turns out,

728
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:39,415
Ms. Bok has precognitive dreams.

729
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,167
That means she can see
the winning lottery numbers

730
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:44,044
and stock charts in her dreams.

731
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,547
No.

732
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:55,931
Sleep.

733
01:03:55,931 --> 01:03:58,350
I need sleep.

734
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,644
We thought they were pushovers,

735
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:02,229
but they have superpowers?

736
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:04,606
We're in serious trouble.

737
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:07,693
They might shoot lasers out of their eyes
if they find us out.

738
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,571
- Let's report them first.
- To whom?

739
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:12,823
The National Intelligence Service?

740
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,492
Or Marvel?

741
01:04:16,076 --> 01:04:17,578
What's a "Marvel"?

742
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:27,963
Hold on. It doesn't end there.

743
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:30,466
Do you know what's even funnier?

744
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,842
They've lost their powers

745
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,845
because of their lifestyle diseases.

746
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:42,394
What a load of bull.

747
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:45,981
Lifestyle diseases, my foot.

748
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,191
They're just spoiled.

749
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:50,694
Let them try scrubbing
people's bodies all day.

750
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:52,362
They'd have no trouble sleeping.

751
01:04:52,362 --> 01:04:54,948
They'd never gain any weight either.

752
01:04:57,367 --> 01:04:58,744
Anyway,

753
01:04:58,744 --> 01:05:00,829
the guy's sister bothers me.

754
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:02,915
Ms. Bok promised to pass down her building

755
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:04,750
to whichever child gets married first.

756
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,543
Da-hae already charmed
the lady of the house.

757
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:07,461
Isn't it game over?

758
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:11,423
There's another person
I have to win over to marry him.

759
01:05:12,966 --> 01:05:13,967
Come in.

760
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:23,477
Hey, I-na.

761
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:26,021
Happy birthday.

762
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,337
Thank you.

763
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,043
Are you leaving to save someone again?

764
01:06:30,043 --> 01:06:31,837
Who will save me then?

765
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:36,133
This bunny will protect you
while Daddy's away.

766
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:44,368
Se-yeon.

767
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:49,206
Se-yeon.

768
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:54,419
Answer me. Se-yeon!

769
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,423
Se-yeon!

770
01:08:06,264 --> 01:08:07,265
I-na.

771
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:09,768
Se-yeon...

772
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,022
Se-yeon.

773
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:16,608
I-na.

774
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:25,534
No. Se-yeon.

775
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,454
I-na. Se-yeon.

776
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,544
Se-yeon.

777
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:41,717
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

778
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:11,455
Do some more digging.

779
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:14,916
Thank you.

780
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:17,252
For holding my hand.

781
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:18,462
What?

782
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:21,298
Do you need help?

783
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:22,299
Do you want to marry me?

784
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,633
No.

785
01:09:24,217 --> 01:09:26,470
I have trouble exchanging favors.

786
01:09:27,637 --> 01:09:30,682
I'll pass this building down to Gwi-ju
once he gets married.

787
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:34,436
I think what's more important
is to try living together.

788
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,648
Bok Don't Eat or whatever her name is
might beat you to it.

789
01:09:38,648 --> 01:09:41,193
Could it be that you came from the future

790
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:42,444
and held my hand?

791
01:09:43,653 --> 01:09:45,363
You held my hand.

792
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:47,199
Remember?

793
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:55,999
