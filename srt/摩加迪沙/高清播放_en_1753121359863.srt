10
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,120
Line everyone up for a photo.

11
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,410
Make sure our faces are visible.

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,870
He's not here, what do we do?

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,120
Don't be too obvious,
but play for some time.

14
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,870
They're late for a
meeting. You tell them.

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,210
- He's here.
- Where?

16
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,040
Of all the things to forget!

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,710
Here it is.

19
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,500
Just open the door next time.

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Swama!

21
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,960
This will go out in a
press release in Seoul,

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,250
so make sure the
flags are in the photo.

23
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,210
And the university signboard!

24
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,920
All right everyone, look at the camera!

Everybody, cheese!

28
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,710
What are you doing?

29
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,330
Go back to the line! Back to the line!

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,330
Careful with that.

31
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,920
What are you doing? A
present from my husband.

32
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,330
- Take it away.
- It's a present from my husband.

33
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,790
Let go of me! No!

Taxi!

38
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,960
They're not here yet?

39
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,290
Welcome sir. Taxi?

40
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,210
Back off.

41
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,210
Taxi? Go fast! Taxi!

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,000
You! Flight...

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Flight good? Good?

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,370
Welcome Somali.

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,790
Me! Best, best driver!

46
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,460
Leave me alone, damn it!

47
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,920
Hey! Taxi, sir!

48
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960

Come!

52
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,250
- Fine. Let's go.
- Come, Bruce Lee!

53
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,540
- Come!
- Let's go!

54
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh my.

55
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,040
Did you wait long?

56
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,670
You came too, Ambassador?

57
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,420
Welcome back, Counselor Kang.

58
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,870
Let me get the smell
of Seoul. Come here.

59
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,790
It's been a year for you, right?

60
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,420
Want a cigarette?

61
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,120
I haven't had time to
smoke even one today.

62
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,830
The school event ran late, so now
we're heading to meet the President.

63
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,380
The gifts for President Barre?

64
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,080
You're opening it here?

65
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,830
Need to know what they
are so I can explain it to him.

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Damn it, I told them
to wrap them nicely.

67
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,380
Wait, this is booze.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,670
Can we give this in a Muslim country?

69
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
This here.

70
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,510
<i>1988 Seoul Olympics opening ceremony</i>
It shows the Somali athletes marching in?

71
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,790
What?

72
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,000
I requested it since President
Barre missed the opening ceremony.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You didn't check?

74
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,830
I just brought it here...

75
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,540
You should check these sort of things.

76
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
That's not my job.

77
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,870
With so few staff,
we all need to pitch in.

78
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,670
Then why didn't you
check with the Seoul office?

79
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,250
I carried the damn
thing back, and you...

80
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,290
Watch your tone.

81
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,580
Quiet! You two fighting again?

82
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,460
We don't have time.

83
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,420
Swama!

84
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,210
We have to leave for the
Presidential Palace now.

85
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,500
So you...

86
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,290
Take a taxi, okay?

87
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,000
Good work.

88
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
Bruce Lee!

89
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,790
Taxi?

90
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,880
Let's go!

91
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,750
Ambassador.

92
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,580
At last, meeting the president!

93
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,620
UN membership!

94
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,080
A promotion!

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,210
Now you're dreaming.

96
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,790
The gifts in the trunk, is
there time to wrap them?

97
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,580
Time isn't the problem.

98
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,500
Where do we get them wrapped?

99
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,540
That Counselor Kang, he
should've taken care of it.

100
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,290
What more do you expect of the kid?

101
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,710
He's obviously got a
chip on his shoulder.

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,620
You said it.

103
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,830
Secretary, I know it's hard
working under a young officer,

104
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,290
but don't make your feelings obvious.

105
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,540
Sometimes it's really obvious.

106
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm happy to work with
you, so I have no complaints.

107
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,000
But what's so great about
being an intelligence officer?

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,170
He was sent here as a demotion.

109
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,250
You think he likes it?

110
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,420
Try to get along, for all our sakes.

111
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,540
What's going on?

112
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm the South Korean ambassador!

113
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,130
We are diplomats!

114
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,870
No! You can't take that!

115
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,080
It's for President Barre!

116
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,210
You'll be in serious
trouble! Internationally!

117
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,710
Swama.

118
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,210
Are you okay?

119
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm okay.

120
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,170
You're okay?

121
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,290
- You okay, Ambassador Han?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,040
You mind waiting
here until help arrives?

123
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,120
Yes, I can do it.

124
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,540
I can do it.

125
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,960
What do you plan on doing?

126
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,210
What do you think? Getting
this meeting was so hard.

127
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,830
Let's run.

128
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,830
I said, run!

129
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay...

Ambassador, wait!

133
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,170

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
But we made the
appointment three months ago.

141
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,710
Why is it canceled?

142
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,290
Your Excellency,

143
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,370
you are the ones that arrived late.

144
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,330
President Barre had another
appointment, so he couldn't wait.

145
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,330
No...

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,460
We're 15 minutes late,
and he had to leave?

147
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,540
Did he plan to talk to
us for only 15 minutes?

148
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,830
Sir, please calm down.

149
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,580
Who the hell is that?

150
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,830
Hey, Ambassador Rim!

151
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,290
Are you playing tricks again?

152
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,670
- Sir.
- Are you?

153
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,250
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

154
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,170
No...

155
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,540
President Barre's next appointment

156
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,080
is with North Korea?

<i>The Somali delegation is now entering.</i>

160
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,460
Getting their meeting
canceled was a pointless act.

161
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,420
It was just for fun.

162
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,750
Oh my gosh.

163
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,460
Look at these bullet holes.

164
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,170
They could've been killed.

165
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,380
Swama.

166
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,620
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

167
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,500
It's okay.

168
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,330
I put on medicine.

169
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,380
Wait a sec.

170
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,580
Swama, this is a radish and an onion.

171
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,290
Radish, onion. Okay?

172
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,290
Okay.

173
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,710
Take home. Grind.

174
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,330
- Mix flour, okay?
- Yes, yes.

175
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,040
And you hurt...

176
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,580
Put here.

177
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,040
And sleep.

178
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960

179
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,620

180
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,750
Thank you.

181
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,040
So you just stood there and
let them take the briefcase?

182
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,210
They shot at us with guns.

183
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,290
Didn't you see the bullet holes?

184
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,420
You think you could've stopped them?

185
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,750
Secretary Gong,

186
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,750
I'm a trained professional.

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,790
You didn't even call the cops?

188
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,420
No point.

189
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It was obviously the North Koreans.

190
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,080
Of all the armed robberies
of diplomatic cars recently,

191
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,120
has anyone ever left the
car and only taken a bag?

192
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,920
Exactly.

193
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,880
The timing of it, and then
their ambassador shows up.

194
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,170
Must have been a leak.

195
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,750
What, so there's a spy among our staff?

196
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
What?

197
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,580
You said there was a leak.

198
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,330
How can you just blurt that out?

199
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,830
Why blame the whole staff for the
intelligence department's failure?

200
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,790
I'm the only intelligence officer here,

201
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,330
so you're accusing me?

202
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,460
When did I accuse you of leaking intel?

203
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,710
What's with you two?

204
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,040
Must be the Minister. What do we do?

205
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Do what? Answer it.

206
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,960
And say what?

207
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,420
You're not going to
report the failed meeting?

208
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,210
Want me to buy us some time?

209
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,750
What will that solve?

210
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Yes?

211
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,130
Yes, Somalia Ambassador
Han Shin-sung speaking. Hello?

212
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,870
I can't hear you well, sir.

213
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,920
Minister?

214
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,670
There's construction here.

215
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,580
I think it's a problem with the line.

216
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,670
Is it the generator? Did I lose you?

217
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,830
Hello? Minister! I'll call back later!

218
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,750
There are some advantages
to being in Africa after all.

219
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,250
Secretary Gong, will you leave us?

220
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,790
What?

221
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,710
I've got something to
discuss with Counselor Kang.

222
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,330
Oh, sure.

223
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,000
- Get some rest.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,670
Secretary Gong, he's more
diplomat than human sometimes.

225
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,250
There's a reason he hasn't
been promoted at his age.

226
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,080
No flexibility, that guy.

227
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,040
He may be rude, but try to understand
him. We're all one family.

228
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,170
I guess I have no choice,
since he's your little lapdog.

229
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,460
Counselor Kang, what
do you take me for?

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,630
I can't believe you'd say that.

231
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,290
Just 6 people in this embassy,

232
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,040
and you're the only
one I can really talk to.

233
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,170
I feel so bad making
you feel that way...

234
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,040
- There you go again.
- Breaks my heart, really.

235
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Ambassador.

236
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
- This time...
- That's enough.

237
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Can you really give
me your full support?

238
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,420
Who would I give it to besides you?

239
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,330
<i>Two hours earlier</i>

240
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,330
No, no.

241
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,080
Your favorite Korean cigarettes!

242
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,750
God, bloody hell.

243
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,500
The rebels wanted to
send out a message,

244
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,040
so I just interviewed
their General Aidid and

245
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,710
took some photographs of his guys.

246
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,250
He just wanted to brag about how well

247
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,130
they're adapting to their
training and all that.

248
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,710
Really?

249
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,710
What did the CIA or MI6 say?

250
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,290
Well, they don't reckon they're
ready for civil war just yet.

251
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,040
Very strange...

252
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,710
If it's not war business,

253
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,920
why...

254
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,750
North Koreans sell weapons?

255
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,420
Who? The North Koreans?

256
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,000
This is a Type 68 assault
rifle, in production since 1968.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,250
This is a Type 78 AK-47
rifle modified for snipers.

258
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,540
Made in North Korea.

259
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,290
The reporter who took the photo
almost wet his pants when I told him.

260
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,080
You're sure they're
really from North Korea?

261
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,210
Does it matter? I'm not
the one writing the story.

262
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,210
This is Africa. Africa...

263
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,460
<i>In a country where war
can break out at any time,</i>

264
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,880
<i>selling weapons to rebels is
as hot an issue as they come.</i>

265
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,870
<i>If that story runs,</i>

266
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,710
<i>meet with the Somali foreign minister,</i>

267
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,210
<i>threaten to cut off aid,</i>

268
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,920
<i>and President Barre will have
no choice but to join our side.</i>

269
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,870
<i>More than anything,</i>

270
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,750
<i>get the Somalian president's
pledge to support</i>

271
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,580
<i>South Korean membership in the UN.</i>

272
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,080
Good morning, Your Excellency.

273
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,750
Good morning, Mr. Ambassador.

274
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello, Counselor.

275
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you for coming this hour.

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
My pleasure.

277
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Your Excellency, do you know that

278
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,790
North Korea is arming the
rebels through Ethiopia?

279
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,210
That's the latest rumor?

280
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,500
The guns in this photo,

281
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,880
you know they were
manufactured in North Korea?

282
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,830
Last month, when a North
Korean delegation came

283
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,000
and promised to
support your government,

284
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,540
they even visited the
arms factory here, right?

285
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,790
But look...

286
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,540
You request military
aid from North Korea,

287
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,880
then they support the rebels?

288
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,540
That doesn't make sense.

289
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,290
Ambassador Han,
let's not get sidetracked

290
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,210
on North Korea or
the rebels or whatever.

291
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,920
Just tell me what you want.

292
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,460
North Korea has started lobbying
ministers in other departments,

293
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,830
to block your efforts at
getting UN membership.

294
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,790
But you know,

295
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,210
I like the government of South
Korea more than anyone

296
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,130
and consider you my very good friend.

297
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,250
So I was thinking...

298
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,790
The government of South Korea needs
to use their money more efficiently.

299
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,330
For example, that program to
take five of our tech students

300
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,870
to Korea to train them...

301
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
Isn't that program already
getting good marks

302
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,250
from both our governments?

303
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,330
You'll have to bear
with me, Ambassador.

304
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,290
This is just an example.

305
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,250
Now, two of my sons happen to be studying
industrial technology in the U.S.

306
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,210
Let's say Seoul adds $25,000 for each,

307
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,880
so $50,000 in total for their
aforementioned training fellowship.

308
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,620
You want a $50,000
scholarship for your sons?

309
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,670
President Barre may speak at the UN,

310
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,500
but ask yourself who
writes his speeches,

311
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,630
and who steers his foreign policy?

312
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,000
This so-called government is
just a pack of relatives and thugs.

313
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,420
How can I do diplomacy with them?

314
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,380
Counselor, does the KCIA
have any cash we can use?

315
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,080
How can you ask me that?

316
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,750
You blow the chance I gave
you, and now you want more?

317
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,420
But the North Koreans are
lobbying, what can we do?

318
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,250
If it takes cash to
stop them, so be it.

319
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,540
You know what that cash is for.

320
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,580
You think you can just dip
into our operation funds?

321
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,670
You keep forgetting what
kind of person you're talking to.

322
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,000
What's with your tone?

323
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,460
Look, wherever you came
from, I'm your boss here!

324
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,250
Look at me when I'm talking!

325
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
I think you've got other
things to worry about.

326
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,210
Cheating on me right in the open.

327
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,170
Hey! Hey, wait!

328
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,080
Wait there!

329
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,750
Wait!

330
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,170
Is there really a leak?

331
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,210
Ambassador Rim!

332
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,750
Ambassador Rim.

333
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,420
I want a word with you.

334
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,880
What is it?

335
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,870
Let's play by the rules.

336
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,670
Ambassador Han.

337
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,500
Maintain your dignity.

338
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,920
How long will you
keep up this sabotage?

339
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,290
Sabotage?

340
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,670
What about you, spreading
lies about us arming the rebels?

341
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Is lying your method of diplomacy?

342
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,000
Why blame us for that?

343
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,460
It's in the newspaper
with photos and all.

344
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,960
Just don't get caught selling
weapons in the first place.

345
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,670
What is this bullshit?

346
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,920
Hey, don't cross the line.

347
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,420
We're just standing here,
you're the ones crossing the line.

348
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,960
- I'll chop your head off.
- Not here, stop it.

349
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,710
We were in Africa working
our tails off 20 years before you.

350
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,170
You think these stunts
will get you anywhere?

351
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,170
So quit selling out your compatriots
for the sake of the UN membership.

352
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,250
What's going on?

353
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,460
Rebels!

354
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,500
They started a riot, and
now they're demanding

355
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,170
that we release Islamic leaders
arrested by the government.

356
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,380
Can we get out?

357
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,130
No. Everything's on lockdown.

358
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,710
But don't worry.

359
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,500
Barre will take care
of this in no time.

360
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,790
Damn it!

361
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,960
No instructions from Seoul yet?

362
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
No.

363
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,330
The Ambassador and Counselor Kang
are safe in a hotel, so don't worry.

364
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,120
Try calling your family at home.

365
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,830
What do I say?

366
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,080
My daughter's studying
for her entrance exam.

367
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,130
I shouldn't worry her.

368
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,500
Ma'am?

369
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,250
I was supposed to phone my kids today.

370
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,750
Sure, go ahead, don't worry.

371
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,830
But are they asleep now?

372
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,830
Yes, they must be.

373
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,540
The Ambassador will be back, no hurry.

374
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,170
While we wait for him,

375
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,580
shall we pray together?

376
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,500
Shall we?

377
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,750
♪ Nearer my God, ♪

378
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,370
♪ to Thee... ♪

379
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,120
She knows I'm Buddhist!

380
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,330
You think I'm Christian?

381
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,920
Just pray to Buddha in your heart.

382
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,000
Amen.

383
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We pray for the safe return of
Deacon Han and Believer Kang.

384
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,330
Let us begin with the Apostles' Creed.

385
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,880
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

386
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,380
Oh no!

387
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,250
Isn't that our driver Swama?

388
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,210
What's he doing here?

389
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,210
Careful!

390
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Isn't this...

391
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,250
the mark of the rebels?

392
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,750
What?

393
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,750
Then is he a rebel?

394
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,710
Don't be ridiculous. It's just a scarf.

395
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,540
Maybe someone gave
it to him for his wounds.

396
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,170
But his neck is fine.

397
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,210
What if he's really a rebel?
We need to send him away.

398
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,790
He can't be a rebel.

399
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,710
He's unconscious, how
do we send him away?

400
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,580
If we're not careful, we
could get hurt, Ma'am.

401
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,460
How about calling the police?

402
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,790
But if he's a real rebel,

403
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,330
they might think we
aided the rebels all along.

404
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,540
But we didn't!

405
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,750
At home they turn innocent
students into Communist spies,

406
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,750
you think that can't happen in Somalia?

407
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm just saying the political
system here isn't developed yet.

408
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,000
Watch what you say, especially
in front of Counselor Kang.

409
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Okay.

410
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,580
Who is it?

411
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,500
It's the police.

412
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,540
Listen. You can't...

413
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,330
not come in here...

414
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,870
Shouldn't we move
Swama now just in case?

415
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,420
Now?

416
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,960
How can we carry him?

417
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,960
Oh no! They're pushing in!

418
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,870
What's going on?

419
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
He is boss. Ambassador!

420
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,960
It's the police.

421
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,830
They say a demonstrator
is hiding in our embassy,

422
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,290
and they want to come in.

423
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,290
What kind of bullshit
is that? Is it true?

424
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,250
Well...

425
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,460
Hey. Who's the boss?

426
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,080
We're looking for one of the
instigators of the riots today,

427
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,960
and we'd like your
cooperation in finding him.

428
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,670
This is Korea government land.

429
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,250
You can't. Never. This.

430
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,380
Damn, I'm too worked up to talk!

431
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,750
Secretary Gong, come
here and translate this.

432
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,710
Okay.

433
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,670
Your job during a riot is to
protect embassies like ours,

434
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,670
and I don't see a single
one of you doing that!

435
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,960
What? Can you repeat...

436
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,500
Hey! You!

437
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,170
Yes, you!

438
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,670
You just trespassed on
South Korean territory.

439
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,080
You want me to call
the Chief of Police?

440
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,790
ID.

441
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,920
Stop it.

442
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,630
You stupid asshole!

443
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,330
- Sir?
- Yeah?

444
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,710
Yes?

445
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,620
What?

446
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,250
Yes?

447
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,380
What is it?

448
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,670
I have something to tell you.

449
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,670
Say it!

450
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,750
- Honey!
- Are you crazy?

451
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,330
What a circus. Did you let him in?

452
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,460
Where's Swama?

453
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,460
Where is he?

One!

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,960
Things often get stormy in
this region, so don't panic.

485
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,380
The radio! Let's listen to the news.

486
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,250
- Down with dictatorship!
- Down with dictatorship!

487
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,790
- Drive out Barre!
- Drive out Barre!

488
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,540
Without any Koreans to
look after, can't we pull out?

489
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,920
Public servants can't
act without an order.

490
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,960
The CIA says it'll be fine.

491
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,500
Should we believe everything they say?

492
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,790
This is hardly the first time
they've predicted war here.

493
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Think of Korea.

494
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,120
Every day they predict war.

495
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,710
At least in Korea, we know
what info is real or fake.

496
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,750
Over here, can we be sure of anything?

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,170
Honey.

498
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,210
Don't stay here. You go back to Seoul.

499
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,960
And you?

500
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,870
It took me 28 years to get here.

501
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,540
Should I ruin it all with a month left?

502
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,170
They can't demote you
for escaping danger.

503
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,210
We spent three years here

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,040
during the most important stage
of our daughter's schooling!

505
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,290
What is this?

506
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,420
My report went to Seoul today,
so they'll do something.

507
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,920
So I should leave you
and all the staff behind?

508
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,630
You're a family member,
not a public servant.

509
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,830
I'm calling the travel agent
tomorrow, so get ready.

510
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,500
It's mine!

511
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380

516
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,380
All the banks and offices are closed!

519
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,420
There's nothing we can do!

520
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,460

521
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:36,190

<i>Hello everyone!</i>

542
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,880
<i>We have come from far-off
South Korea to be your friends.</i>

543
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,040
<i>For the sake of Somalia's
development and prosperity,</i>

544
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>we promise to become
good friends as one family.</i>

545
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,170
<i>Family members like friends,</i>

546
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,670
<i>friends like family members...</i>

547
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,380
<i>Remember that in good times or bad,</i>

548
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:25,290
<i>we South Koreans will
always stand by your side!</i>

549
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,420
The rebels have
taken the radio station?

550
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,670
It's a different frequency.

551
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,420
It's a civilian uprising.

552
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,670
Rebel forces haven't arrived
yet, so it's not a state of war.

553
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,960
You need to keep calm.

554
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,790
The rebels are calling for the
president's head on the radio,

555
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,170
and I should keep calm?

556
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,880
Do we have any kind of intel at all?

557
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,750
The people in Seoul...

558
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,040
don't even know what's
happening to us, right?

559
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,080
We're isolated here.

560
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,920
Why...

561
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,580
Why do I have to die
in a foreign country?

562
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,000
You're not going to die!

563
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,170
Hey!

564
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,460
Let's take one thing at a time.

565
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,630
Sir, we need to request protection.

566
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,920
You said the ministers
ran off. Who do we ask?

567
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Stop!

568
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,710
- Counselor Kang! Stop...
- I saw it.

569
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,210
Who do we have here?

570
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,210
If it isn't the scary Korean diplomat.

571
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,580
Assalamu alaikum!

572
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,040
What brings you here at this hour?

573
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,580
With a date, no less.

574
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,000
- I want to meet Chief.
- You have an appointment?

575
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,080
Our phone all died.

576
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,580
Well, that's too bad then.

577
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,790
Because the chief is busy.

578
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,210
How about deputy chief?

579
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,500
Busy.

580
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,170
In that case...

581
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,330
I will see the...

582
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,250
What's the English for "haengjungkwan"?

583
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,620
Administrator.

584
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,710
I will see the administrator.

585
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,080
Nope. Busy.

586
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,370
And since this is a state
of national emergency,

587
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,210
diplomatic privileges don't apply.

588
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,630
You have no authority!

589
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,920
I am a trained man.

590
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,080
You're also in Somali
government jurisdiction.

591
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,710
My jurisdiction!

592
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,380
So you don't call the shots here.

593
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,750
Now,

594
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,080
go back.

595
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,040
Translate what I'm about to say.

596
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
What?

597
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,370
Arrest me! Shit, arrest me!

598
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,460
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

599
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,170
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

600
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,120
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

601
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,880
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

602
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,040
You got a death wish?

603
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,080
Go ahead and shoot, asshole!

604
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,870
Shoot me if you can!

605
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,210
Translate for me!

606
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,330
Your commissioner is
watching. Deliver this message.

607
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,130
Your commissioner's name is
on our embassy's contact list.

608
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,120
If the rebels take our embassy, we
won't be the only ones going down.

609
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,000
You want to get your family out, right?

610
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,330
Somali money is as good as toilet paper.
And I bet you don't have enough dollars.

611
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:35,670
So take our cash, and
send us police protection.

612
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,670
Okay?

613
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,460
<i>December 30, 1990</i>

614
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,370
<i>The rebels enter Mogadishu</i>

615
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,500
- He's a policeman!
- No!

616
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,250
He killed Swama!

617
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,960
I'm not a policeman!

618
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,920
Punish the murderer!

619
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,250
It's not me!

620
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,290
I'm on your side!

621
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,250
Please!

622
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,380
All these people came here
to get on the evacuation plane.

623
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,710
Even if you are diplomats, we
can't let you board an aircraft

624
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,870
unless it's been sent
by your government.

625
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,120
We have no way of
contacting our government.

626
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,630
All our communications are down.

627
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,170
That's your problem.

628
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,830
We have no choice.

629
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,580
I know...

630
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,040
But that plane. From
Nairobi Airport, right?

631
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,290
There tower... Contact
Nairobi Tower can...

632
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,330
What is it? Just tell me.

633
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,830
The control tower!

634
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:14,170
Can you try to contact the
Korean Embassy in Kenya with it?

635
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,920
I'm sorry.

636
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,420
We're North Korean
diplomats. Who's in charge here?

637
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,120
We need to get to the airport.

638
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,210
You can't go to the airport. Turn back.

639
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,710
Travel restrictions will soon
be enforced for all of Mogadishu.

640
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,870
Travel restrictions?

641
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,250
Then the airport will be closed too?

642
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,170
<i>Since the rebel troops entered
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia,</i>

643
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,370
<i>the gunfights between
the Somali government</i>

644
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,960
<i>military forces and the rebels</i>

645
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,960
<i>have been taking place
every day throughout the city.</i>

646
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,370
<i>The future of the country is now bleak.</i>

647
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,540
<i>And the security of all
foreigners in Somalia...</i>

648
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,830
We have no electricity,
water or communications,

649
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,290
and no gas for the generator.

650
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,420
And the defense chief who issues
travel passes has fled the city.

651
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,080
Don't worry.

652
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,040
His nephew is still selling passes.

653
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
Our informants have gone to get them.

654
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,120
Our bigger problem is we have no food.

655
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,420
I told you to secure food!

656
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,460
No matter how much cash we offer,
no one has enough even for themselves.

657
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,500
What should I do?

658
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:29,880
Turn off the light!

659
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,420
Here they are.

660
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,790
Rest easy and turn the lights on.

661
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,710
It's the informants I
sent to buy travel passes.

662
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,630
Get ready to leave.

663
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,460
There are rebels nearby.
Can we talk inside?

664
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,630
Come on.

665
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,750
We'll talk inside...

666
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,000
You son of a bitch!

667
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,750
Watch! Money!

668
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,830
Min-seo!

669
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,330
Hey!

670
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,580
Stop!

671
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,880
What the hell are you doing?

672
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,460
I told you not to hurt anyone.

673
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,040
Go move the stuff!

674
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,210
No more debts to you now.

675
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,540
The kids from school saved your life.

676
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,500
Now, you better leave, or my
brothers will be back for you.

677
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,500
What do we do without the
last of our food and the car?

678
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,620
And your insulin...

679
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,750
Don't let our comrades know.

680
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,830
We'll take refuge in
the Chinese Embassy.

681
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,960
We have no travel pass,
what if we get caught?

682
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,670
Better to get caught
by government troops.

683
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,420
At least they'll guarantee
the safety of diplomats.

684
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,960
So all of you pack quickly,
and steel your hearts.

685
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,380
From now on, our goal...

686
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,790
is survival.

687
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,500
<i>Chinese Embassy</i>

688
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:30,830
Everyone come in.

689
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,460
Go in. Go in.

690
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,370
The only option now

691
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,080
is to somehow get to the
airport and board a rescue flight.

692
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,420
We barely made it here.

693
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,420
With the kids, we'll
never reach the airport.

694
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,420
Even so,

695
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,000
we can't go back.

696
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,130
Comrade Ambassador!

697
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,540
There are Chinese here!

698
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,540
Run away!

699
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,960
Stay low! Keep going!

700
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:11,960
Come quickly! Quickly!

701
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,540
Stay by the wall.

702
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,790
How much longer do we have
to guard the South Koreans?

703
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,170
To leave, you'll need money.

704
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,710
What are you doing?

705
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,540
This isn't right.

706
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,250
They've got armed guards.

707
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,000
Is this because you're out of insulin?

708
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,120
What?

709
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,290
Beg the South Korean bastards for help,

710
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,750
and turn even our
children into traitors?

711
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,120
What's the point in surviving
here just to get purged back home?

712
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,790
You think I'm planning to defect?

713
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:18,290
If there's trouble, we'll just
take over their embassy.

714
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,210
From now on, don't stop
me if you have no other ideas.

715
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,540
Don't shoot!

716
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,540
Don't shoot.

717
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:38,580
Ambassador Han!

718
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,210
Ambassador Han Shin-sung!

719
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,960
It's Ambassador Rim!

720
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,540
- It's the North Koreans, right?
- Ambassador Han!

721
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:50,210
Don't shoot!

722
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,670
We're from the North Korean Embassy!

723
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,750
Hey, hey!

724
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,870
Stop, stop!

725
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,290
I said stop, asshole!

726
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,540
Ambassador Han, talk to me!

727
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,040
What's going on?

728
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,960
I'm the North Korean
Ambassador Rim Yong-su!

729
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,500
I'm here to see Ambassador Han.

730
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,290
But what's your purpose coming here?

731
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,210
We met a mob on the way to the
Chinese Embassy and ended up here.

732
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,290
The Chinese Embassy is that way.

733
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
Turn back!

734
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,830
There are women and children with us.

735
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,880
Come out!

736
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,500
As you can see, we're all unarmed!

737
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Unarmed?

738
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,210
What are they scheming now?

739
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,420
So tell us your
business! Your business!

740
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,670
That rotten scoundrel!

741
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,960
They know why we're here,
they're just humiliating us.

742
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,710
Hide, quick!

743
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,920
Please, at least take the children!

744
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,620
Are you mad?

745
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,790
Who told you to beg
to the South Koreans?

746
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,500
If State Security had secured
our safety, we wouldn't be here!

747
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,420
I'll rip your head off for saying that!

748
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,870
Counselor Tae!

749
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,960
What are they doing?

750
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,790
Creeping around at night
in such a dangerous place.

751
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,210
In front of another embassy...

752
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,460
But Ambassador.

753
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,960
This could be our lucky chance.

754
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,000
What?

755
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,830
Has an entire embassy
ever defected before?

756
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,370
Don't get any ideas,
just send them away.

757
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,460
They have kids there,
you'll just let them die?

758
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,790
What about us?

759
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,120
Go away! Just go back!

760
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,330
- Someone's there!
- We're all in danger with you there!

761
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,540
Just go inside!

762
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,330
Stay the hell away, you assholes!

763
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,920
Come on out.

764
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,960
Then what is it, huh?

765
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,120
What do you want?

766
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,460
Hey.

767
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,000
Our embassy was
attacked by armed rioters.

768
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,920
That's not our problem.

769
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,210
As you see, we have children here.

770
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,580
Consider it as a humanitarian gesture.

771
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,420
After all you did to us, you
appeal to our humanity?

772
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,880
You said not to sell
out your compatriots.

773
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,380
Ambassador Han.

774
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,130
We have nowhere to go.

775
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,080
Taking kids into the streets
in a situation like this...

776
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,000
What time is it?

777
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:11,210
Have the kids eaten?

778
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,460
Let them in.

779
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,460
Prepare your IDs. Luggage on this side.

780
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:39,620
You'll be searched before
entering, so line up by family.

781
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:43,330
I heard they're trained to kill
people with their bare hands.

782
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,670
The Ambassador's trusting
Counselor Kang too much.

783
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,460
You try talking him out of it.

784
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,330
They've got kids, will
they really try anything?

785
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,710
You know North Korean
kids all get military training?

786
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,290
Come forward.

787
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:00,380
Arms up.

788
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,210
This is not what we agreed to.

789
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,750
They are too many people to protect.

790
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,870
What?

791
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,710
Hey. Many people, no problem!

792
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,290
Your job.

793
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,870
Protect embassy.

794
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,290
This is same.

795
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,040
Well, you still have to
give us more money.

796
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
We are out of bullets.

797
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,500
What a bunch of thieves.

798
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,750
As you can see, we don't have much,

799
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,540
but please eat your fill.

800
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,750
Okay, let's eat.

801
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,750
Aren't you hungry?

802
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:21,290
Okay?

803
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,880
Give this over there.

804
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,330
Oh, Lord!

805
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,290
You scared me. You
shouldn't wander alone.

806
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,790
Go back to your family.

807
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,120
Do you have sugar?

808
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,750
Sugar? Why?

809
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,250
You want something sweet?

810
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,880
Want a cookie?

811
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:58,670
Not for me.

812
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,460
Then who?

813
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,080
Medicine for my grandpa...

814
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,580
Medicine?

815
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,880
He has diabetes?

816
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,790
Your wife told my wife.

817
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,870
That the rioters even
stole your medicine.

818
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,630
But Secretary Gong has
diabetes, so we have insulin.

819
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,380
It's fortunate.

820
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,460
Well, not that Secretary
Gong has diabetes...

821
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,750
She shouldn't have told you.

822
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,670
But thank you.

823
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,580
Is it inconvenient being left-handed?

824
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,580
What?

825
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,380
You use your left hand.

826
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,250
Not as much as diabetes.
I use both hands.

827
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,170
Don't want people calling me a leftist.

828
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:11,380
But with the rebels in charge,
why would they loot the embassy

829
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,790
of the country that armed them?

830
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,540
You really believe we
sold weapons to the rebels?

831
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,580
No reason not to believe it.

832
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,250
You don't want to know the truth.

833
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,210
Even if you did, it wouldn't
change your mind.

834
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:32,500
Just like we assume it was
you who spread those rumors.

835
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,670
I'm starting to learn that
sometimes there are two truths.

836
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:42,670
Anyway, since you are here,

837
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,130
why don't you explain
your position clearly?

838
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,920
Do you think we're going
to defect to South Korea?

839
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,210
Let's do honest diplomacy.
Honest, okay?

840
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,330
You didn't come here to eat dinner.

841
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,380
Just as a person or
a nation has dignity,

842
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,670
there is dignity to diplomacy, too.

843
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,040
We didn't throw away
our pride coming here.

844
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,250
Okay.

845
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,830
Ambassador Rim, I know
you're much more experienced

846
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,670
and capable than I am.

847
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:24,380
But still, you're not in a
position right now to lecture me.

848
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,960
It's just the two of us here.

849
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:32,210
Let's have dialogue, not a lecture.

850
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,250
Let's speak from the heart.

851
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,080
Are you even grateful
to us for what we did?

852
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,830
Hey, you know the water's cut off!

853
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,580
How could you take a dump like that?

854
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,210
That's not my poo...

855
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,880
Ma'am,

856
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,670
would you like to sleep
in that room there?

857
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,080
I'm fine here.

858
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,750
I've got some ginseng liquor...

859
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,580
You have it.

860
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,620
No point in us staying here.

861
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,170
Let's just go, quick!

862
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,710
<i>North Korea passport</i>

863
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,210
<i>NAME: BAE YONG-SOOK
YEAR OF BIRTH: 1935</i>

864
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,380
<i>CONVERSION CERTIFICATE</i>

865
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,250
Damn it...

866
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,370
<i>CONVERSION CERTIFICATE</i>

867
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,580
A conversion certificate.

868
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:11,330
So you're planning to drag us to Seoul?

869
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,830
Hey! Shit...

870
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,710
Hey, did we ask you here?

871
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,920
You came yourselves!

872
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,500
Your guards all ran away,
so you've got some nerve.

873
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:41,670
You scoundrel!

874
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:49,080
Honey, it sounds like
trouble, shouldn't you go?

875
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,420
- Me?
- Yeah.

876
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,540
I need to protect all of you.

877
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,670
The guards. Get the guards.

878
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:58,920
Damn...

879
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,790
What is this, huh?

880
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,580
What is this?

881
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,460
Apologize, you rotten scoundrel.

882
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,210
Or fight to the end.

883
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,250
You shithead!

884
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,080
A commie like you
should be ripped to pieces

885
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,670
and thrown into the
battlefield outside,

886
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,080
but, shit, I'm
restraining myself, okay?

887
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,540
What is this?

888
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,290
What's going on?

889
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,170
Comrade Ambassador,

890
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:03,830
I caught these
bastards trying to use us.

891
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,000
To make us defect,

892
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:10,380
they were forging
conversion certificates.

893
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,960
I heard you, so stop.

894
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,960
Was this your order?
Or did he plan it himself?

895
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,330
Let's speak alone.

896
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,710
If those people don't
convert to our side,

897
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,170
we're violating the
National Security Law.

898
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,540
What violation?

899
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:29,670
You think we're plotting
some rebellion here?

900
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,790
Then why in hell should
we be protecting them?

901
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:32,870
What bullshit.

902
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,250
The guards are gone,
who's protecting who?

903
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,210
Your police guard ran away!

904
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,210
What's this?

905
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,080
They charge for protection by the head,

906
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,130
can we afford that?

907
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,370
The conversion certificates
were made without my order

908
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,040
by our Counselor alone.

909
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,040
As the person in charge, I apologize.

910
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,750
We might've done the same.

911
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,870
It's water under the bridge.

912
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,630
That's not the important issue now.

913
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,170
What will you do now?

914
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,830
We've already abandoned our embassy,

915
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:30,540
so we don't mind leaving here.

916
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,540
And you?

917
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:35,000
We won't last long here without guards.

918
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
We need a way out, too.

919
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,710
If we combine our diplomatic
and intelligence capabilities,

920
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,290
can we find a way?

921
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,830
You think we can
accomplish more together?

922
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:54,670
Neither of us will make it
out without outside help.

923
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:59,710
If we try our Western allies, and
you work your Communist allies,

924
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,620
maybe a route will open.

925
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:06,290
But it's not just up to us two.

926
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:09,330
Will your Counselor and staff agree?

927
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,420
That's my responsibility as Ambassador.

928
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:16,080
Let's state our goal clearly.

929
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,830
We're not aiming for reunification,

930
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:21,330
we're just banding together
to find a way out, okay?

931
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,290
Let's forget this and go
our own way at daybreak.

932
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,540
Let's not get into a
conspiracy with the South.

933
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,710
What damned conspiracy?

934
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,580
You think that ridiculous
conversion certificate

935
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,080
will be any effective?

936
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,710
Your tone is a bit...

937
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:40,500
Counselor, don't break
the flow here. Let's proceed.

938
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,540
Anyway, whether North or South,

939
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,750
let's try arranging a route
out through the big embassies.

940
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:49,330
The Americans have pulled
out, so that's not an option.

941
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:52,620
The Italian Embassy is
close, and might be fastest.

942
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:55,830
Besides, Italy once helped
Somalia under a trusteeship,

943
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:59,870
so they have more influence than the
US, and they still send rescue planes.

944
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,880
We're not diplomatic partners
with Italy, so will they help us?

945
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,710
Not a likely solution for us.

946
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,580
Look,

947
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:13,580
if we go 500 km south to Kismaayo Port,

948
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,670
we can take a boat to Kenya.

949
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,710
500 km, are you kidding?
How will you go 500 km?

950
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,670
You got a car for all those people?

951
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:22,580
And gas?

952
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,870
What if you run into rebels?

953
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,540
Don't you even think?

954
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,120
Hey, did I ask you to come with us?

955
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,330
Why are you...

956
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,130
Everyone calm down and look at this.

957
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,000
Here,

958
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,080
the Egyptian Embassy still stands.

959
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,120
We can ask them if
there's a way to reach Cairo.

960
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,920
South Korea has no
diplomatic relations with Egypt,

961
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,330
so bad luck for you.

962
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,540
We have a consulate there.

963
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,580
Let's do this.

964
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,580
We'll take the Italian Embassy,

965
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:57,540
you take the Egyptian Embassy,
and we'll see which way works best.

966
01:19:58,830 --> 01:19:59,830
What if...

967
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:05,540
only one side is offered a way out?

968
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,580
At least some of us will live.

969
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,620
Don't open the gate, even for police.

970
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:05,710
Okay.

971
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:06,830
I'll pray.

972
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,290
Don't, don't!

973
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,500
Please spare me!

974
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,500
What is it?

975
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,460
Back up!

976
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,330
Sir!

977
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,580
Ambassador Mario is
on the phone with Italy.

978
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,710
Not sure how long it'll take.

979
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,710
Really?

980
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,040
Wait.

981
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,080
You mean their phones are connected?

982
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:46,460
It's a battlefield over
here, a battlefield.

983
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,920
Don't you even watch the news?

984
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,790
Are you just telling
me to die over here?

985
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:52,830
Hello...

986
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:58,330
What did they say?

987
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:00,750
I reached the Korean Embassy in Kenya,

988
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,330
but they can't send a plane.

989
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:06,920
Ambassador Han!

990
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,540
Ambassador.

991
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,380
So I heard there are 20 of you in all?

992
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,080
Including children, yes.

993
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,920
Okay, we do have a Red
Cross medical plane. Right?

994
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,540
But...

995
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:25,460
Look, Ambassador. Frankly speaking,

996
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,120
we can't take North Koreans

997
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:29,580
whom we don't have
diplomatic ties with,

998
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,330
when we can barely fit all of
our own people on the plane.

999
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:38,330
So why don't we evacuate
South Koreans first?

1000
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,460
What are you contemplating? Say okay.

1001
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,580
And the North Koreans?

1002
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,420
They can ask at the Egyptian Embassy.

1003
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,710
What if they say no?

1004
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,040
Just second please.

1005
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,580
- Just second.
- Okay.

1006
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,710
After all this, you'll
give up our ticket out?

1007
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,620
If we'd made them
defect from the beginning,

1008
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:07,790
they'd be South Koreans
and they could all come.

1009
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,040
Exactly!

1010
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,500
Ambassador Mario.

1011
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,420
Actually,

1012
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:20,580
those North Koreans
have defected to our side.

1013
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:29,040
I'm sorry...

1014
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,580
But as you can see,
we're in no position to help.

1015
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:36,960
Can you at least help us contact
the North Korean Embassy in Cairo?

1016
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,710
We want tell that we're safe.

1017
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,580
But all our communications are down.

1018
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,210
Well that...

1019
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,540
I can try.

1020
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:49,500
Can you also contact the South
Korean Consulate General in Cairo?

1021
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,580
South Korea?

1022
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,580
Yes.

1023
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,500
What's taking them so long?

1024
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:02,210
If you'd said we'll go
alone, we'd be on the plane.

1025
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,830
What are you thinking?

1026
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,830
They're not really going to defect.

1027
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,330
Will you take responsibility
if it all falls through?

1028
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,540
Responsibility?

1029
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,250
Our seats are secure.

1030
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,540
There's a way we can both live.

1031
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:22,750
Need to try what we can.

1032
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,710
We should never have
let them in last night.

1033
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:37,750
Right?

1034
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:43,210
Let's just think of
getting on the plane.

1035
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:50,880
Ambassador.

1036
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:56,580
Well, the South Korean Government
officially requested to our government

1037
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,080
to assist them.

1038
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,170
Okay so thankfully,

1039
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,540
everyone in your party will get
a place on the evacuation plane.

1040
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,370
But the plane may arrive later today,

1041
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,580
so I need you to get back

1042
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,170
by 4PM at the latest and stand by.

1043
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,380
- Grazie! Grazie mille!
- It's okay.

1044
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,500
Ask if they can possibly
let us borrow a car.

1045
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,080
A car?

1046
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:21,420
We don't have enough cars for everyone.

1047
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,580
What are they doing?

1048
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:02,420
Ambassador, can we talk privately?

1049
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,420
Yes.

1050
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,250
Counselor Kang.

1051
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,500
We got a car from the Egyptians,
so transportation is no problem,

1052
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,670
but if we drive out and run
into some rebels like before,

1053
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,170
we're dead meat.

1054
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,500
We need to wait for one
side to get the upper hand.

1055
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,250
Is that rescue plane some
kind of taxi you can flag down?

1056
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,250
If you don't catch that
plane, what'll you do then?

1057
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,710
Lower your voice.
You're scaring people.

1058
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,630
I heard the Egyptian
Embassy can't help you?

1059
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:41,210
You saw on the way, the
whole city's a battleground.

1060
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:42,580
Waiting is pointless.

1061
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,960
What will you do?

1062
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,790
We're going.

1063
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:57,000
Have you got any extra books?

1064
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,710
Books?

1065
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:17,000
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

1066
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,170
- Turn it!
- Careful.

1067
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:21,380
Look out!

1068
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,080
Oh, Lord!

1069
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,710
What are you doing in this emergency?

1070
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:04,330
Hey kids, fill these with dirt.

1071
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,540
You're going to kill
us before we even go!

1072
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,920
Why take it off?

1073
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,710
If you use too much, we'll run out.

1074
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,170
How will it support the weight?

1075
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:30,210
Look at this. This should
go here, and then that there...

1076
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:31,540
So we can drive...

1077
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:34,040
Do we have to stick them inside?

1078
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,000
Just carry some sand bags.

1079
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,000
Hey, everyone!

1080
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,920
It's time to go.

1081
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,830
We need to get there
before afternoon prayer ends.

1082
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:47,000
Get in!

1083
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,710
Everyone, move! Don't just stand there!

1084
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:10,080

1085
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:27,880

1092

It's okay, they're government troops.

1093
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,710
Give me the white flag.

1094
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:23,130
Damn...

1095
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:34,540
Give me that. Yes, that.

1096

It's okay, don't worry.

1097

What happened?

1100
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:54,580
Back up!

1101
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:05,920
Look out behind!

1102
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,040
Don't turn your head!

1103
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,040
Follow me!

1104
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,080
You okay?

1105
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:42,830

01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,710
Get down!

1108

Watch out for the gun!

1113
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,040
- Honey, watch out!
- You scoundrel!

1114
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
Grab the gun! Get the gun!

1115
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:37,420
Brake!

1116
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:40,330

- You okay?
- I'm okay.

1125

Are you okay?

1126
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,380
I'm okay. Are you?

1127
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:04,370
Hey, we have no time!

1128
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,170

Take the white flags!

1130

01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,330
Yes, we're all fine.

1150
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,380
Open the door!

1151
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,040
Stop! This is Italian property!

1152
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:14,830
We are Somali government forces!

1153
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:16,670
This is the final warning!

1154
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:18,710
This is Italian property!

1155
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:21,670
Get out of our country!

1156
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,080
Don't shoot!

1157
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,790

Don't!

1159
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,170
Get out. Come.

1160
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:17,790
Get out.

1162
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,500
Hold on.

1163
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,540

I didn't get to say thank you!

1169
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:54,210
Are you going home now?

1170
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:59,250
Yes, we've been abroad a few years,

1171
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:02,670
so after reporting, we'll
see our children again.

1172
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,420
Your children are with you now.

1173
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,330
When we diplomats go abroad,

1174
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:08,750
we leave one family
member each in Pyongyang.

1175
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:13,580
If we don't go back,
they all become orphans.

1176
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,170
Ambassador Rim?

1177
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,290
You have no diplomatic
relations with Kenya.

1178
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,920
When we get to Mombasa Airport,

1179
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,380
our embassy agreed to give
you cars and accommodation.

1180
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,580
Don't misunderstand our intentions,

1181
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:45,210
but if you need it, we can go together.

1182
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:49,420
Last night at the Italian Embassy,

1183
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:53,790
we were able to contact Pyongyang,
and they made arrangements.

1184
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:57,710
Ambassador Han!

1185
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:01,630

Get the defectors in our car.

1191

Take care now.

1192
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:18,750

The North Koreans go
behind us with those foreigners!

1196
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:36,500
Both countries sent teams,

1197
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,580
waiting for us outside.

1198
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:43,370
Once we get off, be sure not
to acknowledge each other.

1199
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,710
