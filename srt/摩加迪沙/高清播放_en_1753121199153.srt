Where the hell is he?

10
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,124
Line everyone up for a photo.

11
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,405
Make sure our faces are visible.

12
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,874
He's not here, what do we do?

13
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,124
Don't be too obvious,
but play for some time.

14
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,874
They're late for a
meeting. You tell them.

15
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,208
- He's here.
- Where?

16
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,041
Of all the things to forget!

17
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,042
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,708
Here it is.

19
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,500
Just open the door next time.

20
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:33,917
Swama!

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,957
This will go out in a
press release in Seoul,

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,249
so make sure the
flags are in the photo.

23
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,207
And the university signboard!

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,917
All right everyone, look at the camera!

Everybody, cheese!

28
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,707
What are you doing?

29
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,333
Go back to the line! Back to the line!

30
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,332
Careful with that.

31
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,917
What are you doing? A
present from my husband.

32
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,332
- Take it away.
- It's a present from my husband.

33
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,792
Let go of me! No!

Taxi!

38
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,957
They're not here yet?

39
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,291
Welcome sir. Taxi?

40
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,207
Back off.

41
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,208
Taxi? Go fast! Taxi!

00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,999
You! Flight...

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Flight good? Good?

00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,374
Welcome Somali.

45
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,791
Me! Best, best driver!

46
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,458
Leave me alone, damn it!

47
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,916
Hey! Taxi, sir!

48
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,958
Come, come!

Come!

52
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,249
- Fine. Let's go.
- Come, Bruce Lee!

53
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,542
- Come!
- Let's go!

54
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,917
Oh my.

55
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,041
Did you wait long?

56
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,666
You came too, Ambassador?

57
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,416
Welcome back, Counselor Kang.

58
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,874
Let me get the smell
of Seoul. Come here.

59
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,792
It's been a year for you, right?

60
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,417
Want a cigarette?

61
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,124
I haven't had time to
smoke even one today.

62
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,833
The school event ran late, so now
we're heading to meet the President.

63
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,375
The gifts for President Barre?

64
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,082
You're opening it here?

65
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:13,833
Need to know what they
are so I can explain it to him.

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,500
Damn it, I told them
to wrap them nicely.

67
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,375
Wait, this is booze.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,667
Can we give this in a Muslim country?

69
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,958
This here.

70
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:30,508
<i>1988 Seoul Olympics opening ceremony</i>
It shows the Somali athletes marching in?

71
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,791
What?

72
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,999
I requested it since President
Barre missed the opening ceremony.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You didn't check?

74
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,832
I just brought it here...

75
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,541
You should check these sort of things.

76
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,541
That's not my job.

77
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,874
With so few staff,
we all need to pitch in.

78
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,666
Then why didn't you
check with the Seoul office?

79
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,249
I carried the damn
thing back, and you...

80
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,291
Watch your tone.

81
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,583
Quiet! You two fighting again?

82
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,458
We don't have time.

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,417
Swama!

84
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,207
We have to leave for the
Presidential Palace now.

85
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,500
So you...

86
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,292
Take a taxi, okay?

87
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,000
Good work.

88
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,542
Bruce Lee!

89
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,792
Taxi?

90
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,875
Let's go!

91
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,749
Ambassador.

92
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,583
At last, meeting the president!

93
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,624
UN membership!

94
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,082
A promotion!

95
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,208
Now you're dreaming.

96
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,791
The gifts in the trunk, is
there time to wrap them?

97
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,582
Time isn't the problem.

98
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Where do we get them wrapped?

99
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:48,541
That Counselor Kang, he
should've taken care of it.

100
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:51,291
What more do you expect of the kid?

101
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,707
He's obviously got a
chip on his shoulder.

102
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,624
You said it.

103
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,833
Secretary, I know it's hard
working under a young officer,

104
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,291
but don't make your feelings obvious.

105
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,541
Sometimes it's really obvious.

106
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:07,624
I'm happy to work with
you, so I have no complaints.

107
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,999
But what's so great about
being an intelligence officer?

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,166
He was sent here as a demotion.

109
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,249
You think he likes it?

110
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,417
Try to get along, for all our sakes.

111
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,542
What's going on?

112
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,874
I'm the South Korean ambassador!

113
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,125
We are diplomats!

114
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,874
No! You can't take that!

115
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,082
It's for President Barre!

116
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,208
You'll be in serious
trouble! Internationally!

117
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,707
Swama.

118
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,208
Are you okay?

119
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,041
I'm okay.

120
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,166
You're okay?

121
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,291
- You okay, Ambassador Han?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:33,041
You mind waiting
here until help arrives?

123
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,124
Yes, I can do it.

124
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,542
I can do it.

125
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,958
What do you plan on doing?

126
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,208
What do you think? Getting
this meeting was so hard.

127
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,833
Let's run.

128
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,832
I said, run!

129
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,958
Okay...

Ambassador, wait!

133
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,249
But we made the
appointment three months ago.

141
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,707
Why is it canceled?

142
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,291
Your Excellency,

143
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,374
you are the ones that arrived late.

144
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,332
President Barre had another
appointment, so he couldn't wait.

145
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,333
No...

146
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,458
We're 15 minutes late,
and he had to leave?

147
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,541
Did he plan to talk to
us for only 15 minutes?

148
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,833
Sir, please calm down.

149
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,583
Who the hell is that?

150
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,832
Hey, Ambassador Rim!

151
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,291
Are you playing tricks again?

152
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,666
- Sir.
- Are you?

153
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,250
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

154
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,167
No...

155
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,541
President Barre's next appointment

156
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,083
is with North Korea?

<i>The flag bearer is the two-time

<i>The Somali delegation is now entering.</i>

160
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:20,458
Getting their meeting
canceled was a pointless act.

161
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,417
It was just for fun.

162
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,749
Oh my gosh.

163
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,458
Look at these bullet holes.

164
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,167
They could've been killed.

165
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,375
Swama.

166
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,624
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

167
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,499
It's okay.

168
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,332
I put on medicine.

169
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,375
Wait a sec.

170
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,582
Swama, this is a radish and an onion.

171
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,291
Radish, onion. Okay?

172
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,292
Okay.

173
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,708
Take home. Grind.

174
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,333
- Mix flour, okay?
- Yes, yes.

175
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,042
And you hurt...

176
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,582
Put here.

177
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,042
And sleep.

178
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,958

179
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,624

180
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,750
Thank you.

181
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:23,041
So you just stood there and
let them take the briefcase?

182
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,207
They shot at us with guns.

183
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,292
Didn't you see the bullet holes?

184
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,417
You think you could've stopped them?

185
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,750
Secretary Gong,

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
I'm a trained professional.

187
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,791
You didn't even call the cops?

188
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,417
No point.

189
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,041
It was obviously the North Koreans.

190
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,082
Of all the armed robberies
of diplomatic cars recently,

191
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,124
has anyone ever left the
car and only taken a bag?

192
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,916
Exactly.

193
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,875
The timing of it, and then
their ambassador shows up.

194
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,167
Must have been a leak.

195
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,750
What, so there's a spy among our staff?

196
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,583
What?

197
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,583
You said there was a leak.

198
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,333
How can you just blurt that out?

199
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,832
Why blame the whole staff for the
intelligence department's failure?

200
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,792
I'm the only intelligence officer here,

201
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,333
so you're accusing me?

202
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,458
When did I accuse you of leaking intel?

203
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:29,708
What's with you two?

204
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,041
Must be the Minister. What do we do?

205
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,042
Do what? Answer it.

206
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,957
And say what?

207
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,416
You're not going to
report the failed meeting?

208
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,207
Want me to buy us some time?

209
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,750
What will that solve?

210
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,042
Yes?

211
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,125
Yes, Somalia Ambassador
Han Shin-sung speaking. Hello?

212
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,874
I can't hear you well, sir.

213
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,916
Minister?

214
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:03,666
There's construction here.

215
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,583
I think it's a problem with the line.

216
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,666
Is it the generator? Did I lose you?

217
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:13,833
Hello? Minister! I'll call back later!

218
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,750
There are some advantages
to being in Africa after all.

219
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,250
Secretary Gong, will you leave us?

220
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,791
What?

221
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,707
I've got something to
discuss with Counselor Kang.

222
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,333
Oh, sure.

223
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,000
- Get some rest.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:55,667
Secretary Gong, he's more
diplomat than human sometimes.

225
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,250
There's a reason he hasn't
been promoted at his age.

226
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,083
No flexibility, that guy.

227
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:12,041
He may be rude, but try to understand
him. We're all one family.

228
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:16,166
I guess I have no choice,
since he's your little lapdog.

229
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,458
Counselor Kang, what
do you take me for?

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,625
I can't believe you'd say that.

231
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
Just 6 people in this embassy,

232
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:29,042
and you're the only
one I can really talk to.

233
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,166
I feel so bad making
you feel that way...

234
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:37,042
- There you go again.
- Breaks my heart, really.

235
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:39,958
Ambassador.

236
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,957
- This time...
- That's enough.

237
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,957
Can you really give
me your full support?

238
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,417
Who would I give it to besides you?

239
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,330
<i>Two hours earlier</i>

240
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,333
No, no.

241
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,082
Your favorite Korean cigarettes!

242
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,750
God, bloody hell.

243
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,499
The rebels wanted to
send out a message,

244
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,042
so I just interviewed
their General Aidid and

245
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,707
took some photographs of his guys.

246
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,249
He just wanted to brag about how well

247
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,130
they're adapting to their
training and all that.

248
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,707
Really?

249
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,708
What did the CIA or MI6 say?

250
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,292
Well, they don't reckon they're
ready for civil war just yet.

251
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,042
Very strange...

252
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:15,708
If it's not war business,

253
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,916
why...

254
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,749
North Koreans sell weapons?

255
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,417
Who? The North Koreans?

256
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:27,999
This is a Type 68 assault
rifle, in production since 1968.

257
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,249
This is a Type 78 AK-47
rifle modified for snipers.

258
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,541
Made in North Korea.

259
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:38,291
The reporter who took the photo
almost wet his pants when I told him.

260
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,082
You're sure they're
really from North Korea?

261
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,208
Does it matter? I'm not
the one writing the story.

262
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,208
This is Africa. Africa...

263
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,457
<i>In a country where war
can break out at any time,</i>

264
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,875
<i>selling weapons to rebels is
as hot an issue as they come.</i>

265
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,874
<i>If that story runs,</i>

266
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,707
<i>meet with the Somali foreign minister,</i>

267
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,207
<i>threaten to cut off aid,</i>

268
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,916
<i>and President Barre will have
no choice but to join our side.</i>

269
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:13,874
<i>More than anything,</i>

270
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,749
<i>get the Somalian president's
pledge to support</i>

271
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,583
<i>South Korean membership in the UN.</i>

272
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,082
Good morning, Your Excellency.

273
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,749
Good morning, Mr. Ambassador.

274
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
Hello, Counselor.

275
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,999
Thank you for coming this hour.

276
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,041
My pleasure.

277
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,041
Your Excellency, do you know that

278
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:49,792
North Korea is arming the
rebels through Ethiopia?

279
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,208
That's the latest rumor?

280
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,499
The guns in this photo,

281
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,875
you know they were
manufactured in North Korea?

282
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,832
Last month, when a North
Korean delegation came

283
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,999
and promised to
support your government,

284
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,542
they even visited the
arms factory here, right?

285
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,792
But look...

286
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,541
You request military
aid from North Korea,

287
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,875
then they support the rebels?

288
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,542
That doesn't make sense.

289
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,291
Ambassador Han,
let's not get sidetracked

290
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:35,207
on North Korea or
the rebels or whatever.

291
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,916
Just tell me what you want.

292
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,457
North Korea has started lobbying
ministers in other departments,

293
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,833
to block your efforts at
getting UN membership.

294
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,792
But you know,

295
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,207
I like the government of South
Korea more than anyone

296
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,125
and consider you my very good friend.

297
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,250
So I was thinking...

298
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,791
The government of South Korea needs
to use their money more efficiently.

299
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,332
For example, that program to
take five of our tech students

300
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,874
to Korea to train them...

301
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,082
Isn't that program already
getting good marks

302
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,250
from both our governments?

303
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,332
You'll have to bear
with me, Ambassador.

304
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,291
This is just an example.

305
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:17,249
Now, two of my sons happen to be studying
industrial technology in the U.S.

306
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,208
Let's say Seoul adds $25,000 for each,

307
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,875
so $50,000 in total for their
aforementioned training fellowship.

308
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:36,624
You want a $50,000
scholarship for your sons?

309
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,666
President Barre may speak at the UN,

310
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,499
but ask yourself who
writes his speeches,

311
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,625
and who steers his foreign policy?

312
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:59,999
This so-called government is
just a pack of relatives and thugs.

313
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,417
How can I do diplomacy with them?

314
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:08,375
Counselor, does the KCIA
have any cash we can use?

315
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:14,082
How can you ask me that?

316
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,749
You blow the chance I gave
you, and now you want more?

317
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,416
But the North Koreans are
lobbying, what can we do?

318
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,250
If it takes cash to
stop them, so be it.

319
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,541
You know what that cash is for.

320
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,583
You think you can just dip
into our operation funds?

321
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:34,666
You keep forgetting what
kind of person you're talking to.

322
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,000
What's with your tone?

323
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,457
Look, wherever you came
from, I'm your boss here!

324
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,250
Look at me when I'm talking!

325
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,875
I think you've got other
things to worry about.

326
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:57,207
Cheating on me right in the open.

327
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,166
Hey! Hey, wait!

328
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,083
Wait there!

329
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,749
Wait!

330
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,167
Is there really a leak?

331
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,208
Ambassador Rim!

332
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,750
Ambassador Rim.

333
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,417
I want a word with you.

334
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,875
What is it?

335
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,874
Let's play by the rules.

336
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,666
Ambassador Han.

337
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,500
Maintain your dignity.

338
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,916
How long will you
keep up this sabotage?

339
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,292
Sabotage?

340
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,667
What about you, spreading
lies about us arming the rebels?

341
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,582
Is lying your method of diplomacy?

342
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,999
Why blame us for that?

343
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,457
It's in the newspaper
with photos and all.

344
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,957
Just don't get caught selling
weapons in the first place.

345
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,666
What is this bullshit?

346
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,916
Hey, don't cross the line.

347
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,416
We're just standing here,
you're the ones crossing the line.

348
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,958
- I'll chop your head off.
- Not here, stop it.

349
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:03,708
We were in Africa working
our tails off 20 years before you.

350
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,167
You think these stunts
will get you anywhere?

351
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:14,167
So quit selling out your compatriots
for the sake of the UN membership.

352
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,249
What's going on?

353
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,457
Rebels!

354
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,499
They started a riot, and
now they're demanding

355
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,166
that we release Islamic leaders
arrested by the government.

356
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,375
Can we get out?

357
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,125
No. Everything's on lockdown.

358
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,707
But don't worry.

359
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,500
Barre will take care
of this in no time.

360
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,792
Damn it!

361
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,957
No instructions from Seoul yet?

362
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,958
No.

363
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:37,333
The Ambassador and Counselor Kang
are safe in a hotel, so don't worry.

364
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,124
Try calling your family at home.

365
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,832
What do I say?

366
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,082
My daughter's studying
for her entrance exam.

367
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,125
I shouldn't worry her.

368
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,500
Ma'am?

369
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:56,250
I was supposed to phone my kids today.

370
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,750
Sure, go ahead, don't worry.

371
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,832
But are they asleep now?

372
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,832
Yes, they must be.

373
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,541
The Ambassador will be back, no hurry.

374
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:13,166
While we wait for him,

375
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,583
shall we pray together?

376
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,499
Shall we?

377
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,749
♪ Nearer my God, ♪

378
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,374
♪ to Thee... ♪

379
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,124
She knows I'm Buddhist!

380
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,332
You think I'm Christian?

381
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,917
Just pray to Buddha in your heart.

382
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,999
Amen.

383
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,999
We pray for the safe return of
Deacon Han and Believer Kang.

384
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,332
Let us begin with the Apostles' Creed.

385
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,875
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

386
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:45,375
Oh no!

387
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,250
Isn't that our driver Swama?

388
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,208
What's he doing here?

389
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,208
Careful!

390
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,083
Isn't this...

391
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,250
the mark of the rebels?

392
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,749
What?

393
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,750
Then is he a rebel?

394
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,707
Don't be ridiculous. It's just a scarf.

395
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:27,541
Maybe someone gave
it to him for his wounds.

396
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,167
But his neck is fine.

397
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:36,208
What if he's really a rebel?
We need to send him away.

398
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,792
He can't be a rebel.

399
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:46,708
He's unconscious, how
do we send him away?

400
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:51,583
If we're not careful, we
could get hurt, Ma'am.

401
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,457
How about calling the police?

402
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,792
But if he's a real rebel,

403
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:03,332
they might think we
aided the rebels all along.

404
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,541
But we didn't!

405
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:09,749
At home they turn innocent
students into Communist spies,

406
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,750
you think that can't happen in Somalia?

407
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:21,042
I'm just saying the political
system here isn't developed yet.

408
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:24,999
Watch what you say, especially
in front of Counselor Kang.

409
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,042
Okay.

410
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,583
Who is it?

411
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,499
It's the police.

412
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,541
Listen. You can't...

413
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,332
not come in here...

414
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,874
Shouldn't we move
Swama now just in case?

415
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,416
Now?

416
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:44,958
How can we carry him?

417
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,958
Oh no! They're pushing in!

418
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,874
What's going on?

419
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,875
He is boss. Ambassador!

420
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,958
It's the police.

421
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,832
They say a demonstrator
is hiding in our embassy,

422
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,291
and they want to come in.

423
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,291
What kind of bullshit
is that? Is it true?

424
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:09,249
Well...

425
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,458
Hey. Who's the boss?

426
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,082
We're looking for one of the
instigators of the riots today,

427
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,958
and we'd like your
cooperation in finding him.

428
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,666
This is Korea government land.

429
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,250
You can't. Never. This.

430
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,375
Damn, I'm too worked up to talk!

431
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,749
Secretary Gong, come
here and translate this.

432
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,707
Okay.

433
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:38,666
Your job during a riot is to
protect embassies like ours,

434
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:41,667
and I don't see a single
one of you doing that!

435
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,957
What? Can you repeat...

436
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,500
Hey! You!

437
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,166
Yes, you!

438
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,666
You just trespassed on
South Korean territory.

439
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:56,083
You want me to call
the Chief of Police?

440
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,792
ID.

441
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,917
Stop it.

442
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,625
You stupid asshole!

443
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,332
- Sir?
- Yeah?

444
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,707
Yes?

445
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,624
What?

446
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,249
Yes?

447
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,375
What is it?

448
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,666
I have something to tell you.

449
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:06,667
Say it!

450
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,750
- Honey!
- Are you crazy?

451
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:13,333
What a circus. Did you let him in?

452
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,458
Where's Swama?

453
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,458
Where is he?

Things often get stormy in
this region, so don't panic.

485
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,375
The radio! Let's listen to the news.

486
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,249
- Down with dictatorship!
- Down with dictatorship!

487
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,791
- Drive out Barre!
- Drive out Barre!

488
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:49,541
Without any Koreans to
look after, can't we pull out?

489
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,917
Public servants can't
act without an order.

490
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,957
The CIA says it'll be fine.

491
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,499
Should we believe everything they say?

492
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,792
This is hardly the first time
they've predicted war here.

493
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,417
Think of Korea.

494
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,124
Every day they predict war.

495
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:08,707
At least in Korea, we know
what info is real or fake.

496
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:11,750
Over here, can we be sure of anything?

497
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,167
Honey.

498
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:23,208
Don't stay here. You go back to Seoul.

499
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:24,957
And you?

500
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,874
It took me 28 years to get here.

501
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,541
Should I ruin it all with a month left?

502
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,167
They can't demote you
for escaping danger.

503
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,207
We spent three years here

00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,041

of our daughter's schooling!

so they'll do something.

So I should leave you

508
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,625
You're a family member,
not a public servant.

509
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:54,833
I'm calling the travel agent
tomorrow, so get ready.

510
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,500
It's mine!

511
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,375

<i>Hello everyone!</i>

542
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:18,875
<i>We have come from far-off
South Korea to be your friends.</i>

543
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:31,042
<i>For the sake of Somalia's
development and prosperity,</i>

544
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:40,000
<i>we promise to become
good friends as one family.</i>

545
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,167
<i>Family members like friends,</i>

546
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,667
<i>friends like family members...</i>

547
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:02,375
<i>Remember that in good times or bad,</i>

548
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:14,292
<i>we South Koreans will
always stand by your side!</i>

549
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,417
The rebels have
taken the radio station?

550
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,667
It's a different frequency.

551
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,417
It's a civilian uprising.

552
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,667
Rebel forces haven't arrived
yet, so it's not a state of war.

553
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:00,957
You need to keep calm.

554
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,791
The rebels are calling for the
president's head on the radio,

555
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,167
and I should keep calm?

556
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,875
Do we have any kind of intel at all?

557
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,750
The people in Seoul...

558
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,042
don't even know what's
happening to us, right?

559
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,083
We're isolated here.

560
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:24,917
Why...

561
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,582
Why do I have to die
in a foreign country?

562
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,999
You're not going to die!

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,166
Hey!

564
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:36,458
Let's take one thing at a time.

565
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,625
Sir, we need to request protection.

566
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:44,917
You said the ministers
ran off. Who do we ask?

567
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,999
Stop!

568
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,708
- Counselor Kang! Stop...
- I saw it.

569
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,208
Who do we have here?

570
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,208
If it isn't the scary Korean diplomat.

571
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,582
Assalamu alaikum!

572
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,042
What brings you here at this hour?

573
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,583
With a date, no less.

574
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,000
- I want to meet Chief.
- You have an appointment?

575
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,082
Our phone all died.

576
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,582
Well, that's too bad then.

577
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,792
Because the chief is busy.

578
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,207
How about deputy chief?

579
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,500
Busy.

580
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,167
In that case...

581
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:41,332
I will see the...

582
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,249
What's the English for "haengjungkwan"?

583
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,624
Administrator.

584
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,707
I will see the administrator.

585
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,083
Nope. Busy.

586
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:52,374
And since this is a state
of national emergency,

587
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,208
diplomatic privileges don't apply.

588
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,625
You have no authority!

589
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,916
I am a trained man.

590
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:12,083
You're also in Somali
government jurisdiction.

591
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,707
My jurisdiction!

592
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,375
So you don't call the shots here.

593
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,749
Now,

594
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,083
go back.

595
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,041
Translate what I'm about to say.

596
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,042
What?

597
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:38,374
Arrest me! Shit, arrest me!

598
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,457
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

599
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,166
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

600
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,124
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

601
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,875
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

602
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:50,042
You got a death wish?

603
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,082
Go ahead and shoot, asshole!

604
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,874
Shoot me if you can!

605
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,207
Translate for me!

606
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,333
Your commissioner is
watching. Deliver this message.

607
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:07,125
Your commissioner's name is
on our embassy's contact list.

608
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:14,124
If the rebels take our embassy, we
won't be the only ones going down.

609
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,999
You want to get your family out, right?

610
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,332
Somali money is as good as toilet paper.
And I bet you don't have enough dollars.

611
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:24,666
So take our cash, and
send us police protection.

612
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,667
Okay?

613
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:46,455
<i>December 30, 1990</i>

614
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:03,372
<i>The rebels enter Mogadishu</i>

615
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,499
- He's a policeman!
- No!

616
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,250
He killed Swama!

617
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:46,958
I'm not a policeman!

618
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:51,916
Punish the murderer!

619
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,250
It's not me!

620
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,292
I'm on your side!

621
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,250
Please!

622
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:26,375
All these people came here
to get on the evacuation plane.

623
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:30,707
Even if you are diplomats, we
can't let you board an aircraft

624
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,874
unless it's been sent
by your government.

625
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:36,124
We have no way of
contacting our government.

626
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,625
All our communications are down.

627
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,166
That's your problem.

628
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,833
We have no choice.

629
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,582
I know...

630
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,042
But that plane. From
Nairobi Airport, right?

631
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:54,291
There tower... Contact
Nairobi Tower can...

632
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:56,332
What is it? Just tell me.

633
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,833
The control tower!

634
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,167
Can you try to contact the
Korean Embassy in Kenya with it?

635
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,917
I'm sorry.

636
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,416
We're North Korean
diplomats. Who's in charge here?

637
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,124
We need to get to the airport.

638
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,207
You can't go to the airport. Turn back.

639
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,707
Travel restrictions will soon
be enforced for all of Mogadishu.

640
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:26,874
Travel restrictions?

641
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,250
Then the airport will be closed too?

642
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:35,166
<i>Since the rebel troops entered
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia,</i>

643
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,374
<i>the gunfights between
the Somali government</i>

644
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,957
<i>military forces and the rebels</i>

645
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,957
<i>have been taking place
every day throughout the city.</i>

646
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,374
<i>The future of the country is now bleak.</i>

647
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:48,541
<i>And the security of all
foreigners in Somalia...</i>

648
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,832
We have no electricity,
water or communications,

649
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:52,292
and no gas for the generator.

650
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:57,416
And the defense chief who issues
travel passes has fled the city.

651
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,083
Don't worry.

652
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,041
His nephew is still selling passes.

653
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,041
Our informants have gone to get them.

654
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:08,124
Our bigger problem is we have no food.

655
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,417
I told you to secure food!

656
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,457
No matter how much cash we offer,
no one has enough even for themselves.

657
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,500
What should I do?

658
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:18,875
Turn off the light!

659
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,417
Here they are.

660
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:28,792
Rest easy and turn the lights on.

661
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,708
It's the informants I
sent to buy travel passes.

662
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:34,625
Get ready to leave.

663
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,457
There are rebels nearby.
Can we talk inside?

664
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,625
Come on.

665
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,750
We'll talk inside...

666
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,000
You son of a bitch!

667
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:43,750
Watch! Money!

668
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:45,833
Min-seo!

669
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:58,333
Hey!

670
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,583
Stop!

671
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:24,875
What the hell are you doing?

672
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,458
I told you not to hurt anyone.

673
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,042
Go move the stuff!

674
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,207
No more debts to you now.

675
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,541
The kids from school saved your life.

676
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:41,500
Now, you better leave, or my
brothers will be back for you.

677
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:04,500
What do we do without the
last of our food and the car?

678
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,624
And your insulin...

679
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,750
Don't let our comrades know.

680
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,832
We'll take refuge in
the Chinese Embassy.

681
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,957
We have no travel pass,
what if we get caught?

682
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,666
Better to get caught
by government troops.

683
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:26,417
At least they'll guarantee
the safety of diplomats.

684
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:33,958
So all of you pack quickly,
and steel your hearts.

685
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:36,375
From now on, our goal...

686
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,792
is survival.

687
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,497
<i>Chinese Embassy</i>

688
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:19,833
Everyone come in.

689
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:23,458
Go in. Go in.

690
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,374
The only option now

691
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:29,082
is to somehow get to the
airport and board a rescue flight.

692
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,417
We barely made it here.

693
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,416
With the kids, we'll
never reach the airport.

694
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:34,417
Even so,

695
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,999
we can't go back.

696
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,125
Comrade Ambassador!

697
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,542
There are Chinese here!

698
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,542
Run away!

699
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,958
Stay low! Keep going!

700
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,957
Come quickly! Quickly!

701
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,542
Stay by the wall.

702
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:12,791
How much longer do we have
to guard the South Koreans?

703
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:15,167
To leave, you'll need money.

704
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,708
What are you doing?

705
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,541
This isn't right.

706
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:46,249
They've got armed guards.

707
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,000
Is this because you're out of insulin?

708
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,124
What?

709
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,291
Beg the South Korean bastards for help,

710
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:54,750
and turn even our
children into traitors?

711
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:59,124
What's the point in surviving
here just to get purged back home?

712
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,792
You think I'm planning to defect?

713
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:07,292
If there's trouble, we'll just
take over their embassy.

714
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:13,208
From now on, don't stop
me if you have no other ideas.

715
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,541
Don't shoot!

716
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,542
Don't shoot.

717
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:27,583
Ambassador Han!

718
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,208
Ambassador Han Shin-sung!

719
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:32,957
It's Ambassador Rim!

720
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,542
- It's the North Koreans, right?
- Ambassador Han!

721
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,207
Don't shoot!

722
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:42,666
We're from the North Korean Embassy!

723
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:43,749
Hey, hey!

724
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,874
Stop, stop!

725
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,292
I said stop, asshole!

726
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,541
Ambassador Han, talk to me!

727
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:52,042
What's going on?

728
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:57,958
I'm the North Korean
Ambassador Rim Yong-su!

729
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,499
I'm here to see Ambassador Han.

730
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,291
But what's your purpose coming here?

731
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:05,208
We met a mob on the way to the
Chinese Embassy and ended up here.

732
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,292
The Chinese Embassy is that way.

733
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:12,958
Turn back!

734
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,832
There are women and children with us.

735
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:16,875
Come out!

736
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:22,499
As you can see, we're all unarmed!

737
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,500
Unarmed?

738
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,208
What are they scheming now?

739
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:30,416
So tell us your
business! Your business!

740
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:31,667
That rotten scoundrel!

741
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,958
They know why we're here,
they're just humiliating us.

742
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,708
Hide, quick!

743
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,917
Please, at least take the children!

744
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:45,624
Are you mad?

745
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,791
Who told you to beg
to the South Koreans?

746
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:51,500
If State Security had secured
our safety, we wouldn't be here!

747
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:54,416
I'll rip your head off for saying that!

748
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:55,874
Counselor Tae!

749
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:56,958
What are they doing?

750
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,791
Creeping around at night
in such a dangerous place.

751
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,207
In front of another embassy...

752
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,458
But Ambassador.

753
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,957
This could be our lucky chance.

754
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:07,999
What?

755
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,833
Has an entire embassy
ever defected before?

756
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,374
Don't get any ideas,
just send them away.

757
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:43,458
They have kids there,
you'll just let them die?

758
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:45,792
What about us?

759
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,124
Go away! Just go back!

760
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,325
- Someone's there!
- We're all in danger with you there!

761
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,542
Just go inside!

762
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:31,333
Stay the hell away, you assholes!

763
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,917
Come on out.

764
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:01,957
Then what is it, huh?

765
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,124
What do you want?

766
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,458
Hey.

767
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:08,000
Our embassy was
attacked by armed rioters.

768
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:12,916
That's not our problem.

769
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:15,208
As you see, we have children here.

770
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,582
Consider it as a humanitarian gesture.

771
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,417
After all you did to us, you
appeal to our humanity?

772
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:25,875
You said not to sell
out your compatriots.

773
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:28,375
Ambassador Han.

774
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,125
We have nowhere to go.

775
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:48,083
Taking kids into the streets
in a situation like this...

776
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,000
What time is it?

777
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,208
Have the kids eaten?

778
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,458
Let them in.

779
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,457
Prepare your IDs. Luggage on this side.

780
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:28,624
You'll be searched before
entering, so line up by family.

781
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:32,332
I heard they're trained to kill
people with their bare hands.

782
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,666
The Ambassador's trusting
Counselor Kang too much.

783
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:38,457
You try talking him out of it.

784
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:42,332
They've got kids, will
they really try anything?

785
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:45,708
You know North Korean
kids all get military training?

786
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,291
Come forward.

787
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,375
Arms up.

788
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:46,207
This is not what we agreed to.

789
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,749
They are too many people to protect.

790
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,874
What?

791
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,707
Hey. Many people, no problem!

792
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,291
Your job.

793
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,874
Protect embassy.

794
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:56,291
This is same.

795
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,041
Well, you still have to
give us more money.

796
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,042
We are out of bullets.

797
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,500
What a bunch of thieves.

798
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:17,750
As you can see, we don't have much,

799
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:20,542
but please eat your fill.

800
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,750
Okay, let's eat.

801
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,750
Aren't you hungry?

802
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:10,292
Okay?

803
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:25,875
Give this over there.

804
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,333
Oh, Lord!

805
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:30,292
You scared me. You
shouldn't wander alone.

806
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,792
Go back to your family.

807
01:08:36,792 --> 01:08:39,124
Do you have sugar?

808
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,750
Sugar? Why?

809
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:44,249
You want something sweet?

810
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,875
Want a cookie?

811
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:47,667
Not for me.

812
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,458
Then who?

813
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,083
Medicine for my grandpa...

814
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:56,582
Medicine?

815
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:58,875
He has diabetes?

816
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:07,791
Your wife told my wife.

817
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:10,874
That the rioters even
stole your medicine.

818
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:13,625
But Secretary Gong has
diabetes, so we have insulin.

819
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,375
It's fortunate.

820
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,458
Well, not that Secretary
Gong has diabetes...

821
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,750
She shouldn't have told you.

822
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,667
But thank you.

823
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,582
Is it inconvenient being left-handed?

824
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:41,583
What?

825
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,375
You use your left hand.

826
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:48,250
Not as much as diabetes.
I use both hands.

827
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:51,167
Don't want people calling me a leftist.

828
01:09:53,417 --> 01:10:00,375
But with the rebels in charge,
why would they loot the embassy

829
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:02,792
of the country that armed them?

830
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:07,541
You really believe we
sold weapons to the rebels?

831
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:09,582
No reason not to believe it.

832
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,250
You don't want to know the truth.

833
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:17,207
Even if you did, it wouldn't
change your mind.

834
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:21,500
Just like we assume it was
you who spread those rumors.

835
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:26,667
I'm starting to learn that
sometimes there are two truths.

836
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,666
Anyway, since you are here,

837
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:35,125
why don't you explain
your position clearly?

838
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,917
Do you think we're going
to defect to South Korea?

839
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:48,207
Let's do honest diplomacy.
Honest, okay?

840
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,333
You didn't come here to eat dinner.

841
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:55,375
Just as a person or
a nation has dignity,

842
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,667
there is dignity to diplomacy, too.

843
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:03,041
We didn't throw away
our pride coming here.

844
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:04,249
Okay.

845
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,832
Ambassador Rim, I know
you're much more experienced

846
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:09,666
and capable than I am.

847
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:13,375
But still, you're not in a
position right now to lecture me.

848
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,958
It's just the two of us here.

849
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:21,207
Let's have dialogue, not a lecture.

850
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,250
Let's speak from the heart.

851
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:29,083
Are you even grateful
to us for what we did?

852
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:42,832
Hey, you know the water's cut off!

853
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:46,582
How could you take a dump like that?

854
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,208
That's not my poo...

855
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:23,875
Ma'am,

856
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:28,667
would you like to sleep
in that room there?

857
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,083
I'm fine here.

858
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:37,750
I've got some ginseng liquor...

859
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,583
You have it.

860
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,624
No point in us staying here.

861
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,167
Let's just go, quick!

862
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,705
<i>North Korea passport</i>

863
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:27,207
<i>NAME: BAE YONG-SOOK
YEAR OF BIRTH: 1935</i>

864
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:30,375
<i>CONVERSION CERTIFICATE</i>

865
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,250
Damn it...

866
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:52,374
<i>CONVERSION CERTIFICATE</i>

867
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:53,583
A conversion certificate.

868
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:00,333
So you're planning to drag us to Seoul?

869
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:02,832
Hey! Shit...

870
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:04,707
Hey, did we ask you here?

871
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,917
You came yourselves!

872
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:12,500
Your guards all ran away,
so you've got some nerve.

873
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,667
You scoundrel!

874
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:38,082
Honey, it sounds like
trouble, shouldn't you go?

875
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,417
- Me?
- Yeah.

876
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,541
I need to protect all of you.

877
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:44,667
The guards. Get the guards.

878
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:47,917
Damn...

879
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:14,792
What is this, huh?

880
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,583
What is this?

881
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,457
Apologize, you rotten scoundrel.

882
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,207
Or fight to the end.

883
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,249
You shithead!

884
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,082
A commie like you
should be ripped to pieces

885
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,667
and thrown into the
battlefield outside,

886
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,083
but, shit, I'm
restraining myself, okay?

887
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,542
What is this?

888
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,292
What's going on?

889
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,166
Comrade Ambassador,

890
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:52,833
I caught these
bastards trying to use us.

891
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:56,000
To make us defect,

892
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,375
they were forging
conversion certificates.

893
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,958
I heard you, so stop.

894
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:07,957
Was this your order?
Or did he plan it himself?

895
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,332
Let's speak alone.

896
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,707
If those people don't
convert to our side,

897
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,166
we're violating the
National Security Law.

898
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:15,542
What violation?

899
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,666
You think we're plotting
some rebellion here?

900
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,791
Then why in hell should
we be protecting them?

901
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:21,874
What bullshit.

902
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:24,249
The guards are gone,
who's protecting who?

903
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,208
Your police guard ran away!

904
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,207
What's this?

905
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:38,083
They charge for protection by the head,

906
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,125
can we afford that?

907
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,374
The conversion certificates
were made without my order

908
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,042
by our Counselor alone.

909
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,042
As the person in charge, I apologize.

910
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,749
We might've done the same.

911
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,874
It's water under the bridge.

912
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,625
That's not the important issue now.

913
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,166
What will you do now?

914
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,832
We've already abandoned our embassy,

915
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,541
so we don't mind leaving here.

916
01:17:19,542 --> 01:17:20,542
And you?

917
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,999
We won't last long here without guards.

918
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
We need a way out, too.

919
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:32,707
If we combine our diplomatic
and intelligence capabilities,

920
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,292
can we find a way?

921
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:39,832
You think we can
accomplish more together?

922
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:43,667
Neither of us will make it
out without outside help.

923
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:48,708
If we try our Western allies, and
you work your Communist allies,

924
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,624
maybe a route will open.

925
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:55,291
But it's not just up to us two.

926
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:58,332
Will your Counselor and staff agree?

927
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,417
That's my responsibility as Ambassador.

928
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:05,082
Let's state our goal clearly.

929
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:06,832
We're not aiming for reunification,

930
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:10,332
we're just banding together
to find a way out, okay?

931
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:14,291
Let's forget this and go
our own way at daybreak.

932
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,541
Let's not get into a
conspiracy with the South.

933
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:18,708
What damned conspiracy?

934
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,582
You think that ridiculous
conversion certificate

935
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:23,083
will be any effective?

936
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:25,707
Your tone is a bit...

937
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:29,499
Counselor, don't break
the flow here. Let's proceed.

938
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,541
Anyway, whether North or South,

939
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:34,749
let's try arranging a route
out through the big embassies.

940
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,332
The Americans have pulled
out, so that's not an option.

941
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:41,624
The Italian Embassy is
close, and might be fastest.

942
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:44,832
Besides, Italy once helped
Somalia under a trusteeship,

943
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:48,874
so they have more influence than the
US, and they still send rescue planes.

944
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:52,875
We're not diplomatic partners
with Italy, so will they help us?

945
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,708
Not a likely solution for us.

946
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:58,583
Look,

947
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,582
if we go 500 km south to Kismaayo Port,

948
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,667
we can take a boat to Kenya.

949
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,707
500 km, are you kidding?
How will you go 500 km?

950
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,666
You got a car for all those people?

951
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:11,582
And gas?

952
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,874
What if you run into rebels?

953
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,541
Don't you even think?

954
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,124
Hey, did I ask you to come with us?

955
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,333
Why are you...

956
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:23,125
Everyone calm down and look at this.

957
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:25,000
Here,

958
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:28,082
the Egyptian Embassy still stands.

959
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:31,124
We can ask them if
there's a way to reach Cairo.

960
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,916
South Korea has no
diplomatic relations with Egypt,

961
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:35,333
so bad luck for you.

962
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,541
We have a consulate there.

963
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:39,583
Let's do this.

964
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,582
We'll take the Italian Embassy,

965
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:46,542
you take the Egyptian Embassy,
and we'll see which way works best.

966
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,833
What if...

967
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:54,542
only one side is offered a way out?

968
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,583
At least some of us will live.

969
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:53,624
Don't open the gate, even for police.

970
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:54,707
Okay.

971
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:55,833
I'll pray.

972
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:45,291
Don't, don't!

973
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:46,499
Please spare me!

974
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,500
What is it?

975
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:55,458
Back up!

976
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,333
Sir!

977
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,583
Ambassador Mario is
on the phone with Italy.

978
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:24,707
Not sure how long it'll take.

979
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:25,708
Really?

980
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,042
Wait.

981
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,083
You mean their phones are connected?

982
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:35,457
It's a battlefield over
here, a battlefield.

983
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,917
Don't you even watch the news?

984
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,792
Are you just telling
me to die over here?

985
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:41,833
Hello...

986
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,332
What did they say?

987
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,750
I reached the Korean Embassy in Kenya,

988
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,333
but they can't send a plane.

989
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,917
Ambassador Han!

990
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:00,542
Ambassador.

991
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,375
So I heard there are 20 of you in all?

992
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,082
Including children, yes.

993
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,917
Okay, we do have a Red
Cross medical plane. Right?

994
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,542
But...

995
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:14,457
Look, Ambassador. Frankly speaking,

996
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,124
we can't take North Koreans

997
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,582
whom we don't have
diplomatic ties with,

998
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:21,333
when we can barely fit all of
our own people on the plane.

999
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:27,333
So why don't we evacuate
South Koreans first?

1000
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,458
What are you contemplating? Say okay.

1001
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,583
And the North Koreans?

1002
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:38,416
They can ask at the Egyptian Embassy.

1003
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,708
What if they say no?

1004
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,041
Just second please.

1005
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:45,583
- Just second.
- Okay.

1006
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:49,708
After all this, you'll
give up our ticket out?

1007
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,624
If we'd made them
defect from the beginning,

1008
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,792
they'd be South Koreans
and they could all come.

1009
01:24:58,042 --> 01:24:59,042
Exactly!

1010
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:02,500
Ambassador Mario.

1011
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,416
Actually,

1012
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:09,583
those North Koreans
have defected to our side.

1013
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,041
I'm sorry...

1014
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:21,583
But as you can see,
we're in no position to help.

1015
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:25,957
Can you at least help us contact
the North Korean Embassy in Cairo?

1016
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,707
We want tell that we're safe.

1017
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,583
But all our communications are down.

1018
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,207
Well that...

1019
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,541
I can try.

1020
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:38,499
Can you also contact the South
Korean Consulate General in Cairo?

1021
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,582
South Korea?

1022
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:40,583
Yes.

1023
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,500
What's taking them so long?

1024
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:51,208
If you'd said we'll go
alone, we'd be on the plane.

1025
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,832
What are you thinking?

1026
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,833
They're not really going to defect.

1027
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,332
Will you take responsibility
if it all falls through?

1028
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,541
Responsibility?

1029
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:03,250
Our seats are secure.

1030
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,542
There's a way we can both live.

1031
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:11,750
Need to try what we can.

1032
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,708
We should never have
let them in last night.

1033
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,750
Right?

1034
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:32,208
Let's just think of
getting on the plane.

1035
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:39,875
Ambassador.

1036
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:45,582
Well, the South Korean Government
officially requested to our government

1037
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,082
to assist them.

1038
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,166
Okay so thankfully,

1039
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:51,542
everyone in your party will get
a place on the evacuation plane.

1040
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,374
But the plane may arrive later today,

1041
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,582
so I need you to get back

1042
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:58,167
by 4PM at the latest and stand by.

1043
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,375
- Grazie! Grazie mille!
- It's okay.

1044
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,500
Ask if they can possibly
let us borrow a car.

1045
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:07,083
A car?

1046
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:10,417
We don't have enough cars for everyone.

1047
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:32,583
What are they doing?

1048
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:51,416
Ambassador, can we talk privately?

1049
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:52,417
Yes.

1050
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,250
Counselor Kang.

1051
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,499
We got a car from the Egyptians,
so transportation is no problem,

1052
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,666
but if we drive out and run
into some rebels like before,

1053
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,166
we're dead meat.

1054
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:10,499
We need to wait for one
side to get the upper hand.

1055
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,249
Is that rescue plane some
kind of taxi you can flag down?

1056
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:17,249
If you don't catch that
plane, what'll you do then?

1057
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,708
Lower your voice.
You're scaring people.

1058
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:24,625
I heard the Egyptian
Embassy can't help you?

1059
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:30,207
You saw on the way, the
whole city's a battleground.

1060
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,583
Waiting is pointless.

1061
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,958
What will you do?

1062
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:35,792
We're going.

1063
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:46,000
Have you got any extra books?

1064
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:47,708
Books?

1065
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:06,000
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

1066
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:09,166
- Turn it!
- Careful.

1067
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:10,375
Look out!

1068
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,083
Oh, Lord!

1069
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:23,708
What are you doing in this emergency?

1070
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,333
Hey kids, fill these with dirt.

1071
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,542
You're going to kill
us before we even go!

1072
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:08,917
Why take it off?

1073
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,707
If you use too much, we'll run out.

1074
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,167
How will it support the weight?

1075
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:19,207
Look at this. This should
go here, and then that there...

1076
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:20,541
So we can drive...

1077
01:30:20,542 --> 01:30:23,042
Do we have to stick them inside?

1078
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:26,000

1079
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:28,999
Hey, everyone!

1080
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,916
It's time to go.

1081
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:33,832
We need to get there
before afternoon prayer ends.

1082
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:35,999
Get in!

1083
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,708
Everyone, move! Don't just stand there!

1084
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:59,083

1085
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:16,875

It's okay, they're government troops.

1093
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,708
Give me the white flag.

1094
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,125
Damn...

1095
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,542
Give me that. Yes, that.

Back up!

1101
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:54,917
Look out behind!

1102
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:00,042
Don't turn your head!

1103
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,042
Follow me!

1104

Watch out for the gun!

1113
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:15,042
- Honey, watch out!
- You scoundrel!

1114
01:39:17,042 --> 01:39:19,042

Are you okay?

1126
01:40:43,542 --> 01:40:45,375
I'm okay. Are you?

1127
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:53,374
Hey, we have no time!

1128
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:55,166

01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:23,333
Yes, we're all fine.

1150
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,375
Open the door!

1151
01:42:57,042 --> 01:43:00,042
Stop! This is Italian property!

1152
01:43:02,167 --> 01:43:03,832
We are Somali government forces!

1153
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:05,666
This is the final warning!

1154
01:43:05,667 --> 01:43:07,708
This is Italian property!

1155
01:43:08,792 --> 01:43:10,667
Get out of our country!

1156
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,083

Don't!

1159
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:05,166

1160
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,792

1162
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:16,499
Hold on.

1163
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,542

I didn't get to say thank you!

1169
01:48:41,792 --> 01:48:43,208
Are you going home now?

1170
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:48,249
Yes, we've been abroad a few years,

1171
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:51,666
so after reporting, we'll
see our children again.

1172
01:48:51,667 --> 01:48:53,416
Your children are with you now.

1173
01:48:53,417 --> 01:48:55,332
When we diplomats go abroad,

1174
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:57,750
we leave one family
member each in Pyongyang.

1175
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:02,583
If we don't go back,
they all become orphans.

1176
01:49:11,958 --> 01:49:13,167
Ambassador Rim?

1177
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:17,292
You have no diplomatic
relations with Kenya.

1178
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:20,916
When we get to Mombasa Airport,

1179
01:49:20,917 --> 01:49:25,375
our embassy agreed to give
you cars and accommodation.

1180
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,583
Don't misunderstand our intentions,

1181
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:34,208
but if you need it, we can go together.

1182
01:49:35,708 --> 01:49:38,417
Last night at the Italian Embassy,

1183
01:49:39,042 --> 01:49:42,792
we were able to contact Pyongyang,
and they made arrangements.

1184
01:49:45,542 --> 01:49:46,708
Ambassador Han!

1185
01:49:48,167 --> 01:49:50,625

Get the defectors in our car.

1191

Take care now.

1192
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,750

The North Koreans go
behind us with those foreigners!

1196
01:51:20,875 --> 01:51:25,499
Both countries sent teams,

1197
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,583
waiting for us outside.

1198
01:51:28,292 --> 01:51:32,374
Once we get off, be sure not
to acknowledge each other.

1199
