1
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,150
 

2
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,460
Wow, how could you, Lady?

3
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,410
How could you come to 
my house and not look for me?

4
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm disappointed.

5
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,480
Are you that gentleman?

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,800
It's him!

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,600
When I almost got kidnapped 
in front of the guest house,

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,220
he was there to help me. 
It was him, my lady!

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,420
"My lady?"

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,960
By "my lady," you mean...

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,820
By chance, did you participate...

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,220
Did you participate in 
the selection for the queen?

13
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,690
Yes.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,310
I'm glad I ran into you.

15
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,420
Please don't take Wal in 
even if he comes back.

16
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,270
I can't be obliged to you 
much longer, Prince.

17
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,860
I'm grateful to you for everything.

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,940
Who are you?

19
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,880
I asked you who you are?

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,760
Hey!

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,400
Your Excellency.

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,390
- What are you...
- Is Hong Yeon Kang Yi Soo's daughter?

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Lock the front door, and don't let 
anyone in the reception room.

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,600
Yes, Your Excellency.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,860
Let's go inside first.

26
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,980
I asked you...

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,540
if Hong Yeon is the woman 
we placed in the selection.

28
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,320
Is that why you came here
 in broad daylight?

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,660
I asked you if that's correct.

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,620
Yes, that's correct.

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,830
How did you learn that name?

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,030
I should've...

33
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,940
I should've known earlier. If I did...

34
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,200
I wouldn't have let 
things come to this.

35
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,530
Let's go to the watering hole.

36
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,480
I'm sure Wal is there.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
The watering hole?

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,160
Right now?

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,280
I can't let him impose 
on the prince anymore.

40
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,010
I'm just...

41
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,090
I'm the prince's servant.

42
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,790
What did you say?

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,910
Who?

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,630
Strictly speaking...

45
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,290
I'm not exactly a servant.

46
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,850
I used to sweep floors
 in his house

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,170
and cut firewood too, but...

48
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,580
not anymore. Not anymore...

49
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,530
You!

50
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,610
How dare you joke around
 in front of His Majesty?

51
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,210
I'm not joking around!

52
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,430
So let me explain this...

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,600
I was initially an informant, 
but the business failed and

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,400
I lived in the prince's 
house temporarily.

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,050
Yes, yes...

56
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,430
An informant?

57
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,840
So now I moved out 
of the prince's house and...

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,660
I'm staying at the watering hole.

59
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,510
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,600
Please cut this trickster's mouth.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,130
He mentioned the prince's residence
 then say he's an informant.

62
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,650
Now he's saying he lives 
at the watering hole.

63
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,710
Officer Han, please show 
off your sword skills.

64
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,810
Cut this man's tongue
 in exactly half,

65
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,320
- put it back together, and cut it again!
- Excuse me!

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
How could you call me a trickster?

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,570
My name is Wal. Wal, okay?

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,950
Haven't you heard of that name?

69
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,030
I'm the owner of the
 biggest informant agency

70
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,590
in Hanyang, Buyong Agency!

71
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,640
So please go to the watering hole

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,470
and try looking into it.

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,860
If you go there, there is 
a courtesan named Cho Hyang.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,720
She sometimes finds 
clients for me too.

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
The reason I went to
 Inwang Mountain

76
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,590
was to receive a commission
 that the courtesan got for me.

77
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,090
- Are you saying nothing but the truth?
- Of course...

78
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,100
By the way,

79
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,170
why are you treating me
 like that, Sir Eunuch?

80
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,310
What? How dare you!

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,410
Your Majesty...

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,040
You're the owner of 
the Buyong Agency?

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,820
I thought it was a woman.

84
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes, it's a woman, and it's a man too.

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,250
I'm the man.

86
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,880
We're partners.

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,990
Then where's your partner right now?

88
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,130
She's probably wandering 
from place to place like me.

89
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,110
She didn't stay with you 
at the prince's residence?

90
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,340
No, no.

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,810
She knew the prince first, but

92
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,450
I'm the only one who 
stayed in his house.

93
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,310
Anyway, if you go to
 the watering hole,

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,630
you'll find out that I'm the owner 
of the Buyong Agency.

95
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,300
So please look into it just
 one time, sir. Your Majesty.

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,800
The eunuch, sir...

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm sorry that I called you a eunuch...

98
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,910
Your Majesty.

99
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,580
How much of what he 
said do you think is true?

100
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,490
 Wow, the king... 

101
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,150
 By the way, 

102
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,260
 wait a second... 

103
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,270
 I heard you passed away. 

104
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,630
I never thought of Prince as a threat.

105
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,000
Thinking about it now,
 I could've suspected him.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Pardon?

107
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,650
Was he not brought in at 
Jo Heung Gyeon's recommendation?

108
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,160
That is correct.

109
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,530
Does that mean they could
 be on the same side?

110
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,450
By the way, Your Majesty, 
how about...

111
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,260
the owner of Buyong Agency?

112
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,790
Go to the watering hole and find 
out if what he said is true.

113
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

114
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,300
I almost didn't recognize you.

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,670
Why are you dressed 
like an aristocrat,

116
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,630
not a shaman this time?

117
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,190
There's a reason for that.

118
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,540
I'm here to see Wal.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,400
- Please summon him for me.
- Goodness.

120
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,690
You don't know where he is either?

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Did something really happen to him?

122
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,570
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,540
Well, the thing is...

124
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,900
Actually,

125
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,290
he went to Inwang Mountain
 to meet a client last night.

126
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,000
But he hasn't returned.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,460
A client?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
He's probably fine!

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,810
I'm sure he'll show up out 
of nowhere again.

130
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,880
You know how he is.

131
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,750
Tell him that I'm looking for
 him when he returns.

132
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,900
You scared me!

133
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,430
I'm glad I ran into you.

134
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,850
What happened anyway?

135
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,090
Why is the owner of the 
Buyong Agency not returning?

136
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,560
Who's the woman just now?

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,330
If I told you? Would you know then?

138
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,590
Don't change the subject.

139
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,810
Where's the owner of
 the Buyong Agency?

140
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,670
If only you kept your mouth shut,

141
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,580
you wouldn't have to die like this.

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,960
What?

143
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,030
- Bye then.
- Take care, sir.

144
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,840
Safe travels, sir.

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,350
I'm from a government office. 
Everyone should gather around.

146
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,150
Is this the owner 
of the Buyong Agency?

147
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,990
Yes, he is.

148
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,850
Speaking of Buyong Agency,

149
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,500
Cho Hyang knows him
 better than anyone.

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,110
Where's that courtesan 
named Cho Hyang?

151
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,090
Come to think of it, 
I haven't seen her today.

152
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,050
Have you seen her?

153
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,360
Has anyone seen her?

154
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,790
Excuse me, sir.

155
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,600
Did you receive an order
 from the King by chance?

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,910
Excuse me, they must've

157
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,910
found out who I am by now.

158
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,590
For how long do I 
have to be tied up?

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,190
Are your mouths glued shut?

160
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,180
In any case, I'm so scared.

161
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,120
By mentioning the prince,
 I only made things complicated.

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,150
Did they go to the 
watering hole or not?

163
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,430
What if they pretended like
 they don't know me?

164
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,960
If they do, I'll go ahead and...

165
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,230
He is indeed the owner 
of the Buyong Agency?

166
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

167
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,200
He was all over the
 place talking nonsense,

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,440
but I guess he did spew some truth.

169
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,690
By the way,

170
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,970
the courtesan named 
Cho Hyang he mentioned

171
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,840
seems to have disappeared.

172
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,100
You mean she disappeared 
all of a sudden?

173
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,910
It seems that way.

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,150
Are you absolutely sure?

175
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,760
Yes, that woman isn't Hong Yeon.

176
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,500
What should we do now, Father?

177
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,200
Don't do anything rash.

178
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,030
Just treat her as usual.

179
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,540
But we should kick her out before
 the second round of selection...

180
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,780
I'll take care of the rest myself.

181
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,950
So don't worry about it.

182
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,380
Yes.

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Gae Pyeong!

184
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,890
When did you get here?

185
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,640
I haven't seen you lately.

186
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,570
Have you been away?

187
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,480
Yes, my lady.

188
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,990
You're back for good, right?

189
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,630
Don't you dare disappear 
without telling me again.

190
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, my lady.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,430
Young Ji, go inside now.

192
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,290
See you again.

193
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,340
What's going on?

194
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,640
We almost got into trouble since 
the king found Young Koon.

195
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,770
But I took care of it by framing
 the owner of Buyong Agency.

196
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,920
Good work.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,510
Is it you, Gae Pyeong?

198
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,900
What are you doing here?

199
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,530
Are you worried about Lady?

200
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,000
She's been crying all day 
since she got disqualified.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm worried that something 
might happen to her.

202
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,320
Make sure to comfort her.

203
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,700
It's not like that would do anything.

204
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,540
Her only dream was to 
be with the King.

205
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,000
I wish she would at least
 have some porridge.

206
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,020
You asked for me, sir?

207
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,300
Would you be able to find 
a decent gun and a gunman?

208
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,820
Yes.

209
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,840
By the way,

210
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,830
what are you using them for?

211
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,110
Here's a picture of the king entering
 the palace with the new queen.

212
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,830
The royal throne right here

213
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,420
will be the target for that gun.

214
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,360
Would you give it a try?

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,240
Would you do it for Young Ji?

216
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,350
I ruined your plan, sir.

217
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,330
Please kill me!

218
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,110
It's not your fault that the
 King came back to life.

219
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,810
But...

220
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,070
you can't let them track you down.

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,060
I'm glad you took good care of it.

222
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,830
However...

223
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,290
I believe the Queen
 came back to life too.

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,680
The Queen's mother, who became 
a slave, apparently disappeared.

225
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,200
Track her down and go 
to Gyeonggido right now

226
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,700
and find out about Hong Yeon, 
the daughter of Hong Ki Ho.

227
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,010
I left this house empty 
since I moved to Gyeonggido.

229
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,260
It must be in a sorry state.

230
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,900
I'm fine with that.

231
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,690
I heard six candidates made 
it to the second round.

232
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,500
What was your rank?

233
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,230
I was in last place.

234
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,090
Last place?

235
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,460
I couldn't be punctual 
since there was a situation.

236
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,080
My lady.

237
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
His Excellency is here.

238
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,590
Do you happen to know the Prince?

239
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,560
Yes.

240
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,990
He helped me a few
 times by coincidence.

241
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,400
By coincidence?

242
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,320
Is that all there is?

243
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,110
Yes.

244
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,440
But why are you asking me that?

245
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,490
You should start carrying
 on your father's plan.

246
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,430
The Theory of Englightenment
 is just the beginning.

247
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,730
I have something to show you.

248
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,860
Follow me discreetly tomorrow.

249
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,250
Before we do,

250
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,270
I'd like to see if my 
mother is well first.

251
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,610
You'd be able to confirm 
that tomorrow as well.

252
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,780
I ordered someone to bring 
Lady Han to Hanyang.

253
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,950
You should bring her to the 
headquarters tomorrow.

254
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,830
Are you really planning
 to take her there?

255
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,150
Can we do that so soon?

256
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,960
There's a reason why we have to.

257
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,900
- The Prince knows her.
- Pardon?

258
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,510
They seem to have met by chance 
without knowing each other's identity.

259
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,590
But I'm concerned about
 the way Prince is reacting.

260
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,130
We should take care of things 
before Eun Bo wavers too.

261
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,410
 Until this day, 

262
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,200
 I'm still hiding. 

263
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,620
 Is that so bad? 

264
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,430
 But I try to trip people, at least. 

265
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,580
 You should do the 
same from now on. 

266
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,450
 Thanks to you, I made
 up my mind as well. 

267
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,560
 I'll give that woman a dagger. 

268
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,730
 So she could aim his heart. 

269
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,820
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

270
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,720
What should you do when you cannot 
figure out the enemy's intention?

272
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,310
I think...

273
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,800
- you should follow...
- I should confront him myself.

274
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes, you should.

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,980
That's precisely it, Your Majesty.

276
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,560
I need to see Prince.

277
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,900
Pardon?

278
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,550
This is our headquarters.

279
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,810
Mother.

280
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,860
Eun Ki?

281
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,880
By chance...

282
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,910
Is it...

283
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,670
Eun Bo?

284
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,900
Eun Bo!

285
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,480
Eun Bo!

286
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,950
Where have you been?

287
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,160
Where have you been?

288
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,230
Eun Bo, Eun Bo!

289
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,530
What are you doing right now?

290
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,050
Tell me why!

291
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,140
That woman is here right now.

292
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,550
I'd like to reveal our intention before
 the second round of selection.

293
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,220
You'd better stop right now.

294
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,680
We'll remove her from 
the selection too.

295
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,670
We'll find another solution.

296
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,150
I opened up my heart to her.

297
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,880
I won't lose her to the king.

298
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,000
Neither the throne nor the woman!

299
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,970
How come everything 
I want belongs to the king?

300
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,360
He does nothing. So why?

301
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,770
I'll make sure she becomes mine.

302
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,770
Yes.

303
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,700
That should be enough.

304
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,370
- If she becomes mine...
- Your Excellency!

305
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,480
Please pull yourself together.

306
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,040
She's nothing but 
a disposable puppet.

307
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,320
That was your plan, wasn't it?

308
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,050
So I want to turn things back.

309
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,760
Don't forget our mission.

310
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Our promises, goals, and the world!

311
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,910
That new world doesn't
 just belong to you.

312
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,530
It belongs to us, who dreamt and 
protected by sacrificing for a long time!

313
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,030
You should never forget that.

314
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,640
You lost your memories too.

315
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,120
How have you been living 
such a rough life?

316
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,420
I should've... I should've 
searched for you a little harder.

317
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,820
I should've...

318
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,780
I've been doing well by being strong.

319
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,820
So don't be so sad.

320
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm your little daughter, 
rambunctious as a boy.

321
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,020
You know me.

322
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,540
I finally got to reunite with you.

323
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm really okay now.

324
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,290
You've been doing well, right?

325
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,670
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
 is helping me greatly.

326
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,400
He was your father's 
friend, as you know.

327
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,540
You'll be staying with 
me from now on, right?

328
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,920
I have something I need to do.

329
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,130
Something you need to do?

330
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,830
I'll tell you eventually.

331
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,640
Don't worry about me.

332
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,730
It's cold these days. 
Please stay warm.

333
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,420
Eun Bo.

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,770
We need to go back now.

335
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,950
I'll take good care of 
your mother. So don't worry.

336
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,840
Eun Bo.

337
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,630
I'll visit you again soon.

338
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,180
I promise.

339
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,190
Aigoo...

340
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,790
All right then.

341
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,450
Hold on a moment.

342
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,440
Please...

343
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,110
Please take good care of her.

344
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,500
Eun Bo...

345
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,330
His Majesty ordered you to come
 to the palace, Your Highness.

346
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,060
Is there any discomfort
 living in Hanyang?

347
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,220
Not at all!

348
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,410
The house is big, 
and the food is tasty.

349
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,960
I gained weight because
 I'm so comfortable.

350
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,770
That is a relief.

351
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,710
Although this is not what 
either of us wanted,

352
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,590
but since you were 
adopted by the late king,

353
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,670
that makes us brothers.

354
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,290
But I have been too inattentive.

355
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,500
Were you sad about that?

356
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,230
Not at all!

357
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,730
You have no time to care
 for me. You're the king.

358
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,090
You can just forget about me.

359
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,240
You could have become
 the king yourself.

360
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,740
Are you disappointed at all?

361
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,370
Please don't say that!

362
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,350
Please refrain, My Majesty!
 I will lose my head.

363
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,260
Do you know the owner
 of the Buyong Agency?

364
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,250
What is that, Your Majesty?

365
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,520
I heard you two know
 each other well.

366
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,890
Of course!

367
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,060
Sir.

368
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,520
Sir, it's me. It's me!

369
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,320
You know me, I'm Wal!

370
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,750
This man is the owner 
of the Buyong Agency.

371
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,020
You brought an unidentified 
man into your house?

372
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,240
Well...

373
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,420
Well, the thing is...

374
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,690
We don't really know 
each other that well.

375
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,210
We just had a mutual acquaintance...

376
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,170
He's shameless and full of hot air.

377
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,280
Who cares about Buyong 
Agency or whatever?

378
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,700
- He's been lying to me as well. 
 - Sir!

379
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,890
Aigoo, he leeched off me saying, 
he has no place to go.

380
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,310
I took him in out of pity, 
but he disappeared so fast.

381
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,510
I was wondering where 
he went to, and here he is.

382
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,720
By the way, did he commit 
a crime or something?

383
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,730
That's good enough. Let's leave.

384
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,940
Excuse me, Your Majesty. 
Your Majesty!

385
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,810
Your Majesty! Sir, sir. Sir!

386
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,760
Sir, it's me. Sir, sir!

387
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
You know me. Sir.

388
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,870
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

389
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,330
I'll get going now then.

390
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,610
- Han Mo.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,860
Have a man follow Prince 
and keep an eye on him.

392
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,330
Yes.

393
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,870
Who is that woman?

394
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,000
Pardon?

395
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
You said you stayed 
at the Prince's house

396
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,720
by an introduction 
from your partner.

397
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,680
How come your story 
doesn't match his?

398
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,880
The thing is...

399
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,790
I think Prince was...

400
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,900
I think I misunderstood.

401
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,970
Tell me that woman's name first.

402
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,510
Well, I don't know.

403
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,660
You do not even know
 your partner's name?

404
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,630
It's not that I don't know, but...

405
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,380
Well...

406
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,710
the name I know is an alias.

407
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,750
People like me go 
by random names.

408
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,330
Some guys have two 
or three names too.

409
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,870
Sometimes, I go by

410
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,800
Wal and...

411
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,430
sometimes I go by Wol...

412
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,460
Some people call me
 Mung or Dog too.

413
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,980
Yes...

414
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,600
Anyway, hasn't my identity 
been proven now?

415
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,870
Didn't you confirm 
at the watering hole?

416
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,240
The courtesan named 
Cho Hyang went missing.

417
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,640
Cho Hyang?

418
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,500
- Why?
- That is what I want to ask you.

419
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,860
If you were me,

420
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,560
would you free yourself 
in this situation?

421
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,590
But if you want to be freed,

422
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,510
you should tell me who 
that woman is first.

423
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,390
We took your mother back safely.

424
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,280
You'll be able to see her soon.

425
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,390
So don't be so disappointed.

426
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,850
Yes.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,400
You must miss your daughter too.

428
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,220
It's all because of me...

429
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,350
She's been physically 
weak since birth.

430
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,600
It's probably better for her 
to stay in the mountain.

431
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,450
Well, by the way,

432
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,300
what kind of place is
 that headquarters?

433
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,380
I was surprised how
 elaborate it seemed.

434
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,770
Are there that many people

435
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,760
who shared ideas with my father?

436
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,620
You should hear about it from 
Baek Ja Yong rather than me.

437
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,420
You just need to do your
 best to fulfill your duty.

438
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,460
Just prepare for the
 second round of selection.

439
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,290
Yes.

440
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Should I...

441
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,000
just come clean?

442
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,300
"Excuse me, sir...

443
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,340
That woman is...

444
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,700
the Queen's twin sister."

445
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,240
If I say that,

446
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,060
she would die.

447
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,630
And if I don't say that, I'd die.

448
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,520
Which one would croak?

449
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,340
Should I be the one to die?

450
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,510
Should I just come clean 
about everything and...

451
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,160
survive on my own?

452
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,210
Or should I just come clean
 and get both of us killed?

453
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,420
Geez, why is that lunatic suddenly
 trying to become the queen?

454
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,490
She shouldn't have entered 
that stupid selection.

455
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,000
She's got a lot of nerves!

456
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,060
She's her twin sister...

457
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,800
What brings you all the way here?

458
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,950
The second round of selection
 is an important issue.

459
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,040
I should be of assistance by 
your side as your brother.

460
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,580
What a good excuse.

461
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,110
Here's the time of the
 six candidates' arrival

462
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,820
predicted by the face reader.

463
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,900
Court Lady Jung should 
take care of this.

464
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Wait...

465
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,580
Will you let Court Lady Jung take
 charge of the second round as well?

466
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,360
Is there a problem?

467
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,360
Did you prepare the mission
 for the candidates?

468
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,450
Yes, Your Highness.

469
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,500
I'm giving it my full attention.

470
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,500
What?

471
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,030
Court Lady Jung is 
taking charge again?

472
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,980
Yes.

473
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,620
Queen Dowager put her 
in charge of everything.

474
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,520
Your Highness.

475
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,350
You need to help out Song Yi 
in every possible way.

476
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,810
Yes, the fate of our family is at stake.

477
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,490
Of course, I want to help her.

478
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,340
But they are preventing me
 from doing so.

479
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,980
What am I supposed to do?

480
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,820
Honestly, this is such nonsense.

481
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,400
How could the Queen Mother 
fall behind some court lady?

482
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,260
Regarding the queen selection at that.

483
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,790
I think...

484
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,020
Queen Dowager lived for too long.

485
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,050
Uncle, please...

486
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,710
It's just a manner of speaking.

487
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,500
Haven't you heard that the 
palace has ears on its walls?

488
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,000
That's enough.

489
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,100
She's on our side anyway.

490
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,840
Anyway, you need to take 
control instead of her.

491
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,390
Not only that you 
should help Song Yi,

492
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,450
you should kick out that woman
 from the Hong family too.

493
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,480
Do you have a solution by chance?

494
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,980
 Please save me. 

495
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,450
 Please save me. 

496
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,300
 Please sav me. 

497
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,320
Did you have another dream?

498
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,390
This time, the Queen

499
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,970
begged me to save her in my dream.

500
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,360
By the way, Your Majesty,

501
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,590
why would a woman 
who's entering the palace

502
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,360
for the selection say that?

503
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,270
It's not like you're participating
 as a judge or anything.

504
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,130
Please do not worry so much.

505
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,460
Since everyone's here, I'll take 
you to the waiting room.

506
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,730
You look happier than usual,
 Left State Minister.

507
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,180
But why do you look 
so upset, Your Majesty?

508
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,710
Why do you think that is?

509
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,590
Please do not be too preoccupied 
with it, no matter what it is.

510
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,490
I am worried that it might 
hurt your health.

511
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,740
Thank you for the advice.

512
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,070
But I will not find it useful.

513
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,650
Your Majesty!

514
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,180
Have you not heard the news yet?

515
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,710
Queen Mother apparently 
has fallen ill.

516
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,680
My mother?

517
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,570
 His Majesty is here. 

518
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,550
Are you feeling ill, Mother?

519
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,580
My body is ill since my heart is ill.

520
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,960
 Great Royal Dowager Queen is here. 

521
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,990
I heard you fell ill, Queen.

522
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,140
- Your Highness.
- It is okay, sit down.

523
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,510
I do not know what to say.

524
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,590
I think I am tired of my life in the
 palace, where I have no one to rely on.

525
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,460
What do you mean, 
you have no one to rely on?

526
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,360
You have your side of the family
 that fully supports you.

527
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,630
My family of origin can 
only do so much.

528
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,460
I am just...

529
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,840
a scarecrow who cannot even
 choose her own daughter-in-law.

530
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,990
I just resent the late
 king, who left me behind.

531
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,780
I'm worse off than Court Lady Jung.
 Being left behind alone.

532
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,980
If this were my fate,

533
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,320
he should have taken me with him.

534
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,280
If you really want to play
 mother-in-law, I should let you.

535
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,650
Court Lady Jung, are you there?

536
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,520
Let the Queen take charge of the 
second round of selection again.

537
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,550
Pardon?

538
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,910
Yes, I'll follow your order.

539
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,770
Lady, do you remember 
drinking last night at all?

540
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,750
Pardon?

541
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,010
Seriously, you're such a bum.

542
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,050
Did I make a mistake by chance?

543
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,850
Anyway, it's been a while 
since we entered the palace.

544
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,350
How come we do not
 hear any news?

545
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,410
I know.

546
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,770
Have some.

547
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,050
I made some because I heard 
pine nuts are good for nervousness.

548
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,810
Lady Ye Shil made them herself.

549
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,490
You made them yourself?

550
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:12,020
I guess I can say that 
I'm pretty confident in cooking.

551
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,610
Why don't you try some too? 
It's good for nervousness.

552
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,210
 Who are you? 

553
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,170
 Why did you come back? 

554
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,000
What's wrong?

555
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,050
Is there something on my face?

556
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,840
No.

557
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,600
Thank you.

558
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,270
Court Lady Jung told me 
to relay this message.

559
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,620
Since the candidates will receive
 a mission prepared for you,

560
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,420
you should pick 
a candidate yourself.

561
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,440
It was worth getting sick.

562
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes, good work.

563
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,780
The second round is 
entirely up to you now.

564
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,530
Do as you wish.

565
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,300
Disqualify anyone you want

566
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,830
and make sure the 
one you like passes.

567
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,130
Well...

568
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,870
the thing is...

569
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,580
you have to choose 
without seeing their faces.

570
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,390
What... What?

571
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,010
Here's the mission 
for the second round.

572
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,110
It's important for the
 lead lady of the court

573
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,010
to assist the royal family.

574
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,730
Starting now, you will

575
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,130
fulfill a filial duty to 
Queen Mother who is ill.

576
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,270
And as usual,

577
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,070
the decision will be made
as fair as possible.

578
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,490
In this jar, there are missions
 for each of you to complete.

579
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,340
Please draw one of the straws.

580
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,500
 

581
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,200
 

582
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,020
Please begin your 
mission starting now.

583
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,830
The court ladies outside
 will assist you.

584
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,960
Lady.

585
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,990
Let's get up quickly.

586
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,900
Where am I supposed to find 
a hydrangea in this cold weather?

587
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,440
I was assigned as your
 assistant, Lady Hong.

588
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,790
Where's the royal kitchen?

589
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,510
Please follow me.

590
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,000
 

591
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,770
Ouch!

592
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,670
Your Majesty.

593
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,940
My apologies, Your Majesty.

594
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,590
I heard you managed to 
pass the first round.

595
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,330
Please be careful in 
everything you do.

596
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,800
Don't get yourself into danger.

597
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,400
Let's get going.

598
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,000
Your Majesty.

599
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,450
When I first came to
 the palace as Yedong,

600
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,430
you helped me as you did just now.

601
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,460
You scolded me back then too.

602
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,400
I...

603
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
will really work hard.

604
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,300
I'll work harder than anyone else.

605
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,650
It seems like you're on a mission.
 You can leave now.

606
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

607
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,270
Stop pretending to cough

608
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,950
and check on that girl instead.

609
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,380
By "that girl," you mean...

610
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,990
I cannot seem to figure out

611
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,040
which direction to go to.

612
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,780
Which woman do you think
 I am concerned about?

613
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,250
Who is it...

614
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,470
Hey.

615
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,400
Come with me.

616
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,090
What's it about?

617
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,050
It's a letter from Prince.

618
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,110
The King is spying on him.

619
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,710
What do you mean, "spying?"

620
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,820
For what reason?

621
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,500
My goodness!

622
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,530
You came to the royal kitchen too?

623
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,690
You too?

624
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,230
This mission is easy since you need to
 follow the prompt, don't you think?

625
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,810
What is yours?

626
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,760
I was told to make a dish using
 rice cake for the Queen Mother.

627
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,500
 

628
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,500
Don't you think there
 was a mistake?

629
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,600
How could they be the same?

630
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,680
Is there a medicine called 
Heuksam (black ginger)?

631
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,710
Yes, there is, but...

632
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,480
This is for a mission. 
Could I have some Heuksam?

633
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,700
I need Heuksam.

634
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,680
This lady asked for Heuksam too.

635
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,540
There's only one root because
 it's a rare ingredient.

636
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,990
 Give Queen Mother her
 favorite flower, hydrangeas 

637
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,410
 and make her feel better. 

638
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,950
We're in the garden.

639
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,810
What's this about?

640
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,700
I'd like seeds for hydrangeas.

641
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,680
Each pair of candidates were
 given the same prompt.

642
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,400
If so, would one of two
 ladies get eliminated?

643
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,190
And Mother does not know 
whom she is picking either?

644
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,670
I guess you can say that.

645
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,850
Anyway, the decision is
 up to the Queen.

646
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,380
She will not be able to complain 
about the process anymore.

647
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,450
So that is why you 
gave up so easily.

648
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:54,360
Did you want to see me because 
you were curious about my intention?

649
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,450
What are the missions
 for the ladies?

650
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,450
 Please save me. 

651
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,350
 Please save me. 

652
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,460
Is there a chance they 
might come to me

653
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,750
or get into danger at all?

654
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,900
Hold on a second!

655
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,650
What would I do if you
 take all of them?

656
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,620
It's first-come, first-served 
in situations like this.

657
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,130
What should I do with 
this Heuksam?

658
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,820
Give it to me.

659
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,010
Whare are you doing?

660
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,070
I was here first.

661
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,300
Let go of your hand.

662
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
You should be the one to let go.

663
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,600
You'll ruin the precious root.

664
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,490
Hey!

665
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,070
What?

666
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,230
Seriously...

667
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,800
Please...

668
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,550
There's no time! Please...

669
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,920
That's why you should let go.

670
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,710
Just act weak as usual!

671
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,900
No!

672
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,740
I'll never let go!

673
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,180
So you want to do this, huh?

674
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,640
Let's make it together then!

675
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,960
- What?
- I can never give up.

676
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,840
You can't either.

677
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,430
Both of us might get eliminated 
since we'd run out of time.

678
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,810
- We might as well...
- Are you crazy?

679
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,720
Why would I do that with you?

680
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,070
If so, we'll both get eliminated.

681
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,440
What's the dish?

682
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,360
I need to write it down.

683
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,060
Well, the thing is...

684
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,590
It's a rice cake tapioca made
 from the Omija tea.

685
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,590
I heard Omija is known
 for restoring energy

686
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,700
and eating rice cake might 
be too heavy due to her illness.

687
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,770
I thought a tea form 
might be better suited.

688
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,710
Right, the honey...

689
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,000
Well...

690
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,160
Could I borrow some honey?

691
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,530
I only have a spoonful left.

692
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,430
Would you like to have that much?

693
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,020
Thank you.

694
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,510
Hey!

695
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,470
Stop it right there!

696
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,050
What's the matter?

697
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,700
Why are you holding my hand?

698
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,320
Open it. Open it!

699
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,920
Open your hand.

700
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,750
What's this?

701
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,760
Where did you pick up 
such bad behavior?

702
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,840
Come with me.

703
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,120
I'll take you to Court Lady Jung.

704
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,690
No, Chief Eunuch Hwang!

705
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,500
You'd get me killed!

706
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,010
Please forgive me!

707
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,500
Please forgive me!
 I'll never do that again!

708
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,220
By chance,

709
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,650
if something like this 
happens again,

710
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,710
I'll make sure you're 
punished accordingly.

711
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,890
Do you understand?

712
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,150
Yes.

713
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,110
The time is up.

714
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,920
Please come to the 
Queen Mother's chamber.

715
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,850
Lady Hong and 
Lady Bang are here.

716
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,390
 Come inside. 

717
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,100
Come inside.

718
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,550
What did you prepare?

719
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,900
They're hydrangea seeds.

720
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,430
They're still seeds,

721
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,810
but they'll bloom when it's time.

722
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,620
I...

723
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,440
couldn't get hydrangeas, so...

724
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,660
I did embroidery instead.

725
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,940
Try some.

726
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,120
What do you think?

727
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,050
Well, it's not too bad.

728
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,240
Although it's not quite sweet enough.

729
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,880
This one is very colorful.

730
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,810
What?

731
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,030
Why is it so salty?

732
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,660
How could you present this as food!

733
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,940
Why did you do that?

734
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,010
What do you mean?

735
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,220
You said you're a good cook.

736
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,200
Did you make it salty on purpose?

737
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,500
This is enough for me.

738
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,100
I saw enough of the palace.

739
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,450
And I'm getting sick 
of living in Hanyang.

740
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,770
I miss my mother's food too.

741
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,520
Don't you think
 I look malnourished?

742
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,610
Geez, my cheeks are 
my best assets.

743
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,190
Also, most importantly...

744
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,130
His Majesty isn't my type.

745
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:19,080
I find the Chief Eunuch cuter.

746
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,900
You know, I've been 
keeping an eye on you.

747
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,410
Even when you had
 rashes on your hand

748
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,360
and when you got kidnapped,

749
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,070
you tried the best you could.

750
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,190
At first, I thought,
 "What a nasty woman."

751
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:45,250
But that means that's 
how badly you want it.

752
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,830
But still, this is the 
second round of selection.

753
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,490
Is it really okay to 
not do anything?

754
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,140
Do you really think 
I won't do anything?

755
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,020
What do you mean?

756
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,410
I'm looking for the
 real Hong Yeon.

757
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,550
Welcome!

758
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,900
- Let me ask you something.
- Yes.

759
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,310
Hasn't the governor of Gyeonggi

760
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,560
order a large quantity of 
asthma medicine lately?

761
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,110
Pardon?

762
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:39,240
Well, he does once in a while.

763
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,850
So when would he come?

764
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,940
He comes on the first
 of every month.

765
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,840
So he'd come in a week.

766
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,180
 I'll look into the details myself. 

767
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,700
 Also, we should not 
meet for a while. 

768
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,970
How come you only
 brought one bowl?

769
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,520
The thing is...

770
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,380
They say too much 
medicine can be poisonous.

771
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,110
We thought giving Queen Mother
 too much medicine

772
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,870
might be worse than 
giving her too little.

773
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,950
Since we were
 concerned about that,

774
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,890
after much discussion,

775
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,060
we decided to work on
 this mission together.

776
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,160
We thought that would be 
a good way to assist her.

777
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,430
That's a good point, but
 that's not what we intended.

778
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,870
There wasn't enough of 
Heuksam from the beginning.

779
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,620
But we decided to work 
together rather than fighting.

780
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:13,320
You probably didn't intend us to 
compete with each other.

781
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,190
If you did by chance,

782
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,010
that would make the 
prompt problematic.

783
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,990
 You're saying we have to... 

784
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,760
qualify both Lady Kim and Lady Jo?

785
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,380
Yes, Your Highness.

786
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,170
I regret to say this, 
but the prompt had a flaw

787
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,070
since I changed it in a hurry.

788
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,430
Even you make 
mistakes sometimes.

789
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,600
If so...

790
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,400
I just need to choose between
 these two flowers, right?

791
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,630
The seeds and the embroidery, huh?

792
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,310
I'll go with this one.

793
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,100
- Is that it then?
- Yes, Your Highness.

794
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,170
Who made it to the 
third round then?

795
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,440
Firstly, it's Lady Hong and...

796
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,160
What?

797
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,310
You mean, I chose her?

798
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,750
Your Majesty.

799
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,950
I'm not sure if I should
 take the credit,

800
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,750
but she was selected
 by the Queen Mother.

801
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,010
Did anything else happen?

802
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,220
Not at all, Your Majesty.

803
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,140
You definitely had 
a silly dream this time.

804
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,420
Oh...

805
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,420
I mean, it's probably not
 a prophetic dream.

806
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,110
So please don't worry.

807
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,890
 Your Majesty, It's Han Moo. 

808
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,670
Apparently, Prince has not 
left the house lately.

809
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,090
I searched the shaman 
house as you ordered,

810
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,760
but it was empty.

811
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:03,390
The information about Young Koon 
from the Buyong Agency was all true.

812
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,160
But the identity of the woman
 I met that one time...

813
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,730
The missing courtesan
 and the Prince.

814
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,060
There are too many suspicious
 things about that Wal.

815
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,640
I agree with you, Your Majesty.

816
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,110
He's a very suspicious man.

817
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,400
Is he remaining silent?

818
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,980
He won't even budge.

819
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,480
Instead of keeping him locked up,

820
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,990
perhaps you should pass him to Royal 
Investigation Bureau and question him.

821
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,680
Go ahead.

822
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,170
What? What's this?

823
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,840
What now? Where am I going?

824
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,120
Hold on, hold on! Am I dying?

825
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,230
Hold on! No, I can't die. I can't die!

826
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,630
Excuse me! Excuse me! I can't...

827
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,970
Thank you for your hard work.

828
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,140
You may leave the palace now.

829
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:03,020
Can't you at least say 
goodbye for the last time?

830
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,080
Good luck with everything.

831
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,200
She should've made it to
 the third round, not me.

832
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,080
Hush!

833
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,430
What are you saying?

834
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,340
You passed because
 you did a good job.

835
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,250
So don't say stuff like that.

836
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,370
Know your places, 
country bumpkins.

837
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,950
By the way, I'm so sad
 that you're leaving.

838
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,130
Come by anytime you want!

839
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,170
I'll show you how tasty the food is

840
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,360
in Jeollado, okay?

841
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,390
Please have a safe trip home.

842
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,100
As long as I have my litter

843
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,710
and beef jerky, 
I can travel anywhere.

844
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,930
I had a good time.

845
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,150
Thank you so much.

846
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,420
I mean it.

847
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,030
Come on, we're friends.

848
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,880
Make sure to become the queen.

849
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,890
Make sure not to forget 
about me, okay?

850
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,330
See you next time then.

851
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,760
Well then...

852
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,090
You should at least tell me
 where we're going!

853
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,190
Hold on, hold on!

854
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,900
- Hold on...
- Stop being so loud!

855
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,050
We're going to the Royal 
Investigation Bureau.

856
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,930
The Royal Investigation Bureau?

857
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:53,980
Hold on...

858
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,220
Hold on!

859
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,700
What's he doing here?

860
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,730
Please don't, my lady.

861
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,010
I don't know what it's about,

862
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,620
but if the soldiers are
 taking him away...

863
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,130
It might be dangerous
 if you go now.

864
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,950
Good work.

865
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:22,220
I heard you made it to the
 third round. You did well.

866
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,860
Well...

867
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,340
I ran into someone
 I know at the palace today.

868
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,130
According to the soldiers, he was being
 taken to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

869
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,770
Would you be able to
 look into it by chance?

870
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,900
I was actually waiting to
 talk to you about that.

871
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,240
The owner of the Buyong Agency 
has been held captive by the King.

872
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,640
The King?

873
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,430
Apparently, the royal soldiers
 recently showed up

874
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:52,140
at Inwang Mountain and
 the watering hole in secret.

875
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:55,050
Inwang Mountain and
 the watering hole...

876
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,900
Are you suspecting anything?

877
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,130
The King has been looking for 
the culprit of the assassination.

878
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,020
If the royal soldiers were
 on a secret mission,

879
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,290
it must have to do with the culprit.

880
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,330
If so, could it be...

881
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:11,640
Was your colleague arrested 
as the main culprit of that incident?

882
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,450
If that's the case,

883
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:17,330
he could end up dying, couldn't he?

884
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,910
That won't be all.

885
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,790
Your true identity 
might get revealed too.

886
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,150
Everything might go to waste.

887
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,910
What if I met with the King?

888
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,580
Please let me see the King.

889
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,540
That's the only solution.

890
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,870
Are you Hong Ki Ho, 
the governor of Gyeonggi?

891
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

892
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,810
What is the reason 
you wanted to see me?

893
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,760
The thing is...

894
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,070
someone else requested to see you.

895
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,830
Who is that?

896
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,720
It's my daughter.

897
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,620
Would you allow her in?

898
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,300
Let her in.

899
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,420
Have a seat.

900
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,490
Please don't kill the man who 
was arrested as the culprit

901
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,590
of the assassination.

902
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,180
Please let him live.

903
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,310
Please let him live.

904
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,040
Why would you...

905
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,910
How do you know that man?

906
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,010
I...

907
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,580
am the woman who saw you
 at the shaman's house.

908
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,540
I...

909
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,870
am Eun Ki, Your Majesty.

910
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,410
 

911
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,120
 You're Eun Ki and the 
owner of the Buyong Agency? 

912
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,630
 Are you making fun of me? 

913
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,990
 That woman is not Hong Yeon. 

914
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:29,690
 This might have to do 
with the dead queen. 

915
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,630
 Why did you lie to me? 

916
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,940
 What's your purpose, 

917
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:35,440
 and what can you achieve 
by making me the queen? 

918
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,700
 I need to know now. 

919
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,660
 I decided not to miss the 
opportunity to be by His Majesty twice. 

920
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,700
 A candidate of the selection should 
not have anything to do with you, Prince. 

921
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,800
 She was always my woman
 from the beginning.
