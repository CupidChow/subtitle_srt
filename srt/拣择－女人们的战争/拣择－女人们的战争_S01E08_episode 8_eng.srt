1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,000
 

2
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,850
Please don't kill the man who 
was arrested as the culprit

3
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,670
of the assassination.

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,450
Please let him live.

5
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,400
Please let him live.

6
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,200
Why would you...

7
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,300
How do you know that man?

8
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,760
I...

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,150
am the woman who saw you
 at the shaman's house.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,500
I...

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,190
am Eun Ki, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,470
Lift your head.

13
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,430
Lift your head!

14
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Did you just say you are Eun Ki?

15
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

16
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,360
You are Eun Ki and the 
owner of the Buyong Agency?

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,660
Yes.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
Are you making fun of me?

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,540
It is not like that, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,990
What else is it then?

21
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,280
You want me to believe 
what you say?

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Do you think what you are 
saying makes sense?

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,660
I can explain.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,220
I will explain everything.

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,570
You had better do that.

26
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,310
If there is any flaw in what you say,

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,800
- I will punish you for mocking the king...
- I thought...

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
you had abandoned me.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,720
I was in the forest when I woke up.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,500
 My whole body was as cold 
as ice and joints were stiff, 

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,870
 I could not do anything. 

32
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,370
 Unni! 

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,930
 What could I have done
 in that condition? 

34
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,230
I was a woman who was 
abandoned by the king.

35
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,760
I did not abandon you.

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,840
I did not abandon you.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,420
I looked for you everywhere.

38
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,050
I tried looking for you, but...

39
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,410
When I woke up in the forest,

40
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,820
Wal happened to be passing by,

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,080
and he found me and helped me.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,780
I imposed myself by staying at 
his place in a state of affliction.

43
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,860
And I found out that he is an informant 
and decided to assist him.

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,840
Because I personally wanted to
 find the culprit who did that to me.

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,800
If so...

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,130
you should have revealed yourself 
when I visited the agency.

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,530
It was too unexpected.

48
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,690
And at the time,

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,890
I could not trust anyone.

50
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,450
By chance, do you remember

51
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,490
the promise you made with me

52
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,970
under the sun, moon, and stars?

53
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,000
 I'll help you anytime you 
ask for my help. 

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,850
 I promise under the 
sun, moon, and stars. 

55
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,080
 Fine. 

56
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,730
You promised to help me.

57
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,840
So please help me now.

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,710
I'm not sure if Eun Bo 
could overcome this.

59
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm sure she could. 
She's a smart one.

60
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,300
Is that why you allow her 
to meet with the King?

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,270
I'm not sure if this is okay.

62
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,180
She's His Excellency 
Kang Yi Soo's daughter.

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,500
She's in a pitiful situation.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,190
Just focus on the Prince.

65
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,750
If he becomes dangerous, 
everything would be over.

66
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,690
This isn't the time to be empathetic.

67
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,000
Grandmother told you not to
 say that you are Eun Ki?

68
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,990
She said that because I requested
 her to place me in the selection.

69
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,110
And I thought it would be safe 
to follow her order as well.

70
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,680
I thought I had to 
participate in the selection

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,570
in order to catch the culprit.

72
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,110
How do you know the Prince?

73
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,810
I heard that you introduced Prince 
to the man named Wal.

74
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,100
He did me a favor once.

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,950
He helped me when ruffians 
on the street were chasing me.

76
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,470
Wal, His Excellency 
Hong Ki Ho, and the Prince

77
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,840
are the people who 
generously helped me

78
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,420
when I was wandering 
with no place to go.

79
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,120
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Wal really has nothing to 
do with that incident.

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,900
I will believe everything you say.

82
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,560
I am just happy that 
you came back to life.

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Telling me that you are 
Eun Ki is enough.

84
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,420
Even if you are lying
 about something,

85
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,420
it does not matter anymore.

86
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,900
I am sorry.

87
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,640
For leaving you alone like that.

88
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,900
For preventing you from
 coming back to me.

89
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,670
It would be better to 
end the selection.

90
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,170
Even if you get chosen
 as Hong Yeon

91
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,810
or not get chosen,
 it would still be a problem.

92
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,060
People would find me 
suspicious if that happens.

93
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,910
Your involvement in the selection

94
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,000
would make me everyone's target.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,290
The culprit would 
show himself soon.

96
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,450
I can't put myself in danger 
for something like this.

97
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,260
That is why I want you to step 
aside and let me handle everything.

98
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,590
No.

99
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,540
This is my business too.

100
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,440
Please do not worry.

101
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,600
My lady.

102
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,210
I know it is not my place, 
but may I say something?

103
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,730
Please go ahead.

104
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,670
Please do not misunderstand 
His Majesty's intention.

105
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,340
His Majesty tried

106
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,200
harder than anyone to save 
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo until the end.

107
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,370
He even ordered his prison 
break and helped him.

108
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,990
That was how determined he was.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
What do you mean by that?

110
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,250
His Majesty ordered
 his prison break?

111
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,430
Please inquire about the
 details from him yourself.

112
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,120
His Majesty would probably 
never bring that up himself.

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,490
Because he is blaming himself

114
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,820
for everything.

115
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,920
Did you send her off well?

116
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,570
Why are you being so cautious?

118
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,440
Did you make any mistake again?

119
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,970
Your Majesty!

120
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,630
Do you think I make 
mistakes all the time...

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I do, Your Majesty.

122
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,620
My apologies, Your Majesty. I just...

123
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,010
thought you should make up...

124
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,250
That is enough. Get to the point.

125
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,780
I told her that you tried to save 
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo.

126
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,600
Why do such a thing...

127
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,040
It is okay. Come.

128
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,870
I know that you did that for me.

129
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,270
Your Majesty!

130
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,600
Are you accepting my 
heart, Your Majesty?

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,890
Han Mo.

132
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,750
Go to the Royal Investigation
 Bureau and free Wal.

133
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,670
My dream turned out 
to be right again.

135
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,270
How could something like 
this keep happening?

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,270
I am worried that you might

137
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,720
hurt your health having dreams 
like that, Your Majesty.

138
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,610
Should I try looking 
for a good shaman?

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,950
Bring the priestess to
 me discreetly.

140
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,160
I need to find out what 
these dreams are about.

141
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,050
 His Majesty tried  

142
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,340
 harder than anyone to save 
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo until the end. 

143
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,400
 I don't trust the King. 

144
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,130
 The King killed your father. 

145
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,410
Why did he lie like that?

146
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,170
You bastard.

147
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,880
Do you think this is your 
bedroom or something?

148
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,270
Get up right now!

149
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,150
Just leave me alone, please?

150
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,990
Can't I just lie down at the 
Royal Investigation Bureau?

151
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,890
And please refresh the hay in here!

152
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,350
It stinks whenever 
I toss around. It stinks!

153
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,730
Well...

154
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,620
Judging from your uniform,

155
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,070
you look like an important person.

156
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,460
What's someone so 
important doing in my cell?

157
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,600
You have better taste
 than I thought.

158
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,100
Get up. You're free to go.

159
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,080
Free? All of a sudden?

160
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,620
Hurry up and come out.

161
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,670
I'll get you a fantastic
 graphic novel...

162
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,070
I brought him out.

163
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,000
Excuse me, sir.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,770
Can't I just stay in prison?

165
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,140
Thinking about it now,

166
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,560
I think the prison lifestyle
 suits me perfectly.

167
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,430
It's cozy, comfortable, and 
feels like my bedroom...

168
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,410
Keep that mouth shut.

169
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,450
Yes.

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,740
Seriously...

171
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,270
What's with the law in this country?

172
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,340
Why do you keep making 
me switch places?

173
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,420
What's this now? Huh?

174
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,960
Tend to your business.

175
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,260
Yes.

176
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,380
Did everything go over well?

177
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,810
Yes.

178
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,860
You went through so much.

179
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,030
By chance...

180
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,530
is there something 
you're not telling me?

181
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,730
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm asking if you hid vital 
information from me.

183
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,040
Should I ask His Excellency 
Baek Ja Yong instead again?

184
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,090
So...

185
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,080
is there something you like?

186
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,380
Your uncle is awarding you for making
 it to the third round of selection.

187
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,140
Thank him.

188
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,830
I'm sorry, Uncle, but...

189
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,500
I need something more valuable.

190
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,750
Something valuable?

191
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,760
What is that?

192
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,310
Please leave us alone.

193
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,080
Queen Dowager plays an 
active role in the third round.

194
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,270
My cousin, Ja Yoon, got 
disqualified in that round too.

195
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,320
No matter how hard I try,

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,890
it's no use if the Queen Dowager 
rejects the Kim family.

197
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,580
As long as you do a good job...

198
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,100
Please show the strength 
of our family, Uncle.

199
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,900
That would be more valuable 
than an object like this for me.

200
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,410
I mean, seriously...

201
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,690
You make a good point.

202
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,160
Song Yi is not wrong about the 
Queen Dowager being our key target.

203
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,460
But I'm sure that old hag 
won't be on our side.

204
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,610
What should we do then, Father?

205
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,870
Why not stick to our original plan

206
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,600
and persuade families in our party

207
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,500
who are participating 
in the selection?

208
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,330
Don't worry about the 
families on our side.

209
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,310
All of them are already on our side
 thanks to the gifts we gave them.

210
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,860
Try even harder.

211
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,250
We need to use Queen Mother and

212
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,630
families in our party and 
pressure Queen Dowager.

213
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,670
Good work, Sweetheart.

214
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,000
But what's about to happen
 is more important.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,900
The third round will 
go on for two days

216
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,540
while you're staying in the palace.

217
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,640
Since it's the last round,

218
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,270
Queen Dowager will be 
disqualifying the candidates herself.

219
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,330
Since the Queen Mother is
 from the Kim family,

220
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,600
Queen Dowager will probably 
disfavor anyone from that family.

221
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,250
However...

222
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,850
she definitely won't favor you either.

223
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,650
If so...

224
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,380
there's no guarantee that 
I'd win this time either.

225
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,730
I can't get disqualified 
in the third round again.

226
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,200
What would happen to Hong Yeon?

227
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,410
You're looking for a way 
to kick her out, right?

228
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,530
There will be good news soon.

229
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,380
Good news?

230
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,170
From whom?

231
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,460
Aigoo!

232
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,680
You're from the governor 
of Gyeonggi, right?

233
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,610
Yes.

234
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,620
I have them ready to go here.

235
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,070
- Thank you.
- Yes.

236
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,050
- Take care!
- Bye.

237
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Lady Yeon!

238
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,650
Your mother told me to 
deliver your medicine.

239
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,110
Here you go.

240
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,160
Is your asthma improving?

241
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,190
Are you Lady Hong Yeon?

242
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,220
Who are you?

243
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,510
Your father in Hanyang sent me.

244
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,410
How are you feeling?

245
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,800
My father did?

246
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,330
Lady Hong Yeon!

247
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,020
My lady!

248
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,350
It looks like you're doing 
well. I'll tell him that.

249
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,610
I'll visit you again soon.

250
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,980
Please take care of yourself.

251
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,920
Who is he?

252
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,540
My father apparently sent him.

253
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,020
This is the medicine 
your mother sent.

254
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,640
Have some.

255
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,450
I am sorry for confusing 
you last time.

256
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,670
Don't mention it!

257
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,130
You don't have to worry 
about someone like me.

258
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,580
It looks like your plan worked out.

259
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,270
I think I misunderstood you.

260
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,120
Misunderstood?

261
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,750
I don't know what it is, 
but I'm glad it worked out.

262
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,320
By the way,

263
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,600
why did you want to 
see me again?

264
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,970
You probably know 
a lady named Hong Yeon.

265
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes, I do.

266
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,690
Please do not tell 
anyone about her.

267
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,720
No matter what it is about.

268
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,460
A candidate of the 
selection should

269
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,600
not have anything to 
do with the prince.

270
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,870
How did you know that 
we know each other?

271
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,220
Did that lady tell you that?

272
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,150
That she feels uncomfortable 
about knowing me?

273
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,720
She said you did her a big favor.

274
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,800
I am very thankful about that.

275
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,290
Why are you...

276
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,070
thanking me for that?

277
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,830
Because she is my woman.

278
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,700
She was my woman 
from the beginning.

279
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,820
What are you doing in the palace?

280
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,550
I came because His Majesty 
wanted to see me.

281
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,190
You may not know since you were 
never educated as a royal,

282
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,690
but the further away you are
 from the palace, the better.

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,490
By chance,

284
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,190
are you close to His Excellency
 Jo Heung Gyeon?

285
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,390
Pardon?

286
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,160
Do not trust that man.

287
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,840
He bragged about 
how you are his puppet.

288
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,670
What do you mean by that?

289
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,880
What I meant is that
 you should not

290
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,630
tempt what is inside the palace 
because you are a prince.

291
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,760
A traitor's offspring who grew up 
on the streets is not granted anything.

292
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,690
You may leave the palace now.

293
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,160
Do not think about
 frequenting this place.

294
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,260
My lady.

295
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,090
Don't you feel nervous?

296
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,500
Even I'm nervous since 
it's the last round.

297
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,630
I'm sure you'd get chosen, right?

298
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,400
Whether we're hiding something?

299
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,040
That's what Eun Bo asked you?

300
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,200
Yes.

301
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,120
Perhaps she heard 
something at the palace?

302
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,820
 A traitor's offspring who grew up 
on the streets is not granted anything. 

303
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,770
Is it okay for you to be here?

304
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,570
Thanks to that woman,

305
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,400
the King stopped being 
suspicious of me.

306
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,270
That's a relief.

307
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,890
It looks like the woman made 
it to the third round.

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,940
The day of our revolt 
is not too far off.

309
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,970
Yes.

310
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,250
The Queen Dowager's decision 
will determine our fate.

311
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,590
But we don't know what 
she's thinking yet.

312
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,200
I'll meet with the priestess and 
get the Queen Dowager's answer.

313
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,020
I heard you wanted to see me.

314
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,790
I got curious about 
something while reading.

315
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Do you know anything 
about prophetic dreams?

316
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,330
Prophetic dreams are

317
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,320
the dreams you are granted with 
from the sun, moon, and stars.

318
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,580
- The sun, moon, and stars...
- Even the people

319
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,820
who worship the spirit like me

320
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,430
rarely have that power.

321
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,670
Not anyone can have
 those dreams?

322
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,950
I'm not sure if it's possible,

323
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,480
but if you keep having
 those dreams,

324
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,730
your body might become weak.

325
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,400
 Your Majesty, it's Han Mo. 

326
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,050
I understand.

327
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,570
You may leave.

328
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,440
I moved Wal somewhere
 else as you ordered.

329
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,900
Good work.

330
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,340
Your Majesty.

331
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,030
What did the priestess say?

332
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,360
Granted from the
 sun, moon, and stars...

333
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,640
Maybe the dreams might

334
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,840
help to turn everything
 back to normal.

335
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,980
Pardon?

336
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,830
Both of this trinket and the Queen

337
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,700
need to be put back 
where they were.

338
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,330
I also need to fix my 
mistake for doing that

339
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,340
to Kang Yi Soo as well.

340
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,860
I will go to Queen Mother's chamber
 first thing in the morning.

341
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,310
I will make them reinvestigate
 Kang Yi Soo's case.

342
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,490
King.

343
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,810
I will clear

344
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,450
Kang Yi Soo's name for teaching 
the Queen about enlightenment,

345
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,820
which is an absurd accusation.

346
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,670
What are you talking about 
all of a sudden, King?

347
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,270
We already reached 
a conclusion regarding that.

348
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,890
Do you really think we did?

349
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,600
I never thought that way, 
not even once.

350
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm filled with a sense of guilt, 
obligation, and shame...

351
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,270
at every moment.

352
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,700
King, I mean...

353
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,200
- Son?
- Yes.

354
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,840
Since I am your son,

355
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,630
I just let it go.

356
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,390
But this time I request of you.

357
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,580
Please confess your crime.

358
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,520
If so, I will reduce
 the punishment.

359
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,780
That will never happen.

360
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,810
Treating the mother you 
gave birth to you like this

361
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,120
is completely outrageous!

362
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,220
I will give you some time.

363
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,000
Whether you would confess
 or I would reveal your crime

364
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,130
is up to you, Mother.

365
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,280
This opportunity I'm giving you

366
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,890
is the last of filial duty I can fulfill.

367
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,570
King!

368
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,610
Do you think Queen Mother 
would accept that?

369
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,630
I just hope she does.

370
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,400
Even if she does not,

371
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,930
there would be no use.

372
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,820
Han Mo.

373
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,320
Run an errand for me.

374
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

375
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Are you out there?

376
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,270
Tell the Chief State Minister to 
come to the palace immediately.

377
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
- Immediately!
- Yes, Your Highness.

378
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,930
His Majesty sent me here.

379
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,660
Wal!

380
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,480
You little...

381
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,430
Seriously...

382
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,340
Why am I so happy to see you?

383
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,580
Are you okay? Did you get injured...

384
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,340
I went through so much
 because of you...

385
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,480
Your Majesty...

386
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,890
You must've become very
 close in a short period.

387
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,760
You mean her and me?

388
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,570
Not at all!

389
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,180
Not with this punk...

390
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,120
"This punk?"

391
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,230
With this lady...

392
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,620
things are still kind of 
awkward and distant...

393
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,100
We're basically strangers.

394
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,250
Don't you think, Lady?

395
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Your Majesty. Anyway...

396
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,890
please have a seat here.

397
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,800
You saved my life. 
I'll take a deep bow.

398
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,870
A hundred times or
 a thousand times...

399
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,320
- I will...
- That's enough.

400
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,480
Huh?

401
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,390
That is okay.

402
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,320
Have a seat.

403
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay then...

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
- That is okay, that is okay.
- Okay, Your Majesty.

405
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Even though I am no
 longer suspicious of you,

406
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,190
it is still true that you were 
seen with the gunman's body.

407
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,500
I wanted to hear about it.

408
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,310
It is just as I told you last time.

409
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,340
I went to meet a client that a courtesan 
named Cho Hyang introduced me to.

410
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,630
And there, I saw two 
corpses out of nowhere!

411
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,400
I was so shocked.

412
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,130
Anything else in the house?

413
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,650
Well, nothing in particular...

414
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,490
Oh, right...

415
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,620
I had forgotten since many 
things happened to me lately,

416
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,350
but one of them was 
still barely breathing.

417
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,150
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

418
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,540
Excuse me, Ahjussi!

419
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,610
- What?
- Gae Pyeong...

420
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,640
Gae Pyeong...

421
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
Gae Pyeong?

422
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,400
Gae Pyeong?

423
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,230
It was "Gae..."

424
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,860
Gae...

425
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,440
Gae...

426
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,960
"Gae Pyeong!"

427
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,070
That's it!

428
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,960
He said, "Gae Pyeong!" 
Gae Pyeong!

429
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,980
Yes.

430
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,310
Gae Pyeong.

431
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,860
What do you think that is?

432
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,470
Well, they call a small change 
"Gae Pyeong" at gambling places.

433
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,190
There's no way 
a dying man said that.

434
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,960
It's probably someone's name.

435
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,840
If so, could it be the culprit's name?

436
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,130
That is highly likely.

437
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,220
Research that name.

438
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,530
You mean me?

439
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,810
I'll appoint you as an officer at the 
Royal Investigation Bureau.

440
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,310
Your Majesty.

441
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,440
Whoa...

442
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,620
You really want me to...

443
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,810
An officer at the 
Royal Investigation Bureau

444
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,940
is a pretty powerful position, 
as I understand.

445
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,730
There is another reason why 
I am sending you to the Bureau.

446
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,580
The culprit's spy is hiding there.

447
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,710
You need to find that spy as well.

448
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,850
Me?

449
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,200
Will you really entrust Wal 
with those things?

450
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,130
Looking at your face...

451
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,030
Why? Is he not trustworthy?

452
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,230
I thought he was competent since
 he owns the Buyong Agency.

453
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,750
He's useful as an informant.

454
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,160
But he's very rambunctious...

455
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,100
He can be kind of silly.

456
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,000
I made him do it since he is like that.

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,620
No one would think 
of him as a threat.

458
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,180
Also...

459
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,740
the culprit must know who the 
owner of the Buyong Agency is.

460
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,600
- I cannot let him be exposed.
- I see.

461
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,250
He helped you.

462
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,550
I am returning the favor.

463
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,520
There is a place I want to go with 
you since we're outside the palace.

464
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,570
This is...

465
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,630
Do you remember?

466
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,870
When I met you for the 
first time in ten years,

467
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,480
I thought you forgot everything 
about our childhood memories.

468
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,150
I told you that, didn't I?

469
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,440
That I forgot about it all.

470
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,600
I tried to remember it even
 if it's just for myself.

471
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
It is a precious memory that

472
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,700
cannot be replaced with anything.

473
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,650
Wait for me, Brother!

474
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,380
Let's go inside.

475
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,420
There is something 
I want to return to you.

476
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,330
How do you have this...

477
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,080
During the first round of selection,

478
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,020
you misplaced, and I have 
been keeping it safe.

479
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,750
I heard Chief Eunuch Hwang
 told you everything.

480
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,780
Yes.

481
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,910
The little prince

482
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,060
you met ten years ago

483
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,840
signed a petition to dismiss 
a subject in order to

484
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,290
protect the position
 of the crown prince.

485
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,130
When he became the 
king ten years later,

486
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,030
he lost that subject whom 
he wanted as the right-hand man.

487
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,420
But if it is not too late,

488
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,350
he wishes to turn everything back.

489
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,740
I will clear His Excellency 
Kang Yi Soo's name

490
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,330
and reinstate you as the queen.

491
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,190
I will make sure to keep the 
promise I made with you

492
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,630
under the sun, moon, 
and stars right here.

493
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,100
Could you wait for a little 
bit longer until then?

494
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,980
I know that the reason 
you participated

495
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,230
in the selection was not 
to be back by my side.

496
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,240
You probably wanted to

497
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,470
catch the culprit and clear 
your father's name.

498
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,110
But let me ask you this.

499
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,430
When everything is over,

500
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,460
could you come back to me

501
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,600
as Eun Ki,

502
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,820
and as my queen?

503
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,400
I will get going then.

504
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,100
 It was me, not Unni. 

505
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,970
 The King also liked me as a child. 

506
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,790
His Majesty really 
warned you like that?

507
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,210
He was not just saying that.

508
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,950
He was truly determined
 to cause trouble.

509
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,860
He is abandoning his own 
mother over a woman.

510
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,300
Oh, boy...

511
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,900
How could he abandon
 his filial duty as a son?

512
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,410
If I face predicament over that,

513
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,530
you think the Kim family 
would be okay?

514
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,380
Come up with a solution somehow.

515
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,840
No matter what it takes!

516
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,980
Perhaps the King was bluffing
 in order to go after us.

517
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,520
Don't you know how he is?

518
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,190
He doesn't know how to
 play tricks like that.

519
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,540
He was trying to be 
respectful to his mother.

520
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,490
What should we do then?

521
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,620
What do you mean,
 "what should we do?"

522
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,120
It seems like

523
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,030
he already warned her 
not to do anything.

524
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,600
Since when did that 
stop us anyway?

525
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,300
But we can't be too hasty either.

526
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,270
If we can silence the palace lady
 who informed him,

527
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,850
everything would be fine.

528
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,940
How could we silence her?

529
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,770
It would be all over if she's dragged
 to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

530
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,950
No matter how well she
 endures the cruel torture,

531
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,420
she won't be able to last that long.

532
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,700
So you mean

533
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,600
we should kidnap her 
before she gets arrested.

534
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,700
And how would we do that?

535
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,540
And where would we keep 
her even if we did?

536
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,900
It's for a preventative measure.

537
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,090
It'd be better to cut off 
the roots completely.

538
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,590
I don't know if Queen Mother
 would allow it.

539
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,130
I'm sure she would.

540
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,470
The family is about 
to get destroyed.

541
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,560
Hyungnim.

542
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,800
The third round of 
selection starts tomorrow.

543
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,550
You need to do something quickly, 
no matter what it is.

544
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
The mission of the third round

545
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,450
should be decided by you, 
Your Highness.

546
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,130
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong is here.

547
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,020
I heard you have many 
questions for me.

548
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,360
Why did you lie to me?

549
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,150
I heard the King caused the 
prison break to save Father.

550
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,130
What significance does that have?

551
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,100
How could it not
 have any significance?

552
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,700
- The King didn't try to kill Father.
- So?

553
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,100
What changed?

554
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,780
Your father became 
a sacrificial lamb for the King

555
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,020
and he died following 
the King's order.

556
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,700
Are you being fooled 
by his sweet talk?

557
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
It's not like that.

558
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,070
Because you made me
 doubt him by lying...

559
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,320
To me, all of that is true.

560
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,840
The King killed Kang Yi Soo.

561
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,820
My old friend who shared
 a dream with me!

562
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,050
The King killed him.

563
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,130
What is that dream 
you're referring to?

564
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,120
Why can't you talk to
 me clearly about it?

565
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,720
Please tell me everything
 without hiding!

566
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,370
Tell me what your goal is

567
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,820
and why is the 
headquarters fully armed?

568
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,800
What can you achieve 
by making me the queen?

569
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,910
I need to know now.

570
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,200
The third round begins 
tomorrow, right?

571
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,720
You should prepare
 for that for now.

572
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,670
I'll tell you everything
 when the selection ends.

573
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,700
It's Gae Pyeong!

574
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,590
Hong Yeon was staying at 
a small temple in Yeojoomok.

575
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,020
What should I do?

576
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,640
Watch her closely for now.

577
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm sure she'd come in 
handy when it's time.

578
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,230
Yes, sir.

579
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,300
By the way...

580
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,660
the King has been too quiet

581
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,730
after he arrested the owner 
of the Buyong Agency.

582
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,630
It's about time for the King to 
start interrogating the man.

583
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,500
That wouldn't be a 
strange thing at all.

584
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,410
I'll find out through the spy
 I planted at the Bureau.

585
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:51,200
Try to be discreet in 
everything you do.

586
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,420
If you get caught by chance,

587
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,940
everyone would find out that

588
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,460
I was the one who 
pointed a gun at the King.

589
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,480
If that happens,

590
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,950
Young Ji would be put
 into danger as well.

591
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,620
 I'll keep that in mind. 

592
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,060
How dare you...

593
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,400
How dare you do this?

594
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,590
Why?

595
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,350
Why did you do that?

596
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,410
Why did you do that? Why?

597
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,110
How dare you do that 
to His Majesty?

598
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,280
Do you even know
 what you've done?

599
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,600
Do you know what
 he means to me?

600
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,360
Do you know how 
precious he is to me?

601
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,500
How could you do that?

602
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,680
What am I supposed to do

603
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,830
if all of this gets revealed?

604
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,150
What am I supposed to do?

605
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,570
Never mind becoming the queen.

606
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,820
I'd never be able to go
 near His Majesty.

607
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,720
It'd all be over!

608
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
What should I do...

609
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,100
No one will find out.

610
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,060
That would never happen.

611
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,960
If I get caught by chance,

612
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,370
I'd cut my tongue off 
and die immediately.

613
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,000
You'd never hear me mentioning

614
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,850
your name or His Excellency.

615
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,500
Could you really...

616
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,000
keep that promise?

617
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,210
Did you want to see me?

618
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,110
He's the new officer who'll be 
your partner starting today.

619
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,320
Teach him well, so he doesn't get 
on the wrong side of Chief.

620
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,280
Pardon?

621
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,390
This guy?

622
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,520
He's the new guy?

623
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

624
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,490
I hope we get along in the future.

625
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,550
We've seen each other often while 
I was running the Buyong Agency.

626
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,950
Let's try not to be too difficult.

627
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,100
Who got you this job anyway?

628
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,820
How about your agency?

629
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,890
Try not to be too curious.

630
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,680
If I told you, you'd faint from shock.

631
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,760
Excuse me.

632
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,500
You know that thing over there?

633
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,100
What's that place for?

634
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,390
That's the office for the higher-ups.

635
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,290
If you go that way, that's 
the interrogation area.

636
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,620
And if you go that way, 
there's the chief's office.

637
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,240
Sir.

638
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,780
- This is...
- I've heard.

639
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,620
You used to be behind bars.

640
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,490
I don't know how you managed to
 join the Royal Investigation Bureau,

641
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,040
but you'd better brace yourself.

642
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,440
I hate the ones who come 
 through connections.

643
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,800
Aigoo...

644
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,870
What a warm welcome...

645
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,840
I'll try my best to serve you, sir.

646
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,550
Make sure he doesn't 
do anything stupid.

647
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,530
- Watch him closely.
- Yes.

648
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,050
Yes.

649
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,380
So he is...

650
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,760
Come on...

651
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,470
You don't need to tell me.

652
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,750
He's one of those pests, isn't he?

653
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,180
You promised to share 
the information with me.

654
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,520
You remember that, correct?

655
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,110
I thought we both could
 find it useful

656
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,680
if it's regarding Lady Hong. 
That's why I wanted to see you.

657
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,980
Did you find out anything?

658
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,090
That woman is not Hong Yeon.

659
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,060
The dead queen...

660
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,790
I mean,

661
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,760
the daughter of Kang Yi Soo
 came back to life.

662
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,650
Is there any evidence?

663
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,800
So...

664
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,010
you mean that woman
 is the dead queen?

665
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,040
Is that really true?

666
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,170
Did the queen really 
come back to life?

667
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,130
Where did you hear that from?

668
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,970
Are you sure that's accurate?

669
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,270
Yes.

670
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,610
His Excellency Jo Heung Gyeon
 gave me that information

671
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,050
suggesting getting rid of her 
since she's both of our enemy.

672
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,260
Jo Heung Gyeon?

673
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,350
He really shared that 
with us so easily?

674
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,270
Can you trust him?

675
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,300
It seemed like he had evidence too.

676
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,650
The dead queen?

677
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,620
It sounds like there 
might be a solution.

678
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,030
What are your thoughts?

679
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,790
What if we killed a palace lady

680
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,230
and frame Lady Hong for it?

681
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,320
Queen Mother won't be 
able to just sit back

682
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,590
once she finds out that 
Lady Hong is the dead queen.

683
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,050
If that woman gets chosen 
again by chance,

684
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,170
that would be a huge disaster.

685
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,240
That's why I'm saying this.

686
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,560
That palace lady is Queen Mother's 
right-hand woman,

687
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,250
but we should get rid of her 
 to prevent anything worse.

688
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,220
Please persuade her saying that.

689
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,900
Also,

690
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,480
if you told her that we 
could kick Lady Hong out

691
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,900
by framing her for 
murdering that palace lady,

692
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,400
Queen Mother would 
have to be on board too.

693
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,260
I'll take care of the rest.

694
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,120
If you just persuade Queen Mother,

695
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,000
I'll get things going starting tonight.

696
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,300
My lady.

697
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,980
Did something happen 
while you were out?

698
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,400
You're acting strange today.

699
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,360
Yeo Wool,

700
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,200
have you ever waited
 for your lover?

701
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,910
Lover?

702
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,400
Maybe I'm still too young.

703
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,480
I don't really know 
about that kind of stuff.

704
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,380
When I was a lot younger than you,

705
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,590
I waited for this young man.

706
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,330
I was curious about him, 
and I missed him.

707
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:37,680
And I got angry waiting for him 
when he didn't keep his promise.

708
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,590
I didn't realize it back then,

709
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
but that was love.

710
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,390
Am I...

711
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,280
not supposed to feel 
that way again?

712
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,670
Pardon?

713
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,930
My lady.

714
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,270
How could you say such an 
absurd thing facing the selection?

715
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,370
I'm afraid someone 
might've heard you.

716
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,200
You worked hard making this 
far along with the selection.

717
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:32,680
One of you will be 
chosen as the queen.

718
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,450
I hope you try your best 
working on the last mission.

719
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,850
 Yes, Your Highness. 

720
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,350
Court Lady Jung, 
announce the mission.

721
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,860
Yes, Your Highness.

722
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,400
You probably all heard the 
story from the Song Dynasty

723
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,140
about young Sima Guang 
breaking a water jug

724
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,610
by throwing a rock 
at it to save his friend

725
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,870
who fell into it.

726
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,280
No matter how precious the 
water jug might have been,

727
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,450
he could easily destroy it

728
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,750
in order to save a precious life.

729
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,030
To put it in different words,

730
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,720
it means you should know

731
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,650
how to give up something to gain 
something else that is precious.

732
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,280
So let me ask you this.

733
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,780
As the queen who supports the king
 who's also her husband,

734
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,040
it's graceful always to 
hold back and sacrifice.

735
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,770
What would you be able to 
sacrifice to become the queen?

736
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,030
Your answer to this question

737
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,300
will be judged by me, Queen Mother,
 and the rest of the royal family.

738
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,700
Court Lady Jung.

739
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,160
Yes, Your Highness.

740
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,720
Come inside.

741
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,900
By 1 p.m. tomorrow,

742
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,230
please bring the thing

743
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,830
you are willing to 
sacrifice in that box.

744
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,240
Your Majesty.

745
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,270
How come you've been standing 
here for almost an hour?

746
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,510
You always nag when
 I want to go somewhere.

747
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,930
Now you are nagging
 for standing still?

748
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,560
I'm not nagging.

749
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,090
I thought you were

750
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,660
waiting here to catch
 her passing by.

751
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,430
I'm just out here because
 the weather is nice.

752
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,740
The nice weather.

753
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,070
I guess...

754
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,490
it's about time they finished 
announcing the mission.

755
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,910
The young ladies are staying 
at Yeonghwadang, so...

756
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,780
she won't be walking 
down this path.

757
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,910
Why are you telling me that now?

758
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,290
Your Majesty!

759
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,260
Where are you going?

760
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,850
Today, you'll be staying in 
your designated room.

761
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,300
Please get some rest.

762
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,670
Well...

763
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:09,390
may I stop by the library?

764
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,250
I thought I might find it 
useful for the mission.

765
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,390
I'll ask Court Lady Jung.

766
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,240
She might get kicked out soon.

767
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,700
So she probably should take
 a tour around the palace.

768
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,460
Are you here to look 
for the answer too?

769
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,900
However, I'm not finding much.

770
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,380
When I was nine,

771
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,970
I met His Majesty for the first time.

772
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,180
When I entered the palace
 as the princess's Yedong,

773
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,570
I was bullied.

774
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,350
And back then,

775
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,170
His Majesty helped me.

776
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,080
So I could get along 
with other children.

777
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,970
He wasn't amiable,

778
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,210
but it was enough for me

779
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,470
to fall in love with him.

780
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,900
Why are you confessing
 this to me?

781
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,500
It's not a confession.

782
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,480
It's a pledge.

783
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,340
I won't miss the opportunity 
to be by His Majesty twice.

784
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,730
I won't let anyone interfere.

785
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,160
We need to work on the mission.

786
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,360
What is it that you wanted 
to talk to me about?

787
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,690
I just wanted to get some
 fresh air and chat.

788
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,340
By the way,

789
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,580
did you hear that rumor?

790
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,590
That lady named Hong Yeon.

791
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:22,500
What...

792
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,320
What about Lady Hong Yeon?

793
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,950
The thing is...

794
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:30,480
She's apparently indeed 
the resurrected queen.

795
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,060
Pardon?

796
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,050
I heard it's from a reliable source.

797
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,930
Okay, I'll come back soon.

798
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,520
- Take care.
- Okay!

799
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,390
My goodness!

800
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:50,780
What's going on?

801
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,120
It's Wal!

802
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,030
What took you so long?

803
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,940
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

804
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,410
This is Yong Ho hyungnim.

805
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,310
Hello, sir!

806
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,840
Yes, yes. Let's go inside.

807
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,540
Let's go!

808
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,960
How fancy!

809
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,000
Go ahead.

810
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,610
Let's go inside.

811
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,250
- Help him inside.
- Come with me, sir.

812
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,100
Hurry up and help him in.

813
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,350
Have some, sir.

814
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,330
So...

815
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,640
you became a government
 official. What a blessing.

816
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,600
The soldiers came here looking
 for you the other day.

817
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,950
So I thought you committed 
a huge crime.

818
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,210
They say life is full of irony.

819
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,620
My life has been full of ups 
and downs lately.

820
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,320
By the way,

821
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,610
is it true that 
Cho Hyang disappeared?

822
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:37,850
Yes!

823
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,390
She disappeared without a trace.

824
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,690
Maybe she really eloped 
with that suspicious man.

825
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,270
Suspicious man?

826
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,450
What's all this?

827
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,090
Whom did you say that man is?

828
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,720
I don't know who he is.

829
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,410
All kinds of people come to the 
watering hole all the time.

830
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,570
You didn't get to see his face?

831
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,840
I couldn't see his face well 
because of the hat, but...

832
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,440
Right! He had a scar 
on the back of his neck.

833
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,670
He had a burnt mark that looked
like a soldering iron burn.

834
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,890
A burnt mark on the 
back of the neck?

835
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:31,920
Queen Dowager seems 
quite determined.

836
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,360
I visited her and tried 
sounding her out.

837
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,650
It seemed like she was quite 
impressed with the fact that

838
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,670
she made it to the final
 round on her own.

839
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,890
So is it safe to assume that
 she'd get selected?

840
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,920
Probably so.

841
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,910
I will do as you said.

842
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,300
I'll make the palace lady who made
 the false confession come clean

843
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,020
and confess my sin as well.

844
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,570
Are you satisfied?

845
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,010
Do you mean that?

846
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,660
Am I...

847
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,160
still your mother?

848
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,790
Never mind.

849
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,840
I made this decision 
because I was afraid that

850
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:50,210
my family might get harmed 
once you draw your sword.

851
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,990
If you still consider me 
as your mother,

852
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,610
please do not punish 
the Kim family.

853
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,200
Do you not think punishing
 your mother is enough?

854
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,530
Is that enough to make
 you believe me?

855
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,040
Oh, whoa...

856
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,960
She doesn't just resemble 
her. She looks exactly like her.

857
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,180
- Really?
- She looks just like her.

858
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,270
How could that be?

859
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,880
What's going on?

860
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,760
I asked you what's going on?

861
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,280
Well, the thing is...

862
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,300
What?

863
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,140
There's a rumor in the palace?

864
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,750
I stopped them, but the young 
palace ladies can be chatty.

865
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,700
How could her resemblance to the 
dead queen be such a gossip?

866
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,500
They don't say just a resemblance.

867
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,300
The rumor has it that
 it's the same woman.

868
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,310
In the palace, whenever there 
are two or more gathered,

869
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,920
everyone is busy 
talking about that.

870
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,850
It sounds like Song Yi did a 
good job spreading the rumor.

871
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,290
I'm sure.

872
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,850
Deliver this letter to
 Lady Hong now.

873
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,040
Pardon?

874
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,720
Yes, Your Highness.

875
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,230
Queen Mother told me to
 give this to you.

876
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,640
To me?

877
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,010
 

878
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,110
By chance...

879
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,950
do you know what this letter says?

880
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,080
Pardon?

881
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,280
No.

882
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,270
How would I dare reading 
Queen Mother's letter?

883
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,290
Why did she want this 
letter delivered to me?

884
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,250
I wouldn't know.

885
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,930
Queen Mother will be
 looking for me.

886
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,840
I should get going now.

887
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,930
What does this mean?

888
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,440
That palace lady killed my father?

889
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,450
Hold on a second.

890
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,690
Hey.

891
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,430
What are you doing here?

892
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,240
Your Majesty!

893
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,750
It's Chief Eunuch Hwang.

894
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,190
Come in.

895
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,000
What is it about?

896
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,360
A palace lady was found 
dead in the palace.

897
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,820
What?

898
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,400
 What happened here? 

899
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,750
 What happened? 

900
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,300
She was poisoned.

901
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,770
Poisoned?

902
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,190
First of all, find out where 
she was last night.

903
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,780
The King ordered to 
search everywhere

904
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,280
in the palace and arrest the
 culprit without delay.

905
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,300
Yes.

906
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,460
Yes.

907
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,960
That girl...

908
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,230
went to Yeonghwadang at night.

909
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,470
Yeonghwadang?

910
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:58,090
It's the annex where the candidates
 for the selection are staying.

911
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,650
The candidates for the selection?

912
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,910
She said she needs to deliver 
something to one of the candidates.

913
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:07,760
And she never came back
 to the palace ladies' quarter.

914
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,130
Where's Yeonghwadang?

915
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,710
- Over there...
- Lead the way.

916
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,860
Yes.

917
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,120
Which of you...

918
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,710
met with the Queen Mother's 
palace lady last night?

919
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,130
Queen Mother's palace lady?

920
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:43,170
Why do you ask that?

921
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,540
That palace lady was found 
dead in the morning.

922
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,140
We're trying to figure out 
where she was last night.

923
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,220
I heard she came to Yeonghwadang 
and never came back.

924
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,140
By chance, has anyone seen her?

925
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,710
I...

926
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,370
saw her.

927
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:11,790
I saw her...

928
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,550
with Lady Hong.

929
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,250
I saw that myself.

930
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,270
Yes, that's true.

931
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,310
I met her briefly last night.

932
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,680
What was it about?

933
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,910
She brought a letter 
from Queen Mother.

934
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,260
A letter?

935
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,300
Why would Queen Mother send 
a letter to Lady Hong?

936
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,860
She wouldn't do that to a random
 candidate during the selection.

937
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,060
Are you lying by chance?

938
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,080
Look here.

939
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,260
May I look at the letter?

940
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,900
The thing is...

941
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,100
I can't share the 
content of the letter.

942
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,400
Isn't this getting more and 
more suspicious?

943
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:01,180
I apologize, but I need to go
 through your belongings.

944
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,600
You guys should wait here, and
 the officers should follow me.

945
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:16,750
Search!

946
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,640
What are you doing? 
Why aren't you searching?

947
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,400
I'm about to search...

948
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,780
Try smelling this.

949
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,980
It's that poison...

950
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:06,090
We found poison in 
Lady Hong's belongings.

951
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,990
Queen Mother was 
probably behind this.

952
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,190
She prevented the palace lady 
from confessing!

953
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,140
Your Majesty.

954
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,400
The Royal Investigation Bureau

955
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,370
is investigating the young
 ladies at Yeonghwadang.

956
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,810
What?

957
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,230
That's impossible.

958
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,500
There must be something
 wrong. It's not mine!

959
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,200
The King ordered to 
arrest the culprit swiftly.

960
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,380
Take Lady Hong away!

961
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,610
Yes!

962
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,070
What are you doing? Let go of me!

963
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,810
Let go of me!

964
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,490
 

965
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,400
 I was framed. 

966
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,100
 I did not kill that palace lady. 

967
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,940
 Start the torturing 
until she confesses! 

968
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,260
 Aren't all of you questioning about 
Lady Hong being the dead queen? 

969
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,790
 Give me the evidence. 

970
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:36,120
 I want to be by your side even 
though it's not my name. 

971
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,530
 You need to hide the thing 
you cherish the most. 

972
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,640
 Go ahead. 

973
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,320
 I will pay back what 
I received no matter what! 

974
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,400
 That woman over there 

975
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,270
 is the daughter of the 
traitor, Kang Yi Soo!
