1
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,100
 

2
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,200
Wal!

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Sir, are you all right?

4
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,810
Wal.

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,240
Wal, are you okay?

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,650
Let me see!

7
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,720
Now that we bought some time,

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,030
the guards will be here soon.

9
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,220
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,350
It looks like the Prince ran away.

11
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,990
He wouldn't back out so easily...

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,000
He must've gone to Eun Bo.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,510
She is in danger!

14
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,400
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,280
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,740
Guard His Majesty!

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,130
Make way.

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,580
Your Majesty.

19
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,070
Let that woman go.

20
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,120
Your target is me.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,800
If you want to save this woman,

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,350
you will have to make way.

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,880
Your Majesty, do not listen to him.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,770
I am all right.

25
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,110
Please do not hesitate.

26
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,830
Your Majesty, you must arrest him.

27
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,410
We cannot let the 
insurgent army go like this.

28
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,020
Make...

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,300
- a way for him.
- Your Majesty!

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
No one should get in the way.

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,300
It is an order.

33
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,630
We will take him with us too.

34
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,640
Yes.

35
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,340
You will hear from me for sure. 
Do not follow me.

36
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,820
If you do anything stupid,

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,070
this woman will be in danger.

38
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,080
Send guards...

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,620
Send guards discreetly and
 have them followed.

40
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,700
They cannot be noticed.

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,030
Do you understand?

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,470
Your Excellency.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,100
It's past the time we agreed on, 
but the palace gate isn't opening.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,200
I think the plan failed.

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,890
We will retreat for now.

47
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,770
Yes.

48
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,880
We're retreating.

49
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,660
Were any other palaces invaded?

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,790
How are the Grandmother
 and Mother?

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,100
Thankfully, I heard they are all right.

52
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
I need to be there myself.

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,400
Let us go to the 
Queen Dowager's Palace.

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,530
 Your Majesty. 

55
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,200
 It's Han Mo. 

56
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,860
How did it go?

57
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,650
Did you have the guards 
follow them?

58
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,060
Go ahead of me with the hostages.

60
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,300
I'll take care of the ones 
who are following us

61
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,970
and there's something I need to do.

62
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,750
The ones who are following?

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Yes, I will.

64
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,000
You should follow me.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
Yes!

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
Did the King send you?

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,300
 If the Prince is plotting 
something with his men, 

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,920
 he might have joined forces
 with Jo Heung Gyeon. 

69
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,700
Sir.

70
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,120
What are you doing here...

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
I am here to take you with me.

72
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,970
Will you come with me now or...

73
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,140
receive my sword here and now?

74
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,980
I didn't want to go this far
 if the plan succeeded,

75
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,900
but you know where 
the headquarters is.

76
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,180
I cannot leave you by the King's side.

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,700
Did you indeed start the coup?

78
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,050
Make your choice.

79
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,810
What will you do?

80
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,220
Do you want to be back on my side

81
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,750
and start a new world with me?

82
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
Kill me.

83
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,330
I cannot betray His Majesty.

84
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,400
You already betrayed me, 
but you cannot do it again?

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,020
If so...

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,300
death is all you've got left.

87
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,500
 His Majesty is here! 

88
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,870
King!

89
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,130
Are you all right, Grandmother?

90
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,300
How about you, are you all right?

91
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,370
I heard it was a coup.

92
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,280
What in the world is going on?

93
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,520
The Prince and Jo Heung Gyeon
 caused a coup.

94
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,530
We're still taking care of the situation. 
Please stay in the chamber.

95
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,080
Please be attentive to her.

96
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,140
Do not worry.

98
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,280
The Prince and Jo Heung Gyeon?

99
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,590
So...

100
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,020
did you arrest them?

101
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,180
Take the hostages to empty 
storage and tie them up.

102
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,490
 Yes! 

103
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,500
 Your Highness! 

104
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,970
Your Highness.

105
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,970
That woman was captured and 
is locked up in the storage room.

106
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,730
Is that so?

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Byeol, bring her here discreetly.

108
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
No.

110
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,770
Is it stuck?

111
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,340
I asked you if it's stuck.

112
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,240
Be quiet!

113
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,560
You just need to...

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,190
go the opposite way it was tied.

115
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,170
Why is that so hard?

116
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,590
Geez...

117
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
You are...

118
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,200
What are you doing here?

119
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,810
Her Highness wants to see you.

120
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,400
No.

121
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,440
No, where are you taking her?

122
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,630
Hey!

123
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,620
Hey!

124
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,410
Where are you taking her to...

125
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,070
Hey, where are you going?

126
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,200
It looks like you're in shock.

127
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm sure you didn't think
 you'd see me here.

128
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,700
Did you plot a coup 
with the Prince?

129
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,700
You tried to kill 
His Majesty yourself?

130
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,660
As you can see.

131
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,030
How does it feel?

132
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,000
You will go to hell soon, like me.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,530
You will want to kill yourself.

134
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,130
At least...

135
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,870
I thought you had a sincere heart.

136
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,800
- What?
- I lost my family...

137
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,600
because of your father's greed.

138
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,030
I cannot forgive you for

139
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,020
covering up his sin, but

140
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,820
I thought it was because of love.

141
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,820
But it was not.

142
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,800
You are the same. 
You were just greedy.

143
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,100
Your dirty greed that only desired 
a place by His Majesty's side.

144
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,000
You tried to become the 
queen by faking your identity.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,700
- How are you different?
- At least I...

146
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,020
didn't look the other way
 and run away.

147
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,400
Right now, you are 
cowardly and pathetic.

148
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,400
That makes me pity you.

149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,270
Your Highness!

150
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't you dare blabber your mouth. 
You don't know anything!

151
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,800
Don't you know whose fault this is?

152
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,700
Don't you know who
 ruined everything?

153
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,180
If only you didn't exist,

154
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,310
I wouldn't have 
become so miserable.

155
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,250
So shut your mouth.

156
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,710
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

157
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,830
Kill me.

158
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,300
Nothing would change
 for you even if I'm gone.

159
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,730
Young Ji.

160
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,860
Give it up.

161
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,900
This wench is just 
a bait to lure the King.

162
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,750
I will toss her to you when 
she becomes useless.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,750
So...

164
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,510
don't be hasty.

165
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,450
Lure the King?

166
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,280
What are you talking about?

167
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,100
Just wait.

168
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,820
You'll find out soon enough.

169
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
I'll make sure to kill you in 
front of His Majesty.

170
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,360
Someone in the palace
 assisted the coup.

171
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you mean there is 
a spy in the palace?

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Invading the palace and kidnapping
 Eun Bo were all planned.

173
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,400
So someone must have

174
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,550
helped them kidnap her.

175
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,900
Find the palace lady
 who escorted Eun Bo.

176
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,400
Yes, Your Majesty!

177
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,650
Wal.

178
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,630
Wal!

179
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,790
Look here.

180
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,970
Over here!

181
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,960
Sir.

182
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,570
The woman we're holding hostage

183
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,820
wants to treat the injured one.

184
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,160
Bring her medicinal herbs

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
and deliver this letter to the 
King when the day breaks.

186
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,110
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,700
The first plan has failed.

188
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,380
We lost significant military 
strength due to the failure.

189
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,340
So we should lure the 
King to come out alone.

190
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,530
I already found a good location.

191
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,710
Let's get our military together
 that's in a disarray

192
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,290
and inspect the location.

193
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,380
That would take at least a day.

194
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,570
But no matter how 
much I think about it,

195
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,900
I don't think the King will come 
out alone without a single guard.

196
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,580
He will have no choice if 
he wants to save the woman.

197
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,040
Do you think he'd go that 
far just to save a woman?

198
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,810
If he wasn't planning 
to save the woman,

199
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,540
he wouldn't have let the Prince 
leave the palace in the first place.

200
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,900
We don't have any other 
choice in this situation.

201
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,070
If there's even a remote possibility,

202
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,300
we should pursue it no matter what.

203
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,400
What would you do

204
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,890
if the King doesn't 
show up by chance?

205
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,830
You mean the palace lady 
who escorted her disappeared?

206
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,520
Did you notice anything suspicious 
about that palace lady?

207
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,340
Well...

208
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,880
she was summoned by 
Consort Kim's palace lady often.

209
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,630
Consort Kim?

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,600
So you mean...

211
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
the King will not even come to
 see how I am in this chaos?

212
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,250
The chief eunuch from the 
Grand Palace did stop by.

213
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,810
How about Consort Kim?

214
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,900
I summoned her a long time ago.

215
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,340
Why isn't she showing her face?

216
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,620
Consort Kim also said...

217
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,930
she cannot come due
 to such a shock.

218
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,370
What?

219
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,810
That's enough.

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Considering what you did,
 this is not nearly enough.

221
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,070
But I am letting this go since 
I cannot cause too much noise.

222
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,550
Lock this b**** up in here.

223
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,710
 Yes. 

224
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,190
Your Majesty!

225
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,100
What brings you all the way 
over to my chamber?

226
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,830
There was a coup.

227
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,610
Where did you go in this situation?

228
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,010
Well...

229
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,770
The thing is...

230
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,200
How did your skirts 
get so wet like that?

231
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
- Pardon?
- I want you to tell me.

232
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,410
Where did you just come from?

233
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,260
His Majesty is asking 
you a question!

234
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,090
Will you answer only 
after a beating?

235
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,430
Well...

236
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,290
we are coming from the storage
 room near Yeochoon Gate.

237
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,440
- Chief Eunuch Hwang.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,490
Send someone to the
 storage room immediately.

239
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,140
Consort Hong's palace lady
 must be there.

240
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,370
It is possible that she 
participated in the coup.

241
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,500
Interrogate her when you find her, and 
you must reveal who was behind it.

242
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
Your Majesty!

243
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,400
Forgive me.

244
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,790
To be honest,

245
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,570
I told that palace lady 
to lock up that woman.

246
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,660
Are you confessing that

247
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
- you participated in the treason?
- The treason?

248
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,460
Not at all. It's impossible!

249
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,860
I was just...

250
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,350
I was just angry that 
she ruined my family.

251
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,700
I wanted to scare her a bit. 
I was just letting my anger out!

252
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,020
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

253
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,090
Search Consort Kim's chamber

255
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,600
to find the evidence of 
treason and imprison her.

256
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,250
Your Majesty!

257
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,530
Your Majesty!

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Did you get hurt...

259
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
by chance?

260
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,750
What are you trying to
 do to His Majesty?

261
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,570
Are you curious?

262
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,060
I'll kill him when 
he comes to save you.

263
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,890
Before your eyes.

264
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm thinking of giving you a chance.

265
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,140
Be my woman.

266
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,390
If so, you can live.

267
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,230
That Wal...

268
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,740
will not get hurt anymore, either.

269
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,180
Is this why you 
brought Wal here too?

270
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
To threaten me like this?

271
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,150
Why are you taking 
this to this extent?

272
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,580
Do you want the throne that much?

273
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,520
Do you want the power that much?

274
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,790
Lee Kyung.

275
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,490
I hate that man.

276
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,130
I don't know if it's because 
he's the king or he has you,

277
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,280
but I know this for sure.

278
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,070
I will take this all the way 
and become the king.

279
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,540
And...

280
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,270
I will have you.

281
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,830
That will not happen.

282
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,000
Because the Heavens would 
never allow such injustice.

283
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,580
And no matter what may happen,

284
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,040
you will never have me.

285
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,200
I am already His Majesty's woman.

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,310
If so...

287
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,640
I'll take your life away then.

288
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,010
Lock up the woman.

289
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes.

290
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,680
Follow me.

291
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,000
 I want you to protect yourself
 with it until we meet again. 

292
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,750
Your Majesty.

293
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,000
They found the palace lady in the 
storage room near Yeochoon Gate.

294
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,500
But they did not find the evidence 
of treason in Consort Kim's chamber.

295
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,800
in Consort Kim's chamber.

296
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,280
Consort Kim was used just 
because she was in the palace.

297
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,890
She could not have been 
deeply involved in the coup.

298
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,960
That is why there is no evidence.

299
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,810
What happened to the guards that
 followed the insurgent army?

300
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,140
I have not heard from them yet.

301
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
And Your Majesty...

302
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
Consort Hong, I mean...

303
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,010
This letter was found
 in her chamber.

304
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,160
It looks like she left it
 for Your Majesty.

305
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,410
Let's go.

306
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,910
 Your Majesty. 

307
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,930
 I do not think I will see 
you before I leave. 

308
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,550
 So I leave you this heartfelt letter. 

309
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,910
 I was truly happy in every moment 

310
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,310
 I shared with you. 

311
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,430
 I had said that I do not 
wish for anything else, 

312
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,600
 but if I had one more wish, 

313
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,000
 I wish for you to be
 in peace, Your Majesty. 

314
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,960
 I wish you will no longer be in 
pain physically and mentally 

315
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,990
 and be strong. 

316
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,740
 Whenever and wherever I am, 
I will always pray for that. 

317
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,800
 I will always long for you in that way. 

318
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,590
Why isn't there any news?

319
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,500
Neither the Prince nor Consort Kim.

320
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,600
We haven't heard from them at all.

321
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,130
Could they...

322
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,500
have failed to accomplish
 the mission?

323
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,700
What do you mean fail? 
Our family's fate depends on it!

324
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
How dare you...

325
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,540
Did I fail the mission?

326
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,930
Did I fail?

327
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,940
- How dare you look at me that way!
 - His Excellency. 

328
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
 - It's Song Myun. 
- Yes.

329
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
Hurry inside!

330
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,560
Yes.

331
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,880
Did you find out anything?

332
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,360
I heard they...

333
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
failed the mission.

334
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,600
I also cannot reach 
Consort Kim either.

335
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,700
My goodness...

336
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,000
But the Prince's men 
kidnapped Kang Yi Soo's

337
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
daughter on their way out.

338
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,000
Kidnap? To where?

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,300
By chance...

340
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,200
are they trying to use the woman
 to lure the King outside?

341
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,700
The mission has not failed yet.

342
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,460
Since it's so open,

343
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,530
we'll be able to see the King
 approaching us to die.

344
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,400
You asked me what I'd do if 
the King doesn't come, right?

345
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,020
He will come.

346
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,700
It looks like they loved each other 
much more than I thought.

347
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,870
The letter must've arrived by now.

348
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,310
This is the letter from
 the insurgent army.

349
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Your Majesty! It's Chief Eunuch Hwang.

350
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,500
I will come inside.

351
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,400
 All the guards that were 
following us were killed. 

352
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,870
 Come to the field at the
 entrance of Sogwigol in  

353
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,100
 Mt. Samgak alone tomorrow
 at seven in the morning. 

354
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,500
 If you behave recklessly again, 

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,600
 the hostages will be killed. 

356
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,970
Your Majesty.

357
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,580
How could he ask you to come alone?

358
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,890
What nonsense is that?

359
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,430
You cannot, Your Majesty.

360
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,840
Your Majesty, you must not go there!

361
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,500
 Your Majesty, it's Han Mo. 

362
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
Your Majesty.

363
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,230
His Excellency Hong Ki Ho 
was murdered last night.

364
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,130
What?

365
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,620
Murdered?

366
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,150
By whom?

367
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,830
It was the Prince.

368
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,200
Because of me...

369
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,000
everyone is in mortal danger.

370
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,750
Your Majesty, it is not your fault.

371
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,990
He is right.

372
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,420
You can never think that way.

373
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,740
But why...

374
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,820
Why His Excellency Hong Ki Ho?

375
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,710
Hong Ki Ho...

376
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,100
Hong Ki Ho knew something.

377
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,180
The insurgent army headed to...

378
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,460
their headquarters!

379
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,300
He got rid of him out of 
fear that I might find out.

380
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,170
We need to find out 
where that place is.

381
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Did you give food to 
the hostages too?

382
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,800
Pardon? No.

383
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,000
They are very useful
 for our mission.

384
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
- Feed them.
- Yes.

385
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,320
Have some.

386
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,810
The Prince told me to feed you.

387
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,610
My Lady.

388
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,570
Wal!

389
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,500
Are you awake now?

390
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,400
Are you okay?

391
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,340
It hurts.

392
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,180
But...

393
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,140
Are we...

394
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,780
dying here like this?

395
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,880
You must've noticed
 on the way here,

396
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,530
but just a few men are 
guarding this place.

397
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,380
I'm sure I can come up
 with a solution.

398
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,310
If you go out before me...

399
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,670
No.

400
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,950
How can I leave you behind 
when you're injured?

401
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,540
I will take you along with me.

402
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,140
I won't go alone.

403
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,770
Then...

404
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,320
shall we die here together?

405
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,400
And it won't be just us.

406
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,770
They will use us...

407
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,360
to hurt His Majesty too.

408
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,300
That's why...

409
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,290
you have to leave before me.

410
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,950
Please go to His Majesty

411
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,830
and come back to save me.

412
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
Please?

413
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,100
First of all,

414
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,630
let's cut the ropes with this.

415
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
- Chief Eunuch Hwang.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

416
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,800
Summon the priestess.

417
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,740
Did you say the priestess?

418
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,540
But what for...

419
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,990
I will bring her over.

420
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,640
I got it!

421
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,900
That servant girl will come
 to bring lunch soon.

422
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,300
What should we do now?

423
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,690
I have a plan.

424
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,910
What?

425
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,020
Don't move and do as I say.

426
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,360
Stop right there.

427
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,230
Look at me.

428
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,390
I said, turn around.

429
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,700
 - Over here...
 - What's going on?

430
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,600
Hello!

431
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,510
Hello! The woman passed out!

432
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,790
 The woman passed out! 

433
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,290
 Hey! 

434
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,800
Get her!

435
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,560
- Hurry up and report to him!
- Yes!

436
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,800
The woman disappeared? 
What are you talking about?

437
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,000
She took the clothes of the servant, 
bringing her food and ran away.

438
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
What?

439
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,390
Which direction did she go?

440
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,270
She headed toward Moonsoobong.

441
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,790
Bring a rope and follow me.

442
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,270
She couldn't have gone
 too far in her pace.

443
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,190
We must catch her.

444
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,100
Is it possible

445
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,570
to start having prophetic
 dreams again?

446
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,060
I had a dream whenever 
she was in danger.

447
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,910
The dreams helped me 
to save her many times.

448
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,020
The time is running out.
 Can you do it?

449
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Well, that's...

450
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,070
too dangerous, Your Majesty!

451
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,270
If you bring the dreams back
 after performing an exorcism,

452
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,390
your body will not be able 
to handle the force.

453
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,810
It might cost your life!

454
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,730
That means it is possible.

455
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,720
It is possible to put a spell on you.

456
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,210
Go ahead.

457
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,880
Your Majesty!

458
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,380
It is an order.

459
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,060
Over there!

460
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,940
She's heading toward
 the top of the mountain.

461
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,760
The sun will set soon.

462
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,210
She won't be able to continue 
since the path is dangerous.

463
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,100
Yes.

464
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,750
She'll have to come back 
down when it gets dark.

465
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,080
She'll have to go through 
Yookmojung Hill to come down.

466
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,250
We should wait along that path.

467
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,440
Let's go.

468
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,130
His Majesty never came.

469
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,950
He abandoned you.

470
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,890
Since she's useless now,

471
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,390
take her away and kill her.

472
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,090
And send her head to the King!

473
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,240
No!

474
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,290
Your Majesty, are you all right?

475
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,620
Your Majesty.

476
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,020
Did you have a dream?

477
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,270
That mountaintop.

478
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,790
I have seen it somewhere.
 I am sure I have.

479
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,400
Samgak Mountain.

480
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,860
Samgak Mountain is...

481
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,580
where we did memorial 
service for the late king...

482
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,310
That is where their headquarter is.

483
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,690
Gather the guards right now!

484
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,330
We will invade that place tonight.

485
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,140
I can't continue on this path.

487
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Their headquarter should be there 
under that mountaintop.

488
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,100
We will ambush them 
once it gets darker.

489
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,080
When the advance party 
led by Officer Han invades,

490
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,810
the remaining force will join in 
and capture the traitors alive.

491
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,570
And we must...

492
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,260
rescue the hostages safely.

493
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,300
- Do you understand?
 - Yes, Your Majesty! 

494
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,390
Why is he taking so long?

495
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,720
Did he lose her by chance?

496
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,060
I'm sure the Prince will bring
 her back no matter what.

497
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,040
What is this noise?

498
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,520
I'll go have a look.

499
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,170
Byeol!

500
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,460
Father!

501
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,440
Arrest the traitors!

502
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,350
Where are the hostages?

503
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,380
Do not worry, Sweetheart.

504
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,570
We'll get out of here safely.

505
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,380
No one will be able to stop me!

506
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,160
Do not get in the way!

507
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,950
Step aside.

508
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,980
Young Ji.

509
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,300
Stand close to me.

510
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,410
Move!

511
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,020
Father!

512
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,600
Move.

513
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,940
Move!

514
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,050
Get out of the way.

515
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
Get out of the way!

516
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,020
Shoot him!

517
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,580
Father!

518
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,990
Father!

519
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,430
Father!

520
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,430
Father! Father!

521
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,040
Father...

522
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,510
Tie her up.

523
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes.

524
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,860
Father.

525
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,090
Are you all right?

526
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,170
Where is she?

527
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,010
Where is the Lady right now?

528
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,690
She left...

529
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,030
earlier today.

530
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,060
And the Prince followed her.

531
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,550
Take the traitors away and 
report to His Majesty.

532
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,570
Yes.

533
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,000
- And bring him to the physician.
- Yes.

534
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
The rest of you should follow me.

535
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
Yes.

536
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
Do you think they are our soldiers?

537
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
Over there!

538
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,190
My Lady.

539
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,400
The headquarter was already cleared 
out, and everyone was arrested.

540
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,900
The culprit should surrender
 and receive the rope.

541
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,500
Surrender?

542
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,300
That will never happen. Attack!

543
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,940
Run away, sir!

544
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,170
Chase after the Prince.

545
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,860
- Right now!
 - Yes! 

546
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,890
You lost him?

547
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,970
My apologies.

548
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,010
The guards are searching 
for him in the mountain.

549
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,780
Did you get injured?

550
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,960
I am all right.

551
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,310
The Prince also got injured.

552
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,050
He couldn't have gone far.

553
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,370
How much time do we have
 left until seven o'clock?

554
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,730
We have about two hours left.

555
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,940
No one should follow me.

556
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,250
I will go to the field alone.

557
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,060
Your Majesty, you cannot do that.

558
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,110
Do you want to face
 the Prince alone?

559
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,340
I want you to wait here for 
about 15 minutes and join me.

560
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,490
When you get there,

561
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,850
if he were alive instead of me,

562
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,480
you must kill him.

563
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,020
I asked...

564
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,400
the King to come here.

565
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,700
Please stop this now.

566
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,000
Didn't you hear that 
everything is already over?

567
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,100
If the King doesn't come, I'll kill you.

568
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Tell me.

569
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,300
Do you think...

570
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,230
the King will come 
alone to rescue you?

571
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,580
I just hope he doesn't.

572
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,070
It's already too late.

573
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,220
I am here!

574
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,380
So let go of that woman!

575
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,300
Did you indeed come here alone?

576
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,490
This will be your grave!

577
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,680
Your Majesty!

578
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,770
Put your sword down.

579
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,260
You could not fight much
 longer in your condition.

580
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,800
I can easily kill you even 
with my injured arm.

581
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,320
Your Majesty!

582
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,410
Did you say you will kill me

583
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,280
and become the king 
to start a new world?

584
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,280
No.

585
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,960
You did not wish for a new world.

586
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,550
You just needed to justify 
your desire to become king.

587
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,490
You desired the throne, 
which was denied to you.

588
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,970
Now humbly accept your punishment.

589
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,000
Your Majesty.

590
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,990
Are you all right?

591
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,030
I am all right.

592
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,740
Are you all right yourself?

593
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,590
 I ended up being the one 

594
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,180
 to die in front of you, My Lady. 

595
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,680
 It was going to end
 this way after all. 

596
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,300
For assassination attempt of His Majesty,
 murdering the Queen, and causing a coup.

597
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,040
For committing such high 
treason, Jo Heung Gyeon

598
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,100
shall drink the poisonous tonic!

599
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,340
Open the door.

600
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,280
Yes!

601
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,850
I was told to release Jo, 
the deposed.

602
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,240
Come out.

603
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,790
How about my father?

604
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,190
What happened to my father?

605
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,050
The criminal was given 
the poisonous tonic.

606
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,800
His Excellency!

607
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,370
But...

608
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,060
I was given mercy?

609
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,400
They should've killed me instead!

610
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,400
It's a long way to Onyang
 from here, Your Highness.

611
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,230
Please get in the litter.

612
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,980
I cannot leave.

613
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,600
I can never leave! I would
 rather die in the palace!

614
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,310
His Majesty ordered 
Consort Kim's expulsion.

615
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,710
What are you doing?

616
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,860
Remove her clothes and

617
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,680
drag her out of the palace.

618
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,930
 Yes. 

619
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,850
Let go of me!

620
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,380
Let go of me!

621
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,330
You think you'd remain 
unharmed for this?

622
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,490
Let go of me!

623
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,250
How dare you do this to me?

624
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,460
I'm Kim Song Yi!

625
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,130
I'm Kim Song Yi!

626
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,890
Get out of the way!

627
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,700
Are you crying right now?

628
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,200
How could this happen to
 the mighty Kim family?

629
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,440
And I'm not just being exiled.

630
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,820
I have to join the army! The army!

631
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,560
Shut your mouth!

632
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,400
At least, we did not get executed
 for the coup like Jo Heung Gyeon.

633
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,390
As long as this 
Kim Man Chan is alive,

634
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,260
there will be another chance!

635
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,550
Yes.

636
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,200
It is finally over.

637
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,670
Finally.

638
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,200
The Kim family was
 locked up in exile in Jeju.

639
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:05,560
What happened to 
Kang Yi Soo's daughter?

640
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,030
I heard she is leaving 
the palace today.

641
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,700
Go to the house I prepared for you.

642
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,230
We will meet again soon.

643
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

644
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,100
Your Majesty, what is wrong?

645
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,370
Your Majesty!

646
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,850
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

647
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,570
- Your Majesty!
- Get the physician!

648
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,850
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

649
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,860
Your Majesty!

650
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,800
Your Majesty.

651
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,750
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

652
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,160
Your Majesty!

653
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,440
What do you mean?

654
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,700
He had another prophetic dream?

655
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,440
His Majesty ordered
 the priestess to

656
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,030
put a spell on him to save you.

657
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,270
I guess he's being punished for

658
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,570
changing the future.

659
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,110
Help me.

660
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,400
If that happened to him because of me, 
there must be something I can do.

661
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,100
I don't care what happens to me 
as long as he can wake up.

662
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,750
I will do anything.

663
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,630
There is nothing...

664
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,770
you can do.

665
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,190
You just...

666
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,220
have to be far away
 from His Majesty.

667
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,140
I also thought you two
 were meant to be.

668
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,380
But...

669
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,080
one of you will be in 
danger if you're together.

670
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,590
So you must leave.

671
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,760
This is the message from
 the sun, moon, and stars.

672
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,070
That's the only way to 
save His Majesty.

673
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,020
 Your Majesty. 

674
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,190
 You must wake up. 

675
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,970
 Please... 

676
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,580
I...

677
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,700
am saying goodbye to you

678
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,310
for one last time.

679
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,890
Your Majesty!

680
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,100
Your Majesty!

681
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,090
Are you all right?

682
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,700
Where is Eun Bo?

683
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,000
Where is Eun Bo right now?

684
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,600
Could you stop giving 
me the medicine?

685
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,620
I have been drinking this for a year.

686
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,150
That cannot be.

687
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,780
How is he doing?

688
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,770
Comparing to last year,

689
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,870
he became significantly stable.

690
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,380
I think you can stop
 taking medicine.

691
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,330
See?

692
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,440
Are you sure?

693
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,000
Take a closer look.

694
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
Are you nagging the
 physician now?

695
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,300
That is enough. 
You may leave now.

696
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,050
Your Majesty.

697
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,370
It is because I am worried.

698
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,270
Are you not having
 prophetic dreams anymore?

699
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,760
I told you I am not, did I not?

700
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,580
How about Eun Bo's whereabouts?

701
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
Did you not find out yet?

702
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,170
No, Your Majesty.

703
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,640
Should I send a message to 
the owner of the Buyong Agency?

704
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,830
Well...

705
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,830
I am here to commission a case.

706
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:26,090
Is this the informant agency that

707
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,550
the King frequents?

708
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,610
Aigoo!

709
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,770
You came.

710
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,860
Yes, this is Buyong Agency.

711
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,870
I arrested all the bad guys from

712
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,870
the Kim family and 
Jo family a year ago.

713
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,600
Aigoo, you're still standing there.

714
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,700
Please come inside.

715
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,400
Yes, yes. Come inside.

716
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,960
Have a seat here.

717
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,200
Aigoo, just leave it.

718
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,540
I can do it myself.

719
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,220
This is for Father's 
memorial service.

720
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,890
I should do it myself.

721
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,390
I didn't think...

722
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,750
I'd be alive a year ago.

723
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,800
Your Highness.

724
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,440
Please stop calling me that anymore.

725
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,750
I want to forget about everything.

726
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,000
Excuse me.

727
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,200
Deliver this to the new right state 
minister, Kim Byung Tak.

728
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,700
He will reward you handsomely 
for running the errand.

729
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,890
Are you sure about that?

730
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,970
Hey, Kim family is 
famous for a reason.

731
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,830
The right state minister will 
help me to get reinstated.

732
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,300
If that happens, I will not 
forget to reward you

733
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,380
for helping me out.

734
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,190
How are the new guards trained by

735
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,710
the public offices doing?

736
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,810
Since the guards took charge
 of security in Hanyang,

737
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,720
the robbers quieted down

738
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,690
and people are feeling safer.

739
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,400
That is a relief.

740
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,510
Award the guards accordingly.

741
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

742
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,870
However...

743
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,850
you should take care of the situation

744
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:21,890
inside the palace as well, 
not just outside the palace.

745
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,210
Planning for the future of 
the royals by bearing an heir

746
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,690
will also be a good way to
 care for the people.

747
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,060
I think it is a good idea
 to accept a new queen.

748
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,490
Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.

749
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:39,450
 Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty. 

750
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,140
I heard the ministers requested you to

751
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,280
accept a new queen?

752
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,470
They make a good point.

753
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:54,700
Producing an heir is also 
your duty as the king.

754
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,060
You are in good health now.

755
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,790
Perhaps it's time 
for another selection.

756
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,980
I will not get married

757
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,420
until I find her.

758
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,160
She left on her own.

759
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,760
It has been a year.

760
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,450
You still have not forgotten her?

761
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,180
I will not forget her 
even after ten years.

762
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,370
She is unforgettable.

763
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,350
I think she's hiding 
somewhere really good.

764
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,800
Even I, the owner of the 
Buyong Agency, can't find her.

765
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:55,770
It seems like she doesn't 
even come near the market.

766
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,740
We must find her.

767
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,320
I don't care how long it takes.

768
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,180
Please find her.

769
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,670
Yes.

770
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,930
There...

771
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,660
Did you go to the
 temple again today?

772
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,980
Yes.

773
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,350
I think your prayer worked

774
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,830
since you prayed so fervently.

775
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,440
I heard His Majesty is
 in good health now.

776
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,990
Yes.

777
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,550
That is such a relief.

778
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,930
You had a baby too.

779
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,890
Perhaps you should see him now.

780
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,370
Don't you want to see him?

781
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,400
Mother, are you all right?

782
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,740
I think you started coughing 
again since it got cold.

783
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,900
This is not good. We ran 
out of the medicine, right?

784
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,840
I will visit the physician tomorrow.

785
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,200
I don't know what to tell you.

786
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,710
That ingredient will 
arrive early in the morning.

787
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,520
Come back tomorrow.

788
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,290
I'll come back tomorrow then.

789
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,420
By chance...

790
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,900
aren't you that woman 
who used to work with Wal?

791
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,670
You are.

792
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,190
You used to come to the watering
 hole in the shaman's clothes.

793
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,900
You're mistaken.

794
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,230
I'm pretty sure that's her.

795
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,080
Cheers!

796
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,210
What's the point of being the king?

797
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,750
He looked so sad because

798
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,000
a woman disappeared.

799
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,890
What are you talking about?

800
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,190
I'm just saying life is pointless.

801
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,920
What else?

802
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,420
So anyway...

803
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,400
Have you heard any 
useful information lately?

804
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,220
As if I owe you one.

805
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,400
Geez...

806
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,460
Right.

807
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,880
Earlier today, I saw the woman
 you've been looking for on the street.

808
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,310
You know, your old business partner.

809
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,660
What?

810
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,460
Hey.

811
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,530
Why are you telling me this now?

812
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,900
Physician!

813
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,790
Sir!

814
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,580
Aigoo.

815
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,940
Hello.

816
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,370
Who are you?

817
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:11,330
I'm urgently looking for someone.

818
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,820
So?

819
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,250
This is the physician's quarter, 
not for missing persons.

820
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,390
Yes, I am aware, but...

821
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,250
Let me tell you what she looks like.

822
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,770
Her eyes are this round, 
and her nose is this pointy.

823
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,990
Her face is the size of a fist.

824
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,550
Anyway,

825
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,680
didn't a young woman come here?

826
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,100
- I heard she was here earlier today.
- Right.

827
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,570
You mean the woman 
who was looking for lily turf?

828
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,390
She said she'd come back 
tomorrow since I didn't have it.

829
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,980
Tomorrow?

830
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,380
Around what time?

831
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,940
Here you go.

832
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,590
I'll be back again.

833
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,800
Wal!

834
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,190
Who are you?

835
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,960
Do you know me?

836
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,900
How could you be like this?

837
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,030
Think about all the time
 we spent together.

838
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,400
How could you leave 
without saying a word?

839
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,600
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry?"

840
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,640
His Majesty is looking for you.

841
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,310
Don't tell him.

842
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,870
I beg you.

843
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,970
Why should I listen to you?

844
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,020
It's because I can't be by his side.

845
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,800
Please pretend that 
you didn't see me.

846
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:41,390
Hey!

847
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,380
There will be another 
selection soon!

848
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,050
Are you okay with that?

849
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,540
That little...

850
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,890
Just walk away!

851
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,270
You're as stubborn as ever!

852
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,100
Just be gone!

853
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,380
Geez.

854
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,530
You came.

855
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,160
What happened, Eun Bo?

856
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,600
- She is found?
- Yes.

857
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,200
Wal told me.

858
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,130
I heard she is in Bangyitgol.

859
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,000
Your Majesty!

860
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,810
Please come back with her!

861
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,560
Promise!

862
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,640
Are you going to the
 temple again today?

863
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,400
Yes. I'll be right back.

864
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:48,260
Your Majesty, how did
 you find this place...

865
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,380
Please let me go.

866
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,530
I will never let you go again.

867
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,480
Please don't do this.

868
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,460
Something dangerous will 
happen if I'm by your side.

869
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,310
I do not care.

870
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,460
Because I cannot

871
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,050
live without you any longer.

872
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,390
Let us stay together.

873
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,410
Let us overcome this together.

874
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,100
Whether it is painful or joyful.

875
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,140
Let us be together...

876
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,500
I missed you.

877
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,200
Eun Bo.

878
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,670
Your Majesty.

879
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:07,360
It's a boy.

880
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,200
He is our son.

881
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,660
What is the boy's name?

882
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,930
He doesn't have a name yet.

883
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:52,150
Why do we not name him Dam,

884
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:54,130
which means beautiful?

885
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,330
Dam.

886
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,300
Lee Dam.

887
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,490
It is pretty.

888
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,930
Let us tell him when Dam grows up.

889
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:07,470
That we named him
 Dam because the day

890
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:10,700
we spent together was so beautiful.

891
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

892
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,500
