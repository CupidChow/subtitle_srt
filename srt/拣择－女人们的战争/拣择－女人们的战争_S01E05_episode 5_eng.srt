1
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,110
 

2
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,960
This is His Excellency, Hong Ki Ho, 
who will lend you his family name.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,340
From now on, your name is Yeon.

4
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,200
Hong Yeon.

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,190
 This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho, 
the governor of Gyeonggi. 

6
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,440
Eun Ki!

7
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,820
The queen is alive?

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,010
The Queen Dowager 
wants to see you.

9
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,120
 Remember. 

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,430
 You're your sister Eun Ki
 in front of her. 

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,730
 It was the queen. 
Didn't you see her? 

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,450
 It was definitely the queen! 

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,530
You said you wanted to 
participate in the selection?

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,900
What's your motive?

15
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,770
I want to find the man 
who pointed a gun at me

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,740
and destroyed everything.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,310
Congratulations!

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,570
You're living the good life now.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,250
Because of your grandfather
 who was a traitor,

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,680
 I heard you had to live in hiding. 

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,090
 How could you stand there 
and just listen to that? 

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,590
You have to silence people like 
that even by tripping them.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,320
He was right about everything.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,710
To this day, I'm still hiding.

25
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,220
 Everyone hides. 

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,400
 Behind their name, family, 
and tall fences. 

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,300
 Thanks to you, I made
 up my mind as well. 

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,490
 Kang Yi Soo's daughter is entering 
the first round of the selection. 

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,240
We'll have to make sure
 she's on our side

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
before sending her to the king.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
 How could she be 
still alive and be here? 

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,670
Find out if there's a daughter of

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,600
Hong Ki Ho, the governor of 
Gyeonggi among the candidates.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,120
The daughter of the governor 
of Gyeonggi is indeed among them.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,710
 Here comes His Majesty! 

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll join you too, 
Great Royal Dowager Queen.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,380
Continue.

38
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,990
 
This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho, 
the governor of Gyeonggi.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,070
Eun Ki...

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,500
What in the world...

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,040
Eun Ki...

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,690
Please let me go.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,670
King.

44
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,450
You are alive?

45
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,140
Let go of her, King.

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,900
Please consider what 
other people think.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
That will be the end 
of the presentation.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,530
Everyone, leave.

49
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,350
What are you doing, 
Court Lady Jung?

50
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,470
Escort the young ladies
 to the waiting room!

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,740
Yes.

52
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,500
Please follow me.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,130
King.

54
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,330
Your Majesty.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,790
What happened?

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,510
Since when...

57
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,660
Are you feeling okay?

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,120
Are you hurt in any way?

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,070
Please stop for a second, King.

60
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,740
Explain yourself.

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,370
Are you truly Eun Ki?

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm not sure what you mean.

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,400
What trouble will you 
cause this time?

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
- Mother.
- Queen.

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Why are you here?

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,330
You should be dead and
 buried underground.

67
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,180
How could you be alive?

68
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,930
What are you doing?

69
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,210
What are you all doing?

70
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,060
Bring Queen Mother to 
her chamber right now!

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
Are you a ghost or a monster?

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,510
Please stop, Mother!

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,840
Will you...

74
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Will you endanger 
the king's life again?

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,570
Mother!

76
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,710
- Mother!
- Your Highness!

77
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,820
- Queen!
- Mother!

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,860
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,970
- Your Highness!
- Mother.

80
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,880
- Mother!
- Your Highness!

81
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,050
Mother!

82
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,030
How is she?

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,010
She became weak momentarily 
due to a huge shock.

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,260
She'll be able to wake up soon.

85
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,200
That's a relief, King.

86
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Did you know by chance?

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,100
You saw the queen showing up
 to the selection today.

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm asking whether you
 intended her to be there.

89
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,960
How could that be?

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,790
I was surprised as well.

91
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,320
Also, she said that 
she's not the queen.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,990
It was the queen.

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,190
If that young lady were
 really the queen,

94
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,690
why do you think she 
didn't reach you first?

95
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,700
 Eun Ki. 

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,680
Does she know His Majesty?

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,160
I know, right?

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,430
What's going on anyway?

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,950
Didn't His Majesty...

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,990
embrace her?

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,810
- So strange. 
- Eun Ki?

102
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,660
Who's Eun Ki?

103
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,110
Queen Dowager wants you 
to leave the palace.

104
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,950
The selection process 
will resume tomorrow.

105
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,290
Don't we deserve to know 
what's going on, at least?

106
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,960
The King ordered to keep silent 
about what happened today.

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,530
I'll get the litters ready.

108
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,310
You may leave the palace now.

109
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,460
Excuse me.

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,430
His Majesty wants to see you.

111
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,470
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,590
Forget everything Mother said.

113
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,730
Please look at me.

114
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,770
It's just you and me now.

115
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,500
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,710
Before coming to the palace, 
I was told not to step on the

117
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,980
shadow of the king and not look
 at the king's face directly.

118
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,060
But I behaved rudely since 
I was caught off guard earlier.

119
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,400
- Queen.
- What do you mean, "Queen?"

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,160
How could you say something
 so unimaginable?

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,070
I'm just a woman who's 
participating in the selection.

122
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,130
Why are you doing this, Eun Ki?

123
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,630
My apologies, but I'm Yeon 
from the Hong family.

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,720
Raise your head.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
It's an order.

126
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,930
Do not step away.

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,660
It's an order.

128
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,720
There's no way I'm
 mistaken about you.

129
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,380
But I'm not the woman you
 think I am, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,790
That's a lie.

131
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,550
It's the truth.

132
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,560
Are you punishing me?

133
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,900
Are you punishing me like this

134
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,540
because I couldn't protect you?

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,980
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,550
Please do not put me in a 
difficult position anymore.

137
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,000
I beg you.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,070
Please let me go.

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Please help me.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,430
Try to make it to the last stage 
of the selection on your own.

141
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,380
I'll decide whether
 I'll help you or not then.

142
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,120
And...

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,970
even if you run into the King,

144
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,460
do not try to reveal your identity.

145
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,160
If you indeed came back to life,

146
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,230
do you think he'd let you 
remain as a candidate?

147
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,780
Your plan to catch the 
culprit yourself

148
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,110
- would go to waste.
- Yes, ma'am.

149
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll follow your order.

150
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,560
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Your Majesty!

152
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,090
Your Majesty!

153
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,740
You can't step out of 
the palace like this.

154
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,420
You know that, Your Majesty.

155
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,730
Han Mo.

156
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,860
Protect that girl.

158
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,460
So she won't be put into
 danger or disappear.

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,290
Tighten the security
 at the Hwigyeongjae.

160
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,830
Yes.

161
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,080
By the way, Your Highness...

162
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,220
Why are you telling His Majesty 
that she's Hong Yeon?

163
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,800
King would probably try to get
 her reinstated immediately.

164
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,980
The queen's family is 
a family of a traitor.

165
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,960
We haven't even caught the culprit.

166
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,690
I can't let the palace to be
 in disturbance again.

167
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,860
I ran into the King 
during the selection.

168
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,330
You mean the King was there?

169
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,110
And did you deal with it well?

170
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,300
I said I'm Hong Yeon according 
to the Queen Dowager's order.

171
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,830
But he didn't seem to believe me.

172
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,180
You did well.

173
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,920
You can't win this battle without 
the Queen Dowager's help.

174
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,200
You need to follow her orders
 and turn her into your ally.

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,420
Yes.

176
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,160
So are you firm in your resolve?

177
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,860
I read the Theory of Enlightenment.

178
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,010
If that's the path Father chose,

179
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,800
I'll follow his footsteps.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
However...

181
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,880
I need to find the culprit
 who killed my sister first.

182
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,700
The revenge on the 
King comes afterward.

183
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,710
You mean she's really 
the deceased queen?

184
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,300
I even passed out. 
Isn't that enough to tell?

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,210
We need to come up with a solution.

186
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,810
She connivingly faked her identity 
and entered the selection.

187
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,800
She will seduce the King again.

188
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,320
I confirmed with the coroner.

189
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,160
He saw a cold corpse 
without a doubt.

190
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,940
The soldiers who dumped the 
Queen's body outside the palace

191
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,520
testified the same way.

192
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Seriously...

193
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
This must be the end of the world.

194
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,240
How could the dead 
keep coming back to life?

195
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,880
What if Kang Yi Soo 
comes back to life too?

196
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,040
Hey!

197
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,150
Don't say stuff like that
 in this situation.

198
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,810
You're scaring me.

199
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,680
Nothing serious would happen yet.

200
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,370
You should look into it further 
and deal with it afterward.

201
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm worried about the
 Queen Mother's nagging.

202
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
She is so scared out of her wits.

203
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,560
It Iooks like you have not

204
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,900
heard the news yet, Left State Minister.

205
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,520
Father.

206
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,410
There's a woman who 
has the Queen's face!

207
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,110
His Majesty saw her too.

208
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,960
Is that why you're 
trembling so much?

209
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,570
If so,

210
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,280
would you like to go back 
home with me then?

211
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
Do you want to move 
back to the annex

212
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,600
and hide your love for him 
for the rest of your life?

213
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,960
No, I don't want to.

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,950
If so...

215
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,420
stop trembling, Sweetheart.

216
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,350
If the Queen really came back to life,

217
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,630
I'll find the evidence and 
get her out of your sight.

218
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,690
She is the daughter of a traitor.

219
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,170
Not only would she get 
disqualified from the selection,

220
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,170
but she'd be killed on the spot.

221
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,020
I'll look into the 
Hong family thoroughly.

222
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,870
You have to be strong.

223
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,100
You just need to do as I say.

224
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,860
During the early selection,

225
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,350
just smile innocently no matter 
whom you're competing with.

226
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,840
So that no one would 
think of you as a threat.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,700
That's what you have to do.

228
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
Do you understand?

229
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,780
Go inside.

230
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,180
Father.

231
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,860
That's the woman.

232
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,730
Let's go.

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,900
She has the dead queen's face?

234
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,250
I've only heard about 
how huge the palace is.

235
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,720
If I didn't have beef jerky,

236
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,780
I would've fainted while walking.

237
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,440
There's no way I could live here.

238
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,610
I was a bit tempted 
when I saw him today.

239
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Didn't you see his face today? 
He's totally handsome.

240
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
He's my type.

241
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,850
We got to see his handsome
 face, thanks to you.

242
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,000
Should I thank you for that?

243
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,500
By the way,

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,840
who is Eun Ki anyway?

245
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,330
Am I the only one who's curious?

246
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh, yes!

247
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,880
Come to think of it, 
I've heard that name before.

248
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,350
She is the tragic queen 
who died unexpectedly.

249
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,520
Am I wrong?

250
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,740
Thank you for telling me.

251
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,830
I was curious about that too.

252
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,230
But this is such a pity.

253
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,480
You went against the 
King's order of silence.

254
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,830
I think you'd receive a penalty.

255
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,630
Lady Kim.

256
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,630
You're receiving a penalty.

257
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,220
 She's the daughter of a traitor. 

258
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,040
 Not only would she get 
disqualified from the selection, 

259
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,990
 but she'd be killed on the spot. 

260
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,430
Why do you keep looking?

261
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
 During the early selection, 

262
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,900
 just smile innocently no matter 
who you're competing with. 

263
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,470
Well, it's nothing.

264
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,230
Your Majesty.

265
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,060
It's getting late.

266
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,100
You should go to bed now.

267
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,230
How strange.

268
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,670
What I dreamt about 
happened in reality.

269
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,020
That can happen sometimes.

270
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,350
Do not worry about it so much.

271
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,900
 Your Majesty, it's Han Mo. 

272
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,330
Come in.

273
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,380
The soldiers are guarding
 the guest house securely.

274
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,660
- How about her?
- She's safe.

275
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,650
Your Majesty.

276
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,580
What are you worried
 about so much?

277
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,960
I cannot possibly forget that face.

278
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,630
As is her voice.

279
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,840
But her eyes...

280
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,270
Her eyes felt somewhat different.

281
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,780
Your Highness.

282
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,540
She endangered my son's life. 
Your grandson's life.

283
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,770
She's an evil and wicked thing.

284
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,100
She deserves to be driven out!

285
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,650
Yes, Sister.

286
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,190
I mean, Your Highness.

287
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,120
I agree with her too.

288
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,080
If she is indeed the queen 
who came back to life,

289
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
she's the daughter of the traitor!

290
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,630
That must be the 
Left State Minister's opinion, not yours.

291
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,250
Stop fussing over it.

292
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,130
She's not the dead queen.

293
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,320
Even if that were true,

294
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,430
I have a bad feeling about it.

295
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,100
It's a bad sign!

296
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,820
The first round of selection 
already started.

297
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,820
We cannot damage our dignity 
as the royals anymore.

298
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,230
But Your Highness...

299
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,360
If she is bad luck 
as the Queen said,

300
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
she'd get eliminated 
during the first round.

301
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,320
This selection will...

302
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,970
be unique in its methods.

303
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,270
This selection will...

304
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,490
be consisted of Gwansang, 
Shimsang, Haengsang.

305
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,490
There will be three parts in total.

306
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,550
Gwansang is about the face, 
Shimsang is about the heart,

307
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,220
and Haengsang is about the attitude.

308
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,610
That would be the criteria.

309
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,370
Before we examine your faces,

310
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,860
we will check if you're 
wearing any makeup.

311
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,720
If you broke the rule

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,470
and wore rouge on your lips,

313
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,900
- you will receive a penalty.
 - Your Majesty.

314
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,370
Pull yourself together, King.

315
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,140
Do not be confused.

316
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,670
Pulling myself together 
will not put an end to this.

317
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,600
Whether she's the queen or not...

318
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,590
everyone will manipulate her 
in front of me from now on.

319
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,670
That would include 
you too, Grandmother.

320
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,580
Do not try to take advantage
 of her, no matter what.

321
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,530
I will be keeping my eye on you.

322
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,820
And...

323
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,790
if that woman turns out 
to be the queen,

324
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,720
I will protect her no 
matter what it takes...

325
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,430
this time.

326
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,260
What is it about?

327
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,640
It's nothing important.
 I'll get going.

328
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,900
- So that man woke up?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,990
Your Majesty, I'll send a notorious 
torturer along, so he confesses.

330
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,200
- I'll visit him myself.
- Pardon?

331
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
You want to do this yourself?

332
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,980
Yes.

333
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,300
Get ready.

334
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,530
Right now?

335
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,590
Never mind.

336
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,690
It would be better if you 
went after the sunset.

337
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll say that I'm leaving to 
inspect public offices.

338
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,090
- Han Mo, only you come with me.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,170
I will put you on an important duty.

340
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,110
Don't be so pouty.

341
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,920
Did you say "an important duty?"

342
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,390
Keep an eye on that woman.

343
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

344
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,420
Your Majesty, by the way, 
the thing is...

345
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,010
Am I spying on her or guarding her?

346
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,420
- It's both.
- Both?

347
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,160
How did it go?

349
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,670
I don't know what that 
old woman is plotting.

350
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,320
I managed to make 
myself a judge, at least.

351
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,540
I planted one of my court ladies
 as a judge as well.

352
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,020
Well done!

353
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,820
What should I do then?

354
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,040
Things would get too loud 
if you get involved.

355
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,410
Song Yi and I will take care of this.

356
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,420
So just step aside.

357
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,360
Pass.

358
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,200
Pass.

359
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,680
A penalty for Lady Hong.

360
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,280
Hold on a second.

361
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm not wearing rouge.

362
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
It definitely smudged.

363
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,450
Please check one more time.

364
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,040
Please check again.

365
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,910
What's going on?

366
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,650
I double-checked, but...

367
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,940
Lady Hong will receive
 an extra penalty.

368
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,830
One's attitude toward the 
process and the result

369
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,690
is also a part of the evaluation.

370
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,840
Hurry up with the rest.

371
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
I'll do it.

372
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,970
Pass.

373
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,400
A lot of you didn't pass
 the makeup test.

374
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,520
Please remove 
everything on your face.

375
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,150
What's wrong?

376
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,310
I have smelled wolfsbane before.

377
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,490
Wolfsbane?

378
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,800
It's poisonous.

379
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,700
It itches your skin 
and turns it red too.

380
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,450
Lady Hong!

381
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,340
Could you lend me your 
towel if you're done?

382
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,130
The one I already used?

383
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,000
But your hands are...

384
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It'd be disadvantageous for
 me if I make a fuss now.

385
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,260
Do you recognize me?

386
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,240
He has not fully recovered yet.

387
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,870
He cannot talk normally.

388
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,560
Your Majesty.

389
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,880
Many people died because of you.

390
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,500
They were guarding me
 and were at your gunpoint.

391
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,390
They were my men.

392
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Everyone who died that day

393
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
were my men whom I cared about.

394
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,720
The only way for me 
to send them off

395
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,310
is to punish the one 
who's behind you.

396
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,880
So you'd better open your mouth!

397
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,800
Tell me whom you're
 working for.

398
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,710
And you'll have to...

399
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,490
You'll have to be punished for 
your crime no matter what.

400
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,760
Your Majesty.

401
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,740
Have you noticed 
anyone looking for him?

402
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,770
No, not yet.

403
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,700
Move to a different shelter at night

404
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,360
and find out who he is first.

405
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

406
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
See you later.

407
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,510
Look who's back.

408
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,450
Any news about the owner 
of the Buyong Agency yet?

409
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,110
We don't know either.

410
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,360
Whether they're dead or alive.

411
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,050
By the way...

412
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,370
Who are you? Why do you
 keep looking for them?

413
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,730
I'll be back.

414
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,090
Let me know if you 
hear about them.

415
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,180
I already talked to the 
face reader about this.

416
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,160
Give it to her when you get a chance.

417
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes, Your Highness.

418
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,370
 

419
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,150
We'll start the face reading
 evaluation now.

420
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,670
Since all three parts of
 your face are weak,

421
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,570
your spirit is weak and timid.

422
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,090
This type of face isn't 
the face of a queen.

423
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,360
You're destined to acquire
 what's not yours.

424
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,990
What does that mean?

425
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,010
Please refrain from 
asking questions.

426
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,890
He's not a shaman.

427
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,040
Your forehead is prominent,
 and eyelashes are long.

428
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,290
Your father will determine
 your destiny.

429
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,050
Your stance resembles a mountain,

430
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,580
but you lack yang energy, 
which is essential to a queen.

431
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,260
Your lips are unusually red

432
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,920
and your lick them often.

433
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,540
I can sense that your 
desires have been repressed.

434
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,880
You have an exceptional face.

435
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,350
You look just like a phoenix.

436
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,650
Your pupils are strong

437
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,490
and your eyebrows are smooth.

438
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,600
Your ears resemble fans

439
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,760
and your lips are plump.

440
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,930
You definitely have
 the face of a queen.

441
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,260
- The king saw her face?
- Yes.

442
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,940
Apparently, nothing happened
 thanks to the Queen Dowager.

443
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,760
The Queen Dowager's plotting
 against her grandson

444
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,540
turns out to be beneficial to us.

445
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,960
Tell her to be careful, so they 
don't find out who she is.

446
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,730
Yes, sir.

447
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,000
She finally decided to be on our side.

448
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,420
Is that so?

449
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,210
I'm curious...

450
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,450
to see what kind of woman she is.

451
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,530
Well...

452
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,310
here's another one who 
has a queen's face...

453
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,600
What are you talking about?

454
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,020
Which one has a 
queen's face anyway?

455
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,910
The thing is...

456
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,830
The thing is...

457
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,840
This young lady has 
a queen's face.

458
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,290
How impressive.

459
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,210
You have a queen's face.

460
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,620
That means you made the first place
 in the Gwansang test.

461
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,730
- Don't you think?
- You're right.

462
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,140
Congratulations.

463
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,820
You're so loud!

464
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,130
Be quiet.

465
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,000
Are you the only people 
around here?

466
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm sorry.

467
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,200
You didn't like how loud we were.

468
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,520
By the way, are you frustrated
 about things in general?

469
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,410
Is that why you're 
frustrated and repressed?

470
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,590
That is a barracks that 
serves the Kim family.

471
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,870
If it's a barracks,

472
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,830
there must be a ledger
 of the hunters.

473
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,530
Find out his name and address.

474
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,910
And find everything 
that can be evidence.

475
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,350
Aigoo, sir. You came.

477
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,060
You act like this is your house.

478
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,050
Welcome.

479
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,730
It's all thanks to your generosity, sir.

480
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,410
It's making me tear up...

481
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,210
- I saw you stretching.
- Did you?

482
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,800
You should've said so then.

483
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Something smells smoky.

484
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,540
- Do I smell gunpowder?
- Hey!

485
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,030
You're usually a happy man.

486
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,120
But you look kind of upset today.

487
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Did something happen 
while you were out?

488
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,960
Did someone trip you or...

489
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,620
slap you or something...

490
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,810
The rent.

491
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,670
- Give it to me now.
- Pardon?

492
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,410
Where can I see her?

493
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,520
Lady Hong Yeon.

494
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,380
Who?

495
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,180
Right!

496
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,790
So she's over yonder...

497
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,400
- What are you doing?
- Across the river...

498
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,310
- Let's go right now.
- Hold on!

499
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,450
My stomach. My stomach
 hurts all of a sudden.

500
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,070
I had a seaweed salad for lunch...

501
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,000
I think it came out a bit...

502
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,260
I'm sorry, but I need to
 use the outhouse...

503
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,100
I know I'm crafty,

504
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,280
but how can I get someone 
who's in the palace?

505
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,160
I'll run away for now!

506
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,420
 Everyone hides. 

507
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,150
 Behind their name, family, 
and tall fences. 

508
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,340
 They hide themselves. 

509
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,300
How could you be...

510
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,970
as secretive as I am?

511
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,250
My goodness!

512
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,360
It's Wal!

513
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,970
- Do you know how much I missed you?
- Look who's here!

514
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,480
Everyone says the owner 
of the Buyong Agency disappeared.

515
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,650
But you were alive and well!

516
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,240
Someone came here
 looking for you.

517
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Me?

518
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,910
Go away somewhere.

519
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,740
- You only like Cheo Yong.
- Go away!

520
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,970
Who was looking for me?

521
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,310
What do you mean? 
It was your client.

522
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,530
I find clients for you all the time.

523
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm not sure, but I think he 
could be a pretty big client.

524
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,220
A client? I thought it was...

525
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,130
You said, "big?"

526
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,790
How big?

527
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,180
The thing is...

528
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,450
No, no, no! No. It's okay.

529
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,880
Buyong Agency is 
closed for a while.

530
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,950
Anyway,

531
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,680
do Kim's men frequent this
 watering hole these days too?

532
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,490
You said you're closed.

533
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,040
What information
 do you need now?

534
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,560
Here comes another one.

535
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,010
He's Kim's man.

536
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,260
Hey, Cheo Yong.

537
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,150
Why don't you go find 
out whether there's

538
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,130
something going on at 
Kim's house and the barracks.

539
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,240
- Right now?
- Right now, right now.

540
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,010
But we didn't get to catch up.

541
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,290
Let's catch up after you're back.

542
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,630
Go right now.

543
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,650
- Hurry up.
- What's wrong with you?

544
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,900
Are you the same 
playboy I used to know?

545
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,070
You used to drool whenever
 you see a woman's skirt...

546
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,500
That's why my name is Wal.

547
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,460
How could you say 
something so vulgar?

548
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,720
- Leave right now!
- That's why...

549
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,810
When did I drool?

550
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,890
- Let's go, Wal!
- Seriously...

551
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,700
Why did you want to
 see me privately?

552
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,620
What will you do with 
that dragon's scale?

553
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,690
The dragon's scale?

554
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,810
The scale that grows the opposite 
direction on the dragon's neck.

555
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,700
I'm talking about the woman, 
the King's Achilles' heel.

556
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,140
Well, I'm not sure.

557
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,680
Why are you asking me about that?

558
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,200
When you took the book 
I handed to you,

559
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,540
we've been on the
 same boat ever since.

560
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,070
At least, that's what I thought.

561
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,590
Will you take this?

562
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,870
You'll find it very helpful.

563
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,600
 

564
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,040
What is it that you want?

565
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,890
The young lady from the Kim family 
will become the queen anyway.

566
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,800
We'll have to see about that.

567
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,890
But first,

568
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,560
you'll have to share
 information with me.

569
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,380
That woman who looks 
like the queen.

570
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,420
What are you planning
 to do with her?

571
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,820
The Queen Mother...

572
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,410
will take care of her.

573
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,340
The second part of the selection

574
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,610
is questions and answers 
conducted by the Queen Mother.

575
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,990
 

576
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,020
Let me ask a question.

577
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,080
Let's say there's 
a precious treasure here.

578
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,210
Who would you give it to?

579
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,830
I will give it to His Majesty
 as a Jinsang.

580
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,400
- To His Majesty?
- Yes.

581
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,490
"Jin" of Jinsang means 
"forward" and "upward."

582
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,700
But it also means "energize."

583
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,380
I'd like to energize His Majesty since 
he works hard for the people.

584
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,070
What a flawless response.

585
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,910
I would like to...

586
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,510
Relax and speak.

587
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,020
I think I'd give it to my parents.

588
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,150
If I see my parents happy,

589
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,540
I think I would be happy as well.

590
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,440
You're the young lady from 
the Hong family, correct?

591
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,510
How about you?

592
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,360
- I would sell it.
- What did you say?

593
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,710
If I give the treasure to one person,

594
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,530
it would just remain a treasure
 for just that person.

595
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,190
But if I get money for the treasure

596
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,370
and provide food and clothes
 to a hundred people,

597
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,650
that would become a treasure 
to a hundred people.

598
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,050
By "a hundred people," you mean...

599
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,860
I mean, the people who 
are hungry and naked.

600
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,570
All right.

601
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,310
How about you, Lady Jo?

602
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,740
Since the owner might claim it later,

603
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,860
I would just leave it where it is.

604
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,450
What does that mean?

605
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,560
You did not say the treasure 
belongs to me.

606
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,450
If the owner claims it later,

607
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,790
it might be a problem.

608
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,680
That's a good point.

609
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,160
Yes, I never said that I'm 
giving you the treasure.

610
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,660
But giving it to His Majesty 
means loyalty toward the king

611
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,340
and giving it to parents
 means filial piety.

612
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,490
But...

613
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,290
deciding to sell it as 
you said means

614
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,270
you're greedy since you're giving 
yourself credit using the people.

615
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,770
I understand what your 
heart stands for now.

616
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,750
You may excuse yourselves.

617
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,640
Have you been watching
 her closely?

618
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,490
She's done with the
 tests for the day, but...

620
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,160
What is it?

621
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,840
She received the lowest score
 for the Shimsang test.

622
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,580
I'll announce the last mission of the 
selection at the guest house later.

623
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,230
I tried to be strict as you ordered,

624
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,530
but will you not help her at all?

625
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,730
Both Kim and Jo family 
already procured court ladies

626
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,770
to plot on something.

627
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,630
She said she would catch
 the culprit herself.

628
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,710
But if she gives up over 
something like this,

629
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,430
how could I be able to use her?

630
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,440
Just wait and see.

631
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,990
His Majesty wants to 
see Lady Hong.

632
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,140
Please follow me.

633
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,380
Your day...

634
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,640
must've been very tiring.

635
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,950
I wasn't there, but I can assume.

636
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,380
It will get worse from now on

637
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,540
and you might be put into danger.

638
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,280
So if you're Eun Ki...

639
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,130
I beg you.

640
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,640
Please tell me.

641
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,480
That it's you.

642
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,760
I'll protect you.

643
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,360
Why do you say you'll protect me?

644
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,150
I already told you that I couldn't 
answer your question.

645
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,020
How could it not be you?

646
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,110
Everything I see
 in front of me is you.

647
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,330
Please stop, Your Majesty!

648
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,520
You're agonizing me

649
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,480
by continuing to do this.

650
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,290
Agonizing?

651
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,980
Do you know how my day was?

652
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,980
I was happy thinking it's you, and 
I felt devastated thinking it wasn't you.

653
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,620
I felt guilty thinking it's you

654
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,910
and felt miserable thinking
 it's not you, but...

655
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,600
I was happy...

656
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,100
thinking it might be you.

657
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,010
But you're saying you're not her.

658
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,170
You can't possibly be her?

659
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,410
I'm not.

660
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:49,500
♫  I miss you every day  ♫

661
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,600
♫  My deseprate...  ♫

662
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,290
You can leave now.

663
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,250
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

664
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,110
Escort her.

666
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,050
♫  If only you and I could  ♫

667
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,410
♫  get close to each other and stay  ♫

668
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,370
♫  in that moment as one  ♫

669
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,900
She keeps denying like that, 
but why can't I believe her?

670
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,470
She looks too much like her. 
She looks just like her.

671
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,440
Am I the only one who 
thinks she's the queen?

672
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
Your Majesty.

673
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,640
Please calm down first.

674
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,310
Since she's so determined...

675
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,290
If she's really the queen,

676
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,040
she wouldn't behave that way.

677
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,520
♫  Please stop the time  ♫

678
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,120
- Search!
- Yes, sir.

679
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,890
Open it.

680
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,850
You came, Officer Han.

681
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,660
We'll move him to a shelter.
 Get ready to go.

682
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,940
His name was Young Koon.

683
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,380
We found this in his lodging.

684
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,140
That's the gun that was used 
for the assassination.

685
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,570
Those coins were probably
 a reward for it.

686
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,420
Was it just this one?

687
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,480
How about the rest?

688
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,710
We couldn't find any more there.

689
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,990
But we couldn't relocate
 Young Koon, Your Majesty.

690
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,550
We saw a shadow in front 
of the physician's quarter.

691
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,330
Are you sure?

692
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,550
Keep him at the physician's
 quarter for now.

694
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,460
 I was happy thinking it's you and felt 
devastated thinking it isn't you. 

695
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,220
 I felt guilty thinking it's you and felt 
miserable thinking it's not you. 

696
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,530
 But... 

697
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,840
 I was happy 

698
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,960
 thinking it might be you. 

699
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,630
 Was the King... 

700
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,430
 deeply in love with my sister? 

701
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,300
Eun Ki.

702
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,540
No.

703
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,120
 Eun Ki. 

704
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,300
No!

705
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,470
This is the third test, 
the Haengsang test.

706
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:50,540
Every pouch has pocket money 
from the royal family.

707
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,220
The amount varies from 
100 nyang to one nyang.

708
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,640
It all varies, but

709
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,770
all of it should be used for the people.

710
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,680
Two days later at noon,

711
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,800
we'll gather the people in 
front of the guest house.

712
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,040
Please prove that

713
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,150
you have the generosity
 and benevolence

714
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,040
as the candidate to 
become the queen.

715
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,690
Whether you were truthful or not

716
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,810
will be determined 
by the people's votes.

717
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,860
We'll start with the one who
 has the highest score so far.

718
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,720
Lady Kim may choose
 the pouch first.

719
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,800
 

720
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,670
Next is Lady Jo.

721
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,320
 

722
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,690
Next is Lady Park.

723
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,580
Next is Lady Lee.

724
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,000
Next is Lady Ha.

725
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,630
Next is Lady Bang.

726
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,650
Next is Lady Hong.

727
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:04,010
Your Majesty, you don't look so well.

728
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,000
Did you have trouble
 sleeping last night?

729
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,360
I had a dream again.

730
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,100
A horrible dream.

731
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,970
Your Majesty, you know
 I'm a eunuch, right?

732
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,190
But I dreamt that I had a child.

733
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,470
My belly started growing big

734
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,360
and when you saw me like that,

735
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,530
you praised me a lot unlike usual

736
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,990
and you even named my child.

737
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,510
That name was "Silly Dream."

738
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,900
So you mean...

739
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,570
my dream is a silly one?

740
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,360
You're mistaken.

741
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,360
Dreams usually are bizarre. 
I was trying to tell you not to worry.

742
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,110
So I made a little joke. 
Wasn't it funny...

743
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,780
I'll tell the royal physician to make 
tonic that'd help you sleep.

744
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,360
Hurry up and leave.

745
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

746
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,770
My robe got caught.

747
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,750
 

748
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,170
 You have two days. 

749
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,140
 Prepare everything in two days. 

750
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,630
 You're free to leave the 
house during the day. 

751
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,200
Welcome, my lady.

752
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,900
I'll have this and this too.

753
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,290
My lady.

754
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,090
What will you do with
 all this food?

755
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:15,050
I have a plan.

756
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,220
It seems like Lady Kim is 
planning to have a party.

757
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,280
What would I do 
with just 10 nyang?

758
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,450
Food isn't the only thing 
that fulfills people.

759
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,110
What else then?

760
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,210
You only have one nyang left?

761
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,960
What did you buy?

762
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,830
All I got is one nyang.

763
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,940
I see...

764
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,550
How about you? 
What did you prepare?

765
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,310
I...

766
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,110
I don't have much.

767
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
Aren't you tired? 
I should get some sleep.

768
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,470
Your Majesty.

769
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,710
Officer Han checked several times.

770
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,010
Nothing happened to her.

771
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,920
Please stop worrying.

772
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,260
Yes.

773
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,460
It was just a dream.

774
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,120
It has to be.

775
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,120
My lady.

776
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,010
It's time now.

777
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,620
According to other servants, 
other ladies already

778
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,880
prepared cotton clothes and 
hired a prominent acupuncturist.

779
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,030
Welcome.

780
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,200
What's the cheapest
 paper you have?

781
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,380
This is it. How much 
would you like?

782
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,770
Give me one nyang worth.

783
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:36,980
One nyang.

784
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,350
When it's past noon,

785
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,620
there will be jars with numbers 
on them in front of this door.

786
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,490
Today, you'll be

787
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:57,550
choosing a young lady who was
 the most giving to the people

788
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:01,860
and put a card inside the jar
 that has the same number

789
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,880
as the number that's 
written on her clothes.

790
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,340
Do you understand?

791
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,560
 Yes. 

792
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,170
Go ahead then.

793
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,490
Come this way.

794
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,150
I have a lot of food.

795
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,460
I'm No. 6.

796
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,040
Keep yourself warm.

797
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,000
Seriously, come on! 
Stop fighting!

798
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,920
All of you will be treated, okay?

799
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,240
Where are they?

800
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,630
My lady, here they come!

801
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,810
Let's go.

802
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,170
- Just a moment, my lady.
- Okay.

803
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,850
They're giving away food!
 Let's go check it out!

804
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,790
- We need to hurry!
- That's right!

805
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,720
- Can we go too?
- It's a party!

806
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,190
I'm sure we'll get something.

807
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,100
What's going on?

808
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,670
The thing is...

809
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,810
The candidates for the selections

810
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,180
are having a party for the people.

811
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,130
- What are you doing? Let's go!
- Yes, let's.

812
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,960
A party?

813
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,620
What are you doing, my lady?

814
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,040
This is Shinmoongo.

815
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,500
Shinmoongo?

816
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,710
You mean the drum you hit 
when you have a complaint?

817
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,490
Yes.

818
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,800
I'll write down what people always

819
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,930
wanted to say and send
 it to the palace.

820
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,620
I see.

821
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,500
Instead of a complaint,

822
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,040
can I say that I want to eat 
stuff like this every day?

823
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,060
Have a seat over there.

824
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,550
So you mean you were
 framed as a thief

825
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,320
and got kicked out by your master?

826
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,610
Yes.

827
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,700
Let's go.

828
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:29,300
They're having the last mission of the 
selection outside the palace right now.

829
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,320
Outside the palace?

830
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,820
How could the selection happen outside 
the palace when it's against the law?

831
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,910
I don't know the details,

832
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,120
but the candidates are having a party
 for the people in front of the guest house.

833
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,500
What?

834
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,530
- Find out more details.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

835
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,490
It really does speak badly 
about my family.

836
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,380
How dare you?

837
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,470
But making a fuss about it now won't
 be good for either of us.

838
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,540
Lead the way.

839
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,010
My lady.

840
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,970
Don't worry.

841
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,160
My lady?

842
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,290
As you can see, I have a hand too.

843
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,770
How dare you...

844
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,070
Do you want to see who's stronger?

845
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,720
You'll lose.

846
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,570
That's why you shouldn't 
have gotten in my way.

847
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,140
I'm annoyed with that girl 
from Jo family too,

848
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,330
but you're no competition for me.

849
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,340
Keep quiet and go back to the 
countryside you come from.

850
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,940
Behave yourself.

851
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,990
Put her somewhere until 
the selection ends.

852
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,560
Tie up her servant too.

853
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,270
Yes, my lady.

854
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,900
You can't come in here.

855
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,260
This is a part of the palace. 
Please go back.

856
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,430
Well, didn't a young lady
 come this way?

857
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,940
- I'm sure she went in there.
- I said, go back!

858
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,100
That's the end of the mission.

859
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,100
Please gather at the front
 yard of the guest house, ladies.

860
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,420
All right.

861
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,010
Please put the cards
 in the jars now.

862
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,680
Why is my lady taking 
so long anyway?

863
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,760
How come I don't see Lady Hong?

864
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,910
Look for her.

865
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:46,350
If I don't see her before the 
announcement, Lady Hong will be...

866
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,020
eliminated.

867
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,100
Your Majesty, it's Chief Eunuch Hwang!

868
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:17,210
Your Majesty, Lady Hong 
has disappeared!

869
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,100
What are you talking about?

870
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,300
She disappeared?

871
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,630
 

872
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,310
 Look everywhere around the 
guest house! You must find her! 

873
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,700
 Did my dream turn out 
to be true again? 

874
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,970
 Lady Hong will be eliminated 
since she broke the rule... 

875
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,640
 Court Lady! Court Lady! 

876
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,070
 I think My Lady is in trouble. 

877
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,700
 You're a servant to 
a candidate of the selection? 

878
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,440
 Why don't we strengthen power in the 
court with you in the center? 

879
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,320
 We need to take the King's life. 

880
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,770
 That girl is tempting the King again! 

881
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,030
 If something scandalous 
happens during the selection, 

882
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,080
 I will not select the queen.
