1
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,060
 

2
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,660
Today, I will give you...

3
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,480
the answer you have been

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,380
expecting for so long.

5
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,490
Let her in.

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,700
Consort Hong,

7
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,130
reveal the truth yourself.

8
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,880
Forgive me.

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,060
Just like the rumors 
outside the palace say,

10
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,410
I am not His Excellency 
Hong Ki Ho's daughter.

11
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,700
I am...

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,950
the late His Excellency 
Kang Yi Soo's daughter

13
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,710
and the former queen, 
Kang's twin sister...

14
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,500
Kang Eun Bo.

15
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,710
Is everything you just said

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,970
- indeed true?
- Yes.

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,160
It is.

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
Your Majesty!

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,300
Please make Consort Hong, no,

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,760
make this woman pay for 
her sins accordingly.

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,290
She just admitted to all 
of her crimes herself.

22
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,800
And on top of that, she's the traitor
 Kang Yi Soo's daughter!

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,680
This is a disastrous situation

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,520
where some woman trifled 
with the royals and the court!

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,330
I am willing to accept any 
punishment you decide to give me.

26
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,690
But...

27
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,150
my father became a criminal by being
 framed for committing high treason.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,350
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Please reinvestigate the 
case and reveal the truth!

30
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,610
What an impudent woman!

31
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,020
Your Majesty, there's no reason 
to listen to her anymore.

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,030
Please remove her from her position

33
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,640
and kick her out of the palace!

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,780
Please execute her 
with poisonous tonic!

35
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,860
She's not even remorseful of 
deceiving the royalty and country,

36
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,130
but she's disturbing the 
administration again!

37
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,670
Her crime is more than sufficient
 to receive a death penalty!

38
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,880
Please give the woman
 from the Kang family

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,020
the poisonous tonic and remove
 Hong Ki Ho, the Minister of Justice

40
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,740
who lent her the fake 
identity from his position

41
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,400
and banish him, Your Majesty!

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,360
Your Majesty, please
 listen to our plea.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,570
 Please listen to our plea. 

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,630
Go inside.

45
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,110
That cannot be.

46
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,770
Eun Bo from the Kang family

47
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,010
is a woman who 
participated in the selection

48
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,270
to find the culprit for the assassination.

49
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,620
And I...

50
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,150
allowed her to do that.

51
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,800
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
- That means...
- I already knew that...

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,090
she is the twin sister of the

54
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,640
dead queen.

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,610
My goodness...

56
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,750
Your Majesty, please be
 careful with your words.

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,570
You should be the one to 
maintain law and order.

58
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,230
Yet you covered up such 
wrongdoing. How could this be...

59
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,960
I am not done speaking yet.

60
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,790
She contributed greatly in finding
 the culprit who attempted to

61
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,080
assassinate me and killed the queen.

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,060
Considering her contribution,

63
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,430
I will stop at removing her
 from the position.

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,310
- Your Majesty!
- Also...

65
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,460
I am ordering the reinvestigation 
of Kang Yi Soo's case.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,710
Your Majesty!

67
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,120
The investigation on that case 
has already been closed.

68
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,970
That is why I said, "reinvestigate."

69
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,190
If no evidence were found,

70
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,850
what would you do then?

71
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,900
If so, that woman's crime will 
become even more serious

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,850
and Your Majesty will have to 
take responsibility for it too.

73
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,910
Would that be all right?

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,110
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,800
The exile, Kwon Ik Soo,
 is requesting an audience.

76
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,340
Your Majesty!

77
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,810
Let him in.

78
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,610
You may go in.

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,700
So, why is Kwon Ik Soo here?

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,300
Hush.

81
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,070
Your Majesty.

82
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,080
He's a criminal who 
should be in exile.

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,860
Why is he here?

84
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,950
You will find out once
 you listen to him.

85
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,840
The exile, Kwon Ik Soo.

86
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,850
Tell me why you are here.

87
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,850
It took me a while,

88
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,000
but I'm here to testify, Your Majesty.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,850
I was exiled for ordering the
 murder of the palace lady,

90
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
but it was actually someone else 
who ordered that murder.

91
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,910
Who is that?

92
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,630
They were the chief state 
minister, Kim Man Chan,

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,370
the chief scholar, Kim Hyung Chan,

94
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,150
and the inspector general, 
Kim Hong Sik.

95
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,880
The reason they murdered
 the palace lady was

96
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,580
because they were afraid that

97
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,800
the fact that they framed His Excellency
 Kang Yi Soo might get revealed.

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,780
So they got rid of the evidence.

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,920
Is that true?

100
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,220
It is true.

101
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,920
Shut... Shut your mouth!

102
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,770
How dare you slander me 
in front of His Majesty?

103
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,180
Your Majesty.

104
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,880
It is a lie.

105
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,580
How could you believe
 a criminal like him?

106
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,670
Yes, it's all a lie. A lie!

107
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,910
This is untrue, Your Majesty!

108
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,790
This is untrue!

109
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,920
Fine.

110
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,830
If so, present the evidence 
that he is telling a lie

111
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,750
and you are being framed.

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,430
Is there any?

113
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,210
Your Majesty!

114
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,770
It looks like there is nothing.

115
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,080
Starting from now,

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,780
Chief State Minister Kim Man Chan, 
Chief Scholar Kim Hyung Chan,

117
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,580
and Inspector General Kim Hong Sik 
will be suspended from their duties

118
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,150
and will be placed under house arrest
 until the punishment is decided.

119
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,380
- Take them away!
- This cannot be!

120
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,740
- I'm the chief state minister!
- Your Majesty!

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,390
You cannot do this!

122
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,520
We're the Queen Mother's family! 
You cannot do this!

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,670
How could this be possible?

124
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,320
We're innocent, Your Majesty!

125
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,130
- Your Majesty!
- How could you believe this criminal?

126
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,080
This is so unfair!

127
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,860
Let go of me!

128
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,200
How dare you touch me!

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,960
I'll remember all of your faces!

130
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,310
I'm the inspector general!

131
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,800
What in the world...

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,610
- I'm innocent, Your Majesty!
- Aigoo...

133
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,100
It all went well.

134
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,030
You can relax now.

135
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,950
Then, what is going to happen now?

136
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,110
The details of the Kim family's 
case will become clear

137
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,780
and your family's name
 will be cleared as well.

138
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,820
Wal did something very important.

139
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,560
That is a relief.

140
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,930
That is such a relief.

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,830
I thought everything was over,

142
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,840
but now I cannot ask 
for anything else.

143
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,660
Now I have to order your expulsion.

144
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,140
Yes.

145
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,740
I will pack my belongings.

146
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,990
What did you just say?

147
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,750
Uncle was expelled?

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,420
You! Tell us exactly what happened.

149
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,000
Consort Hong was
 supposed to be punished.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,960
How could the Chief State Minister's 
crime be revealed all of a sudden?

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
I am telling the truth, You Highness.

152
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,500
His Excellency Kwon Ik Soo, 
who was exiled,

153
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,900
came to the Grand Palace
 and testified.

154
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,010
What?

155
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,800
Kwon Ik Soo?

156
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,180
You came back just in time.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes...

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,670
I don't know how 
I arrived just in time.

159
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,960
I was so proud of myself too.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,380
So I did this...

161
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,100
By the way, how did you
 persuade Kwon Ik Soo?

162
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Well...

163
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,670
at first,

164
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,900
he was so stubborn saying
 he couldn't believe me,

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,210
but then...

166
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,420
Do you know how your family
 is doing in Hanyang?

167
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,450
Do you know how the 
Kim family is treating them?

168
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,420
I saw with my own eyes 
before I came here.

169
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,990
They were left completely
 high and dry right now.

170
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,610
There's no way His Excellency 
Kim Man Chan would be like that.

171
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,130
He knows what I had done 
for the Kim family.

172
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,360
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this,

173
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,010
but you have been ditched. Ditched.

174
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,330
Ditched like an old pair of shoes.

175
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
You...

176
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,270
How dare you blabber your mouth?

177
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,490
Why don't you come with me and
 see it for yourself then?

178
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,460
What?

179
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,440
Let's go to Hanyang together and
 see how your family is doing.

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,300
You won't believe anything
 I say otherwise.

181
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,690
Is this really the place

182
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,220
my family is living in?

183
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,680
The only thing the 
Kim family did for them

184
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,750
was getting them a small cottage.

185
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,390
That's your daughter, right?

186
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,610
We're from the royal palace.

187
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,820
We enjoyed the barley you 
gave us a few days ago too.

188
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,600
Thank you. Thank you so much.

189
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,810
His Majesty sent them.

190
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,800
His Majesty did?

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,610
What can I do?

192
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,400
That was the moment 
he changed his mind.

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,330
He saw that Your Majesty 
was caring for his family.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,600
And...

195
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
if he continues to be loyal to them

196
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
even after seeing how they
 live, he'd be a stooge...

197
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,130
A stoo...

198
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,760
Anyway...

199
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,830
That is how I brought him
 here, Your Majesty.

200
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,830
You worked very hard.

201
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,540
Tell Chief Eunuch Hwang if 
there is anything you want.

202
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,950
Your Majesty.

203
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,850
I don't think I ever told you
 something like this before, but...

204
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,100
I am overwhelmed by your 
generosity, Your Majesty!

205
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,790
By the way, Your Majesty.

206
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,330
Is Consort Hong really 
being expelled?

207
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,000
Last time,

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,140
I promised you that you 
may leave with her

209
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,460
when the time comes, correct?

210
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,380
Do me a favor.

211
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,720
Please stay by her side and

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,470
care for her as you are doing now.

213
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,020
Gyungchu Gate, Yogeum Gate, 
and Gwangji Gate.

214
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,580
You will hear a gunshot at these
 three places simultaneously.

215
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,130
It's to scatter the palace guards.

216
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,600
Head toward Geumcheon Gate 
when the palace gate opens.

217
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,530
It will be easy to enter there.

218
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,560
The problem is Naegeumwi,

219
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,030
the King's security guards.

220
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,700
We will have a full-scale 
war with them.

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,580
We have guns.

222
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,270
I think we should use 
them to lure them.

223
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,070
We lost our secret deal since
 we evacuated the headquarters.

224
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,720
So we don't have enough bullets.

225
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,380
It'd be nice if there's a way to
 lure the king's security guards,

226
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,410
but we don't have enough 
men in the palace.

227
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,650
Sir!

228
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,100
Did they decide to
 expel Consort Hong?

229
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,870
Yes.

230
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,060
It was revealed that Kim Man Chan
 and his men falsely accused a man

231
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,240
and were placed under house arrest.

232
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,350
This is not right, King.

233
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,630
How could you place the 
Chief State Minister under house arrest?

234
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,830
He's the most authoritative
 minister in the court.

235
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,880
He has been loyal to
 you for a long time.

236
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
How could you not recognize that

237
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,920
and treat him like a criminal?

238
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,790
And he is my brother too!

239
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,150
I treated him with respect

240
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,180
by not putting him in prison.

241
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,640
What?

242
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,860
Once the details of 
his crime become clear,

243
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,910
I will place him in exile.

244
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,760
And when that happens,

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,740
please move to Onyang 
Temporary Palace as well.

246
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,200
Did you...

247
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,040
just say, "temporary palace?"

248
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,070
I already gave you the chance

249
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,600
to confess your crime.

250
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,690
I also told you that it would 
be my last consideration

251
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,100
for you as my mother.

252
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,400
So are you saying
 you will kick me out?

253
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,490
How could you do this to your
 mother because of that one girl...

254
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,040
You cannot do this.

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,550
Are you not afraid of the heavens and
 the people for your unfilial deed?

256
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,610
I will ask you a question too then.

257
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,120
Have you ever been truly my mother,

258
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,890
and not a member of the Kim family?

259
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,100
Do you...

260
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,000
Do you mean I was never...

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,190
motherly to you?

262
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,860
Consort Kim will move
 with you as well.

263
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,020
King.

264
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,540
King!

265
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,320
My Lady, His Majesty's 
security guard is...

266
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,270
My Lady, it's Wal.

267
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,290
 Come on in. 

268
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,960
Well...

269
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,900
What would've happened 
if I didn't show up?

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,190
You should've run away immediately when you got caught.

271
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,300
Why is revealing your 
name such a big deal?

272
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,710
Why would you put 
your life on the line?

273
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,230
You have one name, but three 
or four lives or something?

274
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,320
Are you brave or stupid? 
Which is it exactly...

275
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,800
I get it. Please stop.

276
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,440
What do you mean, you get it?

277
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,480
Yes.

278
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,270
I'll stop for now,

279
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,240
but you'll never hear 
the end of this, okay?

280
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,380
All right. Thank you.

281
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,470
So...

282
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,840
I heard you're leaving the palace.

283
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,340
Then you'd be parting 
with His Majesty.

284
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,040
Will you be okay?

285
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,370
Why couldn't you

286
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,040
just insist that you're Hong Yeon?

287
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,740
No one would've known 
if you didn't confess.

288
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,380
Whether it's Kang Eun Bo 
or Hong Yeon,

289
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,100
all you needed to do was
 to be by your love.

290
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,390
I just can't understand 
because I lived my whole life

291
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,300
without a name.

292
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,850
I'm fine being called "Wal."

293
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,010
What's with Wal? Sounds like a dog.

294
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,340
What's wrong with Wal?

295
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,440
- It suits you well.
- It suits my foot, more like.

296
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,230
Anyway,

297
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,770
I should go pack my things.

298
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,930
His Majesty told me
 to leave with you.

299
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,860
With you?

300
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,140
Why are you making that face?

301
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,840
What? Are you grateful 
to His Majesty?

302
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,480
No.

303
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,670
I'm grateful to you.

304
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,990
I mean it.

305
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,540
Thank you so much.

306
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,120
Well...

307
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,900
Why are you doing this?

308
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,940
As if we'll never see each other again.

309
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,510
I said we're leaving together.

310
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,470
Yes, that'd be such a bother.

311
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,850
I should be the one saying that.

312
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,420
Aigoo.

313
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,690
Aigoo!

314
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,880
The temporary palace?

315
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Why must I...

316
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,610
Aigoo...

317
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,860
Aigoo!

318
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,920
Aigoo!

319
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,890
Why must I, Kim Song Yi...

320
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,710
What are you thinking about?

321
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,840
The meal is too simple, isn't it?

322
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I would've liked to get mountain
 herbs, but it's winter.

323
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,630
Please have some even
 if it's not to your taste.

324
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,260
Where are my father and the Prince?

325
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,210
What do you think of working
 with Kim Man Chan?

326
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,670
Kim Man Chan...

327
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,350
He probably can't even
 move freely right now.

328
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,050
Is there something he can do for us?

329
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,480
And once we succeed with the coup,

330
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,790
he will be greedy and demand
 a lot of things from us.

331
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,920
But...

332
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,330
it's also true that he has 
power over the ministers.

333
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
He could help in
 justifying our cause.

334
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,730
You said you need a way to lure 
the royal security guards, right?

335
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,650
Young Ji!

336
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,620
I came up with an idea.

337
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,740
Is there a way?

338
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,840
If that woman disappears
 in the palace,

339
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,570
His Majesty will release the royal 
security guards to look for her.

340
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,200
Disappear?

341
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,800
I've seen it many times

342
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,400
and experienced it.

343
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,650
Whenever that woman is in danger,

344
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,880
His Majesty always takes action.

345
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,710
But how will we plan that exactly?

346
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,040
If we collaborate with
 His Excellency Kim Man Chan,

347
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,490
we can make Consort Kim do it.

348
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,970
The palace ladies at the 
annex finally started speaking.

349
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,500
The evidence that His Excellency Kang Yi Soo
 was framed is growing, Your Majesty.

350
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,240
Good work.

351
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,650
Now no one will oppose me 
for punishing the Kim family.

352
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,870
 Your Majesty! 

353
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,990
 The priestess from Royal 
Shaman Temple is here. 

354
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,350
Let her in.

355
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,240
Did you want to see me?

356
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,030
I heard you lied to the 
Queen Dowager

357
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,660
that she's the resurrected queen.

358
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,890
I was already

359
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,950
told by the Queen Dowager

360
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,410
that she will shut down the
 Royal Shaman Temple.

361
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,150
She...

362
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,660
also told me to give up
 my life as well.

363
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,510
So I will follow the order.

364
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,410
"Eulminyeon Bangassangchul
 Hangyeokse."

365
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,960
The "Yeokse" part from that prophecy

366
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,100
must mean that the
 world will change.

367
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,860
So 20 years ago, the
 priestess at the time

368
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,040
thought of the prophecy 
as a bad omen.

369
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,460
Do you agree with that?

370
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,480
Not necessarily.

371
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,290
Forgive me for saying this, 
if that were a bad omen,

372
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,540
you wouldn't have been 
resurrected when

373
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,080
she was working as 
an assistant shaman.

374
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,360
That was...

375
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,200
indeed our destiny.

376
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,740
I will now tell you

377
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,450
how you can save your life.

378
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,430
Reinterpret...

379
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,990
that prophecy.

380
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,630
Your Highness, I will let him 
know that you are here.

381
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,570
- Bring the priestess to me.
- Yes, Your Highness.

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,770
 Your Majesty. 

383
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,900
 I do not think I will see 
you before I leave. 

384
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,820
 So I leave you this heartfelt letter. 

385
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,920
Like what His Majesty said,

386
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,860
"Yeokse" doesn't necessarily
 mean bad omen.

387
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,160
It is true that the 
Royal Shaman Temple

388
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,420
relayed that prophecy 
20 years ago, but...

389
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,790
it's up to the current priestess 
to interpret the meaning.

390
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,170
You might be telling me a lie

391
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,820
again in order to save your life.

392
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,750
How could I trust you?

393
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,030
I was...

394
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,280
concerned about the 
Royal Shaman Temple's future

395
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,490
and told you...

396
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,560
that the Queen was resurrected, 
and I deserve to die for that.

397
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,810
But I am not telling a lie this time.

398
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,910
I can tell you that by 
putting my life I've lived

399
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,740
as a priestess on the line.

400
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,850
 His Majesty is here. 

401
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,090
Your Majesty! What brings you...

402
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,580
Let's be together until the nightfall.

403
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,240
I want to be a man, not the King, 
for half of the day.

404
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,340
I will stay here as your man.

405
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,760
So if you are going to 
tell me to leave...

406
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,290
No.

407
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,740
I will not.

408
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,270
Please do not go.

409
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,030
Be by my side.

410
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,760
By the way, what were you doing?

411
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,480
Well...

412
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,970
It is nothing.

413
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,660
What are you hiding from me?

414
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,050
It is nothing.

415
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,070
It is nothing, Your Majesty.

416
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,460
- Later...
- Later?

417
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,470
Will you...

418
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,610
kick me and run away this time, too?

419
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,790
Pardon?

420
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,530
Like you did...

421
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,680
that night at the royal 
funeral palace?

422
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,610
I have been curious all along.

423
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,640
Why I was revived that day

424
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,450
and why I started having 
dreams about you.

425
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,300
You brought me back to life.

426
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,020
So I can save you as I promised to

427
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,420
under the sun, moon, 
and stars as a child.

428
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,270
We are destined to be together.

429
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,050
So this is definitely not the end.

430
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,930
When complicated 
situations get sorted out,

431
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,900
I will make sure to get you back.

432
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,400
I...

433
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,900
have not dared to wish
 that much yet.

434
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,990
Wish for that starting now.

435
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
For our days together.

436
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,280
Is this a silver pocket knife?

437
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,210
I want you to protect yourself 
with it until we meet again.

438
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,170
Do not be placed in danger
 while you're away from me.

439
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,010
Also...

440
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,220
I wanted us to have a symbol

441
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,000
to remind us that we are connected.

442
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,330
Even though we will be 
apart momentarily,

443
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,230
it will feel like we are 
sharing every moment

444
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,680
because of this.

445
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,570
I'm from the royal palace.

446
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,300
We're to switch shifts 
half an hour earlier.

447
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,870
Is it time for the Five Guards 
Directorate to take over?

448
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,610
We have no problem with that.

449
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,430
Get to it then.

450
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,810
Let's go!

451
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,090
Is this...

452
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,450
a dream or reality?

453
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,970
This can't be the end, can it, sir?

454
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,010
We are the Kim family!

455
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,500
That's what I'm saying.

456
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,910
That's what I'm saying!

457
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,370
We're not just anyone!

458
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,720
How could the family get destroyed
 in a second like this?

459
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,260
Aigoo...

460
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,590
Hey, hey...

461
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,400
Over there...

462
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,160
The Queen Mother is

463
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,220
about to get kicked out of the palace?

464
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,740
Is that true?

465
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,020
Yes.

466
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,110
The King lost his mind.

467
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,900
Otherwise, how could he do 
something so unthinkable?

468
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
She's his own mother!

469
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,790
If that happens to the Queen Mother,

470
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,920
what would we do then, Hyungnim?

471
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,450
Father.

472
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,680
That bastard...

473
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,940
Prince?

474
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,200
I thought you were being 
chased for high treason...

475
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,030
Don't be so nervous.

476
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,930
I'm just here to make a suggestion.

477
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,570
A suggestion?

478
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,810
You're not someone who'd 
retreat quietly like this.

479
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,870
I'm thinking of

480
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,450
giving you another option.

481
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,370
You must remember my grandfather.

482
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,250
He was framed for planning 
a conspiracy and became a traitor.

483
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,460
But as his grandson,

484
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,890
I won't just be remembered as a traitor.

485
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,030
- By chance...
- I'm thinking of dethroning the King.

486
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,920
Would you like to join me

487
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,710
in starting a new world?

488
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,870
You must know that

489
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,820
this is the best option 
you have right now.

490
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,460
When are you planning to 
overthrow the throne?

491
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,750
- Hyungnim!
- Father!

492
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,160
Tomorrow night.

493
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,320
That soon?

494
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,300
The sooner, the better
 for things like this.

495
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,940
If it is dragged out,

496
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,640
it's more likely our 
information will leak.

497
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
So...

498
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,700
what do you want me to do?

499
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,240
The plan to use Consort Kim
 was a good idea.

500
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,890
Wait just a little longer.

501
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,660
Once this plan succeeds,

502
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,790
our glory will be restored.

503
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,570
I do not ask for

504
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,840
such a thing as glory.

505
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,440
Please let that woman...

506
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,660
die in front of me.

507
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,450
How did it go?

508
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,200
His Excellency Kim Man Chan
 decided to join us.

509
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,090
Consort Kim will receive 
a letter tonight

510
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,280
and we'll get going as soon as

511
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,230
we hear that they 
kidnapped that woman.

512
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,840
It's...

513
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,820
finally tomorrow.

514
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,770
Deliver this to Consort Kim discreetly

515
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,060
without the Queen Mother's knowledge.

516
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,390
Yes, Your Excellency.

517
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,380
Hyungnim.

518
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,470
Are you indeed planning to join in 
the coup with the Prince?

519
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,900
Why should I not?

520
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,400
Well...

521
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,510
how about the Queen Mother then?

522
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,330
She's still his mother.

523
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,700
She won't join us to
 get rid of the King.

524
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,490
Keep it a secret.

525
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,580
We should find a way to 
survive ourselves.

526
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,740
Uncle sent me this?

527
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,370
Yes, My Lady.

528
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,210
It's getting late, Your Majesty.

529
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,470
Please do not see me off tomorrow.

530
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,500
I will leave with a smile on my face.

531
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,290
Because I will be sharing

532
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,740
every moment of 
my life with you now.

533
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:54,190
♫  I just look at you from distance  ♫

534
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:01,160
♫  And miss you every day  ♫

535
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,830
♫  So the image of you feeling sad  ♫

536
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:17,810
♫  Can scatter like dust  ♫

537
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,430
♫  In this wind...  ♫

538
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,400
 I will only love you for
 the rest of my life. 

539
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,430
 I love you. 

540
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,260
 Forever. 

541
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,850
♫  We'll become one
 and stay together  ♫

542
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,740
♫  Just one more step,
 one more moment,   ♫

543
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,690
♫  And one more word  ♫

544
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,290
♫  If only I could say it  ♫

545
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:50,720
♫  Please stop the time  ♫

546
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,590
♫  So we can rest like this  ♫

547
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,790
♫  Please stop the time  ♫

548
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,680
 Because she is my woman. 

549
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,900
 She was my woman 
from the beginning. 

550
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,340
 I'll either live alone or 
become his concubine. 

551
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,010
 I'm the King's woman now. 

552
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,600
 Ever since I met you 
a long time ago, 

553
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,220
 I only had one master. 

554
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,450
Why did you summon me again?

555
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,400
Bring your lady to the storage room
 near Yeochoon Gate tonight.

556
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,300
Pardon?

557
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,500
Pretend to guide her to exit
 the palace and lure her there.

558
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
- I can't do that!
- What?

559
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,650
Forgive me.

560
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,390
I will no longer do things like this.

561
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,500
I cannot do this to someone
 who's getting expelled.

562
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,130
If so...

563
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,800
should I tell His Majesty about

564
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,870
the things you did for me?

565
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,260
My Lady...

566
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,020
If you're afraid of that,

567
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,350
you'd better shut up and do as I say.

568
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,700
Following is my order.

569
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,370
Consort Hong's crime of 
participating in the selection

570
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,010
with a false identity and disturbing
 the royals and the court

571
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,410
cannot be treated lightly.

572
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,100
 However... 

573
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,740
 considering her contribution in finding
 the culprit for the assassination, 

574
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,000
I order her title to be removed 
and be expelled from the palace.

575
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,080
 And Minister of Justice, Hong Ki Ho, 
who was involved 

576
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,940
 will be demoted 

577
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,510
 and for three generations, 
his family will be banned from  

578
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,180
 participating in the selection. 

579
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,080
For framing the former queen, 
Kang's family

580
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,020
and disturbing the court by 
ordering a murder in the palace,

581
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,140
Chief State Minister, Kim Man Chan

582
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,840
will be removed from 
his position and exiled to Jeju.

583
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,210
His accomplice, 
Chief Scholar Kim Hyung Chan

584
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,890
will be exiled to Geoje,

585
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,550
and Kim Hong Sik

586
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,220
will be joining the army
 at the border of Gangjin.

587
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,030
Join the army?

588
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,870
You two are being exiled.

589
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,820
Why am I the only one joining the army?

590
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,180
Is that important right now?

591
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,740
Aigoo!

592
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,550
The King is making things 
easy by egging me on.

593
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,900
Let's just wait until we receive a letter

594
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
from Consort Kim.

595
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,400
Your mother was sent to
 a secret place we prepared.

596
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,300
You will be able to see
 her once you get out.

597
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,700
Thank you.

598
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,520
I know it is too late,

599
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,000
but I'd like to return 
your daughter's name.

600
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,200
Please tell Lady Yeon

601
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,900
that I am very sorry and
 thankful as well.

602
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,940
I should be the one to tell you that.

603
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,360
I got to assist His Majesty,
 thanks to you.

604
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,300
I feel like...

605
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,100
this is what His Excellency 
Kang Yi Soo entrusted me to do.

606
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,070
Please continue to

607
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,600
be a great support to His Majesty.

608
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,530
I will.

609
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,300
I heard the Royal Shaman Temple 
reinterpreted the prophecy.

610
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,270
It might take time, but the
 rumor will eventually go away.

611
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,800
Yes.

612
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,160
By the way,

613
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,540
where do you think that 
rumor came from?

614
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,500
There weren't many people 
who knew that we are twins.

615
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,830
I heard about it through

616
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,440
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
 before the selection.

617
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,840
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong...

618
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,390
If so...

619
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,730
did the Prince know about it, too?

620
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,530
I heard everything went well.

621
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,140
It's fortunate...

622
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,520
It is still a relief.

623
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,710
By the way, Your Majesty...

624
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,830
will you indeed not see her off?

625
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,430
Your Majesty, His Excellency
 Hong Ki Ho is here.

626
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,060
You mean the Prince is the
 one who spread the rumor?

627
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,210
I am not certain,

628
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,540
but that is what I am 
suspecting as well.

629
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,880
If the Prince planned to 
cause this chaos,

630
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,000
that means he is plotting 
something again.

631
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,570
But since His Excellency 
Baek Ja Yong is gone,

632
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,690
there is only a small group of 
people who work for him.

633
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,460
Maybe he just tried to 
cause a disturbance.

634
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,390
 Your Majesty, it's Chief Eunuch Hwang. 

635
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,560
Come in.

636
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,620
The exile Kwon Ik Soo is
 requesting to see you.

637
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,420
I thought I should say a word 
to you for the last time

638
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,290
since you did not deny your crime.

639
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,060
I will always regret the
 fact that I labeled your

640
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,460
sister and father as traitors.

641
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,060
I am sorry.

642
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,510
That must have been the only way

643
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,100
for you to protect His Majesty.

644
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,960
I hope you have a good life.

645
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,310
But you must not see the King again.

646
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,900
The prophecy might not 
have been a bad omen,

647
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,550
but I no longer want you to be 
associated with each other.

648
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,130
You scared me.

649
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,040
Are you ready to leave?

650
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,840
Well...

651
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,040
Did you appear out of
 nowhere to ask me that?

652
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,720
You scared me!

653
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,820
Seriously...

654
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,510
Well...

655
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,280
Is there something 
you'd like to talk about?

656
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,170
What's this?

657
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,460
It's the sword I used when
 I first came to the palace.

658
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,380
Are you...

659
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,510
giving this to me?

660
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,520
Why?

661
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,850
I'm not really interested
 in this kind of stuff.

662
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,650
I want you to...

663
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,500
protect her well.

664
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,850
His Majesty cherishes
 her tremendously.

665
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,140
 My Lady. 

666
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,950
Come in.

667
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,220
I will walk you outside the palace.

668
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,970
You do not have to do that.

669
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,450
It is all right.

670
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,450
Please allow me to.

671
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,940
You requested to see me?

672
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,960
There is something I need to tell you.

673
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,980
When I framed 
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo,

674
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,380
the person who gave me the evidence, 
Theory of Enlightenment,

675
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,100
was Jo Heung Gyeon.

676
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,940
- Jo Heung Gyeon?
- Yes.

677
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,250
And when I planned to murder the
 palace lady, Jo Heung Gyeon

678
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,400
told me that Lady Hong
 is the dead queen.

679
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,580
Jo Heung Gyeon was behind

680
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,700
everything that happened?

681
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,400
Thank you for telling me.

682
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,980
You may leave.

683
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,330
Thank you so much for

684
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,160
taking care of my family, 
Your Majesty.

685
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,940
Jo Heung Gyeon.

686
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,700
He is an extremely evil man.

687
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,090
He ordered the assassination 
during the procession

688
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,160
and esteem Prince Lee Jae Hwa

689
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,840
- to get his daughter selected...
- Hold on.

690
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,950
Jo Heung Gyeon...

691
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,500
has the military right given 
to the Queen's family.

692
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,700
Pardon?

693
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,600
Since Jo Heung Gyeon 
highly regarded the Prince,

694
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,530
they already know each other.

695
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:28,140
And if the Prince is plotting 
something with his men,

696
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,430
he might have joined forces
 with Jo Heung Gyeon.

697
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,810
Where is the guard who was
 supposed to accompany me?

698
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,920
The man named Wal is 
waiting in front of the gate.

699
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,300
My Lady, your leave is 
getting delayed.

700
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,100
Let us go now.

701
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,610
My Lady.

702
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,590
Hold on.

703
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:59,360
I do not think this is the 
way out of the palace.

704
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,300
Well, the thing is...

705
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,450
Forgive me. Forgive me, My Lady!

706
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,060
What are you doing right now?

707
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,760
Open the door!

708
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,000
- Did you lock her up?
- Yes, My Lady.

709
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,390
Let them guard the door securely

710
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,730
and leave the palace
 and let them know.

711
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,440
Consort Kim told me to
 let you know that it's ready.

712
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,400
Sir, we got an update.

713
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,310
Consort Kim succeeded.

714
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,010
Then, are we starting now?

715
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,550
I want you to head
 to the palace first.

716
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,850
- You must open the gate in time.
- Yes.

717
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,460
I want you to fire the gun 
outside the palace as planned.

718
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,620
We need to confuse the guards.

719
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,050
Will do.

720
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,980
Gather the soldiers.

721
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,770
Rush and reinforce security
 inside and outside the palace.

722
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,400
- Yes.
 - Your Majesty. 

723
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,580
 - It's Wal. 
- Come on in.

724
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,610
Your Majesty, 
Consort Hong disappeared.

725
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,680
What do you mean, disappear?

726
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,010
The servants at her 
chamber said she left,

727
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,770
but the gatekeepers said
 no litter left the palace.

728
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,630
Release the royal guards 
and search inside the palace!

729
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

730
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,410
Split up and look for Consort Hong.

731
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,450
 Yes! 

732
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,320
Where is she?

733
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,630
Haven't you seen Consort Hong?

734
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,700
No, we haven't.

735
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,850
She's not here.

736
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,090
- Keep looking.
- Yes!

737
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,660
What happened?

738
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,780
- She's not here.
- Go find her then!

739
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,780
Yes.

740
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,230
My Lady...

741
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,420
My Lady...

742
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,760
Eun Bo, where are you?

743
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,640
Tonight, we will...

744
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,260
dethrone the King

745
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,280
and start a new world.

746
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,660
If we fail by chance,

747
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,600
no one will escape death!

748
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,980
If we succeed,

749
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,150
Joseon's history will be rewritten

750
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,110
and your accomplishment will

751
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,950
be remembered in history forever!

752
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,320
Let's go!

753
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,720
Byeol.

754
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,010
Let's prepare to greet a guest.

755
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,460
A guest?

756
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,880
Is someone coming?

757
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,200
We are just hiding her.

758
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,540
We must not hurt her.

759
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,100
But why can't we?

760
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,890
If we fail to take over the palace,

761
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,320
we have to lure the King outside.

762
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,320
And we'll hold her hostage.

763
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,910
That means...

764
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,200
we must not hurt her.

765
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:14,520
Why isn't there any news 
about her being found?

766
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,110
Your Majesty, do not 
worry so much.

767
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,450
The royal security 
guards will find her.

768
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:35,690
I had to come since I heard
 you were making a racket.

769
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,870
My goodness.

770
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,210
I told you to keep her safe.

771
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,820
We can't let her get injured.

772
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,890
Did you order them to do this?

773
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,720
What are you doing right now?

774
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,950
What do you mean?

775
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,700
You're the one who started.

776
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,340
How dare you ruin my family
 and this Kim Song Yi?

777
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,500
Did you think you'd be safe 
after ruining the Kim family?

778
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,060
Stop making excuses.

779
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,730
- You ruined yourselves.
- What?

780
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,320
I want to tear you into pieces,

781
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,830
but I'm holding back.

782
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,410
So be quiet and stay here 
until the deed is done.

783
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,640
The deed?

784
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,380
What are you talking about?

785
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,100
What are you plotting this time?

786
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,510
Are you curious?

787
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,950
The coup.

788
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,400
While you are stuck in the dark,

789
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,700
the world will turn upside down.
 Brace yourself.

790
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,600
- Tie her up if she gets loud again.
 - Yes. 

791
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,080
The coup?

792
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,680
Your Majesty!

793
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,760
Your Majesty is in danger!

794
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,030
What?

795
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,420
Open it.

796
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,000
My Lady!

797
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,980
You said I couldn't get
 hurt, didn't you?

798
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,840
Who told you that?

799
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,620
What are you all doing?

800
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,500
- Take that away and put her back!
- Don't move!

801
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,360
By chance...

802
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,430
was it the Prince?

803
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,540
Move.

804
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,230
Move!

805
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,440
My Lady! Run away!

806
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,610
Get her!

807
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,620
Thanks for your service.

808
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:12,760
This is the last day for the Five Guards 
Directorate to come to the palace already.

809
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,180
Open the gate!

810
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,290
Hold on.

811
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,950
Your hat is tilted.

812
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,510
Be presentable since 
you're entering the palace.

813
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,600
Yes, sir. My apologies.

814
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,230
Eun Bo.

815
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,390
Your Majesty!

816
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,920
Your Majesty, it's a gunshot!

817
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,160
Protect His Majesty!

818
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,240
Your Majesty, please go inside.

819
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,840
I will release the army immediately 
and find out what's going on.

820
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,200
Hold on!

821
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,040
It is a coup.

822
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,470
Do not split up the guards.

823
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,500
Bring all of them to
 my bedchamber.

824
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,990
Yes.

825
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,500
What? Wasn't that a gunshot?

826
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,510
Open the gate!

827
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,140
Your Majesty.

828
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,590
The insurgent army is 
breaking into the palace.

829
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,700
Has Eun Bo not been found yet?

830
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,210
No, not yet.

831
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,060
But I did gather the guards.

832
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,150
Get ready.

833
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,180
- The insurgent army will come here.
- Yes.

834
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,170
I will head to the King's bedchamber.

835
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,940
- Bring that woman along.
- Yes.

836
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,610
- Let's go!
- Yes!

837
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,180
- Find the King!
 - Yes! 

838
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,860
Stop.

839
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,560
Sir, this is not what we expected.

840
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,790
All the guards are here.

841
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,130
Capture Lee Jae Hwa,
 the leader of the insurgent army.

842
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,610
It is an order.

843
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,680
Listen up, insurgents!

844
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,320
Tonight, we will...

845
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,680
kill the King.

846
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,290
I had no choice.

847
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,910
I heard she headed to the King's
 bedchamber. Go there now.

848
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,070
The woman disappeared.

849
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,850
- Find her!
 - Yes! 

850
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,760
Your Majesty, no!

851
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,300
I don't think we can last long.

852
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,950
Move on to the next plan.

853
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,830
Yes, I will take care of things here.

854
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,960
Hurry and go now.

855
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,500
- Capture the woman.
- Yes!

856
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,060
Eun Bo!

857
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,830
Wal!

858
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,980
Were you inside the palace, too?

859
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,830
As the King's security guard?

860
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,820
Your Hanyang accent is not bad.

861
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,950
Long time no see.

862
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,720
The two-faced prince.

863
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,090
Don't tremble.

864
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,710
You might run out of luck.

865
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,210
Move back.

866
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,780
No!

867
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,540
What is it that you want?

868
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,790
If I told you, 
would you let me have it?

869
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,170
I'm thinking of taking you with me.

870
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,660
Please just kill me.

871
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,980
If you'll use me to
 threaten His Majesty,

872
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,080
that's not going to happen.

873
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,310
I do not see the Prince.

874
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,540
Find the Prince! Right now!

875
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,840
Wal!

876
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,580
Wal.

877
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,130
Are you okay? Let me see!

878
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,750
Wal.

879
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,270
Wal!

880
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,000
Wal!

881
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:21,720
 

882
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,240
 The Prince's army kidnapped 
Kang Yi Soo's daughter. 

883
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,110
 The coup is yet to be accomplished. 

884
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:28,260
 You will go to hell soon like me. 

885
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,140
 You will want to kill yourself. 

886
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,810
 Kill me! 

887
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,560
 Nothing would change
 for you even if I'm gone. 

888
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,740
 Please be my woman. 

889
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,390
 You will never have me. 

890
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,400
 If so, I'll take your life away, at least. 

891
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,970
 Take this b**** away and kill her 

892
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,120
 and send her head to the King! 

893
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,990
 Did you say you will kill me 
and start a new world? 

894
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,430
 This will be your grave!
