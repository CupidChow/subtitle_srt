1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,210
 

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,440
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,450
This is a parade where you 
bring the Queen Consort

4
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,010
to the palace for the first time.

5
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,500
Please behave properly.

6
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,440
Your Majesty.

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,550
Your Majesty!

8
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,850
Seriously, you're being a pest,
 like a sister-in-law.

9
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,600
Even the Grand Eunuch is doing
 nothing. Why keep meddling?

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,130
Are you jealous or something?

11
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,490
Please sit straight.

12
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,390
By the way, the Grand Eunuch
 isn't talkative,

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,340
but he's been repeatedly 
coughing since earlier.

14
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,100
Haven't you noticed at all?

15
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,880
Okay, okay.

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,740
I'll maintain my dignity

17
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,970
and won't turn around, no matter what.

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Your Majesty!

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,450
Protect His and Her Majesty!

20
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,800
Protect Her Majesty the Queen!

21
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,290
No!

22
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,330
Your Majesty!

23
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,530
Your Majesty, are you all right?

24
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,390
Eun Ki.

25
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,660
Your Majesty, please don't!

26
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,950
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

27
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,790
- Eun Ki.
- Please don't!

28
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,590
Your Majesty!

29
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,170
Your Majesty!

30
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,650
Your Majesty!

31
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,420
Eun Ki.

32
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,100
 

33
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,890
What are you doing there?

34
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,580
Court Lady wants to see us.

35
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,700
The king died.

36
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,240
The soldiers are everywhere in the 
palace and the city four gates.

37
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
What do you think that means?

38
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,770
What does that mean?

39
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,380
That means I almost died on my way
 here because of you!

40
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,520
Geez...

41
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,150
Starting from tomorrow evening,

42
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,690
I'll be swamped taking care of the
 late king and queen's body.

43
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,900
And what does that mean?

44
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,850
That means this better be 
very important.

45
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
- There were guns.
- What do you mean?

46
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,120
The parade had dozens of people 
including the royal guards

47
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,660
and they were killed instantly.

48
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,240
Matchlocks need to be loaded with
 gunpowder and ignited.

49
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
Is that even possible?

50
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,630
Maybe they weren't matchlocks then.

51
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,260
Fine. If that's the case,

52
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,260
where do you think they got...

53
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,500
the guns that are not matchlocks?

54
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,960
Probably from America
 through the Qing Dynasty...

55
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,130
Could it have been...

56
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,390
- Mr. Wang?
- That's right.

57
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,000
The one you sold information 
to three months ago.

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
- It's that gun merchant.
- Well, I...

59
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,600
I didn't know he'd kill the
 king with those guns.

60
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Is that really true?

61
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,900
- Did they really kill them with Mr. Wang's...
- Hey, be quiet.

62
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
What have you been listening to?

63
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,240
When they figure out
 the whole story,

64
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,700
this informant business 
will cease to exist.

65
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,290
I've been building a reputation as the 
best informant in Hanyang city.

66
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,640
And because of you,

67
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,030
I'd be losing the scholars, noblemen, 
merchants, and middle class.

68
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,030
I'd be losing all my 
countless regulars...

69
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,810
because of you. What will you do? 
What will you do?

70
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,190
Huh? What will you...

71
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,320
That's why I said...

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,100
when you're making transactions, 
you have to be extra careful!

73
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,800
Didn't I always tell you that?

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,300
Hey! Are your ears clogged?

75
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,460
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

76
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,960
- Don't you understand...
- Silence!

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,590
Shut up!

78
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,370
Is my name Wal because
 I bark like a dog?

79
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,610
Put your hand away!

80
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,090
Put it away.

81
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,250
Okay.

82
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,330
I understand.

83
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,060
I understand. So...

84
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,530
Who was it?

85
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,000
Who was that lunatic who 
did business with you?

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't know because that's the rule.

87
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,850
But it happened on the day of Chinyoung.
 

88
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,860
It's probably someone who
 resents the new constitution.

89
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,130
Could it be...

90
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,260
the family that didn't make 
the selection of the queen?

91
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,030
The selection of the queen?

92
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,520
 The nephew of the prime minister
 of Kim family of Ahndong. 

93
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,060
You must be happy.

94
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,750
Since you didn't make the selection,

95
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,410
you got to save your life.

96
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
I need to see him in person.

97
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,740
How could His Majesty...

98
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,060
My lady!

99
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,060
My lady!

100
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,960
Your Majesty! No way...

101
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,900
Your Majesty...

102
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,140
 The daughter of the left state 
minister of Pungyang Jo family. 

103
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,900
- Your Majesty...
 - Neither of them made the selection. 

104
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,950
But they'd attempt to become the
 next queen if he remarried.

105
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,310
Did they really have to 
assassinate the king?

106
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,820
The chief state minister from
 the queen's family who is

107
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,210
powerful enough to make
 the birds fall from the sky.

108
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,750
Even three-year-olds 
know how proud and

109
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,440
reckless he can be.

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,930
He probably just killed them.

111
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,690
They don't just call him
 S.I.B. for no reason.

112
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,360
- S.I.B.?
- Simple. Ignorant. Boorish.

113
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,640
I see. How about the left state minister?

114
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,250
The left state minister could've been
 behind the assassination.

115
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,330
They say the left state minister is as 
cunning as a 100-year-old fox.

116
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,100
Who knows what he thinks?

117
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,600
No matter which side,
 it must be one or the other.

118
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,180
Those two must've realized that the

119
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,410
young king isn't so easy during
 the selection process.

120
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,470
They decided to replace the king 
and start a new administration.

121
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,310
Hey.

122
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,480
Why are you changing the subject?

123
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,990
I asked you what you're going to do.

124
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,300
Huh?

125
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,000
 

126
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,700
You can see His Majesty's 
clean face for the last time.

127
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,430
Give it to me.

128
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,850
That's the only corroborative evidence.

129
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,950
I need to hold onto it myself.

130
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,630
- Shaman.
- Yes, Your Highness.

131
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,140
They're poor little things.

132
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,730
Please help them 
ascending to heaven

133
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,190
so they have an easy
 passage to eternity.

134
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,720
Tonight, I'm planning to

135
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,270
have female shamans over

136
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,210
to combine their yin 
and yang spirits.

137
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,740
Your Highness.

138
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,880
Left State Minister, Jo Heung Gyeon

139
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,870
and Inspector General, 
Baek Ja Yong are here

140
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,450
and requesting to see you.

141
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,530
Since the King does not
 have a crown prince,

142
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,190
 
shouldn't you appoint

143
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,050
 
a new king among the family members?

144
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,480
Do you have any recommendations?

145
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,080
Lee Jae Hwa, the 
Grand Prince Sang Hae's

146
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,280
grandson is living in Jaemulpo.

147
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,560
He's not suitable to become the king.

148
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,240
If so, there's Count Jeon Ryang, 
Your Highness.

149
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,800
Count Jeon Ryang is
 almost 40 years old.

150
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,100
He's old enough to know the situation
 inside and outside the palace.

151
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,300
For the grandson of 
Grand Prince Sang Hae,

152
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,500
if you become his 
Regent Queen Mother,

153
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,800
it won't be a problem at all.

154
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,360
I share the same opinion as to his.

155
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,950
He might not be wise enough, 
but I heard he's kind.

156
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,960
It won't be too troublesome
 if you help him out.

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,160
You usually have very different 
opinions from each other.

158
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,900
How did you come to 
an agreement like this?

159
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,620
Maybe it means this is
 the right decision.

160
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,910
If you give me an order,

161
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,590
I'll bring him here myself.

162
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,480
You mean you'd do that yourself?

163
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,090
Go ahead then.

164
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,520
Whoa.

165
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,400
I can't believe the new king is 
a vagabond merchant.

166
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,080
He's basically as ignorant 
as a homeless person.

167
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,340
Did he even master the 
Thousand-Character Classic?

168
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,550
You should've been there 
to voice your opinion.

169
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,830
How come you just sat and watched?

170
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,840
I already know who 
the candidates are.

171
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,380
It'd be the same deal no matter
 who becomes the king.

172
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,520
It'd be the same mess 
no matter what.

173
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,430
- Why should I bother stepping in?
- But Hyungnim...

174
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,060
the one who's supposedly 
the new king is...

175
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,540
You don't know what
 you're talking about.

176
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,760
The dumber he is, the better.

177
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,040
It'd be easy to control him
 with my own hands.

178
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,920
The late king was too
 innocent and arrogant.

179
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,790
That Jo Heung Gyeon

180
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,550
came up with a great idea.

181
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,840
Anyway, the Kim family almost got 
into quite a predicament

182
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,990
through this selection as well.

183
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,120
We can't allow a Southerner girl
 to become the queen.

184
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,110
Of course not.

185
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,600
Also, the late king's affection 
toward her was so obnoxious.

186
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,110
If we just let them be,

187
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,340
the Southerners and the royals 
would've been in collusion as well.

188
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,900
Think about what happened last time.

189
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,730
The state institution that 
was rescuing beggars

190
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,400
came into existence.

191
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,240
It must've been those 
d*** Southerners' influence.

192
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,950
I thought we just needed to

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,990
worry about the old salamander, 
Jo Heung Gyeon.

194
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
By the way...

195
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,670
who do you think assassinated
 the king anyway?

196
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,480
Perhaps...

197
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,240
What? It wasn't me!

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,460
Seriously!

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,300
It looks like you're guilty
 about something, Uncle.

200
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,730
Are you crazy?

201
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,090
It wasn't me for sure!

202
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,000
What would you do if you find them?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,710
Enemies are both everywhere

204
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,730
and nowhere at the same time.

205
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,890
But...

206
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,390
the shooter was apparently captured.

207
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,130
They might find out 
who was behind him.

208
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,590
Geez...

209
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,930
Who do you work for anyway?
 

210
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,410
He's a traitor who planned 
instigated this calamity.

211
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,750
Tell me who it was 
right here, right now!

212
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,400
You bastard!

213
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,960
Here comes the Great Royal Dowager Queen.

214
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,060
Your Highness.

215
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,460
You're quite common.

216
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,480
So you used your dirty hands

217
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,020
to assassinate the king and 
the queen of this country?

218
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,000
That doesn't seem believable.

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,430
Tell me!

220
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,420
The thing is...

221
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Supyo Bridge...

222
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,560
There was a rumor going 
around among the beggars.

223
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,190
What?

224
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,150
Supyo Bridge?

225
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,240
If we learn how to shoot,

226
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,670
they gave us a day's worth of food.

227
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,990
I was about to starve to death.

228
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,930
They said they'd make sure
 I always have a full belly.

229
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,940
That's all.

230
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,840
I'm telling you the truth.

231
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,580
Take him to the royal pharmacy.

232
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,810
Pardon?

233
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,740
I'll never allow you to die.

234
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,380
When you recover

235
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,070
and think, "I survived,"

236
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,010
I'll cut you again and again.

237
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,050
It will never end.

238
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,660
You'll think it'd be better to have 
your limbs torn up and die.

239
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,950
I'll make you think that.

240
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,500
You'd better remember quickly

241
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,270
if you want to die easily.

242
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,080
You'll have to find 
any kind of evidence.

243
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,320
I'll make sure to find out 
who's behind you

244
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,470
and burn them to death.

245
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,730
Here you go.

246
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,890
This is the gun. Wow.

247
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,140
Mr. Wang.

248
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,200
Do you remember who
 bought this gun?

249
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,300
Huh?

250
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,500
Translate.

251
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,290
Hey, don't pretend like
 you're the boss. Seriously.

252
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,900
So... Mr. Wang.

253
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,410
Do you remember the person...

254
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,260
who bought this gun?

255
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,300
He asked for five guns
 that are the fastest

256
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,130
and easiest to use.

257
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,720
- Five of them?
- Yes.

258
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,050
- What did he look like?
- What did he say? Did he see him?

259
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,270
I remember.

260
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,060
He was tall and huge,

261
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,870
but he was dressed like a scholar.

262
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,080
So I told him that

263
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,850
it doesn't suit him.

264
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,990
Tall and huge, you said?

265
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,070
What did you say?

266
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,410
A tall and huge man!

267
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,490
Share the information!

268
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
He said he's tall and huge!

269
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,860
- Couldn't you tell when I did this...
- Tall and huge?

270
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
It seemed that way when he 
visited Buyoung Agency too.

271
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,790
From a lowly and servant family.

272
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,920
That's it! Just like that!

273
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,890
Thinking about it now,

274
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,920
it seemed like he was used to

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,010
using a matchlock.

276
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,540
He said he was good
 with matchlocks.

277
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,880
By chance...

278
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,540
can you find the key evidence that

279
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,990
he killed the king with this gun?

280
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,980
By chance, could you
 find the key evidence

281
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,950
that he killed the king with this gun?

282
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,120
Of course.

283
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,760
I can tell by just looking at the bullet.

284
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,250
I'm the only person who can

285
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,550
import these guns to Joseon.

286
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,990
Only Mr. Wang can!

287
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,430
According to him,

288
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,020
he can tell if he sold the gun 
by looking at the bullet.

289
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,540
He seems a bit too confident to me.

290
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah.

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
- Satisfied?
- Yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,620
Let's go. Bye!

293
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,950
- Bye.
- Good luck with sales, Mr. Wang.

294
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,060
So...

295
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,330
if only I find the bullet
 in the king's body,

296
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,540
I could find the culprit, right?

297
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,690
Hey, what are you talking about?

298
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,330
Don't you want to know 
who killed the king?

299
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,020
No, not at all.

300
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,950
How come?

301
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,030
You'd acquire a major 
piece of information.

302
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,820
The culprit who killed the king!

303
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,800
- I'm sure it'd be very useful...
- Shut your mouth!

304
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,410
Are you crazy or insane?

305
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm warning you to stop butting in.

306
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,890
Lowly people like us can't possibly 
use information like that.

307
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,190
- I'll sell it to Queen Dowager!
- What?

308
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,650
Hey, hey, you idiot!

309
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,120
I was kidding.

310
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,690
Where are you going?

311
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,380
It's almost seven o'clock.

312
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,000
She wants us to take turns.

313
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
The king is on the East-side

314
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,630
and the queen is on the West-side.

315
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,480
Don't move in between them.

316
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,170
It's an order from the shaman.

317
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,570
We'll be selecting the queen.

318
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,470
Why? What's so strange?

319
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,160
 
It's already been three years 
since you became the king.

320
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,670
The state funeral has ended too.

321
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,790
It's natural for you to have a wife 
since you're the right age.

322
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,880
You're an old bachelor.

323
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,190
I mean...

324
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,690
how could you use the word "old" 
to this appearance anyway?

325
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,480
Then will you accept official 
candidate applications?

326
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,660
We'll have to follow the protocol.

327
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,100
Please allow me to participate
 in the selecting process.

328
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,650
King.

329
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,570
That's not lawful.

330
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,960
I have read that...

331
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,560
respecting and loving one's wife

332
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,740
is the basic rule of marriage.

333
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,340
How could I respect and love a woman

334
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,550
all my life if I don't have 
feelings for her?

335
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,620
She will be assisting me 
by my side.

336
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,240
We'll love each other

337
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,100
and she'll lead the prosperity of 
Joseon with me as my queen.

338
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,080
The fact that I don't

339
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,000
have the right to choose is strange.

340
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,450
By chance...

341
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,050
do you have anyone in mind already?

342
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,480
Is it someone from Kim's, 
Mother's family?

343
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,300
That's nonsense.

344
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,800
Please consider it, Grandmother.

345
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,830
Since I was raised seeing both of you,

346
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,930
I have high standards 
when it comes to beauty.

347
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,340
She'll probably submit 
her papers, right?

348
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,040
By "she," you mean...

349
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,970
the first love of yours by chance?

350
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,090
You don't even know three 
characters in her name.

351
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,620
But you let her steal 
your heart, didn't you...

352
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,600
I know her last name, at least.

353
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,940
Kang. She's from the Kang family.

354
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,380
Yes, you have two more
 letters to go then.

355
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,730
It's just a name anyway.

356
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,080
You'll get to find out 
during this opportunity.

357
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes.

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
That's right.

359
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,760
I'll get to hear her name this time.

360
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,170
She must've become a woman by now.

361
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,000
You used to come to the
 palace as the princess's Yedong.
 

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,570
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,390
The daughter of Kang Yi Soo, 
the chief scholar of Hongmungwan.

364
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,120
Who's your father?

365
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,380
His name is Kang Yi Soo. 
He's a calligrapher at Sungkyunkwan.

366
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,860
The family who just moved 
from Jeju, correct?

367
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,570
Yes, it seems to be so.

368
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,480
King.

369
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,270
I'm curious about you.

370
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,410
You may leave now.

371
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,190
 Yes, ma'am. 

372
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,880
- My Lady! Lady Yeol Eum! 
 - Seol!

373
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,000
Did you do well?

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,270
I don't know.

375
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,090
I'm sure you did.

376
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,920
How was it, my lady?

377
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,010
I can't believe someone
 like him is the king.

378
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,110
- Pardon?
- He's rude.

379
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,870
I knew a place like this 
doesn't suit me.

380
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,670
My ornament...

381
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,270
Have you been well?

382
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,180
Your Majesty.

383
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,850
I'll ask you three 
questions starting now.

384
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,610
I've been thinking about these
 questions for a long time.

385
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,220
For me, Your Majesty?

386
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,690
Please go ahead.

387
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,790
Do you remember me?

388
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,960
Pardon?

389
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
When I was the crown prince,

390
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,840
I met you as a child.

391
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,720
My apologies.

392
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,920
I don't really...

393
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,450
Is that so?

394
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,380
Here's the second question then.

395
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,340
I've asked you this before.

396
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,160
What's your name?

397
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,510
I'm Eun Ki from the Kang family.

398
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,940
Eun Ki.

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Eun Ki.

400
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,520
The next question is...

401
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,920
The next question is...

402
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,070
I know asking a question like this

403
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,870
is rude for a lady like you, but...

404
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,310
Well, of course...

405
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,250
since I'm the king of the country,

406
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,300
I have no concerns, but...

407
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
may I look at you

408
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,260
closely as you have 
become a woman now?

409
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,640
You're already looking at me.

410
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,100
If so, this question is invalid then.

411
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,890
Here's the last question.

412
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,900
You've become so pretty.

413
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,440
Are you really the child 
from back then?

414
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,520
Your Majesty.

415
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,480
Your Majesty!

416
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,530
You're the only one who knows
 that I'm the king here.

417
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,890
Keep the secret.

418
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,380
It's an order.

419
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,020
But the fact that you stepped 
outside of the palace at night

420
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,740
and meeting a candidate during
 the selection process is...

421
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,940
It's Buddha's birthday.

422
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,980
I heard it's custom for all the men
 and women to come out

423
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,780
to the streets and enjoy
 the lanterns all night.

424
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,090
I need to experience the 
custom myself to see

425
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,030
whether it's blasphemous or not.

426
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,270
Well, if you're really that concerned...

427
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,460
Fine, you'll be my closest 
companion for the night.

428
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,670
- Stay close to me.
- Pardon?

429
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,880
Let's try that one first!

430
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,050
You said you met me when 
you were a child, didn't you?

431
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,290
What was that girl like
 in your memory?

432
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,920
You were a mischievous one.

433
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,020
You were braver than boys

434
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,050
and more ambitious than adults.

435
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,290
You were cooler than I was.

436
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,930
I didn't know that girl would 
become so ladylike.

437
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,060
If so...

438
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,560
If I became different than I was,

439
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,430
if I became someone else...

440
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,010
What would you do?

441
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,610
I'm fine, even if you changed.

442
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,300
Even so, you're still you, after all.

443
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,540
I heard a man and a woman live happily 
ever after if they float a lantern like that.

444
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,290
Let's try that too!

445
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,490
Well, then...

446
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll get going now.

447
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,180
Stop right there.

448
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,790
We're still...

449
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,550
not done with the reason
 for this visit.

450
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,860
Could you come back 
for the selection?

451
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,980
No...

452
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,070
Come.

453
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,340
It's an order.

454
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,780
Your Majesty.

455
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,580
May I put my life at risk

456
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,180
and tell you something?
 

457
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,680
Go ahead.

458
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Selecting the queen means

459
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,780
finding the owner of
 the queen's palace

460
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,690
and it's also engaging in politics.

461
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,830
My family is...

462
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,900
a family of Southerners.

463
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,330
I know you

464
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,570
invited me here and made 
me the chief scholar,

465
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,200
but I'm a failed and 
incompetent Southerner.

466
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,180
As the father-in-law of the king

467
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,680
and the parent of the 
queen of the country,

468
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,540
I have neither power nor 
wealth to be helpful to you

469
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,770
at the moment.

470
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,490
That means...

471
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,620
it's because the Kim family of Ahndong, 
my mother's family,

472
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,700
has the position 
as the prime minister.

473
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,500
Also because the head 
of the Jo family of Poongsan

474
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,880
is currently the left state minister.

475
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,050
You think you are

476
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,360
sitting on the fence 
between them, right?

477
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
Is that right?

478
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,120
I won't deny that.

479
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,540
If so...

480
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,700
I'd like to make a request to you.

481
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,470
As far as I can tell,

482
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,720
you've always cared about
 the livelihood of the people.

483
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,070
Is that wrong?

484
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,520
I do not deserve your grace, but...

485
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,200
- that's correct.
- If so...

486
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,510
you're just like me.

487
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,380
To be honest,

488
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,420
I'm not interested in the fight 
between the political parties.

489
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,530
My only concern is

490
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,800
to become more and more caring

491
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,260
for the people in this country.

492
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,170
It's because I grew up eating, sleeping, 
and getting dressed thanks to

493
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,490
the blood and sweat of the people.

494
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,500
It's because I owe my bones 
and flesh to them.

495
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,670
Therefore, that's my duty as the king.

496
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,320
This is my request to you, 
Chief Scholar.

497
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,970
Please be my thousand soldiers 
and ten thousand horses

498
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,520
and work only for the
 livelihood of the people.

499
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,690
When I was the crown prince,

500
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,220
I lost you because of their trickery.

501
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,540
That was my painful failure.

502
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,580
But it'd be different this time.

503
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,720
My daughter is

504
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,550
reading Lesser Learning for the
 three-parts selection process.

505
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,190
Also, tell her to look 
beautiful for me as well.

506
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,440
I'll let him know.

507
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,530
I'll come back some other time.

508
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,520
I heard they're very impressive.

509
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,930
There's apparently no information

510
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,630
they can't get in Hanyang city.

511
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,020
How fascinating.

512
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,260
They even have information 
about women...

513
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,040
Wow, if that's the case...

514
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,830
Aigoo.

515
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,120
Your Excellency.

516
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,460
Left state minister.

517
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,540
What are you so amused 
about anyway?

518
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,970
We're just chatting 
about the secular world.

519
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,380
You must've heard of 
Buyoung Agency as well, correct?

520
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,920
Yes.

521
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,770
I heard through the grapevine.

522
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,090
I heard they sell information 
requested from clients.

523
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,830
That's that.

524
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,350
Were you at the royal council hall?

525
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,710
Yes, I left right away because 
Chief Scholar was in there.

526
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,730
Did he summon the Chief Scholar
 to the royal council hall again?

527
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,330
Even so,

528
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,460
the queen's palace already 
has its owner, doesn't it?

529
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,900
Isn't that correct, Left State Minister?

530
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Yes.

531
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,710
My daughter is just a foil as well.

532
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,850
I'll make sure the foil 
doesn't become

533
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,300
as flashy as a flower.

534
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,700
He's backing out more 
willingly than I thought.

535
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,180
You never know what he's thinking.

536
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,730
He's Jo Heung Gyeon.

537
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,660
Let's go.

538
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,290
How was your private 
meeting with the king?

539
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,480
Can't we try to change 
Joseon with His Majesty?

540
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,700
What are you talking 
about right now?

541
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,410
Are you by chance

542
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,510
desiring to become the
 king's father-in-law?

543
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,960
Listen to me!

544
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,370
Just like you,

545
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,130
I also hoped the reform would 
make people's lives better.

546
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,510
Because I thought the current king 
was weak and easily controlled.

547
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,110
But the king is dreaming
 the same dream like us.

548
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,220
He understands the people.

549
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,450
That's what I believe.

550
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,260
Don't forget.

551
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,570
This 100-name petition to the king
 sent you away to Jeju ten years ago.

552
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,820
And the current king,

553
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,470
the crown prince at the time 
signed the petition as well.

554
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,750
 

555
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,890
So, how did this end up
 in your hands?

556
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,670
It's a manuscript.

557
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,160
I realized that there's no hope
 in Joseon that day.

558
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,530
I dreamed of our new country 
while in despair.

559
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,530
I kept it so I won't forget
 about that resolution.

560
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,320
This is also my resolution.

561
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,680
What did you, Na Hong Kyu,

562
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,620
and Wangyi come together for?

563
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,280
 

564
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,860
Everything was for that new world.

565
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,230
That's why you started writing the
 Enlightenment Book of Practice.

566
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,620
Collect yourself.

567
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,200
How can we face Wangyi this way?

568
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,900
This is their fight anyway.

569
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,560
If not Kim, Jo Heung Gyeon's daughter
 would probably get selected.

570
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,550
 Your Majesty. 

571
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,710
 This is Chief Eunuch Hwang. 

572
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,350
Enter.

573
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,330
Your Majesty.

574
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,990
They found this trinket in
 Joongyidang per your order.

575
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,750
You can leave now.

576
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

577
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,650
It's strange.

578
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,400
Isn't it very strange?

579
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,790
What are you referring to?

580
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,890
I don't notice any 
movement in there.

581
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,550
Even the petition review...

582
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,010
Again?

583
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,730
I'm probably wrong.

584
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,300
Your Majesty.

585
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,180
This is Chief Eunuch Hwang.

586
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,950
Your Majesty!

587
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,650
 I'm all done. 

588
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,480
 Everything is done perfectly.  

589
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,680
 Tell the Royal Secretariat and 
every office that I'm off duty. 

590
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,750
 I'm on my own from now on. 

591
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,540
Find His Majesty.

592
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Find His Majesty!

593
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,100
Your Majesty.

594
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,330
You're...

595
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,110
What are you doing here?

596
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,450
Did you know that this 
was my litter?

597
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,240
What are you doing squatting 
like that anyway?

598
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,420
What? Squatting?

599
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,900
No, I mean...

600
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,660
First of all, I'll come out of the litter.

601
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,030
- I'll come out.
- No, it's okay.

602
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,740
Are you all right?

603
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,730
My apologies.

604
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,980
You haven't changed at all 
since you were a child.

605
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,410
Little girl.

606
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,270
Your Majesty.

607
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,000
Your Majesty, you're here.

608
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,310
So this is where you are.

609
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,840
How could you do that, 
Your Majesty?

610
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,770
Since when did you start
 seeing Lady Jo in secret?

611
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,700
I thought you were loyal.

612
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,270
I'm disappointed.

613
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,100
I told you not to get the wrong idea!

614
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,200
She was just leaving after 
seeing my grandmother!

615
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,100
- Right. 
- Stop all this nagging!

616
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,200
- You're just like a mother-in-law.
- Right.

617
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,560
Grandmother.

618
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,240
Did you hide a honey pot outside
 the palace or something?

619
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,580
Well, the thing is...

620
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,790
I heard you're starting 
new government offices.

621
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,360
Why haven't you submitted that
 to the royal secretariat yet?

622
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,200
Pardon?

623
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,300
It's because you
 suddenly disappeared...

624
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,460
Pardon me.

625
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,390
Do you not want me to
 know about it?

626
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,060
It's not like that.

627
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,300
It's a new government office where

628
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,710
they train beggers to become 
soldiers and engineers.

629
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:46,230
I can already see 
two parties opposing this.

630
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,700
Grandmother.

631
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,940
A servant is still a servant 
no matter how big he is

632
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,600
and the king is still the king.

633
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,460
How could a servant

634
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,760
defeat the king who
 cares for his people?

635
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,010
That's how you taught 
me, as I remember.

636
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,830
Am I wrong?

637
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,420
You're certainly right.

638
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,090
Yes.

639
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,350
That's what the king and 
the country are about.

640
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,410
You lost your trinket?

641
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,010
I don't know what to say.

642
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,080
I shouldn't have worn it.

643
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,660
When I have it with me,

644
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,130
it feels like Eun Bo is with me.

645
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,840
It comforts me so...

646
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,280
It's already been ten years.

647
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,110
Maybe...

648
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,400
we might not be able
 to find your sister.

649
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,990
Father.

650
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,490
The three-part selection 
process starts tomorrow.

651
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,600
That's what your ill mother
 thinks about all the time.

652
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm aware.

653
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,000
No matter what the result is,

654
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,600
you should collect yourself
 and be strong.

655
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,810
That's my request.

656
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,180
I'll ask you one last time, maidens.

657
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,260
Uncle.

658
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,180
You stupid b****.

659
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,690
I said this is an important event that 
will determine our family's future.

660
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,710
Did you really...

661
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,600
let Jo Eun Gyeol have that?

662
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,230
I'm sorry.

663
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,490
Geez!

664
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,750
Father.

665
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,210
Yes.

666
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,210
Could it be...

667
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,250
that Southerner girl?

668
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

669
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,490
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

670
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,340
The three-part selection 
process has finally ended.

671
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,880
So...

672
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,340
how did it go?

673
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,640
The thing is...

674
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,540
The thing is...

675
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,570
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

676
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,400
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

677
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,750
No!

678
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,750
Who are you?

679
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,980
Tell me.

680
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,010
How are you before my eyes?

681
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,400
Your Majesty!

682
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,740
Your Majesty!

683
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,510
Your Majesty!

684
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,100
 Your Majesty! 

685
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,740
 Your Majesty! 

686
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,700
 Your Majesty. 

687
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,390
Who... Who are you?

688
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,150
We're here to take you with us, 
Your Majesty.

689
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,900
Well...

690
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,170
You came to the wrong house.

691
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,240
So this is my house and...

692
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,140
My name is Jae Hwa, not Jeon Ha.
(Jeon Ha: Your Majesty)

693
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,840
Lee Jae Hwa.

694
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,050
What do you mean,
 the king woke up?

695
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,170
What are you talking about?

696
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,180
How could a dead person 
come back to life?

697
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,060
If so...

698
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,600
- could it be a ghost?
- Maybe it is.

699
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Please!

700
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,950
Shut your mouth and walk.

701
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,540
Do you think you're going
 on a picnic or something?

702
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,000
He...

703
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,600
He's really breathing.

704
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,130
Mother.

705
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,350
Grandmother.

706
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:14,810
Kyung.

707
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,940
Am I...

708
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,940
alive right now?

709
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,900
Kyung.

710
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,600
Kyung!

711
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,190
Kyung. Kyung.

712
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,540
Kyung!

713
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,100
Where's the queen?

714
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,160
Where's the queen right now?

715
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,820
Eun Ki!

716
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,630
Eun Ki.

717
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,300
Eun Ki.

718
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,630
Eun Ki!

719
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,330
He's unbelievably healthy.

720
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:32,150
But unfortunately,

721
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,310
there's no way to explain the situation.

722
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:37,730
The servants checked
 the king's body

723
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,660
and were stunned. That's all.

724
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,410
How could a dead person wake up?

725
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,770
Does that make sense?

726
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,230
Maybe he didn't die.

727
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,290
- Listen to me.
- How could it be?

728
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,680
It's a ghost, a ghost!

729
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,260
Shouldn't we perform an exorcism?

730
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,770
Be more specific!

731
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,520
You're supposed to 
be able to explain!

732
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,610
Your Excellency, how could this be?

733
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,800
 

734
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,500
- She disappeared?
- Yes.

735
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,380
She was never psychic, to begin with.

736
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,390
All she has is itchy feet.

737
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,900
I don't know what her story is,

738
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,460
but I heard a fisherman rescued her
 from the ocean as a child.

739
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,510
She lost her memory, 
and I took her in.

740
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,540
And I raised her as a shaman.

741
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,770
She lost her memory?

742
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,500
I heard that happened
 when she was on duty.

743
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,030
Is that why the Queen Dowager
 is looking for her?

744
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,720
 It was the queen's face. 

745
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,270
By chance, do you know 
where she might've gone to?

746
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:44,220
There's someone she considers 
as her brother outside the palace.

747
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,860
Is that so? Where is he?

748
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,190
It was a gun.

749
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,030
Do you remember?

750
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,470
I think it was.

751
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,180
Do you remember?

752
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,420
Did you see his face?

753
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,190
Please tell me everything.

754
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,500
Everything you remember 
or think of.

755
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,830
Please tell me everything.

756
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,910
I don't know.

757
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,750
I just feel like I woke up
 from a dream.

758
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,850
But Grandmother...

759
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,920
This feels more like a deep sleep

760
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,690
even though I'm awake now.

761
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,960
Stop.

762
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,300
No one is allowed inside.

763
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,600
What are you talking about?

764
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,030
The Queen Dowager ordered me 
to bring the new king.

765
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,450
Listen to me carefully!

766
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,280
I said, "the new king" just now!

767
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,430
 Your Highness, it's Court Lady Jung. 

768
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,410
Come in.

769
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,190
The procession of the new king has
 arrived in front of the palace.

770
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,630
Open the gate.

771
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,830
Remove all the mourning flags

772
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:12,640
and remove everything that
 signifies the king's passing.

773
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,320
Yes, Your Highness.

774
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,740
The people should never talk 
about the existence of the new king.

775
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:02,320
 Whom are you planning to
 serve as the king? 

776
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,020
Since the day I sent the
 late king to heaven,

777
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,870
there's only one king in 
Joseon for me.

778
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,550
I'll wait until the king's
 health is recovered.

779
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,330
Until then, I'll be assisting 
the current king.

780
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:17,050
Also, Lee Jae Hwa, the grandson
 of Grand Prince Sang Hae...

781
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,930
hasn't been crowned officially.

782
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,120
I'll anoint him a grand prince and have him
 stay at a house outside the palace.

783
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,800
But Queen Dowager...

784
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,670
The wellbeing of the king

785
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,420
is directly related to the success 
and failure of the country.

786
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,630
We can't be certain about the 
king's condition at all right now.

787
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:40,010
I can't say that I'm certain that
 this is the right decision.

788
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,160
Does everyone here agree with him?

789
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,550
You think this old woman is 
being unreasonable?

790
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,850
His Majesty's resurrection is

791
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:00,560
a huge event that goes 
against nature's rule.

792
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,320
I'm worried that God got angry with us

793
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,840
and he's punishing Joseon.

794
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,870
If so...

795
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,940
what do you think, Left State Minister?

796
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,760
I...

797
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,190
also think His Majesty's resurrection 
shouldn't have had happened.

798
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,680
So...

799
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,020
I'm worried that this might 
be some kind of sign.

800
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,440
A sign?

801
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,860
I wonder if...

802
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,100
His Majesty is meant to 
become a heavenly ruler.

803
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:53,940
Because he had a great 
plan he didn't get to fulfill,

804
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,310
even God managed to

805
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:01,130
make something impossible
 like this happen.

806
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,380
If so...

807
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,930
could there be any 
happier news than this?

808
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,820
That's right.

809
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,720
That's exactly what it means.

810
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,870
A heavenly ruler.

811
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,100
What are you doing?

812
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,170
Are these real swords?

813
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,370
Who are you?

814
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,020
Tell me right now!

815
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,100
Your Majesty.

816
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,850
- The thing is...
- Your Majesty!

817
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,980
I'm very regretful...

818
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,360
and thankful...

819
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,130
Is that how it goes?

820
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,530
I never saw a king in my life.

821
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,880
Wow, the king...

822
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,420
By the way, wait a second...

823
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,340
I heard you passed away.

824
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,270
Does this make sense? 
How could a dead person...

825
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,390
No way. Is he a ghost
 or a monster?

826
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,410
What is he anyway?

827
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,110
Geez, whatever!

828
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,240
Anyway, he's dangerous.

829
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,670
He gives me chills all over my body.

830
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,940
- Hurry.
- What is this?

831
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,020
Hurry up!

832
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,630
Run!

833
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,590
All right.

834
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,510
You indeed have the same face.

835
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,100
Don't you want to meet your parents?

836
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,780
Do you know my parents?

837
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,540
I'm your father's friend.

838
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,870
I'll take you to your father 
when the sun comes up.

839
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,630
It'd be necessary to keep
 the Kim family quiet.

840
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,570
Do you mean you have a plan?

841
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:35,800
I don't have a clear plan since
 I'm just a lowly servant, but...

842
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,910
I heard books always have answers.

843
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:43,570
Now that you mention it,

844
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,960
I remember what I read 
from the Book of Changes.

845
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,960
Just like how everything started 
when the sky and the land met,

846
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,260
marriage, where yin and yang meet

847
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,550
is the beginning of everything

848
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,580
and it's the base of humanity.

849
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,020
And...

850
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,110
if the marriage was cursed
 from the beginning,

851
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:08,660
everything in the world would
 surely get disturbed.

852
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,170
You want me to...

853
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,520
punish the queen's family
 for the curse?

854
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:26,980
If that's the answer you got 
from the books...

855
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,270
you should go ahead with it.

856
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,030
For providing false information
 in the application

857
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,710
and committing high treason by
 going against the constitution,

858
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:01,330
the king ordered us to punish 
Kang Yi Soo and his family.

859
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,360
- Find the culprits!
 - Yes! 

860
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:08,130
You said it was the king's order?

861
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,500
Was it really...

862
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,050
the king's order?

863
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,860
What are you doing? 
Capture the culprit!

864
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,880
 Yes! 

865
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,200
Sir!

866
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,770
There's a big problem!

867
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,670
His Excellency, Kang Yi Soo...

868
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,810
 Father! 

869
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,600
Father.

870
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,200
Mother.

871
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,800
He's the queen's father.

872
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,530
Your twin sister, 
who committed high treason.

873
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,290
 

874
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,810
 Bring out the body right now. 

875
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:00,990
 It's the body of a traitor. 

876
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:03,330
 She was the queen of the country. 
The queen was assassinated! 

877
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,540
 But how could you blame 
her for that? 

878
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,570
 Find her. 

879
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,430
 She's my queen no matter 
what they say. 

880
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,640
 I got my childhood memories back. 

881
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,410
 - What will you do?
- I have to find him. 

882
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:13,690
 The culprit who killed my sister. 

883
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,890
 You must catch him. 

884
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,520
 There's a place called
 Buyoung Agency. 

885
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,690
 Isn't that a gun wound? 

886
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,760
 He even killed the gun merchant
 he did business with 

887
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,980
 because he woke up. 

888
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:25,070
 You, I, and Buyoung Agency 
probably became the target. 

889
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,110
 - Who's this?
- I'm here to commission a case.
