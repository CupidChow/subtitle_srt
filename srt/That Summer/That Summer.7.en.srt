4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,576
I'm entering a boxing match.

5
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:20,807
What do you need the money for?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm going to win back my dad's motorcycle.

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,068
I think people already know about us.

8
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:28,075
They were talking about it at the market and at the district office.

9
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,214
Running from problems has no end.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,744
Let's face them together.

11
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,745
I don't know why, but you look kind of familiar.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,106
You don't remember being….

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,202
Being what?

14
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:42,241
You're saying Wave is a prince?

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,126
Yes.

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,562
It's also my first time feeling love for someone.

17
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,182
I love you too.

18
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:53,679
Sleepy? Then go get some sleep.

19
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:00,987
I woke up super early for this,

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,197
so I have to watch it.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,407
I'll wait and see.

22
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,203
Thanks, though.

23
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,673
I've wanted to see the sunrise.

24
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:14,734
It feels like a new beginning.

25
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,393
But I like sunsets more.

26
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:22,646
Sunsets are pretty too,

27
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:26,335
but they can feel sad sometimes.

28
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,619
But once the sun rises, everything lights up

29
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:34,427
it feels like there's hope.

30
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,937
No matter how bad things get,

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,824
you can always start again.

32
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:42,424
What if…

33
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:47,021
What if your family were millionaires?

34
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,720
What if you had a really warm home,

35
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,093
and someone who truly loved you
was waiting for you?

36
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,617
What if you were—

37
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,733
If that's the case, that sounds nice too.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,533
If I really were a millionaire,

39
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:14,098
I'd build schools and charities
for poor kids who love music.

40
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:18,976
But I'm happy with my life now.

41
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,836
Sitting here watching the sunrise
with someone I love—

42
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,773
no money could buy this happiness.

43
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,600
Got it.

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:14,112

Hey, the sun's rising.

57
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,820
Lava, look. It's so beautiful.

58
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,132
Mm. Good morning.

59
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,003
Don't tell Wave.

60
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,715
I mean Prince Davin.

61
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:27,977
But Wave, or Prince Davin, has the right to learn the truth
and know who he really is.

62
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,633
And what do we get from telling him?

63
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,429
Don't forget he is in danger.

64
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,543
Our job is to keep him safe

65
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:37,341
until they send someone to get him.

66
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,307
Don't you dare tell anyone.

67
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:45,568
This stays between you and me.

68
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:58,879
Looking for this?

69
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:01,278
Yeah.

70
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:02,936
You read my mind, huh?

71
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:16,516
I want to do something nice for you too.

72
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:17,298
Thanks.

73
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,366
Mm, it's refreshing!

74
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,198
I think your muscles got bigger.

75
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,095
Yeah, I've been boxing,

76
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:56,529
and also weight training these days.

77
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,970
Still, I don't like you boxing.

78
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,355
I know you want your dad proud,

79
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:10,800
but he wouldn't want you hurt, right?

80
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,481
Don't worry. I'm stronger now.

81
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,949
I even beat Tum today.

82
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:19,711
But others might hit harder than Tum.

83
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:27,288
Here.

84
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:28,962
Sell it.

85
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,241
We can split the money.

86
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,208
You said this watch is expensive, right?

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,494
Use it to buy back your dad's motorbike.

88
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,568
Keep the rest for me.

89
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:46,621
I don't even know how long I'll be stuck here.

90
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,443
You see, no one has come looking for me.

91
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,433
Maybe my family or my loved ones

92
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:01,909
are gone for real.

93
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:09,654
Maybe it's time I start over.

94
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,718
I can't accept it.

95
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,341
I want to stand on my own.

96
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:24,775
That's exactly why I like you.

97
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:46,017
Everything has been settled.

98
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,582
No one will trace it back to you, General.

99
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,615
Great. I can finally take care of the rest.

100
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,957
It's been left too long.

101
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:01,741
You really met Davin?

102
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,914
Yes. He didn't recognize me.

103
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,684
It's probably because you hurt him,
Mr. Victor.

104
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,226
But I've handled both of them,

105
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,776
the prince and his rescuer.

106
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,734
If that's all,
I'll take my leave now, General.

107
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,162
Do you really trust him?

108
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,561
More than you, maybe?

109
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:31,658
I made a mistake,

110
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,465
but I should be the one to end this.

111
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,418
You still have plenty to do.

112
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:37,179
I've planned your future already.

113
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,892
Don't let me down again.

114
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,745
You're still acting normal?

115
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,028
Of course. I'm acting totally normal.

116
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,481
What kind of normal?

117
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:02,956
Normal as in dating him—

118
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,124
I mean, dating the prince.

119
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,667
I feel so uncomfortable.

120
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,835
We're doing this to help,

121
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:11,478
not just him, but his country too.

122
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:12,528
Oh, please.

123
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,679
If he returns home,

124
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:17,419
you'll be the president there.

125
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:22,918
Be honest. You really love him, right?

126
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:23,810
Yeah, I do.

127
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:28,644
So what now?

128
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:35,362
I told you you're asking for trouble.

129
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,939
Then what should I do?

130
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,124
Should I just break up with him?

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,980
Don't you dare.

132
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,876
What reason will you even use?

133
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,243
Just keep playing the island boyfriend.

134
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:46,720
We'll see what happens next.

135
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:49,695
Right now, his safety comes first.

136
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:58,136
FAGGOT

137
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,579
Shit! Who did this?!

138
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,315
Who do you think did this?

139
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:20,710
Probably a rival.

140
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:22,509
They probably saw
Uncle Peng getting popular.

141
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,204
Why are they playing dirty?

142
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,816
Why drag his private life into this?

143
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:32,999
How does having a boyfriend
make him lose?

144
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,163
People on the island seem to like him.

145
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,178
They're okay with him as the resort owner,

146
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,152
but they won't want him to take a big role,

147
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,904
like being the village head
in charge of the island.

148
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:48,336
Does loving a man
make someone less capable of their job?

149
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:52,625
Now I get why Uncle Peng
lives the way he does.

150
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,896
Dad, don't go in. I'll handle it.

151
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:13,242
No. This is humiliation!

152
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,144
Come out and talk now, Peng!

153
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,291
Hellon, Director.

154
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,374
Is something wrong?

155
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,378
No need to pretend to be nice.

156
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,657
You've been seeing my son for a year
behind my back!

157
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:27,353
You totally humiliated me!

158
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:28,857
Dad, let's go back.

159
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:29,872
We'd better talk at home.

160
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:32,685
No. We'll talk here and now!

161
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,466
Otherwise, we won't see each other again! .

162
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,693
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,582
I just thought—

164
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:46,584
Thought what?

165
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:51,640
That I couldn't handle my son dating a man?

166
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,646
Don't think that just because I'm old,
I won't be open to anything.

167
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,009
However my son is,

168
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:04,086
whoever he loves, I'll love them too.

169
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,682
But I'm someone with status in society.

170
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,012
Do you know
what people are gossiping about?

171
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:17,172
The director's son, the young doctor,
got played and slept with by a guy from Bangkok!

172
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,730
That's too much, Dad.

173
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,114
No one's saying that.

174
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,659
I really heard it.

175
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:26,003
But I didn't mean it like that.

176
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,000
Dr. Wut and I truly love each other.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,003
You just talk big!

178
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,291
If you really love my son,
you need to do more for him!

179
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,006
Do you want to marry my son?

180
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:49,956
Yes, I do.

181
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,418
Then here's my offer.

182
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,602
If you win this village head election,

183
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,040
I'll let you marry him.

184
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:09,766
And if I lose?

185
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,245
If you lose,

186
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,650
you and Wut must break up.

187
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,420
Ouch!

188
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:43,359
Are you okay?

189
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:44,973
It's swelling.

190
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,590
It's fine. Just a bit of incense ash.

191
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,708
But it's all red.

192
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,252
Even in the temple, huh?

193
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:24,485
Eh?

194
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,553
Where is Lava, by the way?

195
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:29,899
He probably died pooping.
He's been gone forever.

196
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:37,571
Put some ice on it.

197
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,475
It'll be fine soon.

198
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,576
Where did you get the ice?

199
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:44,743
Outside the temple.

200
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:49,846
Wow, that's so romantic.

201
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,233
Can I get a piece of this moment?

202
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:59,493
- Damn, that's sweet.
- Whoa.

203
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,754
They're super caring for each other.

204
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,505
But don't get too lovey-dovey.
You guys still need to help Peng.

205
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,223
Yeah.

206
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,324
I guess we'll campaign every way we can.

207
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,441
How about this?

208
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:10,988
I'll handle straight guys,

209
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:15,992
songtaew drivers, motorbike taxi guys,
and construction workers.

210
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,351
And I'll focus on women.

211
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,970
I'll get all the nurses to vote for him.

212
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,103
I'll sell the charm of the chief and Dr. Wut
as a ship-style couple,

213
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,082
fighting for their love
against a harsh father-in-law!

214
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,752
Wow, perfect target group.

215
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:31,426
Great job.

216
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,626
What about me? Who is my target?

217
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,756
You only have one target. It's Lava.

218
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:42,030
Whatever you say or do
hits the target anyway.

219
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,687
Are you guys fighting fish or what?

220
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:55,415
Let's do this.

221
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,835
Vote number 5, please!

222
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,240
We'll protect the environment,
promote tourism,

223
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:03,756
and say no to corruption.

224
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,728
Please vote number 5.

225
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:08,272
Vote number 5, Chief Peng Pongsakorn.

226
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:12,831
Give the new generation a chance
to make our island better—

227
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:17,497
economy, nature and happy families!

228
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,835
Where there's water, there's fish.

229
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,181
Where there's a bar, there's booze.

230
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:20,872
Tum!

231
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:22,687
Where there's a field, there's rice!

232
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,192
Kratae, have you ever seen
a rice field on this island?

233
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:26,520
Well, you're right.

234
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,570
Hello, Auntie!

235
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,157
Please vote number 5, Chief Peng.

236
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,681
Let the new gen run the island.

237
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,545
Stop voting for the same old family.
It's outdated.

238
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:37,499
Hey.

239
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,308
Number 5, please.

240
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:39,529
You even said that?

241
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,064
Aren't you breaking the rule?

242
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,773
We have to be direct.

243
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,675
Still, we have to respect
everyone's right to choose.

244
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,826
They'll vote for Uncle Peng anyway, right?

245
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,600
Auntie, vote number 5.

246
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,055
As I told you,
please choose someone new gen
to improve the island.

247
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:54,917
Auntie, please vote number 5.

248
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,904
Vote number 5, please.

249
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,387
- I'll buy them all.
- Thank you.

250
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,693
- Vote number 5, please.
- I'll buy them all!

251
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:03,686
- Vote number 5, please.
- I'll buy from your shop.

252
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:04,496
Ugh, so noisy!

253
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,159
I'm buying stuff.

254
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:08,490
I'd never vote for him.

255
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,300
Eh?

256
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:10,305
Come on, Auntie.

257
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,754
Don't you want to give the new gen
a chance to improve the island?

258
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:17,070
I do, but I don't want
a faggot village head.

259
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:21,008
Men who like men shouldn't have that role.

260
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,589
What's wrong with that, Auntie?

261
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:25,311
What does that have to do
with running the island?

262
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,215
It's a completely separate matter, isn't it?

263
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,594
It's never happened before.

264
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:31,346
Big positions here always
go to men with wives and kids.

265
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:34,117
Those men with wives and kids
are the ones who corrupt.

266
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:37,382
Roads cracked, bridges broken,
trash piled high—

267
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:39,115
all thanks to married men with kids!

268
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:40,223
Don't vote for him.

269
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:44,084
If you do, the island's doomed for sure.

270
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,060
You don't want to vote, fine,

271
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,729
but stop telling others not to.

272
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,520
That's outdated!

273
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,540
It's why this island never grows!

274
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,451
You brat!

275
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,263
Your uncle taught you that mouth?

276
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,093
I don't need anyone to teach me.

277
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:58,968
I already know I have to be mouthy
with a crazy, foul-mouthed person like you!

278
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:02,680
- Auntie, you can't do this!
- Hey, stop!

279
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,374
Peng will never be our village head!

280
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:06,090
And you won't die of old age!

281
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,604
Ahhh!

282
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,500
Stop it!

283
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,659
- Stop already!
- You crazy, foul-mouthed auntie!

284
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,160
Stop it!

285
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:39,553
OUTDATED

286
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:43,723
Hey!

287
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,482
Why did you follow me?

288
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:54,641
If I didn't, I wouldn't see
you risking Uncle Peng's disqualification!.

289
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:57,349
They played dirty too.

290
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:58,415
And nothing happens to them.

291
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,659
Still, we have to do things right.

292
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:02,543
Even if they cheat,

293
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:04,608
we shouldn't stoop to that.

294
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:09,529
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

295
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:11,683
But I believe in fair play.

296
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:15,883
If we win, we'll be proud we've done it clean.

297
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:20,123
If we lose, at least we've tried our best.

298
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,240
Don't do this again, okay?

299
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:38,260
I was worried.

300
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:41,362
I worry about you too.

301
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,165
Don't worry about me.

302
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:45,760
I can take care of myself.

303
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,246
I'm more worried you'll be in danger.

304
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,497
And what is the difference between us?

305
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:53,060
Why?

306
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,415
Can't you be shot? Can't you be stabbed?

307
00:22:57,807 --> 00:22:58,391
Forget about it.

308
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,592
Just don't go anywhere alone again.

309
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:05,297
I'll be with you all the time, day and night.

310
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,565
Hey, that's a bit too much.

311
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:09,702
You're acting like my bodyguard.

312
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,735
That's because I'm your boyfriend.

313
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:25,728
Let's go home.

314
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,921
I like it when you're stubborn,

315
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:40,849
but next time, tell me first.

316
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,446
I want to be stubborn with you.

317
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,125
Alright, my boyfriend.

318
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,900
Let's go.

319
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,090
Wait.

320
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:17,151
The world needs love.

321
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:20,270
Let's go home.

322
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,970
Hello everyone.

323
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,300
ELECTION SPEECH
BANGSAWAN ISLAND HEAD
I'm Chettha, number 2.

324
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:49,714
Please vote for me
to be your village head.

325
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,759
My family has always served this community,

326
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,494
as headmen, subdistrict chiefs,
and village officers.

327
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:00,915
I think our island has come so far.

328
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:10,080
Let's not let an outsider,
who is abnormal, tarnish our home!

329
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,926
CHETTHA IS THE ANSWER
TO PROGRESS.

330
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:20,069
- Number 2! Number 2! Number 2!
- Number 2! Number 2! Number 2!

331
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,036
Are you okay, uncle?

332
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:24,379
I'm fine.

333
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,654
Don't mind what they say.

334
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,604
People will always talk.

335
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:31,583
We're here to sell policies, not dreams

336
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,533
You think that's enough?

337
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,412
I'm going to the bathroom.

338
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,220
What do we do?

339
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,983
I'm worried he'll mess up.

340
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,301
He's probably stressed from all the gossip.

341
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,971
He's sweating and his hands are shaking.

342
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,869
If he freezes up there,
he'll lose credibility with the locals.

343
00:25:57,642 --> 00:25:59,811
I think it's better to withdraw for now.

344
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:00,939
Let's say he's got an upset stomach.

345
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,345
No way.

346
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:06,442
There must be a better way.

347
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:07,397
Like what?

348
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:24,506
Are you sure this is a good idea?

349
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,690
We won't know until we try.

350
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:29,183
Fine, let's do it. Come on.

351
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,629
My policy is to develop our economy
alongside preserving nature.

352
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,850
We'll maintain the island's tradition.

353
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,255
We can grow without losing who we are.

354
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:06,205
We'll open for tourism, for parties,

355
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:11,301
but we must..

356
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,854
We must preserve...

357
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,398
We must preserve the environment...

358
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:23,447
We'll…

359
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,174
We'll…

360
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,486
That's all for now. Please vote for number 5.

361
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:51,328
Wait, wait!

362
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,855
Uncle Peng, hold on!

363
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:58,988
Everyone, it's not over yet!

364
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:00,456
Please listen to my uncle!
There's more!

365
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:02,848
Lava, what are you doing?

366
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:03,864
Give me the mic!

367
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,247
Hurry!

368
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:21,077
Everyone, my uncle isn't someone
who brags about himself.

369
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:23,976
If I say it, you'll think I'm exaggerating,

370
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,832
so I'll let people
who've worked with him speak instead.

371
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:27,912
Please come in.

372
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:39,212
Uncle.

373
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:41,496
Uncle, please talk.

374
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,628
Sure.

375
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:51,894
Mr. Peng was the one
who started inviting tourists to the island.

376
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:54,935
They also help collect trash
and protect our island.

377
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,184
Chief gives jobs to locals everywhere,

378
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:12,447
even to people no one else would hire,
like heavily pregnant women.

379
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:20,665
I used to be a drug addict.

380
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:24,148
I had no future, dropped out of school.

381
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:28,203
He was the only one who gave me a chance.

382
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:31,990
He got me a job, helped me quit drug,

383
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,447
sent me back to school,

384
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,383
and changed my life.

385
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:39,603
Now I have a goal.

386
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,309
I'll become a 100-million-follower influencer!

387
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:57,500
The chance I got from Uncle Peng
is the chance to keep living.

388
00:29:58,058 --> 00:29:59,727
I don't even know who I am
and where I came from,

389
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,865
but he opened his heart
and welcomed me into his family,

390
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:07,242
so that I could have a new life.

391
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,971
He never asked for anything in return

392
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:14,880
I've seen how hard he works

393
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:19,410
and how he never judges anyone
by gender or education.

394
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:23,865
His personal life doesn't make him
less capable.

395
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,200
But it makes him stronger

396
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:30,001
because he's had to fight for acceptance.

397
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:35,020
So please, give Uncle Peng the chance
to give this island a new life

398
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:39,283
like he gave me mine.

399
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:46,667
This is 10 out of 10!

400
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:48,348
We have to vote number 5.

401
00:30:52,213 --> 00:31:11,392
- Number 5! Number 5! Number 5!
- Number 5! Number 5! Number 5!

402
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:12,380
This was your doing, huh?

403
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,084
It's the prince's idea.

404
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:53,772
You're smoking again?

405
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:01,371
Hey, what are you doing?

406
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,602
Don't smoke. It's bad for you.

407
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:12,408
If it's bad, then why do you still smoke?

408
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:18,498
You know what? I hate the smell.

409
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:24,346
But I let it go because it's you.

410
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,163
I can quit for you.

411
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:35,868
Don't do it for me.

412
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:38,792
Do it for yourself.

413
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:44,436
You should care about yourself more.

414
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,353
You always act like
you don't care about anyone,

415
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:50,180
but deep down,

416
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,578
you really care about others' feelings.

417
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,655
Since I got here,

418
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,243
I've seen you do more for others
than for yourself.

419
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,564
I'm not that good.

420
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,651
I'm just saying what I feel.

421
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:17,544
If Uncle Peng doesn't win, what do we do?

422
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,760
He'll win. I believe that.

423
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:27,786
It'd be awful, right?

424
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,662
Loving each other that much

425
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,369
but not being able to stay together.

426
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:38,294
Love is so hard

427
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,933
even though it's supposed to be
just between two people.

428
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,169
Take it easy, Tum!

429
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:22,190
Running away, huh?

430
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,097
Kratae, can you grab me
some soap or lotion?

431
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,357
Okay, okay.

432
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:00,770
Poor Wave, man.

433
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,486
It's that bad, huh?

434
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:08,474
Take it slow.

435
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:15,263
Yay! Nice job, Lava!

436
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:17,607
You look like Cinderella.

437
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,202
Come on, keep playing.

438
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,635
Keep playing!

439
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:33,813
You're covered in powder like a dog.

440
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,048
I want some, too.

441
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,024
I just didn't want anyone else touching you.

442
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:47,826
Hey, stop!

443
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:49,411
I don't want to play. Songkran's over!

444
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:50,179
No way.

445
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:51,610
You rushed me back,

446
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,734
so you have to keep playing with me.

447
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,046
Come on, I was just worried
you'd hurt your feet.

448
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,018
Your shoes were biting.

449
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,008
Don't be dramatic.

450
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,589
I haven't had enough fun yet.

451
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:03,945
So…

452
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,146
Oh yeah? You asked for it!

453
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:10,438
Take this!

454
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:14,763
Come here!

455
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:17,495
Stop it!

456
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:18,630
Hey!

457
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,155
Shit, my bag!

458
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:23,441
Jay!

459
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,938
When did you get here?
Why didn't you tell me?

460
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,629
I wanted to surprise you.

461
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,766
And yeah, damn surprise!

462
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:36,051
My bag's soaked.

463
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

464
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:45,887
Wave, this is Jay,

465
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,080
my friend from Bangkok.

466
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:51,537
And this is Wave….

467
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:56,791
He's my friend.

468
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:00,938
Hi.

469
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:04,837
Hey.

470
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:08,416
I came for the party. Take me around.

471
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:10,864
I work all the time.

472
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,160
I don't really go out.

473
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,391
Come on, man.

474
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,464
I came all this way. Let's make it epic.

475
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:19,806
Come on.

476
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,654
Why didn't you tell him I'm your boyfriend?

477
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,048
I didn't want to answer his questions.

478
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:30,963
He asks a lot.

479
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:33,983
No matter what he asks,
I can answer everything.

480
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:37,992
I don't want us to be “friends” one day
and “boyfriends” the next.

481
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:42,077
Our status should stay the same,
no matter who's around.

482
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,399
My apologies, Your Highness.

483
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:48,487
I won't upset you again.

484
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,699
What are you saying?

485
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:53,699
I'm just teasing.

486
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:59,461
Then can I come with you tonight?

487
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:04,231
No. You don't like drinking or parties.

488
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:05,319
You won't have fun.

489
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:08,544
It's not your thing.

490
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,887
But this island's famous for its parties.

491
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:12,578
I've never been to one.

492
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:14,875
You can't come.

493
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,529
There're too many drunk people.
It's dangerous.

494
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:22,987
Why are you so overprotective lately?

495
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,469
Whatever I want to do,

496
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:28,059
you always find a reason to stop me.

497
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,431
Even if we're dating,

498
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,692
you can't control my life.

499
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,316
I'm just worried about you.

500
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:59,580
Then keep me in your sight all the time.
Wouldn't that be better?

501
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,997
Whoa!

502
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,219
Cheers!

503
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:24,539
Yeah!

504
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,256
How do I look?

505
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:38,733
Handsome, but something's missing.

506
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:40,407
What's missing?

507
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:12,287
Are you drunk yet?

508
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,294
Not yet.

509
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,156
I still want to have fun with you.

510
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,664
And I want your friend to like me.

511
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:21,957
No need. He's only here for a little while.

512
00:40:21,957 --> 00:40:23,178
He's leaving soon anyway.

513
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:24,097
No way.

514
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:27,758
I want my boyfriend's friend to like me.

515
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,077
Fine, whatever.

516
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,963
But if you want to leave, just tell me.

517
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,886
I'll take you home.

518
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:36,301
I told you not to act like my bodyguard.

519
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:38,743
Just act like my boyfriend.

520
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,704
Easy! That hurts.

521
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:44,020
You're too cute.

522
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:47,243
Come here.

523
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:16,949
Hey, Lava.

524
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,079
I just saw Wave kiss your cheek.

525
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,204
Are you sure you're just friends?

526
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:23,485
He's not a friend.

527
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:25,115
He's my boyfriend.

528
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,247
Okay, okay.

529
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,208
That's it.

530
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,891
I didn't expect your type to be like that.

531
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:35,744
He's exactly my type,
both looks and personality.

532
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:37,243
Really?

533
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:40,357
I remember
your one-night stands weren't like this.

534
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:43,505
Hey, come on.

535
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:45,229
People change, man.

536
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:46,187
I've changed.

537
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,340
Okay, fine.

538
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,042
Hey, Lava, do you want to try?

539
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,344
It's got a great vibe.

540
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:59,163
No, I'll just drink. I'll get drunk anyway.
You go ahead.

541
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,406
Come on, just a bit!

542
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:01,072
Come.

543
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:02,407
No, Jay, stop.

544
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:03,968
Hey.

545
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:06,775
You bastard!

546
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,701
It's gone. You have to pay for it.

547
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:09,966
For what?

548
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,826
That's drugs. Should I call the cops?

549
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:13,993
Are you threatening me, huh?

550
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:14,713
Hey!

551
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,667
Don't touch my boyfriend.

552
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:21,139
You'd choose your new boyfriend
over your friend of four years?

553
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,828
It doesn't matter how long.

554
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:25,319
He makes my life better. Got it?

555
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,267
You're not fun anymore, man.

556
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,036
I shouldn't have come.

557
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:29,826
Shit.

558
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:37,320
Let's go.

559
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:49,971
I'm sorry you fought with your friend
because of me.

560
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:52,357
It's fine.

561
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,163
Jay's always been like that.

562
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:02,047
I just don't want you using drugs.

563
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:03,744
I'm not.

564
00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:06,200
Don't you trust me?

565
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:15,777
I don't want that life anymore—

566
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:18,953
drinking hard, acting out to hurt my mom,

567
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:22,207
doing everything to show her
I was in pain after I was abandoned.

568
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:26,888
I got to a point
where I didn't care about myself.

569
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,025
And she still didn't care either.

570
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:33,299
That kind of life…

571
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:37,973
was meaningless.

572
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:44,067
I like seeing you
when you're vulnerable like this.

573
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,124
You're the only one
who gets to see me like this.

574
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:57,547
I'm sorry.

575
00:44:57,993 --> 00:44:59,420
I drank too much last night.

576
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,732
Tell Wave I'm sorry too.

577
00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:04,933
He's not mad at you.

578
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,297
Can I ask you something?

579
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:09,147
Who is he, anyway?

580
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,480
How did he change you this much?

581
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:16,807
He's a prince.

582
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,940
I saved him on the beach.

583
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,940
Huh? Asshole!

584
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,754
I'm asking nicely here.

585
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,675
You sound like you're in a mermaid movie.

586
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,009
Eh? I'm serious.

587
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:27,322
Believe it or not.

588
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:29,738
Well, enjoy your life with your prince then.

589
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,698
If you're ever back in Bangkok,
you can stay at my place.

590
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:37,356
Not anytime soon.

591
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:38,813
I've got an important job.

592
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:41,333
What is it?

593
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,295
Taking care of my prince.

594
00:45:53,552 --> 00:45:55,229
Lava!

595
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,280
You got this, Lava!

596
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:05,221
Go, go!

597
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,156
Hit him!

598
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:26,257
Punch!

599
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,727
Go, go!

600
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:53,022
Yay!

601
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,887
If Tum hadn't told me,

602
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:14,947
I'd never know you box.

603
00:47:15,705 --> 00:47:16,949
I didn't want to stress you out.

604
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:18,475
You're busy with the election.

605
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:19,882
I can multitask.

606
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:20,717
Don't worry.

607
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:24,786
And if you need money for that motorbike,
you can tell me.

608
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:26,315
I can lend it.

609
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:28,525
No need.

610
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,510
Winning this way feels more satisfying.

611
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:33,089
Save your money for your wedding.

612
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:37,024
I don't know if there'll even be one.

613
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:39,718
You've got to fight for it.

614
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:40,659
Go for it.

615
00:47:43,913 --> 00:47:48,071
But I didn't know
you were this good at boxing.

616
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:52,303
I'm hurting, you know.

617
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,533
I've been keeping fit.

618
00:47:57,756 --> 00:48:00,737
I have to be ready to be
Prince Davin's royal guard.

619
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:03,390
How are you feeling these days?

620
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,266
Awful.

621
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,177
I feel uncomfortable having to lie to him.

622
00:48:08,113 --> 00:48:09,124
I get it.

623
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:10,801
You've already fallen for him.

624
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:11,921
It's hard to let go.

625
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:14,067
Can't I just not let go?

626
00:48:15,984 --> 00:48:17,354
How?

627
00:48:18,335 --> 00:48:19,571
Do you think it's possible?

628
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,553
You're just an ordinary guy.

629
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:23,089
He's even a prince.

630
00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:27,128
But they'll come for him soon.

631
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,017
I want you to be ready for that, okay?

632
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,141
Who'd believe it, right?

633
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,893
My boyfriend is a prince.

634
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:42,442
Prince Davin of Arantha.

635
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:12,873
What did you say?

636
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:18,796
I'm a prince?

637
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:33,800
Everything you've heard from Mr. Peng
and Mr. Lava is true, Your Highness.

638
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:37,822
You're Prince Davin Evarech Delloy
of Arantha,

639
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:40,273
the next heir to the throne of Arantha.

640
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,143
Then who are you?

641
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:47,933
Aren't you Natee?

642
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:50,977
I'm sorry for lying, Your Highness.

643
00:49:51,913 --> 00:49:53,131
My name is Paolo.

644
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:55,360
I'm a royal guard of Arantha.

645
00:49:55,767 --> 00:50:00,176
Princess Anya sent me to the island
to make sure you were safe.

646
00:50:04,589 --> 00:50:05,901
Please help my brother.

647
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:10,058
What about my family?

648
00:50:10,794 --> 00:50:13,178
They're still being held captive,

649
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:14,506
but don't worry.

650
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:17,701
I'm following Princess Anya's orders,

651
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,815
and they'll soon be free.

652
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:28,197
You're not just teaming up
to play a joke on me, are you?

653
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,785
Everything I said is true.

654
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:39,058
For now, please stay where you are.

655
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,384
I trust that Mr. Peng and Mr. Lava
will take good care of you.

656
00:51:23,698 --> 00:51:25,253
How long have you known about this?

657
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,025
For two or three weeks.

658
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:30,448
Then why didn't you tell me?

659
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:33,760
Paolo told me not to. It's for your safety.

660
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:35,704
So everything that happened…

661
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,292
you lied to me, didn't you?

662
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:40,315
That's not true, Your Highness.

663
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:41,098
Then explain it to me.

664
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:43,831
Taking care of me,

665
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:46,920
being nice to me,

666
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:51,358
being my boyfriend,

667
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,325
making me fall in love with you—

668
00:51:55,484 --> 00:51:56,815
were they all orders too?

669
00:51:59,824 --> 00:52:00,897
Was any of it real?

670
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:02,246
Please, Your Highness, listen to me.

671
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:03,152
I'm not a prince!

672
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:06,511
I'm Wave.

673
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:09,777
Even if you tell me who I am,

674
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:12,309
I still can't remember anything.

675
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:15,235
No matter what, I'm Wave,

676
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,614
Nava Mahasamut.

677
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:24,511
Or what?

678
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:30,540
Someone came up with that name
for me too?

679
00:52:32,747 --> 00:52:33,802
I came up with it myself.

680
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:36,955
I don't even know what to believe anymore!

681
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:42,377
Losing my memory hurt enough,

682
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,080
but now this hurts even more.

683
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,440
Your… Your Highness,
please hear me out.

684
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,462
I'm telling the truth.

685
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:39,249
You're a prince. How could you do this?

686
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,794
I never wanted to be a prince.

687
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:42,775
I'd rather be Wave.

688
00:53:43,047 --> 00:53:44,646
From now on, there'll be no hiding.

689
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:46,943
We'll love each other openly. Everyone on the island will know.

690
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:49,944
Mom!

691
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:51,262
Who's this?

692
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,357
I promise, no matter what happens,

693
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,542
I'll do everything to stay with you, my boyfriend.

694
00:53:57,765 --> 00:53:59,407
I promise too.
