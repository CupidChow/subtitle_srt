Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,552
Can you keep a secret, Victor?

5
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:22,555
You can trust me.

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,052
I'll run away to travel in Thailand.

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,258
Why do you always cause trouble, huh?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,247
I'll send you to your uncle
in the south for three months.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,797
If you know you get seasick,
take a motion sickness pill beforehand.

10
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:34,342
No free ride here.

11
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,925
Even if you're my nephew,

12
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:37,177
you'll have to work.

13
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,671
Help! Someone's drowning.

14
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,378
You want me to take care of him?

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,609
Let him stay for now.

16
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,715
I'll name you… Wave.

17
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:44,900
Ouch!

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,455
I'll hurry you up to remember who you are.

19
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,398
Then I'll finally be free of this burden.

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,037
May I?
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

21
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:52,942
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

22
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:56,710
Excuse me.

23
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:58,020
May I ask you something?

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,680
Of course.

25
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:02,698
Is it true that
there's a party on the island tonight?

26
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,322
Every full moon,
there's a party that goes on until dawn.

27
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:06,645
There's also a fireworks show.

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,773
Very beautiful.

29
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:09,142
Really?

30
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,227
I'd love to see the fireworks.

31
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:13,271
You can watch from the hotel's front beach.

32
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,429
But for the best view,

33
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:17,466
I recommend paddling out
to the middle of the sea.

34
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,190
It's not far, and the vibes are super romantic.

35
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,879
Sure.

36
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:22,944
I'd like to go.

37
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,404
I can arrange a boat for you, sir.

38
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,493
Perfect.

39
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,750
I don't know when
I'll get a chance like this again.

40
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:30,822
Are you sure?

41
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:33,200
The ocean at night can be frightening.

42
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:34,826
I want to.

43
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,034
No one can object to you anyway.

44
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,685
Let's do as he said.

45
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,225
Hey.

46
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,564
Nothing's gonna come out
and bite me, right?

47
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:57,953
No.

48
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,730
And if something does, I'll chase it away.

49
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:05,036
Having time to myself like this…

50
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:06,917
it's pretty great.

51
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,326
It makes me realize… where I belong.

52
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:21,072
But you still have to go back to
being the prince of Arantha.

53
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,114
I know.

54
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,065
But sometimes I wonder…

55
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,220
If I could live a different life,

56
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:35,789
to experience love like ordinary people do—

57
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,627
a love I don't have to hide,

58
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:44,286
free from duty or family expectations,

59
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,748
a love where I can hold someone's hand

60
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,904
without caring what others might think…

61
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,540
would that ever be possible?

62
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,427
Of course, it's possible.

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,707
You don't have to cheer me up.

64
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:08,573
I know…

65
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:12,005
I have to return to reality.

66
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,094
Beautiful, isn't it?

67
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:29,436
Thank you for bringing me this far.

68
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:32,768
Ahem!

69
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:37,580
Wake up.

70
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,083
Get up.

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,007
I said get up. Up!

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,774
Why didn't you knock
before entering the room?

73
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,315
This is my room.

74
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,605
Well, most of what's in here
barely belongs to me now.

75
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:53,062
You took my bed.

76
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:54,582
You took my clothes.

77
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,543
When your memories come back,
I expect back pay.

78
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:58,782
Are you done talking?

79
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:00,645
I will rest.

80
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,649
Get up! Don't.

81
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,365
Go shower and change.

82
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,114
I've got a whole day planned.

83
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,149
I don't wear unwashed clothes.

84
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,683
Bring me fresh ones.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,275
I'm not your servant.

86
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,600
Can't you at least help, though?

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,633
Underwear as well.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,884
Just turn it inside out.

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,752
Unhygienic.

90
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,304
Then don't wear any.

91
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:26,804
Hey.

92
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,477
I'm not leaving the house without underwear.

93
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,420
Are they new?

94
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,711
They're mine.

95
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,279
I don't share underwear.

96
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,009
Who knows what they've been through?

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,425
Then just go commando
and let your balls scratch your thighs.

98
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:03,207
Hey!

99
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,483
Wave!

100
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:05,721
Wave!

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,918
What the heck are you doing?

102
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,108
MARY JANE

103
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:12,645
Mary Jane?

104
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:14,307
Using or selling?

105
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,676
Don't you have better clothes?

106
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:21,028
What did you pick for me?

107
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,585
You have no taste.

108
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,837
It suits you fine.

109
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,598
What were you doing anyway?

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,155
You took all the time in the world.

111
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,274
Get in.

112
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,244
Why don't you move?

113
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,541
Open the door for me.

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,294
Do I have to roll out a red carpet too?

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,105
Fine, I will just carry you.

116
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:41,820
Don't.

117
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:45,403
I don't like being touched.

118
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:01,691
That's it.

119
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:02,864
Roll up the window.

120
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,960
Can you do anything yourself at all?

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,569
Are you always such a fussy person?

122
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,459
I became one once you moved in.

123
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,588
Are these clothes even clean?

124
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,784
What the hell are you saying?

125
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,130
The shop owner will smack you for that.

126
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:21,074
Well, it's true.

127
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,927
They smell musty. They might have germs.

128
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:26,323
You don't know anything.

129
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,583
It's called a ‘vintage' smell.

130
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,937
These have value, you know?

131
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,407
Each piece has a story.

132
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:36,946
They have history.

133
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,679
Most of them came from dead bodies.

134
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:43,393
Really?

135
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,882
The one you're holding still has blood stains.

136
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,822
The former owner was a nightclub musician.

137
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,922
He was riding a bike to pick up his lover.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,758
But then he got hit by a ten-wheeler. Bang!

139
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,362
Dead on the spot.

140
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,169
As for this one,

141
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,740
the former owner was a handsome guy.

142
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,983
He's on his way to surprise his lover.

143
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,696
While he was running there,

144
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,321
a heart attack hit.

145
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,336
Thump, thump, thump.

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,415
Dead on the spot.

147
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:27,155
His hand was still clutching the shirt.

148
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:30,830
I don't believe in ghosts.

149
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,030
Don't fool me.

150
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,545
It won't hurt to believe.

151
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,610
Careful.

152
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,717
Slip it on,

153
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,977
and the owner might come looking for it.

154
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:42,781
Brr!

155
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,658
Bro.

156
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,633
Watch your mouth,

157
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,693
or you will become a ghost yourself.

158
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,571
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:59,128
Goodbye.

160
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,571
I want this one.

161
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,770
It's firsthand.

162
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,252
We don't have enough money.

163
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:11,745
But I want this one.

164
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,025
Uncle Peng gave us a limited budget.

165
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,036
Pick from these secondhand racks.

166
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:17,552
You will get plenty.

167
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:22,593
Didn't you just say
those clothes are haunted?

168
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,832
I want new clothes,

169
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:26,897
so I won't be haunted.

170
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:28,749
Think you're smart, huh?

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,680
Fine.

172
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:32,342
I'll advance it.

173
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,310
But you have to work to pay me back.

174
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,580
No using your amnesia as an excuse.

175
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,618
You've got hands and feet.

176
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:39,924
Fine.

177
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,323
Then we'll shop more.

178
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,863
I don't know how long I have to stay here.

179
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:48,947
I'll work to pay you off later.

180
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:52,013
I'll take this one, this one, and this one.

181
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,188
This one, too.

182
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:55,064
Hey, easy there. Wait, wait.

183
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:56,123
This one looks nice too.

184
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,111
I'm buying it.

185
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,680
You're shopping like a billionaire's kid.

186
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,815
Don't forget to pay.

187
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:08,881
Thank you.

188
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:36,507
I'd like everyone to be careful
and check for Influenza A.

189
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,155
It's spreading widely right now.

190
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,456
You'll each receive a leaflet.

191
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,712
Please check yourself.

192
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,043
How's your sore throat?

193
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:45,991
It's better now.

194
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:46,742
It is?

195
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,504
Did you take the medicine I prescribed?

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,408
I did.

197
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,219
Great.

198
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:52,129
Take precautions, okay?

199
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,136
The flu is spreading.

200
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,366
I'm thinking about getting an injection.

201
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:55,462
Come get one with me.

202
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:55,981
Sure.

203
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,116
Here, Doctor.

204
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,644
Let me help.

205
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,038
Did you hand them all out?

206
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:08,807
Have you got the document?

207
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,070
Have you got one?

208
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,870
Here you go.

209
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,236
Doctor Wut,

210
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:27,276
would you like to join us for a meal?

211
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,566
We're having Som Tum afterward.

212
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,978
I think I'll pass.

213
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,165
After I'm done here,
I've got something else to do.

214
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:35,505
Okay then.

215
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,071
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.

216
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:38,864
See you.

217
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:40,293
Let's go.

218
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:41,940
I'm starving.

219
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,363
My boyfriend is amazing.

220
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,547
Are you tired today?

221
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:03,878
Not too tired.

222
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,877
I just wanted people to listen
and follow my suggestions.

223
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,676
Don't you have work to do?

224
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,092
Work can wait.

225
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,110
Guarding my boyfriend is more important.

226
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,008
You're cute and smart. I'm possessive.

227
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,242
If anyone tries to hit on you,

228
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,798
they'll end up as shark food.

229
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:22,992
Oh, please.

230
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,200
You don't have to do that much.

231
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,695
Dating like normal people is enough for me.

232
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,184
There.

233
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:32,945
You said that again.

234
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,411
Well, we could get married now.

235
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,416
No one would even criticize.

236
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,666
You're the only one holding out.

237
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,064
From what you said,

238
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,671
do you want me to
go ask your parents already?

239
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,886
Will the dowry be high?

240
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,767
I'm smart. Of course it'll be high.

241
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,483
No matter how high, I can pay.

242
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,665
Are you ready to get married?

243
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,559
Should we do it? Hm?

244
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,091
Can you really pay?

245
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:03,728
Mm.

246
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:04,874
Just carry these for me.

247
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,194
Hey, Doc. They're heavy.

248
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,019
Come. We still have work to do.

249
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,915
The laundry machine is over there.

250
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:19,885
Wash clothes, towels, and bedsheets.

251
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,515
How do you use it?

252
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,285
Just read the instructions.

253
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
Gosh, how will you earn a living
with skills like yours?

254
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,917
Do I have to wash your underwear?

255
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,044
Yeah.

256
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,353
Why? Are you disgusted?

257
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,196
It's something you've got too.

258
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,620
Well…

259
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,549
You should wash your own.

260
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:50,510
Underwear is personal.

261
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm too lazy. That's why I hired you.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,291
I ran out of clean underwear.

263
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,385
Right now, I feel so airy down there.

264
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:58,320
How comfortable.

265
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,499
By the way,

266
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,630
underwear should be hand-washed.

267
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:21,806
Machine-washing will stretch the waistband.

268
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,960
There aren't many choices in labor work.

269
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,550
You should learn that.

270
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,596
Yippee!

271
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,366
Did you wash it by hand
or with a jackhammer?

272
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,801
I saw your underwear was dirty,

273
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,277
so I kindly scrubbed it with a brush for you.

274
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,007
Sorry, though.

275
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:22,091
I couldn't control the scrubbing speed.

276
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,149
And why are my shirts all dyed like this?

277
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,517
Didn't you separate whites from colors?

278
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:31,890
Did I have to?

279
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,245
I didn't know that.

280
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,638
Thought it was fine to wash them together.

281
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,276
Home Economics 101,
didn't you attend this class?

282
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,153
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,176
I've never been a laborer before.

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,801
What a waste.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,749
Hey!

286
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:57,334
The barnacles have been there
for a hundred years.

287
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,741
Use some energy.

288
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:03,054
Gosh, you're so fragile.

289
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,451
Give it here. I'll do it.

290
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,419
Damn it. You're useless.

291
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:10,671
See? How hard can it be, Wave?

292
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,069
See? Look.

293
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:14,846
See?

294
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:15,616
Do you get it?

295
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,489
Just scrape, scrape, scrape.

296
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:20,151
Can't you do it?

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,369
It's not hard at all.

298
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,419
Gosh.

299
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,920
Scrub the boat with a sponge.

300
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,082
Come on, why so slow?

301
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,623
Do it quickly. Be more active than this.

302
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,832
Do you even know how to do anything at all?

303
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,258
Let go.

304
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,412
This is so easy.

305
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,059
Is it too hard to get? Just wipe left, then right.

306
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,498
Left, right, left, right.

307
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:06,911
Who are you exactly?

308
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,790
You can't even do something this simple.

309
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,266
What are you going to do in life?

310
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,355
How useless of you.

311
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,599
Hey!

312
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,438
Sorry.

313
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,160
My mistake.

314
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:33,681
Gosh. What the hell?

315
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,035
Hey!

316
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,051
That's marijuana.

317
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:04,190
It's a drug.

318
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,694
It's not a drug.

319
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,050
It's just an herb.

320
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,303
It's bad for your health anyway.

321
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,548
And I'll damage your brain.

322
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,459
You know it all, huh?

323
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:22,619
What are you, a doctor?

324
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:29,909
And don't tell Uncle Peng I smoke weed.

325
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:33,452
If you do, you're dead.

326
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,013
Just go on with the housework.

327
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,789
Ugh! It stinks.

328
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:22,706
Wave!

329
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:30,417
Wave!

330
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,739
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

331
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:37,009
This is Uncle Peng's collectible.

332
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:41,446
Can I buy him a new one?

333
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:43,486
Where would you get the money?

334
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:46,572
From the work I do for you.

335
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,068
Work?

336
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,550
You can't even do laundry properly,

337
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,700
and now you broke this vase.

338
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,982
No money for you.

339
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,103
Hey, it's not fair.

340
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:59,082
People like you
are the cause of labor problems.

341
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,360
You're a terrible employer.

342
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,583
You made me work for free. It's exploitation.

343
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,170
When did I ever exploit you?

344
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,582
You dropped this yourself.

345
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,476
Why weren't you careful while cleaning?

346
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,116
I will tell Uncle Peng.

347
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:09,959
Go ahead.

348
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,291
He'll roast you for breaking his vase.

349
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,613
Then I'll just say I'm sick.

350
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,856
Uncle Peng is reasonable.

351
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,257
He should forgive me.

352
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:25,308
And I'll tell him you smoke marijuana.

353
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:28,458
While I was doing housework,

354
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,960
you were doing drugs.

355
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,414
It's an herb.

356
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,262
Yeah?

357
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,661
But I don't think Uncle Peng will buy that.

358
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,496
He'll think you're so high

359
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:42,080
you've lost your senses.

360
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,160
You want a problem with me?

361
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:54,846
I won't put up with you anymore.

362
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,251
I'm going back to Bangkok.

363
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,508
It should be better than
taking care of an amnesia patient like you.

364
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:46,509
Where are you going?

365
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:47,956
Back to Bangkok.

366
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:48,990
You can't.

367
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,497
I command you to stay here.

368
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,480
Who are you, my parents?

369
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,759
Or my wife?

370
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,381
Move, or I'll miss my boat.

371
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:57,286
No.

372
00:23:59,462 --> 00:23:59,976
Move.

373
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:00,715
No.

374
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:02,497
Move! Wave!

375
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:03,071
Shit.

376
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:06,579
My phone!

377
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:09,709
Go get it back.

378
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:10,424
No.

379
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,471
Go.

380
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:12,224
No.

381
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:13,710
Who told you to run away from me?

382
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,160
You dropped it, so you have to pick it up.

383
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,947
I'm not doing it.

384
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:18,003
It's your stuff. Do it yourself.

385
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,040
I don't want to get wet.

386
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,916
I told you to jump.

387
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,575
No.

388
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:21,075
Jump!

389
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:21,575
No!

390
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,163
Fine. You won't jump?

391
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:22,982
So what?

392
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:23,613
You won't jump?

393
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,460
Hey!

394
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:25,686
You!

395
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:28,525
I'm gonna show you what I'm capable of.

396
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:29,636
No!

397
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,235
Get my phone.

398
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,776
If you don't, I'll push you back down.

399
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,269
Don't stall.

400
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,508
No tricks. Give it.

401
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:07,551
Give me that, damn it.

402
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,548
Shit!

403
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:13,437
Wave!

404
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:15,382
How do I go home now?

405
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,521
I told you, you can't leave.

406
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,512
My order is final.

407
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,581
So defiant, aren't you?

408
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,334
Huh?

409
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,015
What the hell are you guys doing?

410
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:47,249
I want to go back to Bangkok, Uncle.

411
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,245
I don't want to be here.

412
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:52,380
What were you thinking, making me
take care of someone with no memory?

413
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:58,074
I knew you wouldn't last long,
just like your mom predicted.

414
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:02,246
Tum and I even made a bet on
whether you'd last more than a month here.

415
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:04,157
What did Mom say?

416
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,554
Your mom is still hopeful.

417
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,499
She wants you to do better,

418
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:10,851
to not cause problems.

419
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,398
But from the first week you got here,

420
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,282
I knew you couldn't bear it.

421
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:19,090
Sorry for trusting Wave with you.

422
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,073
You can't even take care of yourself.

423
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,202
You can't take care of anyone.

424
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,470
You can't go back to your own house.

425
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,091
You have to crash at your friend's.

426
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:33,696
Didn't you run away
from my grandparents' house too?

427
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:41,359
When you've made it big like me,
then you can talk back.

428
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,782
You can let him go, Uncle Peng.

429
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:49,279
I can go back to the hospital.

430
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,390
Don't, Wave.

431
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:51,633
You stay.

432
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:53,795
If anyone wants to leave, let them.

433
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,573
I'll look after you until you find your relatives.

434
00:26:57,012 --> 00:26:59,605
Someone like me
doesn't abandon things halfway.

435
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,339
If I help, I help all the way through.

436
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:05,319
We shouldn't have been born
if we can't help others.

437
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,556
You're nothing like your dad.

438
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,262
Why would you mention my dad?

439
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,917
Because your dad was kind.

440
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,599
He loved helping people.

441
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,162
I just don't see any of that in you.

442
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:33,479
Come on, I'll drop you off.

443
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:37,859
Wave, get his suitcase.

444
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:40,363
Repay him for saving your life.

445
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,917
Don't.

446
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,068
I know you're only saying that
to give me a nudge.

447
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,369
Wow!

448
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,256
The ride is awesome, Dad.

449
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:32,200
And one day, it will be yours.

450
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,826
Ride it with someone you like.

451
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,923
It's so romantic.

452
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,183
Roger that.

453
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,063
If I have someone,

454
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,411
I will come take this bike immediately.

455
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,296
Look.

456
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:46,676
My baby.

457
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:03,231
Hey.

458
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:09,816
I'm sorry for breaking your phone.

459
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:12,814
It's fine.

460
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,936
I have a way to get a new one.

461
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,424
I don't want to be a burden.

462
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,329
I'll find evidence as quickly as I can.

463
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,038
Yeah.

464
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:36,245
Can you take me to
the beach where you found me?

465
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:39,014
It might help me remember something.

466
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,392
Fine.

467
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,527
Thank you.

468
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,539
Yes, I know.

469
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:05,924
Where's your father now?

470
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,363
Not knowing this won't kill you.

471
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,404
I just want to know

472
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:17,478
because you were furious at Uncle Peng.

473
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:18,688
My dad is dead.

474
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,267
Are we done?

475
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:15,811
Here. You lay right here.

476
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:18,156
How?

477
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,595
Like this.

478
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,466
Can you get down and demonstrate?

479
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,657
I want to know the position I was lying in.

480
00:31:29,396 --> 00:31:30,821
What the heck?

481
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:35,077
If I see it, it might jog my memory.

482
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:37,243
Gosh.

483
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:43,329
You were lying like this.

484
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:46,551
What happened next?

485
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:50,135
I was swimming and saw you,

486
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,745
so I dragged you back to shore.

487
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,165
What next?

488
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,952
And I saved your damn life.

489
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:57,606
How?

490
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,007
Ow.

491
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:02,968
What are you doing?

492
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:04,957
Demonstrating.

493
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,619
Here comes some great content.

494
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:11,619
I pressed your chest to get the water out.

495
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:15,629
But you wouldn't wake up.

496
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:19,749
Then…

497
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:21,982
I sucked your mouth.

498
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:27,615
Geez! That's enough.

499
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:32,440
I think I remember something.

500
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,979
Did I have anything with me?

501
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:43,925
Not a single thing.

502
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,537
I posted your photo on social media.

503
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:50,813
No one knows you.

504
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:52,657
Don't stress.

505
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:54,326
Maybe I just don't have many followers.

506
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,946
You don't have to push so hard.

507
00:32:58,253 --> 00:32:59,276
Just let your life be.

508
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:03,139
We need to go help Uncle Peng
pick up some trash on the beach.

509
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,855
As for you, we'll figure out
another way to help later.

510
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,255
Now, get up.

511
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,649
Will you really help me?

512
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,521
At this point, no one wants you
to remember more than I do.

513
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:21,872
Quick!

514
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,179
Ow.

515
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,805
Oops.

516
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:29,937
Here we go again.

517
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,491
What the heck are you doing?

518
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:37,671
Go, Tum.

519
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:38,700
Come on.

520
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,393
That was great, my friend.

521
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:42,670
It's super nice.

522
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,059
Mr. Peng, do the locals always
have to clean up after the party?

523
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:54,971
Yes.

524
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:57,378
Some tourists help too.

525
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,300
But shouldn't the partygoers
clean up after themselves?

526
00:34:03,428 --> 00:34:04,917
I wish it could be like that too.

527
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:10,311
But the tourists bring in income for the locals.

528
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,207
We have to keep the beach clean

529
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,025
so it stays a tourist attraction
for years to come.

530
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:15,613
Yes, sir.

531
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:32,620
Let me help.

532
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:33,857
Can you stand up?

533
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,248
Walk slowly.

534
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,717
Doing off-site medical service today?

535
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:49,547
I came to help people pick up trash.

536
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,055
But I saw him lying on the beach for so long.

537
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,496
I was afraid the tide'd carry him out to sea.

538
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,522
I hate irresponsible drunk people.

539
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:03,224
What are you like when you're drunk, Chief?

540
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,356
Clingy.

541
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,341
Should we meet at the same spot tonight?

542
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,769
Is there a reason?

543
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:26,611
Yes, but I can't tell you now.

544
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:28,484
Yeah?

545
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:32,679
Peng.

546
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:37,556
Hello, Principal.

547
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:38,602
Hello.

548
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,650
I'd like to talk to you.

549
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,333
It's about the school.

550
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,668
Do you have time?

551
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:45,589
Were you two discussing something?

552
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,136
Nothing.

553
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:48,378
You can talk to him, Dad.

554
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,036
Come on then.

555
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:50,893
Come.

556
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,368
Damn, so much garbage.

557
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:04,883
Hey, dude.

558
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:05,883
What?

559
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:07,835
I think Wave is not so bad.

560
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:09,585
You should be nicer to him.

561
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:11,708
He doesn't seem evil.

562
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,285
He even loves children.

563
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,266
If you had to deal with his prince-like habits
the way I do, you'd understand.

564
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:19,869
He's supposed to make life easier,
but he just adds more burden.

565
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:20,678
Are you mad or something?

566
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:21,723
I'm not.

567
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:23,247
Chill, dude.

568
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,362
I'll take you to Honey's bar tonight.

569
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:26,245
I'm telling you…

570
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,519
it's the highlight of this island.

571
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,620
Nice.

572
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:32,237
That just makes me want to stay longer.

573
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:34,221
You'll see.

574
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:35,380
It's dope.

575
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,558
Hi, girlfriend.

576
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:40,824
Here, let me help you with that.

577
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:45,112
You guys just talk and don't actually work.

578
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:47,884
We're helping here.

579
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:48,787
Stop nagging.

580
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:51,831
People set up a good activity for you.

581
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:54,432
Do it, or nothing you do in your life is good.

582
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:56,159
You scold me so much.

583
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,549
Careful. One day, you might end up with me.

584
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,984
They should pick you up too,

585
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,229
since you're trash as well.

586
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:04,866
But trash like me
can always be recycled and reused.

587
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:06,853
Gosh.

588
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,739
Kratae, do you want to join us
at Honey's Bar tonight?

589
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:11,873
I'm taking Lava to check it out.

590
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,501
You're smoking weed again, aren't you?

591
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:21,291
Tum, don't lead him into bad stuff.

592
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,034
He'll turn bad because of you.

593
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,513
Ouch! My nipple!

594
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:25,330
No.

595
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,500
If I'm going to go bad, it's on me, not him.

596
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,305
Hey, well said, dude.

597
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:31,956
You're both hopeless.

598
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:36,504
I just hope you don't make Wave bad too.

599
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,681
How do you know he's not already bad?

600
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:40,562
Wave.

601
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,555
Wave, Wave.

602
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,289
Tonight, Tum and Lava are going to
smoke weed at Honey's bar.

603
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,457
Don't go with them, okay?

604
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,581
Let's go, let's go.

605
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,525
Hurry before Wave catches up.

606
00:37:58,869 --> 00:37:59,369
Oh, shit.

607
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:01,555
Lava, where are you going?

608
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:03,263
Wave.

609
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,251
I'm running an errand.

610
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,956
You can go home with Uncle Peng.

611
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:08,497
What errand?

612
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:11,742
I know you're going to do drugs.

613
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,160
Kratae told me everything.

614
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,197
Hey, it's not a drug.

615
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,535
It's an herb.

616
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:19,459
Then I'm coming with you.

617
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:20,788
You can't.

618
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,310
It's not a place for you. You won't like it.

619
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,725
I can just sit and do nothing.

620
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,365
I don't want to stay home alone.

621
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,747
Don't act like a lover
guarding their love at a bar.

622
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,781
Don't go.

623
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,685
Just let him come.

624
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:32,926
Let him open his eyes a little.

625
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:36,520
I just want to have fun
with no one in my way, got it?

626
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,362
I get it.

627
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,089
If you don't let me come,

628
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,389
I'll just have to warm up my voice a little.

629
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,091
Ahem.

630
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,955
Uncle Peng, Uncle Peng.

631
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,422
- Hey!
- Hey!

632
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:57,785
Fine, you can come.

633
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,854
Okay.

634
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,983
Come on. Time to go.

635
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:21,824
Let's go.

636
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:30,520
What?

637
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:32,724
Tum, what's wrong with the truck?

638
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:34,940
It won't start.

639
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,147
No! It can't be broken now.

640
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:38,398
This is unbelievable!

641
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,438
We must push it.

642
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,440
Wave, help me push it.

643
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,092
Wave, help me here. I can't do it alone.

644
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:48,982
Quickly.

645
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:52,938
Now. One, two, three.

646
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,305
Push, push, push.

647
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:58,309
Tum, start the engine.

648
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,036
Go.

649
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:03,017
It's starting now.

650
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,203
Wave, what's that in the back?

651
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:08,689
Woo-hoo!

652
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:11,151
See you. Bye.

653
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:11,954
Hey!

654
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:13,042
Wait for me!

655
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:47,166
Jeez.

656
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,840
Can you please help me with something?

657
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:13,408
Sure.

658
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,205
This is heaven, sis.

659
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:31,876
Besides me,

660
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:35,086
you're the other highlight of this island.

661
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:36,763
Sweet talker.

662
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:40,358
You've got good stuff.

663
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:41,885
I can help you sell it.

664
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:44,463
Damn, this guy.

665
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:45,669
You just got here.

666
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,980
Are you becoming a dealer now?

667
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,523
I need money.

668
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:52,150
I have to buy back my bike.

669
00:41:57,946 --> 00:41:59,073
Nice move.

670
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:00,714
Everything about me is nice.

671
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:03,272
People in the back, have fun and be free.

672
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:06,000
Honey is right here.

673
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:08,047
Honey is right here!

674
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:10,096
Woo!

675
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:14,063
Wave.

676
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:15,719
How did you get here?

677
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:17,451
You can never run away from me.

678
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,421
Why did you follow me?

679
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:20,462
You tricked me.

680
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:23,724
It's not your kind of place. You won't like it.

681
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:25,580
You don't know me.

682
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,766
How can you tell what I like or don't like?

683
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:30,271
No one knows you.

684
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,012
Even you don't know yourself.

685
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:43,831
Is he the one they said stranded
on the beach and lost his memories?

686
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:45,089
That's right, sis.

687
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:46,233
It's him.

688
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:54,638
Wanna try it?

689
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,646
No. I don't do drugs.

690
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:01,233
Hey!

691
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,745
This isn't drugs.

692
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,764
It's herbal.

693
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,010
If you take it,

694
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:13,043
you might remember something.

695
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,969
Don't challenge him.

696
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:18,112
This one's a chicken.

697
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,729
It helps nourish your brain

698
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:30,686
and boost performance.

699
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:33,493
Interested?

700
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:36,122
Will it really help?

701
00:43:38,526 --> 00:43:41,153
Can't you tell from looking at my face
if it helps?

702
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,628
You don't try…

703
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:49,624
you don't know.

704
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:53,559
Here.

705
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:56,139
Take it from my hand.

706
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,027
So, yes or no?

707
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:02,186
That's a yes.

708
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:07,996
Go on.

709
00:44:16,727 --> 00:44:17,851
Aw.

710
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:21,770
He's new. Don't blame him.

711
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:23,620
It's alright.

712
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,437
Let's continue the fun.

713
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,327
Let's go. Come on.

714
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:29,944
Hi, girls.

715
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:31,121
Honey is coming.

716
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,655
I told you not to come.

717
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:37,844
Go full-on.

718
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:43,626
Woo-hoo!

719
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:10,968
Where's Lava?

720
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,841
Out with Tum.

721
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,751
He took Wave too.

722
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:17,005
I don't know where they are.

723
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:22,475
I'm still puzzled as to
why his mom sent him here

724
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:25,951
when she barely talks to me

725
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:27,854
because I'm like this.

726
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,821
Maybe she sees the good in you.

727
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,646
She might think you can help
her son become a better person.

728
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:42,295
Or maybe she despises him so much
she doesn't want to deal with him.

729
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:45,804
Maybe not that bad.

730
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,250
Is that why you're hesitant
to admit you're with me?

731
00:45:57,694 --> 00:45:58,535
I don't know.

732
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:04,114
I just feel like I'm not successful enough
to make people accept me.

733
00:46:13,213 --> 00:46:15,722
You're Chief. What are you afraid of?

734
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:16,609
Hm?

735
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:24,077
You know I'm not exactly a chief.

736
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:28,309
I'm not successful. I'm not rich.

737
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,989
People just call me that
because Tum started it.

738
00:46:33,638 --> 00:46:35,446
I think it's cool.

739
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,882
This chief is from Bangkok.

740
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,662
Only a few years on the island
and you could buy this whole resort.

741
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,190
That's the coolest thing.

742
00:46:57,238 --> 00:46:58,466
Oh, boy.

743
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,040
Look at him.

744
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,809
I think your stuff has kicked in.

745
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,564
I told you it's good stuff.

746
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:09,493
Who knows? Tonight, he might even
recall memories from his past life.

747
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:12,166
Good.

748
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:15,031
So I can be free for the next three months.

749
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:20,801
But I think we should redo it.

750
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,420
Redo what?

751
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:24,514
Haven't you seen it in the movies?

752
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:28,990
When people get hit on the head with
something hard, their memories come back.

753
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:31,156
That's absurd.

754
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:33,581
That might injure him even more,
and I'll be in trouble.

755
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:34,740
Come on, dude.

756
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,986
Just do it as a little prank.

757
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,390
No way. No.

758
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,332
Damn, you're no fun.

759
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:39,791
Right, Honey?

760
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:40,473
Mm.

761
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,948
Gosh. How boring.

762
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:44,802
Super boring.

763
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:46,675
Watch him.

764
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:49,742
See if it's the stuff affecting him
or just my charm.

765
00:48:04,286 --> 00:48:04,973
Wave.

766
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:08,458
Wave, are you okay?

767
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,924
Hey.

768
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,546
Come on, I'll take you home.

769
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:15,344
Get up.

770
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:26,448
Shouldn't have been such a showoff.

771
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:36,881
Wave!

772
00:48:37,568 --> 00:48:38,793
Don't hurt me!

773
00:48:45,317 --> 00:48:46,516
Tum!

774
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:48,645
Gosh.

775
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:06,184
Thank you for bringing me this far.

776
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,891
Making you happy is my duty,
Your Highness.

777
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:29,840
Wave!

778
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,139
Wave!

779
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:40,526
Wave, wait for me.

780
00:49:40,526 --> 00:49:41,365
Making you happy…

781
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:42,696
Wave, wait!

782
00:49:42,696 --> 00:49:43,794
…is my duty, Your Highness.

783
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:44,358
Wave.

784
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:46,640
Wave!

785
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:49,757
Wave, are you alright?

786
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:53,185
Who are you?

787
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:54,386
Calm down.

788
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:55,926
I'm not gonna hurt you.

789
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:57,212
I'm taking you home.

790
00:49:58,659 --> 00:49:59,518
What home?

791
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:00,813
I don't have a home.

792
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:02,114
Yes, you do.

793
00:50:02,114 --> 00:50:04,012
Our home, Like Heaven.

794
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:05,989
Easy, okay?

795
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:08,422
Relax. Relax.

796
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:11,229
You're just high right now. It's nothing.

797
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,572
Take it easy and listen to me.

798
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,089
I'm Lava. I'm the one who saved your life.

799
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,957
I named you Wave.

800
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:20,175
It's me.

801
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:22,671
Calm down.

802
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,187
You're just high and there's no danger.

803
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:25,943
Trust me.

804
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:27,984
I'm not gonna hurt you.

805
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:31,308
I'm Lava. I'm the one who saved your life.

806
00:50:38,175 --> 00:50:39,009
Help me.

807
00:50:41,463 --> 00:50:43,955
It's okay. It's all good.

808
00:50:47,634 --> 00:50:49,585
Take it easy. It's nothing.

809
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:53,819
Holy shit, is he okay?

810
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:55,563
Wave, I'm sorry.

811
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:58,443
He's high.

812
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:01,984
Let's take him home. I'll drive. Come on.

813
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:03,720
Damn it. Wave, I'm sorry.

814
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,347
It's okay, it's okay.

815
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:06,523
Come on.

816
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,830
Come. Let's go home.

817
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,523
Get up. One, two, three.

818
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:13,495
Here, let me help.

819
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,481
Feeling better?

820
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:54,513
If you ever feel sick, let me know.

821
00:52:28,618 --> 00:52:29,867
Why are you shaking?

822
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:30,962
Are you okay?

823
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:44,555
Can you come up and sleep next to me?

824
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,621
Can you please hug me?

825
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:45,854
I want to remember who I am.

826
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:54,560
I will help you.

827
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:06,075
One, two, three, go.

828
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:37,570
Hey!

829
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,232
Hey!

830
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:38,924
Ouch!

831
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:41,479
Who are you?!

832
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,968
I'm sorry.

833
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:41,806
DIRECTED BY
TICHAKORN PHUKHAOTONG

834
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:53,895
He hasn't picked up his phone, Anya?

835
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,485
Not yet, Mother.

836
00:56:55,632 --> 00:56:57,555
I haven't been able to reach him for days.

837
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,928
Is something happening to Davin?

838
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:02,446
I'll have my men in Thailand help look.

839
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,587
It's my fault for letting him go.

840
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,519
Davin has always been
a little rebel since he was a child.

841
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:13,235
Don't blame yourself.

842
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:20,410
I promise I will bring him back.

843
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:33,744
What is going on?

844
00:57:34,529 --> 00:57:36,014
We don't have a meeting scheduled.

845
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:37,084
Leave for now.

846
00:57:37,574 --> 00:57:39,942
I'm dealing with a family matter.

847
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,445
You're not the one
who gives orders anymore.

848
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:44,854
You must listen to me.

849
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:47,826
I'm the most powerful man in Arantha.

850
00:57:58,028 --> 00:57:58,864
Victor.

851
00:57:59,722 --> 00:58:00,773
When did you get back?

852
00:58:00,871 --> 00:58:02,634
What about Davin? Where is he?

853
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:06,160
Prince Davin wished
to stay in Thailand indefinitely

854
00:58:06,577 --> 00:58:08,498
and will not return home.

855
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:12,801
He has also decided
to give up his position as heir.

856
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:15,407
That's not true.

857
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,348
Davin would never leave us.

858
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,444
What happened to my son?

859
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:23,222
Don't worry.

860
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,943
Soon, all three of you will join the prince.

861
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:30,136
Once I wrap up my business here,

862
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:33,929
Arantha will be mine completely,

863
00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:40,153
and Victor will be the sole heir to the throne.

864
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,734
I want to know if someone
who's lost their memories

865
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:04,520
can still remember their sexual orientation.

866
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,317
Don't sexually harass me.

867
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:09,655
I still have doubts about that employee.

868
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:11,395
Do you think he's the one who assaulted you?

869
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:14,240
It's surprising that
Uncle Peng and Dr. Wut are boyfriends.

870
00:59:14,286 --> 00:59:15,796
Why would they need to hide it from me?

871
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:17,343
They probably have their reasons.

872
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:19,758
Do you know that Tum likes Kratae?

873
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,152
I don't like women. I like men.

874
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:28,382
Memories are stimulated through senses and touch.
