Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:22,222
I'm still the same Wave, your boyfriend.

5
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,993
Being your boyfriend is way better than being a prince.

6
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:27,418
From now on, there will be no more secret places.

7
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,648
Let's love each other openly, so the whole island knows.

8
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,393
I'm not going anywhere.

9
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,461
My heart belongs here.

10
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:51,873
Take care of it for me.

11
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,223
Who were you talking to?

12
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:01,830
Victor.

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,453
I asked him to help me find a new piano.

14
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,842
Victor really seems to know
everything about you, huh?

15
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,179
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right?

16
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,345
Victor and I aren't like that.

17
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,552
You don't have to worry.

18
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:34,027
Besides, I know I could never be
that kind of person anyway.

19
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:40,168
What kind of person? Tell me.

20
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:47,815
Be a prince who likes men.

21
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm glad you decided to tell me.

22
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,660
It's better than keeping it all inside.

23
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,213
But I could never tell Father and Mother.

24
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:11,331
They wouldn't want an heir
who breaks tradition.

25
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:18,816
Honestly, the one
who should rule Arantha next is you.

26
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,533
You're so much more capable than I am.

27
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:28,851
No matter how capable I am,
a woman can't be Arantha's ruler.

28
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,175
It's never happened before.

29
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,437
If someone like you can't be,

30
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,647
then how could someone like me ever be?

31
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,626
Who would accept that?

32
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,191
Even if no one else accepts it,

33
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:44,473
you have to accept yourself first.

34
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,816
This kind of matter takes time.

35
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,146
Lava!

36
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,424
The prince got shot?!

37
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:05,458
How is he now?

38
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,310
I don't know.

39
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:08,609
The doctor's still helping him.

40
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,826
What about you? Are you hurt?

41
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:15,792
I'm fine.

42
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,187
But I'll find whoever did this.

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,369
Forget that for now.

44
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,198
Just pray he's safe.

45
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,095
We promised them
we'd take care of him the best we could.

46
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,323
I'll go check on the patient.

47
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:35,998
Then I'll go talk to the police.

48
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,394
Maybe they can find the shooter.

49
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:43,964
Holy crap!

50
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,282
Wave is actually a prince?!

51
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,776
Wave— uh, I mean, the prince—

52
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:52,993
he'll be fine.

53
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,685
But don't go after the gunman, okay?

54
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,844
It's dangerous.

55
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:04,772
Lava, don't be stupid and risk your life.

56
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,295
You barely know him.

57
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:09,976
The prince's business isn't your problem.

58
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,966
Let the police handle it, okay?

59
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:11,781
Listen to me.

60
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,049
What the hell are you saying?

61
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:16,449
The person in that room
is someone I've loved for three months!

62
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:19,940
I'll protect him, no matter who he is.

63
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:24,132
I'll make whoever hurt him pay for this.

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,255
Calm down.

65
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:40,720
Where is that jerk?

66
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,840
Jerk? Who are you talking about?

67
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,983
The guy who shot Prince Davin.

68
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,576
You're the one
who told him he's still alive, right?

69
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,358
Huh?!

70
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:50,726
Prince who?

71
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,397
What are you even talking about?

72
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,193
I don't know anything!

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,823
If you keep pretending to be dumb,

74
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:55,667
I swear I'll stab you.

75
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,677
I'm not kind.

76
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:57,177
Hurry up!

77
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,164
Hey, hey!

78
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,574
Just tell him already.

79
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,252
Look at him. He's serious.

80
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,489
Love-crazed people will do anything.

81
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:08,981
Tell him.

82
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:22,300
Asshole!

83
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,177
Hey!

84
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,066
Let go!

85
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,304
That's enough!

86
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:32,299
Hey!

87
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,080
Wave.

88
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:56,718
Wave.

89
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,957
Kratae called me and said you woke up,

90
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,036
so I came right away.

91
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,294
You've been unconscious for two days.

92
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:07,425
I was so worried.

93
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:13,253
I brought you some oranges.

94
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,634
I even peeled them.

95
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:15,875
Eat a little, okay?

96
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,792
Who are you?

97
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:39,443
I'm Lava.

98
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:42,572
Lava who?

99
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,110
I'm your boyfriend.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,769
Boyfriend?

101
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,941
I've never had a boyfriend.

102
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,178
My name is Davin, Prince of Arantha.

103
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,497
So you remember now?

104
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,413
You really don't recognize me?

105
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,373
I don't know you.

106
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:23,235
I came to this island with my friend Victor,

107
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,763
but he attacked me in the middle of the sea.

108
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,733
After that, I remembered nothing.

109
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,842
Are you saying you don't remember anything from the past three months?

110
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,797
Not even where you went,

111
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:40,889
who you were with,

112
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,087
or what happened?

113
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,067
I don't know anything.

114
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,278
What exactly happened?

115
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:51,750
And who are all of you?

116
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:54,928
How do you know me?

117
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,966
I think Lava should be the one
to explain that.

118
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,448
Hello, Prince Davin.

119
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,570
The doctor's told me everything
about your condition.

120
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,276
Please don't be alarmed.

121
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,372
My name is Peng.

122
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:08,204
I own Like Heaven Resort,

123
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,058
and I'm also the village head here.

124
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,481
I'm Lava's uncle.

125
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,820
Uncle Peng was the one who saved your life.

126
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,262
Thank you so much for saving me.

127
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,001
I just gave you a place to stay.

128
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:27,632
The one who really saved you was Lava.

129
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:34,182
He took you to the hospital and cared for you the whole time you were here.

130
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:38,375
While we wait for news from Arantha,
please rest here.

131
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,263
I'll update you as soon as I hear anything.

132
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,765
Thank you very much.

133
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,217
Give it a try, okay?

134
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,506
I don't even know how to help you.

135
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,614
Did I really sleep in this room with you?

136
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:52,008
Yes.

137
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,860
We even shared the same bed.

138
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,359
In this tiny bed?

139
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:03,657
We had to squeeze in real close.

140
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:09,763
Can I ask you something?

141
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,180
Of course.

142
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,338
You said we were dating.
How did that happen?

143
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,309
When did it start?

144
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,255
And how far did we go?

145
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,609
It started after I saved your life.

146
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,034
I brought you back here

147
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,153
and gave you the name “Wave.”

148
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:35,068
At first, I didn't even like you that much,

149
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:39,738
but little by little I saw how cute you were,

150
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,224
and then we kissed.

151
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:44,186
Kissed?!

152
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,567
More than a kiss, actually.

153
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,394
We…

154
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:49,592
Huh?!

155
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:50,970
We did it in this room too.

156
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:52,778
You and I…

157
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,574
Prince, are you okay?

158
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,428
You know what?

159
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,096
You were my first kiss and my first time.

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,234
I'm truly honored.

161
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,940
Hey, but I can't remember anything.

162
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,797
I don't feel anything for you.

163
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:43,856
To me, you're just a stranger now.

164
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,294
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:56,731
It's okay.

166
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,621
We can't undo the past anyway.

167
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,314
Let's just say it never happened.

168
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,252
You can sleep in this room if you want.

169
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,981
Maybe it'll help you remember.

170
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:28,161
It's fine. I don't want to trouble you.

171
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,881
I'll stay at the resort.

172
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:32,351
It's probably more convenient.

173
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:34,707
Don't worry about it.

174
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,217
This room is yours too.

175
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,623
It's Wave's room, not mine.

176
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,211
Who did you bring me to see?

177
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,897
The one who stranded you on this island.

178
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,020
Victor!

179
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:19,735
Prince Davin!

180
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:23,695
Please give me another chance.

181
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:26,181
Another chance?

182
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,112
You've tried to kill me twice.

183
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,528
I didn't want to.

184
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:32,326
It was my father's order.

185
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,461
I actually wanted a free life like yours.

186
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,721
I wanted to come here
to have good times with you.

187
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:43,768
I wanted to bring you home.

188
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,600
But I couldn't. My father ordered it.

189
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:51,887
So please give me another chance.

190
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,018
I'll help you and your family,

191
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:59,964
and we'll forget everything
that happened on this island

192
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:02,047
and start over in Arantha.

193
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:04,446
Don't give scum like him another chance.

194
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:15,471
Aside from my sister,

195
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:20,074
you're the only one I trust the most.

196
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,791
You know all my secrets.

197
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:26,962
You know all my weaknesses.

198
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:33,431
But you approached me to hurt me
and my family.

199
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,804
Was it worth it? Our friendship?

200
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,309
Trust isn't given easily.

201
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,227
If you break it,

202
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,320
you'll never get it back.

203
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,704
Lava caught you,

204
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:22,056
so I'll let him decide what to do.

205
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,001
This is our best room here.

206
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:43,090
Please rest however you like, Prince.

207
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:50,355
Thanks a lot.

208
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,542
This place is nice.

209
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,311
The atmosphere is also good.

210
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,412
I like it.

211
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:03,479
You already contacted people
in Aranta for me, right?

212
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:08,096
Yes. I've spoken to them.

213
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,271
They said they'd send someone
to pick you up soon.

214
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:17,274
Paolo said your family is safe now.

215
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:21,514
Thanks a lot.

216
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,153
Just hearing that makes me happy.

217
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,483
If you need anything, call me anytime.

218
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:40,019
I'll check the AC for you
to see if it's too cool or too warm.

219
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,496
Is the temperature okay?

220
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:49,708
Yes.

221
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,311
What about the pillow?

222
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,768
What kind of pillow do you like?

223
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:58,701
Soft or firm?

224
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,945
If it's too firm, I'll buy a new one for you.

225
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,087
I can sleep like this.

226
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,961
And the mattress —

227
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,446
Is it too bouncy?

228
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,728
If it's uncomfortable, I'll get you a new one.

229
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,033
I can really sleep like this.

230
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,082
Are you sure?

231
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,153
If you need anything, call me.
I'm here 24/7.

232
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:38,387
Mm.

233
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,050
Ah — Prince.

234
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,096
Thanks a lot.

235
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:11,501
Hello.

236
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,526
Hello.

237
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,421
Doctor.

238
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,413
What?

239
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:17,838
I'm tired.

240
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,100
You're tired already?

241
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
Come here, I'll stretch you.

242
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Come on.

243
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:22,092
You go ahead.

244
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,328
I'll stretch you.

245
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,154
Okay.

246
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:27,967
It feels tight.

247
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,503
Aren't you embarrassed in front of others?

248
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,549
Why would I be?

249
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,786
We're legally married.

250
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,384
Well, poor Lava.

251
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:44,890
The prince doesn't remember anything.

252
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,409
Yeah.

253
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,938
He has tried every possible way,

254
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,272
but we don't know if it'll work.

255
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:58,604
I think it depends on the prince
whether he wants to remember.

256
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,961
Lava can't force him.

257
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:03,167
Pushing might make him retreat.

258
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:13,959
Hey.

259
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:19,383
What would you do if this happened to me?

260
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:21,926
Hm,

261
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,576
that would be awful.

262
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:30,516
But I'd start over and try my best
to make you love me.

263
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,268
Pretend to be afraid of needles
so I can comfort you?

264
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:36,654
That might not work.

265
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:42,767
If it doesn't, I'll try other things.

266
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,395
Today, I'll fake fear of needles.

267
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,074
Tomorrow, I'll fake fear of blood.

268
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,685
Next, I'll enroll in medical school

269
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,714
so we'll be at the same hospital.

270
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,804
I'll be close to you.

271
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,953
I'll finally make you love me.

272
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:02,060
You'll go that far?

273
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,305
If it means I get to hug you like this,

274
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,956
it's worth any cost.

275
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,026
Such a sweet newlywed couple, Peng.

276
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:17,388
Just a little.

277
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,573
It took us a while to go public!

278
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,171
Let's continue running.

279
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:22,442
Come here.

280
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,274
Come.

281
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:25,212
You're not old. Come on, run.

282
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,191
I'm already old.

283
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:15,735
Does everyone have to be good at drawing
in architecture school?

284
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:19,670
Not really.

285
00:23:20,986 --> 00:23:22,559
You just need the basics,

286
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:24,578
like an understanding of building structures.

287
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,148
But I don't draw people much.

288
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:29,789
You're the first I've drawn.

289
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:37,683
Is drawing me hard?

290
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,153
Nope.

291
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,366
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
have clear structures.

292
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:49,708
I like your eyes.

293
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:50,966
They're beautiful.

294
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:03,975
What are you doing?

295
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:06,815
I'm making my eyes big,

296
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,547
so you'll draw them nicely.

297
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:12,973
No need.

298
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:15,441
I already remember your eyes.

299
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,377
I've looked at them a lot.

300
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,068
You picked flowers.

301
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,191
Uncle Peng will scold you.

302
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,390
It's fine.

303
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:51,934
I thought you were handsome before,

304
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:54,396
but now you're insanely handsome.

305
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:36,082
Prince!

306
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:38,993
Prince!

307
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,719
Prince!

308
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:46,431
What's going on, Lava?

309
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:48,322
I heard a really loud explosion.

310
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:49,999
The transformer blew again.

311
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,691
It happens here often.

312
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:53,428
This one might take a while to fix.

313
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:56,044
I brought a portable fan and flashlight.

314
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,426
The air is not that strong, but it should help.

315
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:01,926
I was worried you'd be too hot to sleep.

316
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:06,148
Thanks.

317
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:11,537
You're not scared, right?

318
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:14,908
Do you want me to sleep here with you?

319
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,330
I can take the floor.

320
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:21,548
It's alright.

321
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,187
I'm not scared anymore.

322
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:25,076
You can go sleep.

323
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:26,673
Are you sure?

324
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:29,447
I can sleep.

325
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:32,169
Good night.

326
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:02,490
Hey, the prince really doesn't remember anything about Wave and you?

327
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:05,121
That's awful.

328
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,963
It's like none of it ever happened.

329
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:14,451
Dude, don't get me wrong or anything.

330
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,816
Shall we hit him over the head once more?

331
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,656
Maybe his memory will come back.

332
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,804
Are you insane, Tum?

333
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:23,091
If you keep hitting his head,
he'll end up with permanent brain damage.

334
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:24,227
How would you handle that, huh?

335
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,964
If you can't think of anything,
don't talk.

336
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,577
Then what do you want me to do?

337
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:31,424
That's all I could come up with.

338
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:34,356
Wait.

339
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:38,891
What if we try something
like a reverse method?

340
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:40,921
How?

341
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:47,256
Make Prince Davin go through
what Wave has felt or experienced.

342
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:51,491
It might trigger certain feelings or memories.

343
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:52,314
Smart!

344
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:54,366
I get it now.

345
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:55,117
Dude,

346
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:58,914
you need to build full 4D experiences,

347
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:01,519
covering sight, taste, smell, and sound.

348
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:06,549
Make him remember
every moment he lived as Wave,

349
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,604
and every moment he spent with you.

350
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,771
The way you talked to Wave,

351
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,155
the way you treated Wave —

352
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,958
do the same with Davin.

353
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,304
Do you think that'll work?

354
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,015
No idea.

355
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,502
But if you really want Wave back,

356
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:22,352
you've got to try.

357
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,094
Wake up, wake up!

358
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,297
Get up already!

359
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,362
What's with you?

360
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:46,201
You can't make sleeping your hobby.

361
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:47,935
But it's still very early.

362
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,456
And how did you even get into my room?

363
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,270
What about security here?

364
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,105
People here wake up before sunrise
to earn a living.

365
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,840
You're used to being a prince
with an easy life,

366
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,252
but here, you've got to work

367
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:08,525
to repay the effort, care,
and money I've put in!

368
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,795
Why should I work?

369
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,768
I can just tell Arantha to bring you money.

370
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,184
Have you ever even tried to struggle?

371
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:18,426
If you don't know hardship,
how will you ever understand your people?

372
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:20,524
How could someone like you rule anyone?

373
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:21,945
Don't lecture me.

374
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,497
I know what I have to do.

375
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,536
If you do, then get up already.

376
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:27,734
Come on!

377
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,234
Hurry up.

378
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,257
Ugh!

379
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,177
Prince!

380
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:39,970
Open the door!

381
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:42,350
What now?

382
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:43,845
Something big happened.

383
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:46,452
What now again?

384
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,533
It's Arantha—

385
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,280
What happened to Arantha?

386
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,793
Hey, I'm showering!

387
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:02,685
I needed to pee.

388
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:06,020
So what happened to Arantha?

389
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,949
Father and Mother are free now.

390
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:10,120
Or did someone come to take me home?

391
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:11,462
No.

392
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:13,265
I needed to pee.

393
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:15,980
And you called that something big?

394
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:29,370
This is big too.

395
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,585
Are you making me
wash your underwear too?

396
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:56,488
No way.

397
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:57,562
It's dirty.

398
00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:58,803
Dirty?

399
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,021
My underwear is sexy.

400
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,491
People want to wash it.

401
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,980
Don't you remember when you were Wave?
You used to sneak a sniff.

402
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,276
I did not.

403
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:07,965
I'm not that kind of person.

404
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:09,331
Oh really?

405
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,144
Why would I lie?

406
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,428
Do you want me to help jog your memory?

407
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:13,712
Stop it.

408
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,317
I won't smell it, and I won't wash it either.

409
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,796
I never had to do anything like this before.

410
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:20,950
Back at the palace,
people did everything for me.

411
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,986
My hands never even touched detergent.

412
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,288
At the palace, you followed their rules.

413
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,503
But here, you follow mine.

414
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:32,869
Don't resist.

415
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,152
Or did you forget
what happens when you resist?

416
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,494
Ouch!

417
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:51,569
Don't abuse your power.

418
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,318
My balls!

419
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,270
I bet he's starting to remember something.

420
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:09,031
Ugh, barnacles won't come off
that easily!

421
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,065
Why do I have to do this anyway?

422
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:14,624
You've never heard of this saying?

423
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:18,001
“When you live under someone's roof,
you lend a hand.”

424
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,565
“So help us scrape off the barnacles.”

425
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:21,602
What are you talking about?

426
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,703
Hey, you were way stronger
when you were Wave.

427
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,708
Why so weak now that you're a prince?

428
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,564
I don't like being called weak.

429
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,699
Fine, Your Highness.

430
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:47,469
Then show me your strength, please!

431
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,615
Harder, Your Highness!

432
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,869
Harder! That's not enough!

433
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,971
It's a giant one. Crack it!

434
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:07,828
Harder!

435
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,116
Come on, keep going.

436
00:33:11,307 --> 00:33:12,071
No way.

437
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,446
I'd never like someone like you.

438
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:15,519
You're rude!

439
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,121
Teacher Wave,

440
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,358
I got accepted into the provincial school,

441
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:34,981
and I got a musician's scholarship too,

442
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,084
thanks to the song you taught me.

443
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:41,999
I taught you?

444
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:44,499
Yeah! You taught me for a whole month.

445
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:46,444
Are you kidding me now?

446
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:49,911
Well, Wave's been sick,

447
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,215
so he's a bit forgetful.

448
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:58,867
Aomsin, remind him
how good a teacher he is.

449
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:03,275
You're smart, kind,
and really patient with me.

450
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,695
I almost gave up,

451
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,002
but you kept encouraging me.

452
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:11,096
And best of all…

453
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,191
It was free of charge.

454
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:16,008
If it weren't for you,

455
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:19,515
I would've made him quit learning piano.

456
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:23,610
Amazing!

457
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:25,714
See?

458
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:29,854
Teacher Wave could change
the kid's world this much.

459
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:37,044
Who knows, maybe one day
he'll be a world-class musician,

460
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,309
playing at Kentucky Hall, New York City!

461
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:42,317
Wait.

462
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:44,744
It's Carnegie Hall, isn't it?

463
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:46,557
Same thing.

464
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:48,912
Come on. Let's hug.

465
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:12,995
Why did you bring me down here?

466
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:14,556
Aren't you scared the tide will rise?

467
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:17,421
The tide's low right now.

468
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:18,734
It's really beautiful.

469
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:30,105
It's beautiful.

470
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:36,013
Look.

471
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,516
When the water goes down,
trash's everywhere.

472
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:42,412
I wonder where it all floated from.

473
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:44,854
Someone should clean it up.

474
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,295
They do.

475
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:51,026
Uncle Peng and the villagers
usually help out.

476
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,968
So you brought me here to pick up trash?

477
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,351
Let's do it.

478
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:00,697
No.

479
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:04,153
I brought you

480
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:07,227
because this place is special to us.

481
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,664
Special?

482
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,409
How?

483
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:17,924
It's where…

484
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:20,186
we kissed.

485
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:31,984
And Wave was the one
who asked to kiss me.

486
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:36,178
He did?

487
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:37,638
Yeah.

488
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:40,108
I loved that moment.

489
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,014
Wave was so brave,

490
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:49,508
and it was the first time I realized
I was starting to really like Wave.

491
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:52,983
I brought you here,

492
00:36:54,922 --> 00:37:00,223
hoping it might help you
recall some feelings.

493
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,543
I don't know what Wave felt for you,

494
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:28,846
but I'm Davin.

495
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,056
I don't kiss someone I don't love.

496
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,397
I understand.

497
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,021
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:52,199
Don't be.

499
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,960
I know you're trying,

500
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:01,675
but I really can't be Wave for you.

501
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:06,601
It's all in the past now.

502
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,406
You should focus on the present.

503
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:41,687
Let it go, man.

504
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,243
You've done your best.

505
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:45,804
Yeah,

506
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:52,245
Lava, it's crazy enough
this even happened at all.

507
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:55,448
Still, it's a regret, huh?

508
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:59,596
If he did remember, that'd be so sweet.

509
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,968
Remember that time His High— uh…

510
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,165
whatever we call him—

511
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:11,254
got high here at my bar
and ran around like crazy?

512
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,193
If his royal guards knew,

513
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:15,558
we'd both be dead, Tum!

514
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:16,714
You're right!

515
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:22,076
Good thing he forgot, or I'd be screwed.

516
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,544
But I've got a video of the prince
when he was high.

517
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:26,270
Do you want to see it?

518
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,162
Let me find it.

519
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:29,777
Here we go.

520
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,013
You've got more videos of him?

521
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,551
Oh, tons.

522
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,212
I filmed them for content.

523
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:58,453
Hey!

524
00:39:58,453 --> 00:39:59,156
Hey!?

525
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:01,277
Hey, that's enough, Tum.

526
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,386
Honey, stop it.

527
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:03,553
Something good again, huh?

528
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:04,100
Tum!

529
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:06,316
Help me with something.

530
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,317
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

531
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:18,546
What's going on?

532
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:21,386
We brought you here to watch a movie.

533
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:24,073
What movie?

534
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:25,750
It's a surprise.

535
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:30,855
And this is for a better
viewing experience, Your Highness.

536
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,024
This movie is directed
and shot by Tum himself.

537
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,110
Like Heaven Studio proudly presents

538
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,913
Lava and the Prince!

539
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:52,844
Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da, ta-da-da!

540
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:58,546
Thai voices by… himself.

541
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:07,743
Your highness, I bow to you.

542
00:41:08,578 --> 00:41:12,838
I don't really know the proper words to use when speaking to you,

543
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,129
but I'll just talk the way I usually do.

544
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:23,447
I'm Lava Tiwakorn Rapeepong.

545
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:26,402
My mom sent me to this island
to fix my behavior,

546
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,848
to live with Uncle Peng.

547
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,851
Back then, I wanted to go home every day

548
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:36,738
until I met the person who made my time here the happiest it's ever been.

549
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:41,143
When I took you to the beach
where I first found you,

550
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:43,002
and demonstrated how I saved you,

551
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,034
I was still annoyed by you.

552
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,253
But not anymore now.

553
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:50,684
Hey, stop it already.

554
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,908
Don't worry.

555
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,224
No one wants you to remember
more than I do.

556
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,775
Get up.

557
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,224
This one is the cutest.

558
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:04,703
That night, you were high on weed
and freaked out, running away too.

559
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,971
All because of Tum!

560
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:12,606
Welcome to Honey Bar!

561
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,408
Hi everyone.

562
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,388
Today, I'm fixing the noodle shop
with my friends.

563
00:42:17,388 --> 00:42:20,811
Let's see the before and after.

564
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:25,586
Tum secretly filmed us
when we were fixing it.

565
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,867
You wiped my sweat and handed me a drink.

566
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,839
That was when I started liking you.

567
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:33,785
Thanks.

568
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:37,254
We rode to the beach with Tum and Kratae.

569
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,094
I drove fast
and teasingly hit the brakes all of a sudden.

570
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:41,097
You grabbed my waist tight.

571
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:44,623
We ate roast pork noodles
in front of the temple.

572
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,595
You loved extra roast pork.

573
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,206
Back then, Tum and Kratae were teasing us for secretly dating.

574
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:58,478
Gotcha!

575
00:42:58,635 --> 00:42:59,417
Hey!

576
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:04,980
During the election,
Kratae filmed your campaign speech for Uncle Peng.

577
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:06,714
I was super happy.

578
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:09,401
Thanks to you,
Uncle Peng won as village head.

579
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:15,622
So please, give Uncle Peng the chance
to give this island a new life

580
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:20,208
like he gave me mine.

581
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:26,708
Yay! Vote! Vote!

582
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:36,073
Vote! Vote!

583
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,828
These are just the moments Tum recorded.

584
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:40,295
There are so many more memories
on this island.

585
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:42,113
I just don't want you to forget me,

586
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:45,269
Lava Tiwakorn Rapeepong.

587
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:50,569
Now you understand
why I never wanted to go back home, right?

588
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:57,620
It's because Wave made me want to be
an island boy forever.

589
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:09,589
See you at Nava Mahasamut.

590
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:11,544
All done, Tum.

591
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:13,740
If he still doesn't remember, just let him go.

592
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,541
What is “Nava Mahasamut”?

593
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:22,786
No idea.

594
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:25,280
Maybe it's a secret code
between you and Lava.

595
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:29,453
And where is he now?

596
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:32,456
I really don't know.

597
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,190
You have to find him.

598
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:51,811
(Nava Mahasamut.)

599
00:45:00,922 --> 00:45:02,966
Aww, look at those sleepy eyes!

600
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,426
Look at those sleepy eyes.

601
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:05,618
My baby girl.

602
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,065
Your Highness, my respects.

603
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:13,024
Dao, you don't have to do that.

604
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,897
The Prince won't mind, right?

605
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:20,441
No need to bow.

606
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:22,509
Just act normal.

607
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:27,302
Do you remember me, Your Highness?

608
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,519
I'm Dao, the housekeeper here.

609
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,851
I taught you the Southern dialect once.
Do you remember?

610
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,674
And this is my daughter.

611
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:39,722
You were there when she was born.

612
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:41,852
When my water broke!
Do you remember?

613
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:53,052
Come here, sweet girl.

614
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:56,774
Come see the Prince.

615
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:10,693
Let the Prince hold you.

616
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,909
Come on, come on. I'll carry her now.

617
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:37,723
Hi there.

618
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,810
Can I play with you? Peek-a-boo!

619
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:44,418
Peek-a-boo!

620
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,179
Chief.

621
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:57,336
Well, I wanted to ask.

622
00:46:57,336 --> 00:47:04,315
Can you and Dr. Wut
adopt my daughter as your own?

623
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:06,461
Dao, why?

624
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,201
Where is her real father?

625
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:13,595
I don't know where he is, and I don't care.

626
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:15,612
I only care about my child.

627
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:18,049
I'm scared I can't raise her well on my own.

628
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,975
I want her to be in the care
of someone capable,

629
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:31,875
so I think you both could be my child's dads and secure her future.

630
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:38,806
I don't know about that, Dao.

631
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:40,917
You have to ask Dr. Wut.

632
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:50,914
I'm fine with that.

633
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:55,318
We're legally married now.

634
00:47:57,511 --> 00:48:01,091
If another child joins the family, I'm ready.

635
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:02,886
Right?

636
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:04,834
Are you ready? Are you?

637
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:05,550
Alright.

638
00:48:06,411 --> 00:48:08,300
Let's go file the papers at the district office.

639
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:13,904
Chief, thank you so much!

640
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,444
Thank you, Dr. Wut.

641
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:18,583
I haven't even named her yet.

642
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:21,439
I told you, Chief, you should name her.

643
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:23,889
Let me and Dr.Wut think about it first.

644
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:27,510
Or maybe the Prince
would like to name her?

645
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:35,332
No, I'm an outsider.

646
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,097
You should name her yourselves.

647
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:40,856
You're not an outsider.

648
00:48:41,404 --> 00:48:43,163
You're also part of our family.

649
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,953
You're such a chubby little girl.

650
00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:52,868
How lucky you are, my daughter.

651
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,631
By the way, where is Lava?

652
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:58,256
I want to ask him about that name.

653
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,892
He's in his room, probably sleeping.

654
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:07,163
Come on. I'll carry her.

655
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:11,487
Come, sweetheart.

656
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:16,708
Do you like it?

657
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:24,608
Lava.

658
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:30,115
Lava.

659
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,235
I really don't know where that place is.

660
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,136
Lava, are you in there?

661
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:42,553
I'm coming in.

662
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:25,825
I like your eyes.

663
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:27,376
They're beautiful.

664
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:31,470
But I don't draw people much.

665
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:33,234
You're the first I've drawn.

666
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:46,391
NAVA MAHASAMUT

667
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,517
See you at Nava Mahasamut.

668
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:54,092
You said you wanted a real name, right?

669
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:57,314
I found one with a nice meaning.

670
00:52:57,314 --> 00:52:58,374
NAVA MAHASAMUT

671
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:04,924
Ah! That tickles!

672
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:31,566
Mr. Peng!

673
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:33,589
Oh…

674
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:37,870
Calm down, Your Highness.

675
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:39,077
Is something wrong?

676
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:41,878
I need your help.

677
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:42,505
Why are you leaving so fast?

678
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:47,954
You're not waiting for me anymore?

679
00:56:06,017 --> 00:56:07,374
Your secret code—

680
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:09,935
it took time, you know.

681
00:56:12,337 --> 00:56:13,575
How did you even get here?

682
00:56:14,828 --> 00:56:15,611
Did you remember everything?

683
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:18,592
Not yet.

684
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:26,622
Just bits and pieces. It's still blurry.

685
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:34,416
It's okay.

686
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:37,959
I've done my best.

687
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:43,693
Just the fact that you remember this island makes me happy enough.

688
00:56:45,729 --> 00:56:47,518
From what you've shown me,

689
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:54,797
Lava and Wave must have shared
so many good memories together, right?

690
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,413
It's a shame I'm the only one
who remembers them.

691
00:57:07,138 --> 00:57:09,199
I once said I envied Wave

692
00:57:11,783 --> 00:57:14,304
because he got to restart
his memories from zero.

693
00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:19,556
But not anymore.

694
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:23,346
Now I want to remember
everything about us forever.

695
00:57:26,557 --> 00:57:27,795
I'm still trying.

696
00:57:29,335 --> 00:57:30,402
Just give me a little more time.

697
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:34,888
Do I even have any left?

698
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:42,266
It's fine.

699
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:45,186
Even if I only have one day,

700
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:48,659
one hour, or one minute left,

701
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,928
I'll make you remember
what happened between us.

702
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,751
Can I try something?

703
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:25,220
It's a lot clearer now.

704
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:38,870
Do you want a bite?

705
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:23,885
Anya!

706
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:30,143
If tonight is the last night we get to be together,

707
01:00:30,143 --> 01:00:32,528
can we make it a night we'll remember forever?

708
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,478
What if I go to the palace to see you?

709
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:41,206
What happened between us would just be a summer memory.

710
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:42,848
Wave has nothing to lose.

711
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:43,955
He has no past to hold on to.

712
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:45,808
All his life, it's just you!
