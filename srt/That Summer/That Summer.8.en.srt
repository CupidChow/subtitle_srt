4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,084
Then what should I do?

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,399
Should I just break up with him?

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,185
Don't you dare.

7
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,229
What reason will you even use?

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
Just keep playing the island boyfriend.

9
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,661
We'll see what happens next.

10
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,111
Shit! Who did this?!

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,906
Come out and talk now, Peng!

12
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:30,924
It'd be awful, right?

13
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,481
Loving each other that much but not being able to stay together.

14
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:34,753
How are you feeling these days?

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,435
I feel uncomfortable having to lie to him.

16
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,600
Who'd believe it, right?

17
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:39,269
My boyfriend is a prince.

18
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,755
How long have you known about this?

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,509
Losing my memory hurt enough,

20
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,695
but now this hurts even more.

21
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:54,748
Here's your meal.

22
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:56,140
Please enjoy it, Your Highness.

23
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:58,223
What language are you speaking?

24
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:01,351
Well, you're a prince.

25
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,776
I have to use royal language. That's correct.

26
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,470
Aren't you two going to eat with me?

27
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:14,449
Oh, Uncle Peng and I will eat
at another table.

28
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,027
Then I won't eat.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,389
This food isn't good enough for me.

30
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,984
Also, take me to Aomsin's house.

31
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,680
He has an exam today.

32
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,509
But I think you don't need to go.

33
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,876
Aomsin can handle it.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,860
But I want to go.

35
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:36,192
I want to cheer her on.

36
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:39,418
If you want to treat me like a prince,

37
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:41,772
you must do everything I say.

38
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:43,186
Don't argue.

39
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:46,408
But—

40
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:46,921
No “but.”

41
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,988
My orders are final.

42
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,190
Do you understand?

43
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,228
What should I do, Uncle?

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,276
He looks really mad.

45
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,076
Give him some time

46
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:12,582
The information is new to him.

47
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:13,404
He might still be in shock.

48
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:15,242
Just stay calm.

49
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,892
His family will come
to pick him up soon anyway.

50
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:23,596
Ouch!

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,277
Hey!

52
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:28,534
Uncle!

53
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,953
A knife cut like this is nothing.

54
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,394
It's miles away from your heart.

55
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,909
You can treat this kind of wound
yourself at home.

56
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,594
Oh, the knife is old.

57
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:37,576
I was worried it might have germs,

58
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,085
so I came to get it checked.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,286
Should I unwrap it
and redo the wound dressing?

60
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:51,169
I guess you just want someone else
to treat your wound.

61
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,959
Doctor Wut, emergency patient here!

62
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:09,373
You didn't purposely cut yourself
just to come see me, did you?

63
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:12,493
And what if I say I did?

64
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,673
Why would you go that far?

65
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,369
You're hurting yourself for nothing.

66
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,059
I'm kidding. It was really an accident.

67
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,761
Hey, stop that.

68
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,542
This is a government building.

69
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,332
Don't.

70
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:38,929
Stay still.

71
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,274
Let me hug you for a bit longer.

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,598
If I were the village head,

73
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,409
I wouldn't have to fake a bleeding wound
to come see you like this.

74
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,059
You're going to be.

75
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,286
Your speech was so inspiring.

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,900
Inspiring?

77
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,285
If it weren't for Wave and Lava helping me,

78
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,654
I would've been done for a long time ago.

79
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:08,814
Hey, give yourself some credit.

80
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,435
You built all of this.

81
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:12,819
Do you understand?

82
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,895
You can do it. You're really capable.

83
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:32,178
Doctor, Wave is a prince.

84
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,347
What?

85
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,309
You can do it. Don't worry.

86
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,449
You've practiced so much already.

87
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,860
I'm not so confident, Teacher Wave.

88
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,597
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

89
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,174
It's okay even if you do.

90
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,843
You don't have to be the best.

91
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,525
At least you'll learn something,

92
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,346
and everyone will see your talent.

93
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,202
I'm sure you'll get the scholarship
and become a world-class musician.

94
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,949
Thank you, Teacher Wave.

95
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,674
I won't let you down.

96
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:08,154
Lava, what are you standing there for?

97
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:09,323
Come hug me too.

98
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,454
I need all the encouragement I can get.

99
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,045
Hurry up!

100
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:20,368
Come on, hurry!

101
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:30,000
Dad, come here!

102
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,315
Good luck, Aomsin.

103
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:35,826
Thanks.

104
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:54,388
Eh?

105
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,236
Hey, why did it stop?

106
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:02,528
Come on, don't break down now.
Just get us home first.

107
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,391
What's wrong with it?

108
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:12,097
Maybe you should check
what's wrong with it first.

109
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:19,266
Do you know how to fix it?

110
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:28,959
Hello, Tum?

111
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,764
My motorbike broke down
near the rubber plantation entrance.

112
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:33,642
Come pick me up.

113
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:36,994
You'll be back late?

114
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:42,545
Alright, I'll try to get a ride.

115
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness,
for putting you in trouble.

116
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:55,548
It's fine. It's not that bad.

117
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,989
I could even walk back.

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,631
In this heat, Your Highness?

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,161
Are you sure you can walk?

120
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,320
Maybe we should just call for a ride.

121
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:03,936
I can walk.

122
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,850
If you want to wait, then wait by yourself.

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,497
Your Highness.

124
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:12,304
Man, what kind of prince is this?

125
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,202
He's so stubborn.

126
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:24,172
♪ Often, the heart just walks away
without looking where it's going ♪

127
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,858
Whoa, it's so hot.

128
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,215
Can you really walk in this heat?

129
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,027
He's just unbelievable.

130
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:40,621
♪ Standing under the sky
doesn't feel the same ♪

131
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:46,259
♪ Summer isn't the same without you ♪

132
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,516
Ugh, it's boiling!

133
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,162
You're sweating a lot.

134
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,135
Here, Your Highness, use my handkerchief.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,489
This cloth sure is versatile.

136
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,064
It could wipe your blood and my sweat too.

137
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:25,273
I forgot it touched my foot before.

138
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,346
I'll just take off my shirt instead.

139
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:28,088
No need.

140
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,124
Just give me the handkerchief.

141
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,923
The way you cheered for Aomsin
was really great.

142
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,656
I'm sure he'll pass.

143
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,565
I just wanted to do my duty properly

144
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,819
to help Aomsin reach his goal.

145
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,047
When I care about someone, I give my all.

146
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:01,941
I don't fake it.

147
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,641
Hey, the car's here,Your Highness!

148
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:36,312
Let's go!

149
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:38,725
Hey, bro!

150
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,063
Stop please!

151
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:44,514
Stop please!

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,215
Bro, can I hitch a ride to the guesthouse “Like Heaven,” please?

153
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,231
Sure, kid, but you'll have to squeeze
in the back with the coconuts.

154
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,970
No problem.

155
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:57,937
Is that okay, Your Highness?

156
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,986
What about your motorbike?

157
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:01,413
I'll come back for it later.

158
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,611
Thank you so much.

159
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:04,379
Hop in.

160
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:18,782
Come, let me help you.

161
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:26,675
One, two, three.

162
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:36,115
Let's go, bro!

163
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,467
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

164
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,190
for all this trouble.

165
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,873
Please bear with it. We'll be there soon.

166
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,473
You keep apologizing

167
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,803
and saying “Your Highness.”

168
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,418
Can you just treat me like before?

169
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:11,579
I told you, I'm still Wave.

170
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,056
Just Wave.

171
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:14,723
Wave.

172
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,558
I understand,

173
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,802
but you have to understand me too.

174
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,328
I don't know how to act around you.

175
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,944
The person I used to call my boyfriend

176
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:29,016
suddenly became someone
I can't even touch now.

177
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:35,777
Why can't you?

178
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:42,898
I'm still the same Wave, your boyfriend.

179
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,940
I want you to touch me,

180
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:57,320
tease me,

181
00:12:58,917 --> 00:12:59,884
and make me laugh.

182
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,100
I don't want to be a prince.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,385
I want to be your boyfriend.

184
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,034
Your highness, I want to tell you that—

185
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:15,906
I'm Wave!

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,724
Wave.

187
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,679
Everything that happened wasn't
Paolo's order.

188
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,871
It was my real feeling.

189
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,675
When I said I loved you, I meant it.

190
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,058
When I got jealous, it was fierce.

191
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:34,759
When I wanted to hug you, I really did.

192
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,047
I've never lied about any of it.

193
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:40,589
Can you believe me?

194
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:59,586
Being your boyfriend is way better
than being a prince.

195
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:10,839
What a regret!

196
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,971
I missed my chance to brag to the whole island
that my boyfriend is a prince.

197
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,300
Stop it.

198
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,689
Come on, just let me do it.

199
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,152
I'm proud, okay?

200
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,487
My boyfriend is a prince!

201
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:28,280
Lava, stop it!

202
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:29,893
We're moving so fast.

203
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:31,386
No one can hear us anyway.

204
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,246
My boyfriend is a prince!

205
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,970
Woohoo!

206
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,941
My boyfriend is a prince!

207
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,469
Woohoo!

208
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,324
Damn, why isn't Tum here yet?

209
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:04,461
I already called to wake him up.

210
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,181
Will he make it in time?

211
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,057
There he is!

212
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:08,313
Coming!

213
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,805
Tum, it took you long enough
to wake up and come vote!

214
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,976
If I hadn't called, you'd still be asleep.

215
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,742
Every single vote counts!

216
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,139
Yeah, yeah, I know.

217
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,617
I'll mark a big tick.

218
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,586
Just hurry up and get in there!

219
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,163
And don't tick the wrong box, got it?

220
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,121
Hey, wait up!

221
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:22,833
Hurry up.

222
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,933
Valid vote, number 5.

223
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,448
Yay!

224
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,022
Valid vote, number 5.

225
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,280
Yay!

226
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,730
Valid vote, number 2.

227
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,440
Yay!

228
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,030
Valid vote, number 2.

229
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,082
Yay!

230
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,943
Valid vote, number 5.

231
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:06,824
Let's go!

232
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:13,583
Valid vote…

233
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,401
number 2!

234
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:16,600
Wait!

235
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,008
That ballot's torn like that.

236
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,303
Does it still count as a valid vote?

237
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,894
Hey! Hey!

238
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,616
Check it one more time.

239
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,531
How could you do that?

240
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,071
We're sorry.

241
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,034
Correction.

242
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:27,707
This is a spoiled ballot.

243
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,031
Check carefully!

244
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:34,306
VILLAGE HEAD ELECTION
BALLOT BOX

245
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,809
And the final vote goes to number—

246
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,134
Uncle Peng, let's go!

247
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,410
Tum, hurry!

248
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,595
Uncle Peng, start the car!

249
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:53,536
Tum, close it up.

250
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:59,326
Let's go!

251
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,133
Go, quick!

252
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,286
Dr. Wut!

253
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,838
Dr. Wut!

254
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:14,541
Dr. Wut!

255
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,057
Where is he?

256
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:16,962
He's probably in the back room.

257
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:17,685
I'll take you there.

258
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:18,239
Let's go.

259
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:25,779
Hey, there he is.

260
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,168
What's going on?

261
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,660
Why is everyone here?

262
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:33,935
Is someone hurt?

263
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:36,050
And what about the election result?

264
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,275
Dr. Wut.

265
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,378
I've been elected as the new village head.

266
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:54,697
Are you serious?

267
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:55,710
Yeah.

268
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,869
Are you sure there's no surprise twist?

269
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:58,955
Uh-huh.

270
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:11,917
What are you doing?

271
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,245
Now that I've done what the director asked,

272
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,854
I want to do things right.

273
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:22,241
No more hiding.

274
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,043
Let everyone in the hospital
be our witnesses.

275
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:28,763
I'm ready to take care of you…

276
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:34,412
forever.

277
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,592
From now on,
there will be no more secret places.

278
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,330
Let's love each other openly,
so the whole island knows.

279
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,620
Will you marry me?

280
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:53,018
Are you serious?

281
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:56,779
Yes, I am.

282
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,186
Then, say yes!

283
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:07,374
Get married! Get married! Get married!

284
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,686
After waiting this long,

285
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,720
of course, my answer is yes.

286
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,156
Just wait until it's my turn.

287
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,080
I'll make mine an even bigger scene.

288
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:57,150
Hey, Dao, are you so touched
you can't hold it in?

289
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:58,299
Tum,

290
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,035
I'm not peeing.

291
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,084
I'm in labor!

292
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:04,724
What?!

293
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:06,885
Oh no!

294
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,333
Excuse me!

295
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,950
Your baby is so cute, Dao,

296
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,456
looking just like you.

297
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,888
Have you picked a name yet?

298
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,093
I haven't had any idea so far.

299
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,769
How about “Kuha,” Dao?

300
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:26,877
It fits with the election theme.

301
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,374
What kind of name is that?

302
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:30,337
It's so weird.

303
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,312
Save that name for your own kid, Tum.

304
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,896
Hey, my kid is your kid too, you know.

305
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,343
We can have the monk pick it for you later.

306
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,960
Sure, whatever you say.

307
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,316
What does that have to do with me, Dao?

308
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:48,161
I'm your employer, not the baby's father.

309
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:52,182
Then I'll prepare some
postpartum meals for you.

310
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,451
Thank you so much, Doctor.

311
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,946
The baby's got their fists all clenched up.

312
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,231
See? The baby must like you.

313
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:06,771
You like him, right?

314
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:10,488
Well, kids and I are made for each other.

315
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:26,069
Today's just full of good things.

316
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:29,730
Uncle Peng became village head,

317
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,514
proposed to Dr. Wut,

318
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:35,036
and Dao just gave birth.

319
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,901
So many happy things happened.

320
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:47,153
Yeah, today's been super fun and wild.

321
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,144
It was like an action scene
when her water broke.

322
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,127
Do you know what I'm afraid of?

323
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:00,622
What?

324
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,816
I'm afraid that when I go back
to being a prince,

325
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:10,951
I won't be as happy as I am right now.

326
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,555
Don't be dramatic.

327
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,670
Living in a big palace, eating good food,

328
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,674
and having people serve you—

329
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:23,773
that's super comfortable.

330
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,062
What if my happiness
isn't about having a big house?

331
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:35,991
My happiness is

332
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,882
seeing the people I love happy.

333
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:44,908
Seeing Tum,

334
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:47,231
Kratae,

335
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:50,376
Aomsin,

336
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:57,521
and Dao happy is enough for me.

337
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,463
Wherever you go,

338
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,086
you'll always be valuable to others.

339
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:09,520
Let me tell you something.

340
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,699
I'm not going anywhere.

341
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:15,650
My heart belongs here.

342
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:20,341
And you're not allowed to make me leave.

343
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,289
I won't.

344
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:27,124
I'll tie up your body, your arms,
and your legs to keep you right here.

345
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,445
- Got it.
- I'm not letting you go anywhere.

346
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:18,955
Mom!

347
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:24,441
Mom? How did you get here?

348
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:25,699
Peng called me.

349
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:27,473
He said he needed my help,

350
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,373
and I wanted to see how you're doing.

351
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,346
And who's this?

352
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:39,165
This is Wave.

353
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:40,538
He's my boyfriend.

354
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:41,542
Boyfriend?

355
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:44,321
Why didn't you ever tell me?

356
00:24:44,804 --> 00:24:45,964
Did you meet here?

357
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:47,776
It's a long story.

358
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,010
I'll tell you later when I have time.

359
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:51,604
Hello.

360
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,820
I'll wait outside for breakfast then.

361
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,041
Hey, your mom isn't mad, is she?

362
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,802
No, she's fine.

363
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:08,106
I didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,916
Also, I'm legally an adult now.

365
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:11,771
I can do what I want.

366
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:19,702
Hey, stop.

367
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,082
Your mom's waiting for you.

368
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:23,473
She won't be mad.

369
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:27,284
If I tell her the truth,
she'll be shocked for sure.

370
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:31,672
That's enough.

371
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:32,376
Your mom is—

372
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:33,201
Hey!

373
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:34,464
Ow!

374
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:35,740
Enough!

375
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:37,049
Ouch!

376
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,835
You're cooking by yourself now?

377
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,003
At home, you never even touched a spatula.

378
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:46,333
Well, people have to change sometimes
for their loved ones.

379
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:50,506
You make it sound like an ad slogan.

380
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:52,831
Just make sure you keep it up.

381
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:58,120
So, Wave, are you from around here?

382
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:07,489
Yes.

383
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,856
I was born and raised in Bangsawan.

384
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:10,111
My full name is Nava Mahasamut.

385
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,040
I'm twenty-three years old.

386
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
My father's a fisherman.

387
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
My mother teaches music,

388
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,582
and now I'm a tutor
for secondary school students.

389
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,321
I only asked a short question,
and you gave me a whole essay.

390
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,496
So how did you and Lava meet?

391
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:29,917
It was very romantic.

392
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,414
That day, I went swimming
and got pulled out by the waves.

393
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:34,289
Lava saw me and saved my life.

394
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,573
I was touched by how heroic
and talented he was,

395
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:37,932
so I went after him
until he became my boyfriend.

396
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,246
Wow, that sounds like something
straight out of the series.

397
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:45,158
You never think about your own safety, huh?

398
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,860
You're always helping others.

399
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,689
It's lucky nothing happened to you.

400
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,250
Even when I did something good,

401
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,722
you still scolded me, Mom.

402
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:55,452
Please don't be too hard on Lava.

403
00:26:55,892 --> 00:26:59,744
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be alive today.

404
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:04,095
I'm not mad. I'm just worried.

405
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:05,659
I'll eat now.

406
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,391
You really gave a solid background story.

407
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:14,940
So? I'm good at this, right?

408
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,744
I made you look cool in front of my mom too.

409
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,781
My boyfriend is amazing.

410
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:25,585
Now, this chef will make his
very own omelette for you.

411
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,050
Lava looks so happy living here.

412
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:03,830
He gets to be himself
with no expectation or pressure.

413
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,326
That must feel freeing.

414
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,184
Are you talking about Lava
or about yourself?

415
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,883
Why didn't you tell Dad and Mom
you're getting married?

416
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:17,161
They could be here as your family elders.

417
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,487
Wouldn't that be better than having me?

418
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,667
Even if I told them, they wouldn't come.

419
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:29,150
I didn't want to be disappointed.

420
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,334
You should try to understand them.

421
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:34,876
They're old.

422
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,112
It takes time for them to catch up.

423
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:40,497
But if I keep waiting for them to catch up,
when will I get to live my own life?

424
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:43,778
I'd probably end up becoming a civil servant
and marrying their friend's daughter

425
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:48,340
only to feel sorry for her later
and end up divorced.

426
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:53,456
You've got to live the life you wanted.

427
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:57,156
Have you ever asked how I've been, huh?

428
00:29:00,077 --> 00:29:04,014
When you left, I became their hope.

429
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:08,181
I had to have a good husband,
and give them a grandchild.

430
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:14,315
Did it ever cross your mind that
maybe I wanted a life like yours too?

431
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:31,597
I'm sorry, sis, for being selfish.

432
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:36,443
You weren't selfish.

433
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:40,397
It's just that you were brave.

434
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:50,005
Honestly, I'm glad I sent my son
to live with you here.

435
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,950
He looks so happy.

436
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,652
I think he's learned something from you.

437
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:58,432
Come on. He's nothing like me.

438
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:00,420
He's way more hot-headed.

439
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,767
Sometimes he's so hot-headed
that I have to hold him back.

440
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,365
But don't worry about him.

441
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,969
He can get by.

442
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,402
There's only one thing that concerns me,

443
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:24,836
but it's better if he learns it on his own.

444
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:28,856
You're quite the wise talker now.

445
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:42,479
PONGSAKORN & SARAWUT

446
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,870
Thanks.

447
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:52,915
You're taking my son now, Peng.

448
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:54,253
Take good care of him.

449
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:58,455
He's my only son, and I love him very much.

450
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:01,422
I'll take the best care of Dr. Wut.

451
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:07,238
May you love each other for a long time

452
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,098
and not only on the good days.

453
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,599
On the bad ones,
love each other a lot too.

454
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,644
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

455
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,483
Congratulations, Dr. Wut.

456
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:25,208
You finally found your person.

457
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,927
A fake like me could never compare
to the real you.

458
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:30,817
Thank you.

459
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:32,762
Congratulations.

460
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:36,328
Congratulations, Dr. Wut.

461
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:40,346
You don't have to pour water on me, I guess.

462
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:42,281
Of course I do, Uncle.

463
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:44,881
I have to witness your love

464
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,851
and send you off properly.

465
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,629
No more hiding.

466
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,352
Go show it off.

467
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:53,233
Stop teasing me.

468
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,305
Thanks.

469
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,437
You two are the perfect example
of the kind of love I want.

470
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:10,373
You've overcome everything
to be together.

471
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:15,346
I hope you and Dr. Wut.
stay in love forever.

472
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:17,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

473
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,420
Boss! You're leaving me!

474
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,729
You'll belong to someone else now!

475
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,851
Tum, stop being dramatic.

476
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,388
I'm only getting married for a day.

477
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:38,260
I'll be back fishing with you tomorrow,
same as usual.

478
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:42,626
Dr. Wut, please take good care of him.

479
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,202
I love him with all my heart.

480
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,520
If he ever gets hurt, I'll come after you.

481
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,504
Tum, why are you threatening Dr. Wut?

482
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,897
Those two truly love each other.

483
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,514
They'll never leave one another.

484
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,124
Wow, seeing this wedding
makes me want one too.

485
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,720
Kratae, shall we get married?

486
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,323
Learn to have some manners, will you?

487
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,179
Aren't you embarrassed in front of others?

488
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,298
You're a prince.

489
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:04,300
How could you do this?

490
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,839
I don't want to be a prince.

491
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,215
I'd rather be Wave.

492
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:11,629
Then I can be sweet,

493
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,181
do whatever I want,

494
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:19,280
wherever and whenever I want, with you.

495
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,566
Hey!

496
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:32,872
Play like this and you'll get it yourself!

497
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,194
Fine.

498
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,287
Are you challenging me, huh?

499
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:47,594
But you look handsome today.

500
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:49,567
I don't want to mess up my boyfriend's face.

501
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:17,524
BANGSAWAN MOO KRA TA

502
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:25,621
Tonight, I'd like to sing a song for a woman

503
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,324
who feels special to me.

504
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:33,692
She inspires me to be better,

505
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,014
to quit being reckless,

506
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,074
and to dream of building a family
with her in the future.

507
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,784
I dedicate this song to show my sincerity.

508
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,732
I'm so inspired tonight!

509
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:01,594

The fireworks will start soon.

527
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:55,527
Seeing Uncle Peng happy today
makes me feel glad.

528
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,297
That's good.

529
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,477
Now they don't have to hide anymore.

530
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:03,007
Next time, they can kiss each other
on the cheek in front of everyone.

531
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:03,763
Like this.

532
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:13,002
And what about you?

533
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,021
Have you ever thought about marriage?

534
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,324
Marriage?

535
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:20,736
No,

536
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:22,935
not at all.

537
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:29,461
I don't think love needs
any kind of certification.

538
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,833
As long as the two people know,
that's enough.

539
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:36,231
But I think it's not that simple.

540
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,263
No one is born alone.

541
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:45,772
We all have parents and people around us
to care about.

542
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,953
Still, if we live just to please everyone else,

543
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,690
we'll never be happy.

544
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:58,577
Why are you asking?

545
00:39:59,328 --> 00:40:01,300
Do you want to get married, my boyfriend?

546
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:05,092
Yeah, I do.

547
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:10,606
I feel like it's a promise between two people.

548
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,946
They'll love and
take care of each other forever.

549
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:17,661
You don't need a wedding
to make a promise.

550
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:19,899
Really?

551
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:41,811
Ouch!

552
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:44,746
What are you doing?

553
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:45,826
It's an engagement.

554
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:52,212
I promise that no matter what happens,

555
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:55,149
I'll do everything I can to stay with you,
my boyfriend.

556
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:05,309
Ouch! That hurts!

557
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,143
Good. Then you'll remember it.

558
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,209
I promise too.

559
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,679
No matter what happens,

560
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,828
I'll do whatever it takes for us to be together.

561
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,143
No one will ever come between us.

562
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:56,503
Hey, I'll be right back.

563
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,165
I'm grabbing the cake from my motorbike.

564
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,215
I'm getting a little hungry.

565
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:03,645
Wait for me here, okay?

566
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:07,469
Should I come with you?

567
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,911
It's okay. I'll go myself.

568
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:10,699
Stay here.

569
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:41,166
Hello, Tum?

570
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,457
I brought Wave to see the fireworks
at the pier.

571
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:51,544
Yeah, we'll hurry back.

572
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:52,712
Don't get too drunk, okay?

573
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:53,547
Save some for us.

574
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:56,348
Okay.

575
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:21,134
Wave!

576
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:48,823
Wave.

577
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,112
Why Wave?

578
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:53,040
Because the wave brought you to me.

579
00:44:55,635 --> 00:44:59,758
Being alone, not knowing where I come from

580
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:02,113
or having anyone in my life,

581
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:06,988
is worse.

582
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:11,443
I want to have memories I can look back on.

583
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:13,208
I've made my choice.

584
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:16,069
No one can force me.

585
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:01,611
Wave.

586
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,617
Who are you?

587
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,785
Are you seriously telling me
you don't remember anything from the last three months?

588
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:09,354
You just try, then.

589
00:46:09,354 --> 00:46:10,722
I don't even know how to help you.

590
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:16,214
You have to make the prince remember every moment when he used to be Wave.

591
00:46:17,136 --> 00:46:18,659
Have you ever known what hardship is?

592
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:20,535
Being like this, how could you even rule anyone?

593
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:22,409
There's no way I'd ever like someone like you.

594
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,440
You're rude!

595
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:27,696
Even if I only have one day, one hour, or one minute left,

596
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:30,499
I'll make you remember what happened between us.
