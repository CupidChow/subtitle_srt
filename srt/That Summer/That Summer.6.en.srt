If you meet someone who makes you feel good, follow your heart.

5
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:24,670
I didn’t mean to yell at you.

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,158
I’m sorry.

7
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:28,425
I’ve really started falling for you.

8
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,173
Do you really think I’d dump you for the new doctor?

9
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,434
I’ve only known that guy for a few days.

10
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,498
You think I’d throw away a year‑long relationship for that?

11
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:39,600
You said you wanted a real name, right?

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,767
I found one with a nice meaning.

13
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,749
The prince is still alive.

14
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,523
Send someone to deal with this as soon as possible.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,442
Send our best operative.

16
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:52,877
Whoa.

17
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,743
The noodles in front of the temple
are insane.

18
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:55,959
Try the red pork.

19
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:56,726
It’s crazy good.

20
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,046
Let me have some.

21
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,985
Hey, Kratae!

22
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,103
Nooo, give me some.

23
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,035
Hey, I even ordered the special one.

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,197
I like red pork too.

25
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,493
It’s mine. Give me some!

26
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:13,335
That’s enough. I can’t even eat it all.

27
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:15,719
It’s fine.

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,564
I want you to eat a lot so you’ll get bigger.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,176
Get bigger for what?

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,258
I think my body is perfect already,

31
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,325
easy to carry.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,447
I mean, if something happens to me,

33
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,217
whoever helps me can carry me easily.

34
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,613
Mhm, okay.

35
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:39,684
Like Lava—he carries me all the time.

36
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:44,955
He probably means when you helped him.

37
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,172
And I carried him once.

38
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:48,211
I don’t carry him often.

39
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,810
Don’t listen to him too much.

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,910
He doesn’t make much sense.

41
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:54,073
True. Lava only carried me once.

42
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,898
I don’t really like being carried.

43
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:56,968
It’s achy.

44
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:57,468
Huh?

45
00:01:58,517 --> 00:01:59,686
Don’t say anything!

46
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,401
Can you help me buy my roses, please?

47
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,002
Oh, Tong!

48
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,799
Perfect timing for some romance.

49
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,613
How many? I’ll take them all.

50
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,974
Fine. I’ll take one then.

51
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,177
I feel sorry for Tong.

52
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,877
Tong, make sure you focus on your studies as you grow up.

53
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:28,002
Don’t end up like this dude Tum.

54
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,461
Yes, I won’t be like this dude Tum.

55
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,520
-Whoa, this kid!
-Good job, kid.

56
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,395
Here, take the money.

57
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,330
Another 100, please.

58
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,567
Clever, huh?

59
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:44,445
Here you go.

60
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:45,249
Thank you.

61
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,893
Hey, buddy, I’ll give you one.

62
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,324
In case you meet someone you like,
give it to them.

63
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:53,116
As for me, the one I like is already here.

64
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,146
Are you afraid Tum and Kratae
will find out about us?

65
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:17,661
I’m not afraid,

66
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:20,697
but that wasn’t the place to tell them.

67
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,958
Also, I saw Tum flirting with Kratae.

68
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:25,316
I don’t want to steal his spotlight.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,806
You’re sweeter than I thought.

70
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,073
You think about others more than I do.

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,232
I’ve got plenty of sweet sides,

72
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,266
but my bad side hides them all.

73
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,285
Oh, by the way, I’m entering a boxing match.

74
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:51,627
Why would you do that?

75
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,303
For the money.

76
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,341
The winner gets thirty thousand.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,103
Are you short on cash?

78
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,346
What do you need the money for?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,784
I’m going to win back my dad’s motorcycle.

80
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,309
It’s the only thing
that’ll make him proud of me.

81
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,565
I get it,

82
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:31,170
but I really don’t want you to get hurt.

83
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,998
Don’t worry. You know I’m strong.

84
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,567
I’ve got the strength,

85
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,456
but I’m missing something.

86
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:49,522
What’s that?

87
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,564
Someone to cheer me on.

88
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:07,845
For you.

89
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:15,429
Thanks.

90
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,616
I believe in you. You’ve got this.

91
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,409
Come on.

92
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:58,784
Are you trying to make you look
even more handsome?

93
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:01,733
It’s muddy.

94
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,297
I just want people
to always see me looking good.

95
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,294
I don’t even want to think about having to share you with everyone on this island.

96
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:12,242
Don’t worry. I can balance my time—

97
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,729
between public and private duties.

98
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,310
But since you’re are public property,

99
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,365
I kind of get both at once.

100
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,235
Stay over at my place tonight.

101
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:30,616
We haven’t slept together in a while.

102
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,801
I didn’t bring any clothes.

103
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,107
If you don’t have them,

104
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:46,057
then don’t wear any tonight.

105
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:49,980
Wow, you’re taking advantage, huh?

106
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,742
I’d better call home

107
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,531
and say I’m sleeping at the hospital.

108
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:55,939
See?

109
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:58,295
You lie to your family too.

110
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,007
Now do you understand me?

111
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,580
I don’t have to lie.

112
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:07,613
I can call my family and say I’m sleeping
at the future village head’s house.

113
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,672
No, no, okay, fine!

114
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:10,803
I’ll tell them myself.

115
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,204
Alright?

116
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:14,709
Please.

117
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:22,861
Okay, okay.

118
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:26,760
Let’s go.

119
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,235
Hey.

120
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:41,665
What happened? My bike fell over.

121
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,592
I swear I parked it fine.

122
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,835
Help me lift it.

123
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,009
The wind isn’t even that strong.

124
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:03,948
Hey, is that the guy who picked a fight
with you at your dad’s shop?

125
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,488
Yeah, that’s him.
He’s the one who pushed me.

126
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,972
Who the hell are you
to mess with my brother?

127
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,186
Your brother stole that uncle’s money.

128
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,523
That’s between his dad and him.

129
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:16,069
None of your damn business!

130
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:17,297
Hey.

131
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,969
Let’s just go. Don’t start anything.

132
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,704
Hey, nice rose you got there.

133
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,882
Let me see it.

134
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,382
Hey!

135
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,284
You’ve never seen a rose before?

136
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:33,606
If you want one, buy your own.

137
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,148
Hey, asshole, he just wanted to look!

138
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:36,889
Hey!

139
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,601
Wave, run!

140
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,126
Wait.

141
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:49,922
What?

142
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,803
My shoe tore.

143
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,349
Take it off.

144
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:54,849
Huh?

145
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,016
What about you?

146
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,925
Forget it. Hurry up.

147
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:02,829
Come on!

148
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,118
Let’s go.

149
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,491
Where the hell did they go?

150
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,570
Damn troublemakers!

151
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,489
Hey, where are you?

152
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,552
Come out already.

153
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:31,621
Hey.

154
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:37,727
Where the hell are you?

155
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,714
Guys, let’s get out of here.

156
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,634
This is a military zone.

157
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,871
Should we check the other side?

158
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:30,847
I’ve missed this place so much.

159
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,963
I haven’t been here in so long.

160
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,419
The sea smells so nice.

161
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,093
The resort owner’s right here too.

162
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,285
Don’t you miss me?

163
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,881
Do you remember when we first met,

164
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:54,906
when you gave me that vaccine shot?

165
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:57,361
When you pretended
to be scared of needles?

166
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,832
I was scared.

167
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:01,835
That’s why I flirted with you
to distract myself.

168
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,658
I knew it, but I let it slide.

169
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,258
I liked you anyway.

170
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:17,047
You smell so good, young doctor.

171
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:18,408
I’m not that young anymore.

172
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,911
I’m twenty-seven now,

173
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,107
perfect age to start a family.

174
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,359
E?

175
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,973
What’s that supposed to mean?

176
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:31,903
You want to get married already?

177
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:33,972
You want to get married already?

178
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,524
I don’t know. Up to you.

179
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,863
If you get married,

180
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,299
what kind of wedding do you want?

181
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:53,313
Something stylish by the beach,
or traditional Thai style?

182
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,593
Can we do both?

183
00:13:58,663 --> 00:13:59,223
Sure.

184
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,881
I’ll do whatever you want.

185
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:06,227
But can we start with the honeymoon suite

186
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:08,999
and have the wedding later?

187
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:15,554
Uncle Peng!

188
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,421
Uncle Peng!

189
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:18,489
What happened?

190
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,517
You’re lucky. The wound isn’t too deep.

191
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,368
You stepped on a nail,
and the wound is open like this.

192
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:35,696
Be careful of infection.

193
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,370
You’d better get a tetanus shot just in case.

194
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,561
It’s just a small cut. No need for that.

195
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,413
You know a lot, huh?

196
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:47,698
Did you graduate from medical school?

197
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:49,782
Just do what you’re told.

198
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,618
So, tell me what the hell happened.

199
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,498
Those punks at the pier
picked a fight with us.

200
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:01,892
They kicked my bike

201
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,706
and tried to pull a gun on me.

202
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,015
They wanted to kill you over nothing?

203
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,137
Did you do something to piss them off?

204
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,989
Maybe a little.

205
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,836
See? You’ve got a temper.

206
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,731
Don’t you remember what happened before?

207
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,135
I remember.

208
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:20,207
Then why the hell did
you risk your life again?!

209
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,845
Think before you act!

210
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,278
I’m just trouble wherever I go!

211
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:27,377
Fine, I’ll leave!

212
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,236
Hey, wait.

213
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,003
At least your nephew is okay.

214
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,618
Uncle Peng, please don’t be mad at Lava.

215
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,885
He really didn’t mean to start anything.

216
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,950
I know he didn’t mean to.

217
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,397
But whatever he does, he should stay calm.

218
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,846
I just don’t want history repeating itself.

219
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,880
Did he tell you about his dad?

220
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,744
And do you know that
I don’t get along with his mom?

221
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,993
But you’re siblings, aren’t you?

222
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:20,960
Siblings can still clash.

223
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,799
When she said she was sending Lava here to straighten him out,

224
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,694
I swore I’d help him change.

225
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,425
I’ll take better care of him than his own mom.

226
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,619
Even if he’s only staying a few months,
he has to go back as a better man.

227
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,155
What did he do wrong?

228
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,809
Why do you even want to change him?

229
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:37,719
From what I know,

230
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,355
he hasn’t done anything wrong.

231
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:43,672
Even with his dad, he only meant well.

232
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,594
He always protects everyone.

233
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,494
Even tonight, he got hurt protecting me.

234
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:54,409
To me, Lava doesn’t need to change at all.

235
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,640
I just worry about his future.

236
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,949
His dad is gone,

237
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,627
and his mom doesn’t want him.

238
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,749
He’s all alone, just like me.

239
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,405
But he has you,

240
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,503
and he has me too.

241
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,931
Hey, do you want to eat something?

242
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,110
Hey.

243
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,043
Hot rice porridge.

244
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,242
Eat first,

245
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,365
so you can take your medicine
like Dr. Wut said.

246
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,133
I don’t feel like eating.

247
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:17,613
You have to.

248
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,628
The meds will hurt your stomach otherwise.

249
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,166
You had a high fever last night.

250
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:24,320
I had to wipe you down all night.

251
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,465
You undressed me?

252
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:31,401
I told you, you had a fever.

253
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:34,541
Why? Is there something I haven’t seen yet?

254
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:37,063
What are you shy about?

255
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,085
Come on, eat.

256
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:43,816
Here.

257
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:49,277
No, I don’t eat veggies.

258
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:54,333
You get sick
and turn into a five-year-old, huh?

259
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:56,553
Fine, just don’t eat.

260
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,161
Oh, and I washed this for you.

261
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,515
It took forever to get the bloodstains out.

262
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,136
My hands almost peeled.

263
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,069
Why did you wash it?

264
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,330
You could have just thrown it away.

265
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,757
You like it, so I wanted to clean it for you.

266
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,626
You’ll make a mess eating, Little Lava.

267
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,928
You have a fever?

268
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,892
Mm, but I’ll be fine soon.

269
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,524
In a little while, I’ll be able to walk.

270
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,749
Don’t worry. I’m not slacking off.

271
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:01,164
Stop acting tough.

272
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,034
Don’t forget to get that tetanus shot.

273
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,224
Yeah, I know.
No need to keep repeating it.

274
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,350
Wave, come run an errand with me.

275
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,033
What errand?

276
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:13,830
I need to feed Lava.

277
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,810
His foot is hurt, not his hand.

278
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,889
He can eat by himself.

279
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:18,372
Let’s go.

280
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:23,532
You’ll be okay, right?

281
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:25,745
Are you sure?

282
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:26,366
Yeah.

283
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:30,265
Hey, he’s not going to die.

284
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,882
Those two, right?

285
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,150
The ones who picked a fight with you?

286
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,786
Yeah, them.

287
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,677
They’ve had it out for Lava
ever since that rice noodles shop incident.

288
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,588
These punks have been
causing trouble for too long.

289
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:03,335
It’s time I put an end to it.

290
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,464
Hey, Uncle Peng!

291
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,409
What are you doing?

292
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:13,234
Calm down first!

293
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,717
Hey, what the hell?!

294
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:19,028
If you step in, I’ll gut your friend.

295
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,758
You wouldn’t dare.

296
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:21,780
Why wouldn’t I?

297
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,927
I’ll just say you two were high
and attacked me.

298
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,249
Let’s see who they’ll believe.

299
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,012
Wave, grab the knife.

300
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:36,707
You think you’re tough, huh?

301
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,426
I’ve put up with you guys for too long.

302
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:44,995
You ride around bothering folks
and shaking people down.

303
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,097
You’re ruining the island I love!

304
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:48,691
You’ll never be the village head anyway.

305
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:49,628
That’s my business!

306
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,417
But if I do become one, you’re done.

307
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:02,303
If you keep causing trouble,
not just with my nephew,

308
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,608
but with anyone on this island,

309
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,077
you’ll have me to deal with.

310
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,005
Got it?!

311
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:21,803
Quit the drugs already.

312
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:24,820
I know your parents.

313
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:28,782
They work hard while you waste their money on crap like this.

314
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,473
Uncle Peng, wait up!

315
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:46,043
Uncle Peng said to bring the projector out.

316
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:48,037
He’s screening a movie tonight.

317
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:50,696
Where did you go with him?

318
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:52,995
You don’t have to know.

319
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:57,169
Just know that he really cares about you.

320
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:00,172
If he cares so much,
he could talk to me nicely for once.

321
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,811
All he ever does is yell,
like that’s supposed to motivate me.

322
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:06,136
Sometimes, I just need some
straight-up encouragement.

323
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:11,010
People show love in different ways.

324
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,575
As for me, I show it like this.

325
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,965
Excuse me, do you have a room available?

326
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,015
I didn’t book a room.

327
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:43,727
I just happened to pass by
and saw how nice this place is,

328
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:45,407
so I thought I’d try my luck.

329
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,048
We’ve got one last room.

330
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:52,651
Perfect. Can I see it first?

331
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:53,991
Sure, I’ll show you.

332
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,600
Where are you from?

333
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,192
Bangkok.

334
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:02,080
Bangkok? Which area?

335
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:05,528
Sukhumvit.

336
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,925
Oh, Sukhumvit is big.

337
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,786
The beginning, middle, or end?

338
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,368
Around the middle.

339
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:18,730
Which alley?

340
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:21,843
Maybe we’re neighbors.

341
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:23,240
Why are you asking so many questions?

342
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:24,807
You sound like a cop.

343
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,557
Come on. I’ll show you the room.

344
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:29,763
I’ll come too.

345
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:33,958
No need. Your foot is still injured.

346
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:35,918
If you walk too much,
your wound will get worse.

347
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,379
This room faces the sea breeze.

348
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,843
You won’t feel hot at all.

349
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,534
The weather is nice this season,

350
00:25:58,214 --> 00:25:59,629
and the beach is beautiful.

351
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:08,833
Is something wrong?

352
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,317
No.

353
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,610
I’ll take this room then.

354
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:17,736
Sure. How many nights?

355
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,318
Probably three.

356
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,012
Alright, I’ll take care of it.

357
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:25,877
You can pay when you check out.

358
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:27,956
If you need anything, let me know.

359
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,089
I’m helping out at the front desk.

360
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:33,465
How long have you been working here?

361
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:35,352
Not that long, actually.

362
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:39,049
I’m not really staff.

363
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:42,223
They saved my life,

364
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:44,142
so I’m working to repay them.

365
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:45,648
Saved your life?

366
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,846
It’s a long story.

367
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:49,369
You should rest.

368
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:50,733
You must be tired from traveling.

369
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,514
If you need anything, just tell me.

370
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:01,179
I’m Wave, by the way.

371
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,907
Wave?

372
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,416
Yes.

373
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:05,962
Wave—like ocean waves.

374
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,266
Lava named me,

375
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:12,051
both my nickname and my real name,

376
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,923
Nava Mahasamut.

377
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,262
Who’s Lava?

378
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,897
The guy you met at the counter.

379
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,319
He’s the owner’s nephew.

380
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,435
He’s the one who saved my life.

381
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,748
I’m Natee, or you can call me Tee.

382
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,499
Nice to meet you, Tee.

383
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:01,943
This land belongs to Thai people.

384
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:04,011
Foreigners have no rights here.

385
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:07,160
No outsiders! No outsiders!
DON’T STAY SILENT ABOUT LAND OWNERSHIP.
FIGHT FOR COMMUNITY RIGHTS.
RIGHTS OF THE UNHOUSED.

386
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,943
Not allowed!

387
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:13,536
Please, District Chief.

388
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,188
I just want our island to stay ours.

389
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,834
We’ve let too many outsiders
take over already.

390
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,380
Be careful, Peng.

391
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,442
This could backfire on you.

392
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,578
You yourself are from Bangkok.

393
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,570
If you don’t marry a local,

394
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,076
they’ll still see you as an outsider too.

395
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,263
I understand.

396
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:36,172
But please, think of me
as representing the villagers.

397
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:41,745
Then you’d better find a wife soon
and become one of them.

398
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,358
Hello, District Chief.

399
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:45,753
Hi, Mr. Chet

400
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:49,210
Hi, Mr. Peng.

401
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,130
Hello, Mr. Chetta.

402
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,556
Just call me casually as Chet.

403
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,393
Even though we’re rivals,

404
00:28:57,544 --> 00:29:00,391
I see you more as… entertainment.

405
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,227
We’ll see.

406
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:06,975
Maybe we should let the locals decide that.

407
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:11,972
But I don’t think the locals would vote…

408
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,025
someone like you as village head.

409
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:18,801
Someone like me?

410
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:21,588
Like what?

411
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,379
Nothing.

412
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,963
Anyway, as I said,

413
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:32,083
I find you as…entertainment,
adding color to the race.

414
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,257
Excuse me.

415
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:36,028
I’ve got business with the District Chief.

416
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:13,045
Oh, hey.

417
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:14,791
Thanks.

418
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:16,625
It’s nothing.

419
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:18,598
I was just coming to ask for an extra towel.

420
00:30:19,228 --> 00:30:19,843
Of course.

421
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:37,497
I don’t know why,
but you look kind of familiar.

422
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,554
It feels like I’ve seen you somewhere before.

423
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:41,602
Where?

424
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,772
I’m not sure.

425
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,641
Ever since the incident,
my memory has been hazy.

426
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:53,333
You don’t remember anything?

427
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:59,219
It just comes in flashes, on and off.

428
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,047
You don’t remember being….

429
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:05,782
Being what?

430
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:14,734
Wave, open the door!

431
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:19,461
Wave!

432
00:31:22,485 --> 00:31:23,700
Why did you lock the door?

433
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,547
I didn’t.

434
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,486
It must have closed from the wind.

435
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:31,596
Hey, this is a private area.

436
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:32,735
How did you get in here?

437
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,159
I came to give him my ID card.

438
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,303
I’m sorry.

439
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,696
Wave, come with me to the hospital.

440
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,495
I need a tetanus shot.

441
00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:45,815
Why don’t you wait for Uncle Peng
to come back?

442
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:46,955
He can take you.

443
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:49,025
Or call Tum.

444
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,492
Why wait? We don’t have to wait.

445
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:53,497
Dao can watch the resort.

446
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:55,602
But your foot’s still hurt.

447
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:56,707
Are you sure you can drive?

448
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,004
Yes.

449
00:31:58,256 --> 00:31:59,542
You don’t need to worry.

450
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:03,598
Hey, come out already.

451
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:15,920
Let’s go.

452
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,581
See? You can’t do it.

453
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,231
You’re being stubborn.

454
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:33,033
Let’s call Uncle Peng or Tum instead.

455
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,041
No need.

456
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,340
I don’t want to hear him nag.

457
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:37,949
Also, Tum is busy anyway.

458
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,846
Alright, I’ll call a songthaew for you then.

459
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:42,746
I said no.

460
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,387
Stop being stubborn. Look at yourself.

461
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,962
I can help.

462
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:49,866
With your foot hurting like this,
it’ll only get worse.

463
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:51,333
I can drive you there.

464
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,663
It’s fine. You’re on vacation.

465
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,869
It’s really no problem.
I don’t have any plans anyway.

466
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:00,761
It’s fine. I can take care of myself.

467
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:01,683
It’s really no problem.

468
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:02,685
I can go by myself.

469
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:04,998
I’d really like to experience local life
while I’m here.

470
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,187
Let me take you there.

471
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:07,390
I’m fine like this.

472
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,184
Hey, just let him take you, okay?

473
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:12,303
Thanks a lot.

474
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,164
But how are the three of us getting there?

475
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,444
Riding triple is dangerous.

476
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:20,117
I said it’s fine!

477
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:16,794
I told you not to mess with those kids.

478
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,996
You almost ended up a ghost
haunting this island.

479
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:20,837
Can you not yell at me too?

480
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:24,147
I’ve been scolded all day already.

481
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:25,963
Nobody even tried to comfort me.

482
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:26,976
Eh?

483
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:28,600
Then get your partner to comfort you.

484
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,225
Partner? I don’t have one.

485
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,065
Wave isn’t your partner?

486
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,257
You knew?

487
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,907
Of course I knew.

488
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:39,879
I’ve seen everything.

489
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,867
You two are obviously together.

490
00:34:45,272 --> 00:34:46,527
Like you and Tum?

491
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:51,791
Ha! Me and Tum?
We’re more like karmic debts.

492
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:56,827
I just wish he’d grow up
and take life seriously.

493
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:59,301
Then give him a chance.

494
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,399
He’s been trying to change for you.

495
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:04,096
Support his influencer dream a little.

496
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,566
Who knows?

497
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:09,318
He might become
a big online seller someday.

498
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:13,019
You could be dripping in gold chains.

499
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,224
Wow, you’re really on his side, huh?

500
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,488
You two are way too alike.

501
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:19,749
Let me give you another shot.

502
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:20,341
No, no!

503
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:21,652
- One more, okay?
- No!

504
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,346
- Let me do it.
- Stop. I said no!

505
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:24,700
Hey,

506
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,211
you don’t need to lecture me.

507
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,945
Worry about yourself.

508
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:32,513
Taking advantage to make him your boyfriend while he remembers nothing?

509
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,437
Be careful.

510
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:35,928
One day, someone may reclaim him.

511
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:46,189
You don’t have to wait for us.

512
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,233
We can head back ourselves.

513
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,946
I think Lava is feeling better now.

514
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,168
It’s fine. I can wait.

515
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,537
I really don’t have plans.

516
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,611
I’d like to get to know this place
and you a little better.

517
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,484
There’s nothing that interesting about me.

518
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,479
But I find you interesting.

519
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:16,084
All done.

520
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:18,701
Let’s go home.

521
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:32,378
Are you sure you can drive?

522
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:34,281
You’re not going to crash on a turn, right?

523
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:36,202
I told you, I’m fine.

524
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:37,784
This wound is nothing.

525
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:42,955
If you can go back,
I’ll go my own way here.

526
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:46,070
Where are you going?

527
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,122
Just to a nearby beach.

528
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:50,616
I want to find a beautiful sea to swim in.

529
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:53,113
There are plenty of beaches here,

530
00:36:53,637 --> 00:36:55,710
but I know one I want to recommend.

531
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,103
It’s really beautiful and private.

532
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,203
Should we take him there?

533
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:01,881
You’re really volunteering yourself, huh?

534
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,630
He didn’t even ask for help.

535
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,443
Why bother?

536
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:08,366
If you want us to take you,
I’ll have to charge a guide fee.

537
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:10,128
Why would you charge him?

538
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,750
He came alone.

539
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:15,747
Also, he’s the one
who drove you to the hospital.

540
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:19,481
It’s okay, really.

541
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:23,922
Lava must be tired. He should rest.

542
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:26,317
Rest?

543
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,237
He just said the wound is nothing.

544
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,178
Come on, let’s go.

545
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:35,200
Ugh.

546
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,727
You’re right, this beach is stunning.

547
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:11,763
Thanks for bringing me here.

548
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:13,875
I’m going to go for a swim.

549
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,560
Wow, you’re in great shape.

550
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,894
What do you do for work?

551
00:38:28,346 --> 00:38:30,362
I used to be a soldier.

552
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,583
That explains it.

553
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,757
I wish I had a body like yours.

554
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,842
Didn’t you say the other day
you liked your own body just fine?

555
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:37,779
You said you’re small, easy to carry.

556
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,534
You don’t want to be carried anymore, huh?

557
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,385
But he’s in such good shape.

558
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,286
Look. He’s perfectly lean.

559
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:45,601
Not that much.

560
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,166
Just wait until I bulk up.

561
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,290
I’ll be huge like King Kong.

562
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,006
Do you want to go swimming together?

563
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,101
Sure. We came all this way.

564
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,276
Take care of it for me.

565
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,032
My watch too.

566
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:08,269
I’m coming too.

567
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,386
Don’t.

568
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:12,261
Your foot is not fully healed yet. Stay here.

569
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:15,577
Let’s go.

570
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,046
Hey!

571
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:28,233
Don’t hold hands!

572
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,488
Wave, let go!

573
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:34,131
Back off a bit. That’s too close!

574
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:37,035
Wave!

575
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,603
The sea here really is beautiful.

576
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:59,774
I told you. Everything here is amazing.

577
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,081
Don’t you ever think about
finding your family?

578
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,129
I tried.

579
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:13,645
I just wonder if there’s anyone left.

580
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,721
I just want to know if there’s anyone
who really loves and cares about me.

581
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,106
I don’t get why no one ever came
looking for me.

582
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,499
Maybe they’re just waiting for the right time.

583
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:29,512
The right time?

584
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:32,353
What time are you talking about?

585
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:38,869
It’s fine though.

586
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:42,278
I’m happy here.

587
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:48,737
I’ve got friends, a job I like, good food,

588
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,705
and a boyfriend.

589
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:58,922
You should try living here for three months.

590
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,233
You might feel like heaven just like I do.

591
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:44,776
Lava!

592
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:50,533
Wave!

593
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:53,211
Wave!

594
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:56,290
Wave!

595
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,097
Wave!

596
00:41:58,905 --> 00:41:59,570
Wave!

597
00:42:01,234 --> 00:42:01,966
Wave!

598
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:03,625
Wave!

599
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:07,717
Wave!

600
00:42:08,983 --> 00:42:09,682
Wave!

601
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,013
Wave!

602
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:14,016
Wave!

603
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,834
Wave!

604
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:15,740
Wave!

605
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:16,762
Lava!

606
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:21,267
Wave!

607
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:23,848
What happened?

608
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,234
I went out to swim and got a cramp.

609
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:35,724
Good thing Natee helped me,

610
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,289
or the waves would’ve carried me far out.

611
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,621
I didn’t even notice.

612
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:44,001
The waves were too strong.

613
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:45,427
Let go.

614
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:52,624
You’re not a strong swimmer.

615
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:54,518
How did you go that far out?

616
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:57,965
I got a bit carried away.

617
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:04,230
Right side hurting, right?

618
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:26,471
Feeling any better?

619
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,400
You can’t do this.

620
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:35,176
I was worried sick.

621
00:43:37,274 --> 00:43:39,607
You know you’re not a strong swimmer,
yet you still mess around.

622
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,172
You can’t mess around with the sea.

623
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:49,585
No matter what,

624
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,893
no outsider can protect you better than I can.

625
00:44:00,497 --> 00:44:04,526
So if you’re going somewhere,
I need to be there with you.

626
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:07,342
Yeah.

627
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:36,881
Eh?

628
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,740
Hey, why are you coming in here?

629
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,861
Wait until I finish showering.

630
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,065
I’m showering with you.

631
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:50,278
Your foot’s injured, right?

632
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:52,006
Can it get wet?

633
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:53,607
Never mind.

634
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:56,338
No, don’t.

635
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:00,721
Why?

636
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:04,526
Are you rushing to smell good
to watch the movie with that foreign guy?

637
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,196
Are you jealous of me and Natee?

638
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,235
Yes, very jealous.

639
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,291
I did it on purpose.

640
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,166
Whoa, that’s sneaky.

641
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,311
I wanted to test you too.

642
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:26,021
You can test me, so I can test you.

643
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,641
I already protected you from those thugs.

644
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:30,264
Isn’t that proof enough?

645
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:37,831
I just want to know what we are.

646
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,836
Life debt to repay?

647
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:46,573
Friends helping at the resort?

648
00:45:48,786 --> 00:45:52,269
Or just your holiday romance?

649
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:56,290
We’re boyfriends!

650
00:45:57,702 --> 00:45:58,681
Boyfriends!

651
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,770
You’re my boyfriend!

652
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,876
Boyfriend!

653
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:07,221
Hey. I got it.

654
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:20,892
Even though Natee saved my life today,

655
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:25,494
it can’t compare to you giving me a new life.

656
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:44,362
I’ll scrub your back.

657
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,246
How do people without partners
even do that?

658
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:57,864
I don’t know. I have a boyfriend.

659
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,000
Tong, can you wait for me
to graduate next year?

660
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:24,005
Then we can start fresh.

661
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:26,160
Yeah.

662
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,515
I can wait for you.

663
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,868
I hope we won’t mess this up again.

664
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:44,333
I hope we grab this chance.

665
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:57,176
If you ever get to date your crush,
where would you take them?

666
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:02,888
Me?

667
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:03,950
Uh-huh.

668
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:08,897
Someone like me, with no money,
can’t do anything fancy.

669
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,443
At most, I’d just take them out on a boat,

670
00:48:15,443 --> 00:48:18,191
go diving to see the coral and pufferfish,

671
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:22,555
cook a meal from the fish I catch,

672
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,933
then end the night catching squid and watching the stars together.

673
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:34,247
That actually sounds like your kind of low-budget romance.

674
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:36,764
But who would want that with me?

675
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:42,011
Who knows?

676
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,170
Maybe one day I’ll want to try dating you

677
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,171
because I like diving

678
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:50,507
and stargazing out at sea.

679
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,828
But I don’t like you.

680
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:06,372
I must be crazy if I don’t.

681
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,845
- You idiot!
- Ouch.

682
00:49:11,175 --> 00:49:12,476
Just eat.

683
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:16,922
You’re the most beautiful on this island.

684
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,048
Doc, I think people already know about us.

685
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:41,516
They were talking about it at the market
and at the district office.

686
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:45,734
You really heard that?

687
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:48,517
They were even teasing.

688
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,753
Do you think the director knows?

689
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,365
He hasn’t said anything to me.

690
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,951
I think you shouldn’t worry.

691
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:08,955
It’s better if others know.

692
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,673
We don’t have to hide.

693
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:16,084
Running from problems has no end.

694
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:18,295
Let’s face them together.

695
00:50:19,872 --> 00:50:20,638
Alright?

696
00:50:26,884 --> 00:50:27,820
Don’t overthink it.

697
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,912
Why are you up so early?

698
00:51:03,406 --> 00:51:05,191
I’m helping you cast nets.

699
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:07,061
Don’t bother calling Tum.

700
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:09,391
He took Kratae out
for late-night tea yesterday.

701
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,048
Is your foot all healed now?

702
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:19,303
Yeah. I know I can’t stay weak for long.

703
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:30,430
Anyway, thanks a lot for handling those guys
who came to pick a fight.

704
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:32,481
Wave told me everything.

705
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,763
I was just doing my job.

706
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:37,502
If I’m going to be village head,

707
00:51:37,643 --> 00:51:39,691
I’ve got to keep everyone safe.

708
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:42,833
Don’t act all cool, Uncle.

709
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:44,810
My house registration isn’t here.

710
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,973
I can’t vote for you.

711
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:48,517
You little punk.

712
00:52:02,145 --> 00:52:03,076
Hey!

713
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:05,424
What’s that, Uncle?

714
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:15,545
What’s going on?

715
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:20,953
Stay in the car, okay?

716
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:26,539
Wait. What if he’s a thief?

717
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:27,268
Hey!

718
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:31,566
Help! Somebody help me, please!

719
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:32,579
Uncle!

720
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:36,365
Help!

721
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:39,932
Please help me!

722
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:50,114
Uncle, watch out!

723
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:11,165
Hey!

724
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:30,520
BANGSAWAN ISLAND SCHOOL

725
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:37,847
You don’t have to be jealous anymore.

726
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:41,671
Natee checked out this morning.

727
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:45,762
He booked three days but stayed only one.

728
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:49,744
I guess he didn’t like the island that much,

729
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:54,547
or maybe he’s just scared of you.

730
00:53:55,889 --> 00:53:58,006
Scared? I haven’t even done anything.

731
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,258
I kind of wanted him to stay.

732
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:03,911
I like it when you get jealous.

733
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:11,629
Come pick me up later, okay?

734
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:12,748
Yeah.

735
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:24,210
Wave!

736
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,596
Hmm? What is it?

737
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:35,985
I finished work today, so I asked Uncle Peng
to let me watch you.

738
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:42,036
Wait. What did you just call me?

739
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,459
You, in a polite way.

740
00:54:49,555 --> 00:54:50,406
Well,

741
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:55,173
we’re dating now, right?

742
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,624
I just want to sound polite,

743
00:54:57,624 --> 00:54:58,729
like you always do with me.

744
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:04,234
But it doesn’t feel right.

745
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,477
It doesn’t sound like you at all.

746
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:11,183
Honestly, I don’t mind.

747
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,114
I like you better when you’re rough.

748
00:55:18,468 --> 00:55:20,458
No, I want to talk nicely.

749
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:26,728
Alright then, whatever you want.

750
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:54,763
Lava, look.

751
00:55:55,069 --> 00:55:57,347
Aomsin’s gotten so much better at playing.

752
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,888
I bet he’ll get into
the provincial school for sure.

753
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:04,178
I wouldn’t be this good without you, Teacher.

754
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:07,683
You’ve been practicing hard, Aomsin.

755
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,255
Give yourself credit, not me.

756
00:56:10,396 --> 00:56:12,169
Whoa. You’re so cool!

757
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:24,130
Dance with me.

758
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:26,681
I’m so happy today.

759
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,135
Oh, come on.

760
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,055
I learned it in high school,

761
00:56:33,585 --> 00:56:35,821
but I can’t dance anymore.

762
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:37,489
It’s fine.

763
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:39,863
No one is judging.

764
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,234
Just dance with how you feel.

765
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:48,417
Princess Anya sent me here
to see if her younger brother,

766
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,416
Prince Davin, is safe.

767
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,484
Prince who?

768
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:59,441
Prince Davin, heir to the throne of Arantha.

769
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:04,560
Prince Davin?

770
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:07,714
The one you know as Wave.

771
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:28,226
You’re saying Wave is a prince?

772
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:29,265
Yes.

773
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,657
I think he was attacked and lost his memory.

774
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,633
I don’t believe it.

775
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:42,595
You made that up, didn’t you?

776
00:57:43,136 --> 00:57:44,837
I also wish it weren’t true.

777
00:57:45,284 --> 00:57:48,043
But right now, the prince’s life is in danger.

778
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:52,293
The prince’s family has been imprisoned
in the palace by the rebels,

779
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:54,052
cut off from the outside world.

780
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:03,133
If everything you said is true,

781
00:58:03,463 --> 00:58:04,686
what do you want us to do?

782
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:08,568
Please take care of the prince
the best you can

783
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:10,817
until things in the palace settle down.

784
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,657
After that, I’ll come back to take him home
as soon as possible.

785
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:18,404
You trust us?

786
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:21,781
Of course. I can read people.

787
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:26,690
I can see how much you both
love and care for him.

788
00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:36,349
But from now on, you must act normal.

789
00:58:36,938 --> 00:58:39,321
Never let the prince discover
who he really is.

790
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:49,532
What are you thinking about?

791
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:56,655
That I’ve never danced before.

792
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:00,956
This is my first time.

793
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,366
How does it feel?

794
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,529
Feels good, right?

795
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:14,115
Trying something new for the first time.

796
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:30,236
It’s also my first time

797
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:43,442
feeling love for someone.

798
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,420
I love you too.

799
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:36,993
You’re just an ordinary guy.

800
01:00:36,993 --> 01:00:38,379
He’s a prince.

801
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,196
I want you to be ready for that, okay?

802
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:42,230
Can I just not cut it, Uncle?

803
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,772
I’ve got an important job, watching over my prince.

804
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,032
FAGGOT
Who do you think did it?

805
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,346
Probably a rival.

806
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:50,900
I guess they saw Uncle Peng getting popular.

807
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,747
Come out and talk, Peng!

808
01:00:52,747 --> 01:00:54,897
You’ve been seeing my son for a year behind my back!

809
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:56,240
You really humiliated me!

810
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,446
I just saw Wave kiss your cheek.

811
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,744
Are you sure you’re just friends?

812
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:00,989
He’s my boyfriend

813
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:02,941
I like it when you’re this gentle.

814
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:05,845
You’re the only one who gets to see me like this.
