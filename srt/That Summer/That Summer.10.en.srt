4

Even if I only have one day, one hour, or one minute left,

5
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:27,021
I'll make you remember what happened between us.

6
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,390
Can you and Dr. Wut adopt my daughter as your own?

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,280
If another child joins the family, I'm ready.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,222
Let's go file the papers at the district office.

9
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,194
From what you've shown me,

10
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:41,315
Lava and Wave must have shared so many good memories together, right?

11
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:43,959
Did you remember everything?

12
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,124
Can I try something?

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,588
It's a lot clearer now.

14
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,840
You should get some rest, Prince.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,925
Tomorrow I'll take you
to see the sunrise at dawn.

16
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:06,062
At dawn?

17
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:07,701
Will that be okay?

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,760
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:13,485
When you dragged me out at 5 a.m.,
I literally fell asleep under the sun.

20
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:15,771
That does sound familiar.

21
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:20,112
Fine. Then I'll go to bed early tonight.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,763
Then I won't bother you tonight.

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,760
Lava!

24
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:36,605
I couldn't reach you at all.

25
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,279
Uncle, what?

26
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,429
There was barely any signal on the island.

27
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:42,404
Someone came to see you, Prince.

28
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:44,495
Who?

29
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:50,755
Anya!

30
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,571
Davin!

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,263
Davin,

32
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,630
I thought I'd never see you again.

33
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,942
Same here.

34
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,764
How did you get here?

35
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,466
Where are Father and Mother?

36
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,571
I wanted to come get you myself.

37
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,875
Father and Mother are fine.

38
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,710
Things in Arantha have calmed down.

39
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:33,715
Paolo and our soldiers already handled General and his men.

40
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:39,825
We have the people here
to thank for capturing Victor.

41
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,307
It gave us leverage.

42
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:47,417
Paolo told me everyone here
took great care of you.

43
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,381
I want to repay them.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,577
Everything on the table is a local specialty.

45
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,600
I asked the best cook on the island to prepare it.

46
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,331
Thank you.

47
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,386
You looked after Davin,
and now you're taking care of me too.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,628
Would you like a lot of rice?

49
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,320
Half is enough for me. I don't eat a lot.

50
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:16,827
Thank you.

51
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:26,815
This is too much for me.

52
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,055
I can't finish all this.

53
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,296
You usually eat a lot here,

54
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,297
especially when the food is spicy.

55
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,810
I thought you didn't like spicy food.

56
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,122
I can handle it.

57
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:46,644
Well, here, the spicier it is, the more he eats.

58
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:53,168
Um… enjoy your meal.

59
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,121
Hey, wait.

60
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:57,676
Where are you two going?

61
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:58,379
Sit and eat with us.

62
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,245
There's so much food.

63
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,671
Davin and I can't finish it.

64
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,493
We'll eat at another table.

65
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,083
No, stay.

66
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,652
I have so many things

67
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:07,771
I want to ask about Davin,

68
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,510
like how spicy he likes it.

69
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,573
Oh, it's not that.

70
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:16,164
I mean how fun things were.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,043
Please excuse me.

72
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,800
Lava! Where are you going?

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,501
I'm sorry he's being rude.

74
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,323
Please start eating first.

75
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,716
Give me your arms, Your Highness.

76
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:01,753
And your legs.

77
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,657
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

78
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,326
You might get sick.

79
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,134
Thank you.

80
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,213
Princess, would you like some too?

81
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,403
Oh, no, it's alright.

82
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,841
Enjoy your meal.

83
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:34,613
Thank you.

84
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,590
Everyone here really took good care of you,

85
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,141
especially Lava.

86
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:52,068
He served your food

87
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,620
and wouldn't let mosquitoes bite you.

88
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,702
We should hire him as
a royal guard in Arantha.

89
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,781
You teased me because
you've figured it out, haven't you?

90
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,522
Do you realize you've never been able
to hide your feelings?

91
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:11,472
So how does that matter now?

92
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,892
We're leaving tomorrow anyway.

93
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:19,036
Just when everything started coming back,
I'm out of time.

94
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,318
Then what do you want to do?

95
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,280
Stay longer?

96
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:23,674
I can leave first.

97
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,551
I can't. Father and Mother are worried.

98
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:39,946
You never know how many times in your life you'll find someone who loves you.

99
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:43,045
If you get the chance, hold on to it.

100
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:45,846
I can't hold on to it.

101
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,736
We live so far apart.

102
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,642
If he can't come up to you,

103
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:55,789
then you come down to him.

104
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,843
Make the most of the time you have left.

105
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:04,261
Every second matters.

106
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:07,990
One day it'll all become a precious memory.

107
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:13,579
Now go to bed.

108
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:52,892
You can't sleep?

109
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,505
It's hot.

110
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,714
What about you?
Why aren't you asleep?

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,614
You have to wake up early for the boat.

112
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,358
I know. Stop reminding me.

113
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,980
Are you upset that I suddenly have to leave?

114
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,587
How could I be upset?

115
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,829
It's good that you're going home.

116
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,604
You've been away for months,

117
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:25,895
living on an island,

118
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,569
scrubbing boats.

119
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,775
You should be in a palace,

120
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,875
drinking tea, playing polo,

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,062
and doing charity work.

122
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:41,710
Hey, don't be sarcastic.

123
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,756
I'm not. I mean it.

124
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,000
No matter how hard I try,

125
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,915
it doesn't change anything.

126
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,638
What if I want to be the one trying?

127
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:28,094
If this is our last night together,

128
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,239
can we make it a night
we'll remember forever?

129
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,289
The princess might see us.

130
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,395
You don't have to worry.

131
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,757
My sister knows.

132
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,194
She's seen how obvious you are.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:58,286
I'm not very good at hiding my feelings.

135
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,712
I'm the same.

136
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:08,556
If you feel something, then do it.

137
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,103
Who knows when you'll get another chance?

138
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:17,694
I came down here for you.

139
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,182
Won't you take the chance?

140
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,999
Can I hug you as long as possible?

141
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:56,252
Thank you again
for taking care of my brother.

142
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,508
It's our pleasure, Princess.

143
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,085
I may not remember much,

144
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,850
but I can feel that during my time here,

145
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,679
I truly received help and love from all of you.

146
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:13,639
And congratulations on the new family.

147
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,039
Thank you.

148
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,730
You're always welcome back here.

149
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:28,193
Lava, aren't you going to see the prince off?

150
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:29,724
No.

151
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,400
They'll be fine without me.

152
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:39,338
They will, but the prince will be sad

153
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:42,746
if the most important person to him
isn't there.

154
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,870
I don't want the last thing
I see to be him leaving.

155
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:01,345
It feels like I'll never see him again.

156
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:06,274
All the more reason to end things well.

157
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:12,928
Let the last image he takes from this island
be you sending him off with a smile,

158
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:14,122
not tears.

159
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:19,012
Think about it.

160
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:31,609
I still need time to rebuild our friendship.

161
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,184
If you miss us,

162
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,857
you can check social media.

163
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,536
Follow me, and I'll follow you back.

164
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,202
Of course.

165
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:46,523
So you two are officially dating now?

166
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,569
Go on. Say it.

167
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:51,944
Tell him.

168
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:54,039
I just said yes,

169
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,360
but we're only trying it out for now.

170
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,541
I need to see if he becomes
more responsible first,

171
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,619
and I'll decide what to do then.

172
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:04,500
Don't worry, Your Highness.

173
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,488
When I get married,
you have to be the guest of honor.

174
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,345
We'll have a honeymoon trip in Arantha.

175
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,807
Please lend me your palace.

176
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:13,806
That's too much, Tum.

177
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:15,438
Of course.

178
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,355
He just gave us permission.

179
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,388
Honeymoon in the palace!

180
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,618
Study hard, Aomsin.

181
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:26,059
Practice a lot.

182
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:28,453
Even if you're already good,

183
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,908
you still need to practice.

184
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:30,413
Yes.

185
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,232
Don't compete with anyone.

186
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,477
Just compete with yourself.

187
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:35,302
Yes, Teacher Wave.

188
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,035
Uh, Your Highness.

189
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:41,048
I'll practice hard
and become a world-class musician!

190
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,144
Will I get my head chopped off?

191
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,966
Lava asked me to say goodbye for him.

192
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:02,058
He just has some family matters
to take care of.

193
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,622
Bye!

194
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,621
Prince! Wait for me!

195
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,336
Prince!

196
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:09,118
Prince! Wait for me!

197
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:10,791
Prince!

198
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,206
Prince! Wait for me!

199
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:47,354
Whatever happened here, leave it here.

200
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:54,344
These last three months meant a lot to me.

201
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,607
I know, but you and he
live in different worlds now.

202
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:01,806
No one can take away what you two had.

203
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,914
It'll always stay with you.

204
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,308
But you have to get your own life back.

205
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,041
How long have you been back?

206
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,217
Why didn't you let me pick you up?

207
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,748
I was afraid you were busy.

208
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,971
I didn't want to trouble you.

209
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,967
Trouble? I'm your mother.

210
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,938
Don't you think I miss you too?

211
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,459
You're becoming more like Peng.

212
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,780
You're always wanting to do things yourself
and prove yourself.

213
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:05,652
But sometimes I wish you'd tell me things.

214
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,513
Ask for help.

215
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:14,098
I want you to know I worry about you.

216
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,294
Talk to me once in a while.

217
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,287
Okay, okay. I know.

218
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:26,741
Peng told me about your dad's motorcycle.

219
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,833
I'll get the money and buy it back myself.

220
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,794
No. I'll work and earn money.

221
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:35,036
See? Before I even finish talking!

222
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:39,168
Fine. I'll help you find a job.

223
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:42,011
Your dad's friend just opened
an architecture firm.

224
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,988
No. I'll find one myself.

225
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:49,670
No. Let me help you this time.

226
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:53,742
Alright, alright.

227
00:20:59,156 --> 00:20:59,788
Mom.

228
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:01,092
What?

229
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:07,578
Do you still miss Dad?

230
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:11,675
Of course.

231
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,085
Every day.

232
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:18,569
Some days I miss him so much I cry.

233
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,553
So what do you do?

234
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:32,914
Nothing. I just keep living.

235
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:35,985
It becomes a part of life.

236
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,184
There were so many good memories.

237
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:42,291
I don't need to forget them.

238
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,615
It's better to keep them and cherish them.

239
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,283
Davin, what song are you playing?

240
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,353
I've never heard it before.

241
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:46,829
I heard it in Thailand, Father.

242
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:53,495
While we were locked up in the palace,

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,848
Davin got to go to the beach,

244
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:58,182
swim, and play the piano.

245
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,658
Our summers were really different, weren't they?

246
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:03,452
Please don't say that, Father.

247
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:05,781
If nothing had happened to me,

248
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:08,019
I would've hurried back
to Arantha right away.

249
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,960
Davin, do you remember
meeting Kate when you were little?

250
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,083
When the ambassador was stationed here?

251
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,225
You two were so close.

252
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,178
You ran around the palace together all day.

253
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,239
I remember a little, Mother.

254
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,165
But it was so long ago.

255
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:32,164
You even taught me how to play guitar,

256
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:34,980
but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it.

257
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:37,320
I couldn't even read music notes.

258
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,270
Music really isn't my thing,

259
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:44,694
unlike you, who are number one at it.

260
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,600
That's the only thing I'm good at.

261
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,274
I can't do other things,

262
00:23:55,905 --> 00:24:00,036
like doing laundry,

263
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:03,523
scraping boats,

264
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,131
riding motorbikes, or cooking.

265
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,831
Why would we ever need
to do those things, Davin?

266
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:16,935
We have people who do that for us.

267
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,406
But scraping boats?

268
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,969
Why would we ever need to scrape boats?

269
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,429
Maybe you just miss the beach.

270
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:35,387
If you go again, take Kate with you.

271
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,336
She knows a lot about Thailand.

272
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:41,701
Her father was stationed there for years.

273
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:47,054
I think you two will have a lot to talk about.

274
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:03,573
That must be a scam caller.

275
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,844
Ugh!

276
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,405
You scam caller! Go to hell!

277
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,177
(Lava, it's me.)

278
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,672
Me? Who? I'm not your friend to mess with.

279
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:29,494
It's Davin.

280
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:39,852
Prince Davin?

281
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,184
Yeah.

282
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,335
So? Will you still tell me to go to hell?

283
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:48,505
No. I'm sorry.

284
00:26:48,698 --> 00:26:50,506
I thought it was a scam call.

285
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:55,827
Um… why did you call me?

286
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:59,598
I watched Tum's video.

287
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:03,839
And I saw the part where you were helping pull the shoe off my leg.

288
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:05,871
It was so funny.

289
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,720
I don't remember anything.

290
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:11,893
Oh, we were having a water fight that day.

291
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:14,203
Your foot got stuck in the shoe.

292
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,886
I pulled and pulled and couldn't get it off.

293
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,612
In the end I had to use soap.

294
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:23,198
It was hilarious. I still remember it.

295
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,357
When I watched Tum's videos again,

296
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,539
everything I saw was just fun stuff
we did together.

297
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:35,064
You miss those moments, right?

298
00:27:39,382 --> 00:27:42,964
If you do, you can call me anytime.

299
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,293
I still have tons of fun stories to tell you.

300
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:48,935
Will you even have time?

301
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:55,132
For you, I'll always have time.

302
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,044
Ouch!

303
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:12,928
Don't hit snooze.

304
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,928
Get up and go to work.

305
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:16,938
Ugh… what?

306
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:18,849
Give me ten more minutes and I'll leave.

307
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:23,216
You're the one who said the later you leave,
the worse the traffic gets.

308
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:26,933
What time is it?

309
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,007
It's almost nine.

310
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,961
If I were rich, I'd wake up in the afternoon.

311
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:35,178
Ow!

312
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:36,102
You know what they say?

313
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:39,791
Early birds get the first worms.

314
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:41,976
Have you ever heard this one?

315
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:46,764
Late birds get fed by the early birds.

316
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,221
Stop messing around. Go shower.

317
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:51,382
Okay, okay.

318
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:52,771
Then get up.

319
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:53,787
- I know.
- Faster.

320
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:57,395
Okay, okay. Fine, Your Highness!

321
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,839
You want to turn FaceTime off first?

322
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:04,346
Call me back after you shower.

323
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:07,146
No need. What's there to be shy about?

324
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,309
We've showered together before.

325
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,914
I'm not shy.

326
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:13,246
If you're brave enough to show it,
I'm brave enough to watch it.

327
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:15,367
Oh, you said it yourself.

328
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:16,701
Here. Look as much as you want.

329
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,840
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Look as much as you want.

330
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,320
What? Then I'll call you back later.

331
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,558
What? You're not so bold after all, huh?

332
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:24,473
Look at me.

333
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm showing off my muscles.

334
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,219
So how are you these days?

335
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,895
I'm good.

336
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:35,556
I'm in my probation period,

337
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:39,245
designing houses, condos,
coming up with new concepts.

338
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:41,500
The company's pretty open-minded.

339
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:44,583
That sounds fun.

340
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:50,905
I'm still catching up on charity work
to make up for the time I was gone.

341
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,397
Father wants people to like me more.

342
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:58,631
I have to meet so many people.

343
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,085
I'm tired of putting on a face.

344
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,766
People already like you.

345
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,934
You're both handsome and talented.

346
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,621
What about you? Do you like me?

347
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:14,134
It's more than ‘like' at this point.

348
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,588
Hey, Lava! Who're you talking to?

349
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,681
Your babe?

350
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:21,857
Lava?

351
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:24,588
No. I'm working.

352
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:25,506
Working?

353
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,484
Your eyes are sparkling at your screen.

354
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:32,496
Dust, bro. My eyes are dry.

355
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:33,662
Dust, huh?

356
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,995
I'll tell Aui to buy an air filter.

357
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,053
Okay.

358
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,162
Move left a bit.

359
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:54,621
Left.

360
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,907
More to the left.

361
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,963
Hey, your left, not mine!

362
00:30:58,963 --> 00:30:59,815
Your left.

363
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,478
Then explain it to me in detail.

364
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,269
Too far.

365
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,464
Right a little.

366
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:05,221
Right. Right.

367
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:07,584
Davin, give the photo some life!

368
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:10,036
You're sitting still like a corpse.

369
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:10,885
Hey.

370
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,987
Just tell me what pose you want.

371
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,774
Or just fly here and adjust me yourself.

372
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:20,734
Don't challenge me.

373
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,333
I'm not challenging you.

374
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,381
Come for real.

375
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,237
Hey, listen up.

376
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,956
Stretch your legs so they look long.

377
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:36,126
Why are you shrinking them?

378
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,856
Bring your knee up.

379
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:42,884
Create a triangle with your shoulders
to give a good posture.

380
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,588
Lift your sleeve a bit.

381
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,359
Your hand disappears otherwise.

382
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,336
This angle, okay?

383
00:31:59,082 --> 00:31:59,848
How is this?

384
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,662
Much better.

385
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,540
I look the same to me.

386
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:14,441
Lately I've been dreaming
about the island a lot.

387
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,106
What do you dream about?

388
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:20,359
I dream we're driving together,

389
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:24,491
drinking coffee, watching the sunrise.

390
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,798
That wasn't a dream.

391
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:30,000
That happened. It was insanely romantic.

392
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:35,512
I wish I could close my eyes
and feel it more clearly.

393
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:43,657
I'll never get to do something like that again.

394
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:48,450
Wave is so lucky, unlike Davin,

395
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,220
who's stuck alone in this palace forever.

396
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:57,738
What if I come to the palace?

397
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:01,980
Are you serious?

398
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,062
Don't give me hope like that.

399
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:06,456
I'm serious.

400
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:08,825
I always mean what I say
and do what I say.

401
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:12,834
Then your dream can finally come true.

402
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:39,736
Thank you.

403
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:45,801
Hello, Mr. Lava.

404
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:47,915
Welcome to Arantha.

405
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:49,516
How have you been?

406
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:53,565
Hi, Paolo. I'm good.

407
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:55,581
Whoa.

408
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,408
You look cool in full uniform.

409
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:00,964
You're not scared of me anymore?

410
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:03,264
A little.

411
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:05,989
The image of you shooting that guy
is still in my head.

412
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,763
You're scarily accurate.

413
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:13,467
You might need to train for that
if you're staying with Prince Davin.

414
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:18,269
I'm the type who uses my heart,
not weapons.

415
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:21,447
You're so handsome.

416
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,563
Lava!

417
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:35,092
How are you?

418
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,673
Are you tired from the flight?

419
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:38,635
Not at all.

420
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,248
I could fly even longer,
if someone's waiting for me.

421
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:44,746
You're starting here already.

422
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:47,988
Let's go inside.

423
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,783
Father and Mother are waiting.

424
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:51,554
Okay.

425
00:34:53,454 --> 00:34:54,518
Thanks, Paolo.

426
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:06,639
Follow me.

427
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:23,178
You helped our family so much.

428
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:26,009
We must honor you with a title.

429
00:35:27,113 --> 00:35:29,988
Give him a big one, Father.

430
00:35:29,988 --> 00:35:33,695
He took care of Davin like a VIP.

431
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,795
It's okay, Your Highness.

432
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:43,750
I'm here because Prince Davin
Everett Delroy of Arantha invited me.

433
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,974
No need for the full name.

434
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:49,776
We're friends. Just call me Davin.

435
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,792
I even memorized it.

436
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:56,433
Lava doesn't want anything, Father.

437
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,539
He just wanted to visit

438
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:00,777
and spend time with me.

439
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:03,735
Make sure you take care of him well.

440
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,115
Let me know if you need anything.

441
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:08,895
Since he came all the way here,

442
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:12,094
we should take good care of him,
just like he took care of us.

443
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,391
I'll take good care of him, don't worry.

444
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,393
Arantha's reputation is safe.

445
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,630
I'll make him not even want
to go back home.

446
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:31,584
Come in.

447
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:46,607
This room is huge.

448
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:50,058
Big or not, I'm still sleeping alone.

449
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,860
It's still better than the resort.

450
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,319
We had to squeeze into that tiny bed.

451
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:59,556
But that was warm. I liked it more.

452
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:58,500
It's weird.

453
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:02,982
I feel like it's my first time,

454
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:08,117
but you said we've done it
many times already.

455
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:11,728
Of course.

456
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:15,123
I remember every part of you.

457
00:38:15,636 --> 00:38:20,083
I know exactly where each part is
and what your scent smells like.

458
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:23,383
Hey, enough.

459
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:24,984
I believe you now.

460
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:26,832
You have a great memory.

461
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:35,787
I'll try to make time to take you sightseeing.

462
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,185
But we probably can't go just the two of us.

463
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,907
Guards must be accompanying us.

464
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,395
Then we won't have any time alone?

465
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,096
We'll have to meet in secret rooms
or hidden places.

466
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,184
I don't want people to suspect anything.

467
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,918
Now I understand how Dr. Wut felt
dating Uncle Peng.

468
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:04,010
Please understand me.

469
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:11,965
Like I said, Father wants me
to rebuild my reputation since I was away.

470
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,207
Image is important.

471
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:27,162
Then can I go to work with you?

472
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,686
Would you like that?

473
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,847
It's basically just charity stuff

474
00:39:36,002 --> 00:39:39,031
and visiting kids in hospitals.

475
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:43,111
I'd love it.

476
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,647
I love kids, and kids love me.

477
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,585
But what would your role be?

478
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,716
My friend? My boyfriend?

479
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,444
Or my royal bodyguard?

480
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:59,075
Anything you want.

481
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,626
I'm ready to follow your orders.

482
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:19,020
I've been training in music since I was five.

483
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,998
I played both guitar and piano.

484
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:24,537
Music helps me focus.

485
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,975
And I use it to let out my feelings,

486
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:30,787
whether I'm happy,

487
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:40,445
sad,

488
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,770
angry,

489
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:01,875
or even in love.

490
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:17,068
So, who here wants to be a musician?

491
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:18,769
Me!

492
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:26,126
Kids, look over here.

493
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,471
This way, please.

494
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,084
Look at this camera, please.

495
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,730
Boy, could you move a little closer?

496
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,392
That's right.

497
00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:39,206
I'm sorry. Could you step aside a bit?

498
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,603
You're in the frame.

499
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:42,253
I'm sorry.

500
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:45,281
You can include Lava too.

501
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,127
He's my friend from Thailand.

502
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:54,563
It's okay. I don't want to trouble you.

503
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,885
Please go ahead.

504
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,380
But I want you in the photo.

505
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,940
Come closer.

506
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:13,079
Look at the camera.

507
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,879
One, two, three.

508
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,509
Kids, smile.

509
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:48,085
Hey, can I ask you something?

510
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,765
Why didn't you come to send me off?

511
00:42:53,997 --> 00:42:55,636
You left me waiting at the pier for so long.

512
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:00,075
I did go, but I was late.

513
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:02,767
I'm not good at saying goodbye.

514
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:06,094
I didn't want our last moment
to be a sad one.

515
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:08,362
I wanted to remember us happy.

516
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:10,583
You can choose what to remember?

517
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:13,386
That must be nice.

518
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:18,321
People like you can get happy so easily.

519
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,228
Easily? Not at all.

520
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:22,190
Who said that?

521
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,825
Before you called me, I was totally a mess.

522
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:28,859
I have a heart too, you know.

523
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:36,727
Are you sulking?

524
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:44,530
You're kind of cute when you sulk.

525
00:43:54,695 --> 00:44:00,168
You know what helps me remember everything that happened on the island?

526
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,544
Songs.

527
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,571
The song I used to listen to on
Uncle Peng's CD player.

528
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:15,113
When I came back here, I looked it up.

529
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:21,792
I remembered I used to listen
to this song with you.

530
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:07,058
♪ The sky, the sea, and the breeze exist ♪

531
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:13,937
♪ ฺBut who would know my heart? ♪

532
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:19,598

♪ The sun that shines so bright ♪

00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:29,574
♪ The moon and stars you dream of ♪

535
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:58,143
Hey, you're a prince now.

536
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,229
Do you still have to be scared
of your subordinates?

537
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:05,272
I just don't want them gossiping
that I'm on a date with a friend.

538
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:12,889
♪ I'll bring the moon and stars
you've dreamed of ♪

539

♪ And place them all in your hands ♪

541
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:37,659
That's good.

542
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:39,461
Your shot is pretty accurate.

543
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:41,167
You just need a bit more practice.

544
00:46:42,656 --> 00:46:43,906
Thank you, Your Highness.

545
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,682
I want to get even better,

546
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,099
so I can protect the person I love.

547
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:53,034
Good.

548
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,253
As men, it's our duty to protect women.

549
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:07,947
Your Majesty.

550
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:10,147
You're right on time, Kate.

551
00:47:11,816 --> 00:47:13,671
Is there anything you'd like me
to do for you, Your Majesty?

552
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:16,143
Nothing much.

553
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:23,026
I want you to help advise Davin
on diplomatic communication.

554
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:26,727
He'll soon have to take the throne,

555
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:31,380
and I want him guided
by someone experienced.

556
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:35,634
Of course, but I'm not that good yet.

557
00:47:38,612 --> 00:47:41,852
Kate, this is Lava.

558
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:46,568
He's my friend from Thailand.

559
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:47,759
Hello.

560
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:50,691
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lava.

561
00:47:57,469 --> 00:48:00,536
Davin, take Kate inside.

562
00:48:00,818 --> 00:48:02,997
Lava and I will continue shooting.

563
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:21,747
The ambassador's daughter is exactly
the type of woman who suits Davin.

564
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,408
Don't rush, Father.

565
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:35,830
Let Davin decide for himself.

566
00:48:56,495 --> 00:48:58,041
The ambassador's daughter is cute, isn't she?

567
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:03,413
I'm sorry I never told you about this.

568
00:49:05,698 --> 00:49:06,792
I get it.

569
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:10,168
The king wants his son
to marry a beautiful woman.

570
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:14,100
But you're not actually
going through with it, right?

571
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:29,841
Don't tell me you'd really marry someone
you don't feel anything for?

572
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:31,118
Would you lie to her?

573
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:32,733
Then what do you want me to do?

574
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:35,609
My life isn't that simple.

575
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:36,532
It's simple.

576
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:38,246
You're the one making it complicated.

577
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:42,046
So you think if I just walked in
and said I like men,

578
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:44,536
everything would be fine?

579
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,933
That we'd get a happily-ever-after?

580
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:51,879
You're making it sound too easy.

581
00:49:53,214 --> 00:49:55,312
You never have to think about anyone.

582
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:57,302
You never have anyone
you need to think about.

583
00:49:57,302 --> 00:49:58,608
That's the right thing to do.

584
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:00,562
Why should we live for other people?

585
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,536
Why be a puppet with no feelings,
no happiness?

586
00:50:03,998 --> 00:50:05,298
What do you want me to do?

587
00:50:06,428 --> 00:50:09,051
My life was set for me—

588
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:12,875
what I must do, what I must be,

589
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:15,395
and even who I must love.

590
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:18,965
We can choose our own path.

591
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:20,739
We don't have to listen to anyone.

592
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,828
I used to think Prince Davin and Wave
were the same person,

593
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:33,465
but now I don't think so

594
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,465
because Wave is so much braver.

595
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:38,655
How could you say that?!

596
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:41,641
Wave has nothing to lose.

597
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:43,311
He has no past to remember.

598
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,052
His whole life is only you!

599
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:21,617
I'm sorry.

600
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:25,969
I didn't mean to insult you.

601
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:33,614
Sometimes I wish I could be brave like you.

602
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:39,378
Uncle Peng once said
I should try to understand others,

603
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,197
not just myself.

604
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,270
But I never thought our story
would end up like this.

605
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:00,861
I came all the way here,

606
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:05,893
but in the end,

607
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:11,390
what we had was only a summer memory.

608
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:24,572
I think I'll go back to Thailand.

609
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:34,187
You don't want to stay with me anymore?

610
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,255
I do.

611
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:41,479
But if I stay,

612
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:45,840
both of us will be even more uneasy.

613
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:52,450
Then can you wait for me?

614
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,374
I don't know how long it'll take,

615
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,361
but I'll try my best.

616
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,227
When you're ready, you can come back.

617
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:07,901
I'll be waiting in my place.

618
00:53:10,905 --> 00:53:11,857
Wait for me.

619
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:15,930
Just give me some time.

620
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:22,705
I promise.

621
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:25,203
I'll wait for you.

622
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:00,694
ONE YEAR LATER

623
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:25,209
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

624
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,319
I would've closed the shop for you.

625
00:54:27,546 --> 00:54:29,102
Then it wouldn't have been a surprise.

626
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:31,806
Man, you've changed Honey's bar so much.

627
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,082
I didn't think you had such good taste.

628
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,670
It's not his taste, but mine.

629
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:39,121
We just spent his money.

630
00:54:43,778 --> 00:54:49,970
Tum, I've noticed your TikTok followers
have gone up a lot.

631
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,478
I've been creating
couple content with Kratae.

632
00:54:52,478 --> 00:54:54,445
The shop got popular
and customers increased.

633
00:54:54,445 --> 00:55:00,206
You know, the money I used to take over Honey's place
all came from those couple videos.

634
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:03,500
And once Kratae got on camera…

635
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,213
Don't say it.

636
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:07,225
Now she wants to be a TikTok star.

637
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,291
And Honey?

638
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:13,317
She's abroad now.

639
00:55:13,317 --> 00:55:14,196
She's got a foreign boyfriend.

640
00:55:14,196 --> 00:55:16,537
She's moving to Germany
and getting married.

641
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:18,486
How lucky she is!

642
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:19,244
Yeah.

643
00:55:19,953 --> 00:55:22,036
Everyone's lucky in love.

644
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:23,773
Guess I'm the only one.

645
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,823
So you're really not talking
to Prince Davin of Arantha at all?

646
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:35,981
No.

647
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,368
He has his world,

648
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:42,312
and I have to move on with mine.

649
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:45,255
It's okay, Lava.

650
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:49,134
I'm sure someday you'll meet the person who's truly right for you.

651
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,256
Mm.

652
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:51,328
It's fine.

653
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:53,610
I'm not trying to replace him anyway.

654
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:55,613
Memories can't be replaced.

655
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:58,985
Oh come on, stop pulling it into sadness.

656
00:55:58,985 --> 00:56:00,115
No more.

657
00:56:00,285 --> 00:56:03,828
Since you're here, we're getting drunk.

658
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,703
Drunk again?

659
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:08,652
It's a special occasion.

660
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:10,680
Our friend's here, right?

661
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,529
You always use that excuse.

662
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:18,469
Last time was a special occasion,
and today is another special occasion.

663
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:22,937
Oh, Kratae, look at our friend's face.

664
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:23,985
Look.

665
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:26,401
He looks like a sad puppy.

666
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:28,734
Just a little, okay?

667
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:29,980
Fine.

668
00:56:35,555 --> 00:56:37,187
Do you want one?

669
00:56:38,635 --> 00:56:41,388
He has already planned where the kid will study—

670
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:44,157
kindergarten, primary, secondary.

671
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,289
The baby's only a few years old.

672
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:49,650
We have to plan ahead, Doc.

673
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:51,608
Our kid deserves the best.

674
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:57,216
Do you want one?

675
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:01,429
So, Dr. Wut, how's work at the hospital?

676
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:04,802
It's much better.

677
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:06,990
We just got new medical equipment

678
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:09,766
and funding to build a patient ward.

679
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:13,869
Thanks to donations
from the prince's foundation.

680
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,399
Prince?

681
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,052
Prince Davin.

682
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:20,619
He didn't tell you?

683
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:30,078
Ever since I came back,
we haven't contacted each other at all.

684
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:37,726
He sent people to donate money
to both the hospital and the school.

685
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,971
We built a huge new music room.

686
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:42,359
He must really love this island.

687
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,630
If you have time, you should go see it.

688
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:49,509
Alright. If I have time, I'll go.

689
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:54,006
So how long are you staying?

690
00:57:55,482 --> 00:57:58,848
Until Uncle Peng's new resort is finished.

691
00:57:58,848 --> 00:58:00,499
I already quit my job,

692
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:01,835
so I'll probably stay for months.

693
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:04,628
Make yourself at home.

694
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:06,561
Your room's still the same.

695
00:58:09,883 --> 00:58:11,448
Then I'll excuse myself for now.

696
00:58:12,044 --> 00:58:12,733
Yeah.

697
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,585
Sweetie, do you want this?

698
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:25,004
Here you go.

699
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,334
Do you want some milk?

700
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:29,987
Daddy will go get your milk, okay?

701
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,372
It's alright. I'll do it myself.

702
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:05,824
Are you asleep, Davin?

703
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:09,184
No. What's up, Anya?

704
01:02:21,233 --> 01:02:23,047
Take good care of yourself.

705
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:24,466
A big event is approaching.

706
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,162
I know.

707
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:32,663
I'm just letting my mind wander.

708
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,650
Wandering all the way to that island
in Thailand too?

709
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,062
I know you miss him a lot.

710
01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:53,798
But since things have come this far,

711
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:58,269
and if you've made your choice,
then you have to live with it and be happy.

712
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:08,614
So that means I have to lie to myself
for the rest of my life?

713
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:15,655
Davin, what matters most is your happiness.

714
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:23,164
But no matter what you choose,
someone will be affected.

715
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:30,005
If you choose to be Arantha's king,

716
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,125
I'll stand by you

717
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:36,575
and fight anyone who tries to hurt us.

718
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,908
But if you choose love,

719
01:03:42,867 --> 01:03:44,642
I'll also be right here,

720
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,115
listening to all the sweet stories
you brag about,

721
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:52,893
and giving advice
when you're sulking at Lava.

722
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:03,327
So you won't think I'm too selfish?

723
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:05,867
Not at all.

724
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:10,035
I see it as bravery.

725
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:18,119
And more importantly,

726
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,446
no matter what happens,

727
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:22,761
keep this in mind.

728
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:25,781
I'll never leave you.

729
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:54,761
Then can you help me with something?

730
01:04:58,963 --> 01:04:59,990
What is it?

731
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,108
Why did you call us in so late at night?

732
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:08,002
Say it, son.

733
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,910
You can tell us anything.

734
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,048
Father, Mother…

735
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,248
I can't be the next king of Arantha.

736
01:05:28,103 --> 01:05:30,704
Why, son? What happened?

737
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:36,069
It's a position inherited
under the rules of Arantha,

738
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,414
and I don't believe
I have the qualities to be a good king.

739
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:44,739
But you're my son.

740
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:46,268
Why wouldn't you be able to?

741
01:05:49,477 --> 01:05:51,014
I'm a prince

742
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:55,027
who doesn't want a princess by his side.

743
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,203
I'm a prince

744
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,165
who wants a prince of his own instead.

745
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:30,719
I respect what you've built,

746
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:34,398
and I respect our royal bloodline,

747
01:06:36,386 --> 01:06:38,157
but that's not who I am.

748
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:42,667
I just want to live with the person I love.

749
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:53,408
That's all I am.

750
01:06:57,127 --> 01:07:02,347
And I want everyone to accept me.

751
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:20,768
Son, I've never been disappointed in you.

752
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,268
Life's too short to keep lying to yourself.

753
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:32,145
Being a prince doesn't just determine
who you'll love.

754
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:38,326
It's more about
having the courage to accept yourself.

755
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:55,143
I'm sorry if I made you feel pressured,

756
01:07:57,386 --> 01:07:59,456
especially about finding you a partner.

757
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:04,158
Give me time to learn.

758
01:08:06,657 --> 01:08:08,189
I love you,

759
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:15,193
and you'll always be Arantha's heir.

760
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:30,456
Anya, you knew?

761
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:32,805
Why didn't you tell me?

762
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:36,996
For something like this,

763
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:41,025
it's better to let the person say it himself.

764
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:52,213
You mentioned the person you love.

765
01:08:52,951 --> 01:08:53,990
Who is it?

766
01:09:03,586 --> 01:09:08,840
The one who gave me a new life, Father.

767
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:22,592
I still have something else to say.

768
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:23,521
What?

769
01:09:24,486 --> 01:09:26,259
More surprise?

770
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:34,880
I believe the one who should rule
Arantha next is Anya.

771
01:09:36,129 --> 01:09:39,991
Davin, let's talk about this later.

772
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:44,156
If I don't say it, you never will.

773
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,308
Anya led our family through the crisis.

774
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:56,363
I think she's the most suitable person.

775
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:02,523
Even if our rules never had this,

776
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:08,589
I think it's time for a change.

777
01:11:09,273 --> 01:11:10,113
Hey!

778
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:17,555
Prince!

779
01:11:17,924 --> 01:11:18,641
Prince!

780
01:11:21,168 --> 01:11:22,093
Prince!

781
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:23,474
Prince!

782
01:11:23,928 --> 01:11:25,033
Prince!

783
01:11:25,544 --> 01:11:27,307
Hey, Prince!

784
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:32,183
Aren't you going to save me?

785
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:39,561
How did you get here?

786
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:46,273
I took a boat, but it broke apart.

787
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:50,445
So I ended up
washed ashore on this island by chance.

788
01:11:51,126 --> 01:11:52,517
Stop joking.

789
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:54,266
How did you get here?

790
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:55,798
Where are your bodyguards?

791
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,146
No one came.

792
01:12:01,339 --> 01:12:02,873
I came alone.

793
01:12:04,435 --> 01:12:06,280
And more importantly,

794
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:09,893
I'm staying here.

795
01:12:11,806 --> 01:12:13,552
How can you stay here?

796
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:15,668
Who's going to rule Arantha?

797
01:12:17,286 --> 01:12:19,418
The one who's more suitable than me.

798
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:25,529
Someone like me belongs with the sea,

799
01:12:26,352 --> 01:12:30,010
the mountains, the nature,

800
01:12:33,758 --> 01:12:35,677
and the person I love.

801
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,266
Hey.

802
01:12:41,436 --> 01:12:43,392
Don't tell me you ran away from the palace.

803
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,315
I'm not involved. I don't want trouble.

804
01:12:45,315 --> 01:12:46,787
I didn't run away.

805
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:51,429
My family lets me do what I want now.

806
01:12:52,764 --> 01:12:54,619
I can go wherever I want

807
01:12:55,926 --> 01:12:58,796
and love whoever I want.

808
01:13:00,897 --> 01:13:02,759
I can do anything that makes me happy,

809
01:13:02,986 --> 01:13:06,221
and they'll be happy too.

810
01:13:12,865 --> 01:13:16,977
Here, I'm not Prince Davin.

811
01:13:18,823 --> 01:13:23,637
But I'm Wave, Nava Mahasamut,

812
01:13:26,363 --> 01:13:28,466
the one who belongs to you, always.

813
01:13:40,811 --> 01:13:45,250
If our first kiss was the one
where I saved your life,

814
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:00,979
then this one…

815
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:04,437
you saved mine.

816
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:10,884
Then let's keep kissing
for the rest of our lives.

817
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:49,132
I told you I'd make it grander
than Uncle Peng's, right?

818
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:52,551
Here it is.

819
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:55,120
I want to propose in the middle of the ocean.

820
01:14:58,357 --> 01:15:01,940
You carry the ring with you all the time?

821
01:15:04,381 --> 01:15:05,769
Of course I do.

822
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,971
You never know when the moment will come.

823
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:19,131
Wave, will you marry me?

824
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:34,996
Well, since I gave up the throne,

825
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:38,132
I guess we're getting married.

826
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:49,250
Excuse me.

827
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:13,286
From now on, my life belongs to you.

828
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:16,712
It's “our.”

829
01:16:18,984 --> 01:16:20,872
Our lives belong to each other.

830
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:07,076
Whoa.

831
01:18:07,076 --> 01:18:09,336
We've actually been through a lot
since the very first day.

832
01:18:09,336 --> 01:18:11,921
- Oh, we went through so much —
- Exactly.

833
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,143
- The sea.
-The heat.

834
01:18:13,143 --> 01:18:14,004
- The sand.
- The island.

835
01:18:14,004 --> 01:18:14,504
The wind.

836
01:18:14,504 --> 01:18:15,070
The rain.

837
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:15,855
The palace.

838
01:18:15,855 --> 01:18:17,052
The house.

839
01:18:17,052 --> 01:18:17,565
The kids.

840
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:19,385
Yes, but everything has passed now.

841
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:20,959
Please look forward to watching it.

842
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:24,380
All the actors and the whole team
put so much effort into this

843
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,300
even though they're not here
to speak right now.

844
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,419
They've already gone home —

845
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:28,587
they're totally fine, by the way.

846
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:30,206
So yes, please support us, everyone.

847
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:31,324
Yay!

848
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,667
Thank you.
