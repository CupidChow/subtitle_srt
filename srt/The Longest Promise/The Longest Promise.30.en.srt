19
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,195
I'm willing to tell you

20
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:01,074
everything I know.

21
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:07,074
After it!

22
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:18,834
This is an illusion.

23
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:20,035
Don't let your mind be distracted.

24
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,114
That's strange.

25
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:24,195
I used sweet Osmanthus just now.

26
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:25,195
If we follow the scent,

27
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,834
we should be able to find the entrance.

28
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:38,834
Shi Ying?

29
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,350
(Lang Gan, Emperor Xingzun)

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,435
Who are you?

31
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,995
Didn't you already know who I am,

32
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:15,954
Shi Ying?

33
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:19,155
It's really you.

34
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,234
I killed him.

35
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:32,715
The Ice Clan had served its purpose.

36
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,354
They no longer have my protection.

37
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,315
So there's no need to fear them anymore.

38
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,514
Emperor Xingzun,

39
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,114
you're indeed still alive.

40
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:45,794
Yes.

41
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,394
I'm still alive.

42
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:50,995
It's because

43
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:55,195
of my obsession with Bai Wei.

44
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:57,674
That's why

45
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:01,674
I've been living like a walking corpse

46
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:03,794
for a thousand years.

47
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:05,834
If you have such an obsession with her,

48
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,354
why did you conspire with the Ice Clan

49
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:09,954
and destroy

50
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:10,875
what you both created,

51
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:11,834
the glorious Kongsang era?

52
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,275
Kongsang has fallen

53
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,754
and can no longer be called
a glorious era.

54
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,314
I can't stand by

55
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,515
and watch all the efforts Bai Wei
and I made

56
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:25,955
go to waste.

57
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,395
That's why I want to destroy it myself

58
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:33,754
and rebuild order.

59
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,955
Only then I can give back to Bai Wei

60
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:38,754
the prosperous Yunhuang

61
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,515
she never forgot

62
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:45,395
until her death.

63
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,794
You're so infatuated

64
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,354
with Empress Bai Wei.

65
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,114
It's not an infatuation.

66
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,635
It's deeply ingrained in my heart.

67
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,395
You came to kill me.

68
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:05,955
It was you

69
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:07,314
who ignited the resurgence
of the Ice Clan.

70
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,155
I'm the Priest of Grand Preceptor
from Jiuyi Mountain,

71
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,194
and I'm also a citizen of Kongsang.

72
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:13,955
Anyone who is an enemy of Kongsang,

73
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:14,915
even if

74
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,554
that person is you,

75
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:19,515
I'll fight against them.

76
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:21,475
Yes,

77
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:24,314
you're a citizen of Kongsang.

78
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,075
You're the chosen one,

79
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,554
the chosen Emperor of Kongsang.

80
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,114
I am not.

81
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:36,955
Back then,

82
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:39,754
I let Bai Wei down

83
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:41,674
despite her unwavering love for me.

84
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,354
I made her misunderstand me,

85
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,874
and I pushed her further
and further away.

86
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,595
I spent decades

87
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:51,554
loving her

88
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:53,595
but spent a thousand years

89
00:05:57,155 --> 00:06:00,874
regretting my mistakes.

90
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,475
Do you know this heartbreaking pain?

91
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:06,835
You won't understand.

92
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:08,635
Once,

93
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:11,915
we stargazed together,

94
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,434
and I asked her

95
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:15,994
if the nearest star to us

96
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,635
was an unreachable distance.

97
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:22,674
She held me

98
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,715
and comforted me, saying,

99
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:27,475
"No,

100
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,794
as long as you reach out your hand,

101
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,515
you can touch it."

102
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:38,754
But I pushed her away

103
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,754
step by step.

104
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:43,715
Now, you've seen

105
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:44,715
how I ended up.

106
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,114
I've been drifting in this world

107
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,715
for a thousand years.

108
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,114
I'm very tired.

109
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,354
I knew you would come to me.

110
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,234
So I've been waiting for you.

111
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,434
I know everything

112
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,635
that you've done.

113
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,674
Now that you're here today,

114
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:14,915
I can finally

115
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,395
let it go.

116
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,234
You can choose

117
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,955
to be a ruler

118
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,595
or choose to be someone

119
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:29,075
who assists the ruler.

120
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:30,674
With you,

121
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,354
Kongsang has a glimmer of hope.

122
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:37,035
Then I

123
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,475
can peacefully go

124
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,955
and meet her.

125
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,314
Come.

126
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,434
Do it,

127
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:01,794
my child.

128
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:05,554
Come.

129
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,635
Emperor Xingzun,

130
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:17,595
please rest in peace.

131
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:40,954
Where did he go?

132
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,515
I was worried sick.

133
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:46,395
Are you okay?

134
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:48,594
I'm fine.

135
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:49,834
Let's go.

136
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,275
What's inside?

137
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,554
Where's Wu Xian?

138
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:54,875
Did you see the sage?

139
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:58,594
The sage was none

140
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,155
other than Emperor Xingzun.

141
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,194
He developed an obsession

142
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:03,554
because of Empress Bai Wei.

143
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,554
So he used the Ice Clan

144
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:06,755
to deal with Kongsang.

145
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:08,674
Then...

146
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:09,794
Then where is he now?

147
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:14,635
He has ascended
to the realm of immortals.

148
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:20,635
The Ice Clan has lost his protection,

149
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,314
and the leader of the Ten Sorcerers,
Wu Xian,

150
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:24,834
was also killed by him.

151
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,395
The Ten Sorcerers will collapse

152
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,714
and the Ice Clan is no longer a concern.

153
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:30,674
The current crisis

154
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:32,035
that Kongsang is facing

155
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:33,635
is only the Merfolk Marine Force now.

156
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:36,474
Thrust!

157
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:39,755
One!

158
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:41,674
Strike!

159
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,355
Thrust!

160
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:45,275
One!

161
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,434
Stop right there.

162
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:55,194
Releasing these captives hastily

163
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,554
may lead to unforeseen consequences.

164
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:58,915
It's better

165
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,674
if I bring them back to Ye City
for thorough interrogation.

166
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,074
General Bai.

167
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:14,474
General Bai,

168
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,155
I'm here on the orders of Prince Shi Yu

169
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:18,355
to investigate

170
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,794
the identities
of these Merfolk marine force soldiers.

171
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:21,395
If they're

172
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,434
just ordinary soldiers,

173
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:24,474
they'll be sent home

174
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:25,594
to reunite with their families.

175
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:27,554
Thank you for your help, General Qing.

176
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,035
But these Merfolk marine force soldiers

177
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,314
are all cunning and deceitful.

178
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,714
You may excel
at leading troops into battle.

179
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,515
But interrogation methods
require skills.

180
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,355
If not executed properly,

181
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:42,434
our efforts may go to waste.

182
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,115
The total number
of Merfolk marine force captives

183
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:47,794
is less than ten thousand.

184
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,074
But at the very least,
there are eight thousand.

185
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,714
I'm willing to share
some of the burden with you.

186
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:54,275
It's all right.

187
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,755
There are laws in our country,
and the military has its regulations.

188
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:00,074
Moreover, the Priest of Grand Preceptor
has instructed us

189
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:01,635
not to abuse them

190
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,115
with private punishment.

191
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:06,635
General Bai,

192
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,674
it's a large number
of Merfolk Marine Force soldiers.

193
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,355
I need to start dealing
with them immediately.

194
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:14,834
Take them away.

195
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:30,954
If we treat the Merfolk well,

196
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:32,635
it won't be long

197
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,515
before this battle comes to an end.

198
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,995
Then how can I
achieve military accomplishments?

199
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:41,155
Shi Ying,

200
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,235
I'll remember

201
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,554
what you and your disciple

202
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:47,635
owe me.

203
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:54,794
You did it.

204
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:56,954
I'm glad I didn't let you down.

205
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,635
Shi Yu is currently overseeing
the withdrawal of troops.

206
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,594
However, it'll take some time
to restore the relationship

207
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:04,594
between the two clans

208
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,314
to what it was before.

209
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,155
But I've obtained an imperial decree

210
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:10,875
that guarantees the safety
of the civilians.

211
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,515
Refugees

212
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,755
who have lost their homes in the chaos

213
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:16,635
can seek assistance

214
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,954
from local authorities.

215
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,194
Whether they are Merfolk
or Kongsang people,

216
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:22,954
they will be given the same treatment.

217
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,834
Thank you for being thoughtful of us.

218
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:28,834
I hope that after this battle,

219
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:30,115
there will be no more conflicts
between the two clans.

220
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,395
May peace reign in Yunhuang.

221
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,275
After the war has ceased,

222
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,594
Sea Emperor must fulfill

223
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,635
his promise.

224
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:41,594
Farmers have their own fields.

225
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,794
Weavers have their own looms.

226
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,995
Everyone should have a home.

227
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,194
The elderly and the young
have someone to rely on.

228
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,434
People are wise and knowledgeable.

229
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,035
Those who speak have no fear.

230
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:54,755
Everyone can utilize their abilities
to the fullest extent.

231
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:55,954
Learning from the past
while embracing new progress.

232
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,275
These will ensure the long-lasting haven
and well-being of the citizens,

233
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,474
The country will also be prosperous
and stable.

234
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:15,515
Now that the matter of the Evil Star
has been resolved,

235
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,474
So after this,

236
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,194
shouldn't you leave the priesthood?

237
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,355
Fortunately, I have the foresight

238
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:21,995
and have chosen a pet name
for you earlier,

239
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,395
Ying Ying.

240
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,235
How about it?

241
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:25,755
Does it sound like Zhu Zhu?

242
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:26,915
Isn't it a good match?

243
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,674
Who's Zhu Zhu?

244
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:31,915
Who else?

245
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:32,875
It's Zhu Yan, of course.

246
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:34,995
After you leave the priesthood,

247
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:35,915
your relationship will change.

248
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,314
Perhaps it's time to change

249
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:38,594
how you address each other as well.

250
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:39,875
Stop talking about it anymore.

251
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:41,755
Can you honestly say

252
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,635
you didn't leave the priesthood
because of her?

253
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,635
Do you dare to deny
that you leave the priesthood

254
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,355
because you want to be with her?

255
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:47,714
I do.

256
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:49,554
Now that's more like it.

257
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:50,674
But

258
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:51,434
Zhu Yan has been

259
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:52,635
the one pursuing you.

260
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:54,434
You have always been free
from worldly desires

261
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:55,395
and truthful without pretense.

262
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,635
So how do you plan

263
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,594
to explain it to her?

264
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:01,155
I'm indeed

265
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:02,515
not skilled in this matter.

266
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,755
If I were to express my feelings
to her rashly,

267
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,434
I'm afraid it would scare her.

268
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,074
I should wait until
after I leave the priesthood

269
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:10,995
before making any decisions.

270
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:12,395
What kind of joke are you making?

271
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:13,594
Are you afraid of scaring her?

272
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:15,194
Do you think

273
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:15,915
she's a delicate woman?

274
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,074
You're actually afraid
of scaring yourself.

275
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:19,314
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

276
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:20,915
Lord Chong Ming.

277
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,314
I heard you talking

278
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:24,834
about Princess Zhu Yan just now.

279
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,275
If it weren't for her mediation,

280
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:28,594
perhaps

281
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:29,755
we wouldn't have been able
to trust each other.

282
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,635
The war wouldn't have had room

283
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:33,194
for resolution so quickly.

284
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:34,115
Yes.

285
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:35,834
The ceasefire

286
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,155
was thanks to her.

287
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,275
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

288
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,635
I know there are some things
I shouldn't say.

289
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:43,594
But I have to say them.

290
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,235
The happiest time
in Princess Zhu Yan's life

291
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:46,355
was

292
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,155
when she became your disciple

293
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,434
and lived with you on Jiuyi Mountain.

294
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:54,554
But the most painful time for her

295
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,915
was when you expelled her
from Jiuyi Mountain,

296
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,395
thinking

297
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,515
that she would never see you again
in her lifetime.

298
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,155
I watched her grow up

299
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:03,194
little by little

300
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,434
and took care of her like family.

301
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:07,594
Now, I have to go

302
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:08,434
and serve my clansman.

303
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,714
I can't stay by her side all the time

304
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:11,915
to take care of her.

305
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:13,395
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

306
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:15,235
You're the one

307
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,355
who truly brings her happiness.

308
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,275
Since there will be peace in the future,

309
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:21,235
I hope

310
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:22,355
she'll never shed tears again.

311
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,035
That's my only wish.

312
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,474
I've said things I shouldn't have.

313
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:33,275
So I'll punish myself with three drinks.

314
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,515
I promise you.

315
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:57,235
Please sit down.

316
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,314
As Merfolk, we can live
for hundreds of years.

317
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,275
So we're used to facing life and death.

318
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:05,995
I thought I wouldn't care

319
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,155
about anything anymore.

320
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:08,395
But recently,

321
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,674
I couldn't help but think of the past.

322
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,474
Do you remember

323
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,074
the heartbreak I mentioned to you

324
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,515
about hiding in the Western Huang

325
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,074
for over two hundred years?

326
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:20,995
Yes.

327
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,115
The last time Kongsang and the Merfolk

328
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,474
signed a peace treaty,

329
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,515
it was presided over

330
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,554
by the woman I love.

331
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,875
She was the Chief of the Crimson Clan,

332
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:32,115
Chizhu Feili,

333
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,875
who was also Zhu Yan's
great-grandmother.

334
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:38,235
It happened over two hundred years ago.

335
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:40,235
The first time I saw her,

336
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:42,954
she was dressed in red,

337
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,554
with a heroic demeanor.

338
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:46,554
Her swordsmanship was outstanding.

339
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,155
It was unforgettable.

340
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,194
Did you stay with the Crimson Clan

341
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,515
because of this?

342
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,594
Chizhu Feili,

343
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,355
the Sword Saint of Kongsang,

344
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,035
advocated for a ceasefire
with the Merfolk

345
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,074
and the expulsion
of the invading Ice Clan.

346
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,994
She was born into a prestigious family.

347
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,474
She was radiant

348
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,034
and splendid,

349
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,474
attracting the attention
of countless noble families

350
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:11,994
and the admiration
of the Six Ministries.

351
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,115
I'm worlds apart from her.

352
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,674
I shouldn't have any delusions.

353
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,194
This is the destined sword

354
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:30,274
that accompanies us Merfolk since birth.

355
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,994
You're the one I drew the sword for.

356
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,034
From that day on,

357
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,234
it has accompanied you and me
in sword practice,

358
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,474
as well as in our war campaigns.

359
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:41,434
But I haven't figured out

360
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,795
what to name it.

361
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,395
Just now,

362
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,194
I decided to name it

363
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,835
Extreme Biluo.

364
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:52,954
Extreme Biluo?

365
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,674
Because your Extreme Wind City

366
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:00,595
is my sanctuary.

367
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:10,795
Yao Yi,

368
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:12,754
you have a  weakness

369
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,555
because of me.

370
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,635
But I'll spend my whole life
repaying you

371
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,795
by being your sword and armor.

372
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:28,754
Then it's a promise

373
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:31,075
that you'll repay with a lifetime.

374
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,194
I only wish that this lifetime
were longer.

375
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:54,674
Extreme Biluo.

376
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:57,155
The deep affection of a sword.

377
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,795
At that time, as the war continued,

378
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:00,954
I didn't know

379
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:02,555
if we would ever be separated.

380
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,234
So I decided to disregard everything

381
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,194
and express my feelings to her.

382
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:08,155
Even if it ends in heartbreak,

383
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,714
it's better than regretting it
for the rest of my life.

384
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:18,155
The best thing I've done in my life

385
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:20,595
is to tell her in person

386
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:22,835
that I love her.

387
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:27,514
(Shi Ying,)

388
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:28,915
(I leave it to you)

389
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,274
(to tell her in this lifetime.)

390
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,200
♪Whose longing has been stirred up♪

391
00:19:52,330 --> 00:20:01,920
♪Unfinished fate and love
while passion has gone♪

392
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,690
♪Like a nightmare♪

393
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,390
♪Longing to meet again in dreams♪

394
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,155
I wonder

395
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,434
what Master is doing now.

396
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,900
♪Like the bright moonlight
quietly sneaking into the night♪

397
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,550
♪When this life reaches its end,
fallen petals become intertwined♪

398
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,040
♪Snowy Rosa at the temple,
blooming the most beautiful verses♪

399
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,170
♪Through the years, through time♪

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,590
♪Only your appearance♪

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,760
♪I will forever remain in the past♪

402
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,355
Let me go!

403
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:48,674
I don't want to take a bath!

404
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,674
I don't want to take a bath!

405
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:51,714
Someone is trying to kill me!

406
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,674
Help! I don't want to take a bath!

407
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,954
Help me!

408
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:56,595
Let me go!

409
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,835
Let me go!

410
00:20:58,555 --> 00:20:59,434
Help me!

411
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:00,915
Someone is trying to kill me!

412
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,075
I don't want to take a bath!

413
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:07,714
I must hurry.

414
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,155
I can't clean this in time.

415
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:19,155
Yan'er.

416
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,595
Master.

417
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:26,395
I've been too busy

418
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:27,674
to visit you lately.

419
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:28,875
Are you all right?

420
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:32,754
(How can I let Master)

421
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,355
(see me in such a messy state?)

422
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,115
Yan'er?

423
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:41,514
Master,

424
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,555
I'm all right.

425
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:44,674
It's just

426
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,155
that I'm not accustomed

427
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,355
to the environment here.

428
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:48,875
How

429
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,434
about you write a prescription for me?

430
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:55,754
I wasn't attentive enough.

431
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:56,835
Wait for a moment.

432
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,560
(Prescription)

433
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,500
(Take this with water)

434
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:27,234
So beautiful.

435
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:32,315
Yan'er,

436
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,595
follow this prescription
for your recovery.

437
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:42,034
I'll come and visit you tomorrow.

438
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:46,194
Master,

439
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,954
I'm just making a fuss about nothing.

440
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,635
If you have something important to do,

441
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:50,434
please go and do it.

442
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,075
I said before

443
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,234
that no matter what you say

444
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,395
or where you are,

445
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:01,994
I won't

446
00:24:01,994 --> 00:24:02,875
have any more resentful thoughts.

447
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:05,075
The matter of the withdrawal of troops

448
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,434
was also

449
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,075
because of your speech in the hall.

450
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:09,875
When I was in the streets,

451
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:11,434
I saw many people

452
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:12,954
clapping and cheering.

453
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,514
My master sure is amazing.

454
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:21,674
I've entrusted the matter

455
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,355
of Kongsang's soldier withdrawal
to Shi Yu.

456
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:24,994
As for Merfolk marine force,

457
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:26,434
Zhi Yuan is taking care of it.

458
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,915
I have no other matters to handle.

459
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,155
Oh,

460
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,315
tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

461
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,034
Would you like

462
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,315
to accompany me to the market?

463
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,194
Master, is there

464
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:44,315
anything you want to buy?

465
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:45,355
Just let me know.

466
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:46,835
I'll have someone buy it for you.

467
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,115
You once said

468
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,274
you'd show me around
in Extreme Wind City.

469
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,315
It didn't happen back then.

470
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:55,674
How about we do it

471
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:57,514
in Ye City instead?

472
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:02,954
You want me to come with you

473
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:04,474
to the market?

474
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:06,034
Yes.

475
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,555
Just for the sake of wandering aimlessly

476
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:10,795
and having fun?

477
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:15,395
Would you like to?

478
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,514
Yes.

479
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:24,274
All right.

480
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:25,714
I'll see you tomorrow.

481
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:27,754
I'll see you tomorrow.

482
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,595
Young Lady.

483
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:45,835
Did you see that?

484
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,315
My master came to visit me.

485
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:49,835
Yes.

486
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,595
The Priest of Grand Preceptor just left.

487
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,434
So what I saw

488
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:55,315
wasn't an illusion.

489
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:58,155
My master did come.

490
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:00,274
Something's not right.

491
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,754
Could it be

492
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,915
that someone transformed into my master

493
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:05,395
to deliberately play tricks on me?

494
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:06,754
Young Lady,

495
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,795
what are you talking about?

496
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:09,875
No, that's not right.

497
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,115
What nonsense am I spouting about?

498
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:14,434
Yes,

499
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:16,115
that's my master.

500
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,954
He came to my room.

501
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,434
He said he wanted to go to the market.

502
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:21,315
Young Lady,

503
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:21,994
He came to my room.

504
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,075
Isn't that a good thing?

505
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:23,875
Go to the market.

506
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:24,795
Why do you look at it

507
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:25,954
as if it's a catastrophe?

508
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,155
You're right.

509
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:28,714
It's a good thing, Yufei.

510
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,155
Master is taking me to the market!

511
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:33,194
Young Lady!

512
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:55,562
Master,

513
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:57,562
it has been a long time
since I dressed in this.

514
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,403
It feels like returning
to Jiuyi Mountain.

515
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:07,322
Is this the place

516
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,362
you wanted to come?

517
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:12,082
Of course.

518
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,723
I share the same preferences as you.

519
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:17,042
I like whatever you like.

520
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,260
(Calligraphy and Painting Hall)

521
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:34,602
Master,

522
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:35,842
this painting

523
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,643
was painted by Master He Yu,

524
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:39,562
who is known as a master of painting.

525
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,643
They say it vividly depicts
a beautiful woman with bright eyes,

526
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,282
a charming smile,

527
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:46,763
and lifelike details.

528
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:47,480
It's one of his representative works

529
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,082
(Huanxi Sand)
It's one of his representative works

530
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:49,120
(Huanxi Sand)

531
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:50,322
called "Huanxi Sand".

532
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:53,683
Legend has it that the woman
in this painting

533
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,602
was someone he encountered by chance

534
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,882
during a spring outing.

535
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:58,483
Unfortunately,

536
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:00,443
he didn't express his feelings
at that time.

537
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:02,282
After completing this painting,

538
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,802
he went in search of her,

539
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:05,723
only to discover

540
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:07,243
that she had already married.

541
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,082
(Master is happy with my explanation.)

542
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:13,122
(I'm glad that my efforts yesterday)

543
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:14,522
(were not in vain.)

544
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:16,963
I have noted down
all the renowned artists

545
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:18,443
and their most sought-after works

546
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:19,723
in the calligraphy and painting shop,

547
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,643
just in case we need them in the future.

548
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:23,243
Among the ancient books and paintings,

549
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,282
the most famous should be

550
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:27,282
Master He Yu.

551
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,122
He excels in portraying beautiful women.

552
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:31,842
Beautiful women portrait?

553
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:43,802
And this landscape painting

554
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,243
was painted by Gu Ruobai.

555
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,322
There are various opinions

556
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:48,602
about which scenery he painted.

557
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:51,403
Some say it's the forests
between the mountains,

558
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:54,882
likely from the Tianque Mountain
in the east.

559
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:57,042
- So it's Tianque Mountain.
- Tianque Mountain?

560
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:58,403
It's the first time I've heard of it.

561
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,322
So that's the place.

562
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:02,763
Who is she?

563
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:03,763
Master,

564
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:04,443
why

565
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,842
are they looking at us like that?

566
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,243
They probably mistake you

567
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:11,082
for the commentator in this art gallery.

568
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,522
Watch how I make them leave.

569
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,522
May I ask

570
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,882
about the background of this painting?

571
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,203
This painting

572
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:27,963
is by a renowned painter, Xi.

573
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:30,522
The name is quite special.

574
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,203
It's called

575
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:35,243
"Early Moon, Blossoming Spring".

576
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,802
It has gained great popularity
in recent years.

577
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:38,802
Nonsense.

578
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:39,923
"Early Moon, Blossoming Spring"?

579
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,683
This painting clearly
belongs to Qin Zhang,

580
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:42,842
titled "Begonia under the Moon".

581
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:44,362
"Early Moon, Blossoming Spring"
is pure nonsense.

582
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:46,562
Her boasting went too far.

583
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:47,362
That's right.

584
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:48,322
So she was just pretending.

585
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:50,882
This work was actually painted
by Qin Zhang

586
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,882
during his retreat on Xishan.

587
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:54,522
He gave this painting

588
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,203
to his friend Li Hezhi,

589
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:57,322
who returned the favor

590
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,362
by writing a poem.

591
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,362
"The moon sets on Xishan early,

592
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:02,842
begonia blossoms in early spring."

593
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:05,122
He also left a note as the name implies.

594
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,802
So "Early Moon, Blossoming Spring"
has its own significance.

595
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:08,882
Besides,

596
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,963
it serves as the best witness

597
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:11,683
to their deep friendship.

598
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:12,842
(I made things up on the spot.)

599
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:14,122
(Master can even cover up for me.)

600
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:15,122
(What else can't he do?)

601
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:15,802
So

602
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:17,802
may I know

603
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,042
what's the background of this painting
on this folding fan?

604
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,010
(Foliage)

605
00:30:26,882 --> 00:30:28,362
This landscape painting

606
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:30,643
is one of the representative works
of Master Lin An,

607
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,163
and it's called

608
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:34,483
"Foliage".

609
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:35,203
"Foliage"?

610
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,203
Did she say "Foliage"?

611
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,562
This clearly belongs to Master Lin An's

612
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:40,042
"Orchid and Jade Tree" painting.

613
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,763
What does this have to do with foliage?

614
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:43,643
It's true.

615
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,882
"Foliage" also has its own significance.

616
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:47,963
As for the specific background,

617
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:50,882
I'll let my Master explain it
to everyone.

618
00:30:57,683 --> 00:31:00,602
Master Lin An has a unique way
of titling his works.

619
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,042
He can have a straightforward title,

620
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:02,923
a tangential title,

621
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:03,923
or even a lying title.

622
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:04,923
Moreover,

623
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:06,602
he often hides the true title

624
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:07,882
within the calligraphy.

625
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,683
He was right in front of me

626
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:12,282
when he created this painting.

627
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:15,082
The true name of this artwork

628
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:15,923
is indeed "Foliage".

629
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:18,203
It captures the essence of spring,

630
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:20,643
symbolizing the birth
of the smooth and soft foliage.

631
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,362
Without the foliage growing first,

632
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,643
how could

633
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:24,882
the orchid and jade tree grow?

634
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,042
He has a point.

635
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:29,403
If you look closely

636
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,643
at the second pine needle
of the third branch

637
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:31,562
from the left.

638
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:34,483
It has a slightly lighter shade of ink
compared to the others.

639
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:37,122
That's because I added it
when I was young.

640
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:37,923
It's true.

641
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:41,203
This...

642
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:43,763
Excuse me, sir.

643
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:45,483
May I ask who you are?

644
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,602
Just an ordinary person.

645
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:49,003
Not worth mentioning.

646
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:51,602
Yan'er,

647
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:54,003
time to go.

648
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,963
He's indeed an expert.

649
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,122
Show it to me.

650
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:06,802
Come and take a look.

651
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:09,163
You sure have picked up a treasure.

652
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,362
Right here. This is the one.

653
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,203
It's indeed there. It's really there.

654
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:18,522
Let's go.

655
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,630
(Calligraphy and Painting Hall)

656
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:26,683
Master,

657
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,163
you're so impressive.

658
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,802
Are there any lies in this world

659
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:31,802
that you can't cover?

660
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,243
Luckily, I know

661
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:36,443
Li Hezhi and Lin An.

662
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:38,562
If we stayed any longer,

663
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,243
our lies will be exposed.

664
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:43,122
I can be mischievous at times,

665
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:45,403
and you've always been strict with me.

666
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,562
I didn't expect you
would go along with me.

667
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:49,643
I'm truly overwhelmed

668
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,243
by the unexpected favor.

669
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:54,042
What do you expect me to do?

670
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:55,882
Leave you to perform a one-man show?

671
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,403
But I didn't expect

672
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:01,163
it would be this amusing

673
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:02,643
to engage in nonsense with you.

674
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:06,562
So

675
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:08,122
you don't have to continue seeing me

676
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:09,602
as your master all the time.

677
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:12,163
No, I can't do that.

678
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:13,683
A joke is a joke.

679
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,482
Once a master,
you'll always be my master.

680
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:16,882
As a disciple,

681
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,442
I should adhere to the rules
of being a disciple.

682
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:21,922
But

683
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:23,163
Master,

684
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:25,683
why are you suddenly saying this?

685
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,123
Oh, I get it.

686
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:30,962
It's because you're a cultivator.

687
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:32,322
You don't want

688
00:33:32,603 --> 00:33:33,643
to reveal your identity
in the mortal world.

689
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,442
You can put it

690
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,163
that way.

691
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:39,882
Then Master...

692
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:43,563
Then

693
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:45,882
where would you like to go next?

694
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:49,402
I'll go wherever you go.

695
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,123
No, I'll follow you.

696
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:54,882
All right, then.

697
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,482
When I was young,

698
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,523
I once watched a shadow puppet show.

699
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:01,282
But I couldn't wait until the end.

700
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,962
I've always had regrets about it.

701
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:05,002
How about this?

702
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:06,402
You can accompany me to find it.

703
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:08,603
If we can find
that particular shadow puppet show,

704
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:10,442
it would be fulfilling

705
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:11,763
a wish in my heart.

706
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:13,203
All right.

707
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:14,482
I'll definitely find it.

708
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,603
That way, your effort
to fulfilling my wish

709
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:17,723
won't be in vain.

710
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,882
We've already searched several streets.

711
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:55,603
But we still haven't found that fish.

712
00:34:58,842 --> 00:34:59,842
Master, do you still remember

713
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,603
the color fish?

714
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,842
I remember it was red.

715
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:07,083
Red?

716
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:08,842
Perhaps,

717
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:10,163
it's no longer there

718
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:11,723
after such a long time.

719
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,083
Then do you remember

720
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,563
what the shadow puppet show's venue

721
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:17,643
looked like?

722
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:20,203
I only remember

723
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,603
two large fish swimming around.

724
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,083
They looked happy.

725
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:25,203
- Awesome!
- Incredible!

726
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:25,842
Excellent!

727
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,362
- Great!
- Marvelous!

728
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,163
If I find it,

729
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:31,683
what reward are you prepared to give me?

730
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:35,882
Are you making me promise you
something again?

731
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:39,322
Stop right there.

732
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:41,643
Awesome!

733
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:43,322
Your injuries just recovered.

734
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:44,442
Don't run.

735
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:46,322
All right, Master.

736
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:03,243
Do what I say.

737
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,123
That's so beautiful!

738
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:15,763
Later, you can

739
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:16,282
just lead me the way.

740
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:17,603
Don't run.

741
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:21,362
All right.

742
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,882
(Did Master hold my hand earlier)

743
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:49,643
(because there were many people around)

744
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,802
(and it wasn't convenient to use magic?)

745
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:52,203
(That must be it.)

746
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:53,962
(It must be because of the crowd.)

747
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,163
- Wait for me!
- Coming!

748
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:02,962
Let's go!

749
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,002
Master.

750
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:15,922
Look!

751
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:17,643
It's these two fish, right?

752
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,322
It was probably

753
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:21,763
the lights from the shadow puppet show

754
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,083
casting onto the fish,

755
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:24,402
making it appear

756
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:25,882
as if they were swimming around.

757
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:30,482
We finally found them.

758
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,083
Yan'er,

759
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:33,243
thank you.

760
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:35,882
But don't forget

761
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:37,083
you owe me a favor.

762
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:39,083
All right.

763
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:40,362
I'll remember.

764
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:43,402
Mister,

765
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:44,802
do you happen to know

766
00:38:44,962 --> 00:38:45,842
if there's a place nearby

767
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:47,163
where there are shadow puppet shows?

768
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:48,442
I remember you.

769
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:50,362
You're the owner
of the shadow puppet show.

770
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:53,643
I've been performing
for more than ten years.

771
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,442
Paper-cutting and shadow puppets

772
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:56,482
have a similar effect.

773
00:38:57,763 --> 00:38:58,482
Ten years ago,

774
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:01,282
I watched your show halfway here.

775
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:03,482
Ten years ago?

776
00:39:04,962 --> 00:39:07,163
The most popular one
was the "Tales of the Righteous Demon".

777
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:10,842
Mister,

778
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:12,802
could you perform it again

779
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:13,683
for us?

780
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:15,442
We'll generously compensate you.

781
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,922
Miss, there's something you don't know.

782
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:19,962
Just the other day,
Consort Qing summoned

783
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:22,402
the Princess of Crimson Clan

784
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:23,882
to the palace to reprimand her

785
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,683
for her improper behavior,

786
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:27,882
which made us ordinary folks

787
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:28,882
bear the consequences too.

788
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:30,362
Now,

789
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:31,962
we can no longer perform

790
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,203
any romantic love stories.

791
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,603
It has also affected

792
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:36,882
my business by half.

793
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:38,482
Innocent people like us

794
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:39,962
were implicated for no reason.

795
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:44,243
I have to apologize for declining.

796
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:46,723
Since you're old acquaintances

797
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,402
and have come to my stall.

798
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:49,962
How about this?

799
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,763
Let me make

800
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,123
a small paper-cut portrait for you.

801
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:54,842
Then can I trouble you

802
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:56,442
to teach me instead?

803
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:57,523
I'll do it myself.

804
00:39:58,043 --> 00:39:58,842
Sure, sure.

805
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,002
(Master must be compensating)

806
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:28,282
(for the unintended harm)

807
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,643
(we caused we caused)

808
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:30,362
(to the old man's business)

809
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:32,043
(out of guilt.)

810
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:39,243
Mister,

811
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:41,043
please have a look.

812
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:47,962
It truly is a masterpiece

813
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,683
from the hands of someone
with deep affection.

814
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:54,962
I've been doing paper-cutting
for decades.

815
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:56,083
But I've never seen

816
00:40:57,243 --> 00:40:58,563
such a lively

817
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:00,123
and exquisite work.

818
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:03,203
Now

819
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,322
that the paper-cut portrait is finished,

820
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:08,203
you can choose
a congratulatory wedding scroll.

821
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:10,163
Congratulatory...

822
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:12,243
A congratulatory wedding scroll?

823
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:13,563
Have a look.

824
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:14,322
These words

825
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:16,083
are

826
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:17,402
from the scripts

827
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,203
of my puppet shows,

828
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,123
as well as some fine quotes
from scholars.

829
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:22,402
Both of you

830
00:41:23,043 --> 00:41:24,322
can choose the one you like

831
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:25,922
and stick this paper-cut portrait

832
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,402
on top of it.

833
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:31,643
You misunderstood.

834
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,763
We're not...

835
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:36,643
(A perfect couple?)

836
00:41:37,322 --> 00:41:38,442
(An ideal match?)

837
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:39,723
(Isn't this)

838
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,123
(the congratulatory wedding scroll
he gave me back then?)

839
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,750
(A perfect couple and an ideal match)

840
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,523
These characters come

841
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:44,442
from the story of a virtuous woman.

842
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,603
It tells the tale of a girl
named Liangnv

843
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,442
who fell in love with her lover.

844
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:51,482
However, their parents disapproved,

845
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:52,683
and their attempt

846
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,442
to elope also failed.

847
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,002
Her lover died

848
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,563
and turned into a star.

849
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:58,842
The story may be good.

850
00:41:59,203 --> 00:41:59,643
But

851
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,362
the ending is tragic.

852
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:04,482
Unbelievable.

853
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:06,723
When you sent me
the congratulatory wedding scroll,

854
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:08,203
you were already foreseeing

855
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:09,842
my future as a widow.

856
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,470
(A lifetime together, never lose, never forget, never be separated)

857
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:23,083
(If a handsome man like Master)

858
00:42:23,683 --> 00:42:25,123
(were not a cultivator,)

859
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:26,322
(I wonder how many women in the world)

860
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:27,922
(would be infatuated with him.)

861
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:31,402
Which one do you like?

862
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:34,523
I like...

863
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:40,603
Oh, you mean
the congratulatory wedding scroll.

864
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:42,723
I like...

865
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:44,282
This one?

866
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,123
It's a riddle

867
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:47,922
from the play "Jade Casket."

868
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:49,962
It refers to a couple in the story

869
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:51,282
named Orchid

870
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:52,083
and Jade,

871
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:53,842
who eventually

872
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,203
marry

873
00:42:55,563 --> 00:42:56,723
and grow old together.

874
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:58,402
We happened

875
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,322
to see the "Orchid and Jade Tree"
painting earlier.

876
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:01,922
It seems

877
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:03,842
it's pretty fated.

878
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:08,402
"A lifetime together,

879
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,922
never lose, never forget,
never be separated".

880
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:16,763
I understand it now.

881
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,282
Master, what is it
that you understand this time?

882
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,523
Why are you looking
at this scroll again?

883
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:24,763
Could it be

884
00:43:24,763 --> 00:43:26,203
that you intend to choose this one

885
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:27,563
when you give me
the next congratulatory wedding scroll?

886
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:29,123
Yan'er,

887
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:30,882
I've planned

888
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:32,882
to leave the priesthood

889
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:34,402
and resign from the position
of Immortal Official

890
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:36,243
after the withdrawal of the troops.

891
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:39,362
Shi Ying!

892
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:40,643
Shi Ying!

893
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:42,282
Shi Ying!

894
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:43,123
Chong Ming?

895
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:43,962
I've finally found you.

896
00:43:44,563 --> 00:43:45,322
Something happened to your brother.

897
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:47,683
I heard he was carried back to Jialan.
