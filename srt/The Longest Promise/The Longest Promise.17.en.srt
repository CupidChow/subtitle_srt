19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,540
We followed your orders

20
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:58,981
and haven't sent any

21
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,221
of Second Young Lady's letters

22
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,100
to Jiuyi Mountain.

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,900
We withhold them all.

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,141
Well done.

25
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,300
As usual,

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,100
come back tomorrow
at this time to collect the letters.

27
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:06,701
Yes.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,420
(To Zhu Yan)

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,420
(Yan,)

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,420
(your letter is quite amusing.)

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
(Chong Ming loves looking beautiful,)

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,420
(but his feathers are scorched black.)

33
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:22,901
(You're active)

34
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,781
(but can only lie in bed to recuperate.)

35
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,221
(The thought of a human and a bird)

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,580
(supporting each other)

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,061
(Bai Xueying)
(is truly hilarious.)

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,061
(But)

39
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,781
(you have to take care of yourself)

40
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,420
(and Chong Ming.)

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,221
(I heard from Prince Shi Yu)

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
(that on the south side
of Jiuyi Mountain,)

43
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:48,860
(there is a place called Nvluo Creek
where Nvluo plants grow.)

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,540
The favored consorts
in the palace use it

45
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,420
to maintain their beauty.

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,260
It's a panacea that helps hair grow
and revitalizes the skin.

47
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,021
Lord Chong Ming!

48
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:02,700
Lord Chong Ming!

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,980
Lord Chong Ming!

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,781
Lord...

51
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:20,420
Lord Chong Ming?

52
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:25,660
Lord Chong Ming,

53
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,341
how did you become one with this tree?

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,941
Let me see.

55
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,820
You actually

56
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,420
look quite cute like this.

57
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,820
Lord Chong Ming,

58
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,501
shouldn't you eat something?

59
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,461
Starvation is a minor issue.

60
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,140
But disfigurement is a major concern.

61
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,301
Look at my current state.

62
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,820
Even if I starve to death,

63
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,501
I can't be seen like this.

64
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,621
Lord Chong Ming,

65
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,021
you've endured
the Flaming Heaven Punishment

66
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,380
for several days.

67
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,301
You really should eat something.

68
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
I, Zhu Yan, swear

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,420
that no matter how you turn into,

70
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:06,100
you'll always be the most beautiful bird.

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,341
Just a bird?

72
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:10,980
Oh, no.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,580
I mean, in my heart,

74
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:13,660
even in human form,

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,341
you're the most handsome young man,

76
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,020
other than my master.

77
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:19,340
Are you going to keep your word?

78
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,340
Are you really not going to laugh at me?

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,140
Of course.

80
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,700
Now, you should

81
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,501
come over and eat something

82
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:29,541
and have some fish soup
to enhance beauty and youthfulness.

83
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,340
It smells so good.

84
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,460
The fish soup that has been simmering
for four hours

85
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:42,301
is truly a heavenly delicacy,

86
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,941
the ultimate beauty and skincare elixir.

87
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,941
Give it to me.

88
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,140
Be careful, slow down.

89
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,301
As long as mythical creatures

90
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,421
like us on Jiuyi Mountain are alive,

91
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,301
we'll continuously face tribulations
again and again.

92
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,621
A great tribulation
once every thousand years

93
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
and a minor tribulation
once every hundred years.

94
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,981
I've experienced

95
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,700
minor tribulations like this
a hundred times.

96
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,380
The heavenly tribulations like this

97
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,220
will be over in less
than a quarter of an hour.

98
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,661
What annoyed me the most

99
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,460
is this raging fire would always ravage

100
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,780
my beautiful feathers.

101
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,260
It makes me livid.

102
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:31,780
A mere quarter of an hour
of tribulations

103
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,260
takes half a year to recover.

104
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:36,780
Slow down.

105
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,900
(The favored consorts
in the palace use this)

106
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,181
(to maintain their youthfulness.)

107
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,061
(It's a panacea that helps hair grow
and revitalizes the skin.)

108
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,421
(Surely this item
can also restore Chong Ming's)

109
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,741
(former appearance, right?)

110
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,621
Is it not enough?

111
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,301
I'll get make some more for you.

112
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,020
I'll have another one.

113
00:05:59,061 --> 00:05:59,460
No, no.

114
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,181
Give me another two.

115
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:34,620
(Yan'er.)

116
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,700
Who are you?

117
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,021
Summon the Priest of Grand Preceptor
to rescue you.

118
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,220
It turns out you're after my master.

119
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
You can forget about using me as bait.

120
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,541
Even if I die here,

121
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,941
I won't let my master come.

122
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:02,620
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

123
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,381
Get out of the way.

124
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,061
No matter how grave the matter is,

125
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,740
you must not leave this place.

126
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,901
If you can break through
to the real state,

127
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,700
you'll ascend in one step.

128
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,261
If you halt your cultivation progress,

129
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,700
you'll fail

130
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:14,740
with no chance to try again.

131
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,541
Besides, your current cultivation

132
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,901
is insufficient compared
to the usual standard.

133
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,700
How will you escape
from a formidable enemy?

134
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:21,700
Knowing someone is in distress
and not helping.

135
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,100
Even if one breaks through
to the real state,

136
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,620
it's against one's conscience.

137
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,620
With just you,

138
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,061
do you think you can stop me?

139
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,220
Since you refuse to cooperate,

140
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:55,181
using your dead body to meet him

141
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,541
will be just the same.

142
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,620
You're the ones who will die!

143
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,340
Master?

144
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,941
You shouldn't have come here.

145
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,460
Ice Clan?

146
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,541
First, you attacked
the Emperor's Valley.

147
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,700
And now you lured me here.

148
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,381
What do you intend to do?

149
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,500
So you were the Immortal Official

150
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,340
at the Emperor's Valley back then.

151
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,820
If only I had killed you earlier.

152
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,421
Kill me?

153
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,381
Just several days ago, the Azure Clan

154
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,541
also sent people to kill me.

155
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,620
Could it be that you're colluding

156
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,580
with the Azure Clan from the beginning?

157
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,700
You're about to die.

158
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,421
Don't waste time trying to probe.

159
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,541
Considering that you're about
to reach the real state,

160
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,860
the Ice Clan cannot let you live.

161
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,261
Soon?

162
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,620
I'll let you witness

163
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,021
the magic techniques of the real state.

164
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,021
Her time of birth aligns
with the frigid winter month.

165
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,860
Her birthplace aligns
with the brightest crimson place.

166
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,061
What was recorded in the Elixir Book

167
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,220
of the dance ritual back then

168
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,261
was her official birth date.

169
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,460
According to Zhu Yan's
actual birth date,

170
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,061
she's the cursed lady.

171
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:22,820
Your Supreme Majesty,

172
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,661
the Ice Clan has taken Zhu Yan hostage.

173
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,061
The Priest disregarding everything,

174
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,141
went to Nvluo Creek.

175
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:30,100
Follow me!

176
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:35,580
Hurry!

177
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,181
Master,

178
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,860
have you broken through the stage?

179
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:46,740
Not yet.

180
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,340
It's because of me again, isn't it?

181
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:48,941
No.

182
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,460
It's because of me

183
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,620
that you're in danger.

184
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
They are targeting me.

185
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:54,340
Hurry back to Jiuyi Mountain

186
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,620
and seek help from the High Priest.

187
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,700
But...

188
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,381
Go quickly.

189
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:00,381
All right.

190
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:22,421
Priest of Grand Preceptor of Kongsang,

191
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,500
today is the day you die.

192
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:27,860
Yan'er!

193
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:39,421
Yan'er, watch out!

194
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,100
Yan'er!

195
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,500
(If this continues,)

196
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,460
(Yan'er will be in danger.)

197
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,980
(I can only use Celestial Assault.)

198
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,181
(Master actually wants)

199
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,661
(to use Celestial Assault?)

200
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,061
Master!

201
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,541
He's already at his weakest.

202
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,220
He's just bluffing.

203
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:58,500
Master.

204
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,901
Master, with Gong Shang here,

205
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,460
we'll be fine.

206
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:44,820
Celestial Assault!

207
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:56,732
(My power is weak.)

208
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:58,692
(I couldn't share)

209
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,291
(the damage with Master.)

210
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:03,571
(Fortunately, Yuan taught me
the Fushui Spell.)

211
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,251
When the Emperor's Blood is in peril,

212
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,811
the Ring of Houtu will emerge.

213
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:40,972
Indeed, the three Sorcerers

214
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,531
did not disappoint me.

(Cangwu Abyss)

228
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:18,372
Master.

229
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,932
(That's strange.
Master didn't transform.)

230
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:29,771
(Could it be because he's too weak?)

231
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:38,851
Master,

232
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,372
the situation was urgent earlier.

233
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,011
Forgive me for offending you.

234
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,251
How are you feeling now?

235
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:01,172
Master.

236
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:22,212
God of Dragon?

237
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,132
Are you the God of Dragon?

238
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:27,571
The God of Dragon that was sealed
for thousands of years

239
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:29,732
is actually trapped in the Cangwu Abyss.

240
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:33,132
You bear the mark of Emperor Xingzun,

241
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,011
who set up the dragon barrier
to imprison you.

242
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:37,732
Did the Emperor of Kongsang

243
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,652
send you to disturb me?

244
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,412
The Cangwu Abyss

245
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,732
is not a place for the living.

246
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,851
God of Dragon, you've misunderstood.

247
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:46,811
We didn't come

248
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:47,692
to bother you.

249
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:49,091
We were ambushed

250
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,531
and fell in here by accident.

251
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:52,652
Who ambushed you?

252
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:54,492
It was the Ice Clan.

253
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,771
My master said they are Ice Clan people.

254
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,251
They want to kill my master.

255
00:21:59,091 --> 00:21:59,732
God of Dragon,

256
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,811
don't ask me why.

257
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,331
I haven't figured it out myself.

258
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,291
In short,

259
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,452
they forced us to come here.

260
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:05,972
God of Dragon,

261
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:07,611
my master is injured.

262
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:08,972
I'm begging you.

263
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:10,412
Can you send us out of here?

264
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,212
Two Kongsang people

265
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,531
actually asked me to send them out.

266
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:18,732
The aura on this person

267
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,212
is the same as the one

268
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,892
who trapped me thousands of years ago.

269
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,291
God of Dragon, you've mistaken.

270
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:25,531
My master

271
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,132
is an Immortal Official
of Jiuyi Mountain.

272
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,892
He's completely unrelated
to the person you're looking for.

273
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:39,892
Yan'er!

274
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,091
Master!

275
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:43,091
Run.

276
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:43,692
Master.

277
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,531
(This is the talisman Yuan gave me.)

278
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,251
You actually possess
the Dragon Blood Jade.

279
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,412
You managed to use the sacred relic
of the Merfolk Clan

280
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:27,291
to protect a Kongsang people like you.

281
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:28,972
Could it be

282
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,972
that you're the one
I've been waiting for?

283
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:34,331
Do you know me?

284
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:35,372
No,

285
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:36,972
the one I'm waiting for

286
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:39,172
is a woman from the White Clan, not you.

287
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:42,172
But since you can possess
the Dragon Blood Jade,

288
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,091
you must be closely related

289
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,212
to my Sea Kingdom's destiny.

290
00:23:46,212 --> 00:23:47,611
If I were to kill you,

291
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:49,732
it would likely disrupt

292
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:52,452
the changes happening in Yunhuang.

293
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:53,972
God of Dragon,

294
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,051
I don't understand what you're saying.

295
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,011
But as long as I'm here,

296
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:00,132
I will never let you harm my master.

297
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,571
Return to where you belong.

298
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:19,972
Master,

299
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,412
we've finally come out.

300
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:30,571
It's all my fault

301
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,811
you ended up like this

302
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:34,771
because I insisted on picking Nvluo.

303
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:38,732
Master, I'll take you back.

304
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:40,331
Come.

305
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:52,800
♪The wind whirls and howls, dancing♪

306
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:02,420
♪One step, on the cliff♪

307
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:06,811
It's getting dark.

308
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,172
We can't be trapped here.

309
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:10,892
I need to quickly figure out a way

310
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:11,972
to leave this place.

311
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:15,372
Master,

312
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,011
if only you could transform

313
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:18,251
into a white beast.

314
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,452
But just now in the water,

315
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:25,452
I couldn't even

316
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,492
make you transform.

317
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,811
What should I do now?

318
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:35,251
Don't tell me

319
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,132
it would only work
if I kissed him longer.

320
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:50,132
Zhu Yan!

321
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:59,291
High Priest is finally here.

322
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,051
Ying. Ying.

323
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,732
Take the Priest back for treatment.

324
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,331
- Yes.
- Yes.

325
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:41,531
(Yin and Yang will meet,
and Starflower will bloom.)

326
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:43,531
(It's really you.)

327
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:02,732
Zhu Yan is also seriously injured.

328
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,212
I've transferred
some spiritual power to her.

329
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:07,652
Take her back for treatment too.

330
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:09,811
- Yes.
- Yes.

331
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:40,132
Yan'er. Yan'er.

332
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,932
Yan'er, run. Yan'er.

333
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:45,051
Thank goodness you're finally awake.

334
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:46,811
You've been unconscious
for three days and three nights,

335
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,611
do you know that?

336
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:51,452
Come.

337
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:53,972
Slowly.

338
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,972
Where's Zhu Yan? How's she?

339
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:01,212
Why do you care?

340
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,531
She almost got you killed.

341
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:06,132
I shouldn't have taken any chances.

342
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,212
She saved me.

343
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:10,732
If it weren't for her,

344
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:12,172
I would have died

345
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:13,251
at the hands of the Ice Clan.

346
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,172
But if it weren't for her,

347
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:16,972
would you have gone to Nvluo Creek?

348
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:36,571
The High Priest had transferred

349
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:37,452
some spiritual power
to Princess Zhu Yan.

350
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,972
So she's recovering well.

351
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,492
Her pulse has stabilized

352
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,412
and she should regain
consciousness tomorrow.

353
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,932
(It was such a serious incident.)

354
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:47,851
(Fortunately, His Supreme Majesty
did not suspect anything.)

355
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:51,091
Her vital energy was greatly impacted,

356
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,412
and it'll take some time
for her to recover.

357
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:55,611
Prepare the decoction.

358
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:59,212
But don't make it too strong
or rush with it.

359
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:01,291
Let her rest and recuperate slowly.

360
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:04,452
Oh.

361
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:05,932
Don't forget to add

362
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:07,212
some Qi-enhancing red fruits.

363
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,331
She dislikes bitterness,

364
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:14,492
so add a bit of sweetness.

365
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:16,051
Yes.

366
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:34,611
All you do is concerned about her.

367
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:35,972
Have you ever thought

368
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:37,372
about how long it'll take
for you to recover?

369
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:39,811
You failed at breaking through
the stage at the last minute.

370
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:41,132
I wonder

371
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:42,331
if you still have the chance

372
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:43,412
to enter the real state in the future.

373
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,811
You could even sacrifice
your life for her.

374
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:01,492
Could it be

375
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,091
that you've fallen for her?

376
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,331
What did you say?

377
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,412
Nothing, I didn't say anything.

378
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:11,652
I let my imagination run wild.

379
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:13,251
How could someone like you,

380
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:13,892
who wholeheartedly serves the gods,

381
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:15,892
fall in love with someone
from the mortal world?

382
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:17,412
Don't entertain

383
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:18,571
such distracting thoughts.

384
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:19,932
By the way,

385
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:22,372
the High Priest is waiting for you
at the Cultivating Hall.

386
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:23,412
He wants to treat your injuries.

387
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:24,251
So you'd better hurry back.

388
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,452
He couldn't possibly

389
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:39,051
have developed feelings
for Zhuyan, could he?

390
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,331
You're always spouting nonsense.

391
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:43,531
You and your big mouth.

392
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:45,771
Master.

393
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:49,091
Master.

394
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:51,172
Run.

395
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:54,372
Master.

396
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:57,732
Run.

397
00:30:58,412 --> 00:30:59,251
Both of you are unbelievable.

398
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:00,771
He sacrificed himself to save you,

399
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:02,051
and you risked your life to protect him.

400
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:03,652
You clearly have a connection.

401
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:04,692
But it's a pity

402
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:06,611
that you will bring him to his doom.

403
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:08,892
Master.

404
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:07,892
Master!

405
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:09,732
Master.

406
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:11,692
Don't die.

407
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:13,771
I won't let you die.

408
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:15,892
Princess, you're finally awake.

409
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,611
How's my master?

410
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,531
The Priest dropped by earlier.

411
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:29,412
He told me to decoct

412
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:30,652
this decoction for you.

413
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:40,452
Why is this decoction...

414
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:42,571
The Priest was worried
you might find it bitter.

415
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:44,172
So he asked me

416
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,771
to add some sweetness to it.

417
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,972
Master is very considerate to me.

418
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:52,452
Where is he now?

419
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:53,771
The Priest should be back

420
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,172
at the Cultivating Hall
to treat his injuries.

421
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:56,571
Princess,

422
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:58,331
is there anything else
you'd like me to do?

423
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:00,892
No, that's all.

424
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,452
Thank you.

425
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:08,212
Xueying suggested that I gather Nvluo.

426
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,091
Coincidentally, the Ice Clan

427
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,811
set an ambush to capture me there.

428
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,972
How could there be such a coincidence?

429
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,172
Could it be

430
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:20,331
that someone wants to harm Master?

431
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:22,811
They knew Master would rescue me.

432
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,452
So they imitated Xueying's handwriting

433
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,452
and tricked me
into going to Nvluo Creek.

434
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:35,251
No.

435
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,692
I must write a letter to Xueying.

436
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,972
I encountered the God of Dragon

437
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:44,172
when I was at the bottom
of the Cangwu Abyss.

438
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:46,652
It's likely that the plague
in Jiuyi District

439
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:48,851
and the contaminated water
of Eastern Creek

440
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,051
are the results
of the God of Dragon's awakening.

441
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:53,412
When Wu Xian attacked,

442
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:54,571
he predicted

443
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,131
I would die in the Cangwu Abyss.

444
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:57,691
He also revealed

445
00:33:58,252 --> 00:33:59,772
that there is a sage behind the Ice Clan

446
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,131
who plans for them.

447
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:03,372
Have you heard of him?

448
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:05,252
This sage

449
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,332
can make the Ten Sorcerers
of the Ice Clan

450
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,292
bow down and submit.

451
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:09,772
Surely,

452
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:12,772
he must be an extraordinary
and unparalleled individual.

453
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,772
But I've never heard of him before.

454
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:18,332
It is as if he appeared out of nowhere.

455
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:23,011
It looks like the approaching unrest
in Kongsang is getting closer.

456
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,731
The Merfolk marine force
is constantly causing trouble.

457
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:29,011
Now,

458
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:30,651
with the awakening of the God of Dragon,

459
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:33,492
the rumors of the return of evil

460
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,252
and the Sea Emperor

461
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:36,372
are approaching.

462
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:39,332
The Merfolk marine force
will surely use this opportunity

463
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,252
to incite chaos among the merfolk,

464
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:44,171
leading to a bloody conflict.

465
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:46,571
Ying,

466
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,932
it was the Ice Clan
who attacked you previously.

467
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,731
But the mastermind

468
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:53,211
must be the Azure Clan.

469
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,011
It seems that the Ice Tribe
is no longer content with staying put

470
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:59,651
and has colluded with traitors,
coveting Kongsang.

471
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:03,292
When the world falls into chaos,

472
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:06,731
Jiuyi Mountain cannot

473
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,332
become a secluded sanctuary.

474
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,731
You must prepare yourself early.

475
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:13,691
Rest assured.

476
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,171
As Jiuyi Mountain's
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

477
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:17,972
if Kongsang is in danger,

478
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:19,571
I'll do everything in my power

479
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:20,651
to protect the world.

480
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,772
So my cultivation will not be in vain.

481
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,131
(So the Azure Clan was behind this.)

482
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:31,812
I'm afraid Consort Qing
won't give up easily.

483
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,571
She has already discovered
your identity.

484
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:36,332
She'll do everything possible
to get rid of you.

485
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,091
I only have one identity.

486
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,171
That is the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain.

487
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:44,292
The tree longs for stillness,
but the wind keeps blowing.

488
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:46,051
I shall wait then.

489
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:50,171
(How did Master get involved
with Consort Qing?)

490
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,372
Ying,

491
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,171
this time

492
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,292
you were on the verge
of reaching the real state.

493
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:05,171
But because of saving Zhu Yan,

494
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:07,932
your progress was hindered.

495
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,011
It's uncertain
when you'll have another chance

496
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,691
to attain such a breakthrough.

497
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,812
Don't you regret it?

498
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:17,651
Is Zhu Yan really

499
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:20,171
that important to you?

500
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:23,972
(Could it be)

501
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,131
(that you've fallen for her?)

502
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,452
When I was in danger,

503
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:34,932
it was you who came to my rescue.

504
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,892
It's the responsibility of teachers

505
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,452
to protect their disciples.

506
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,011
Zhu Yan was almost killed
by the Ice Clan

507
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,972
because of me.

508
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,531
It was an unjust calamity.

509
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,131
I hope you

510
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:49,972
won't make things difficult for her

511
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:51,131
because of this incident.

512
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,492
What do you take me for?

513
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,492
Do you think I don't know this?

514
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:00,452
I noticed marks left

515
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:02,812
by artifacts on both of your bodies.

516
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,852
Did something happen during the battle?

517
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,452
When I performed Celestial Assault,

518
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,731
Zhu Yan used Gong Shang

519
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,412
to share the damage with me.

520
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,131
Such a kind and righteous person

521
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,011
is truly rare.

522
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:19,571
Ying,

523
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:23,131
you must treat her well in the future.

524
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,131
Do not disappoint

525
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:25,812
the deep bond

526
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,892
behind her selfless act of saving you.

527
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:42,131
However,

528
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,211
I still need to warn you.

529
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,772
Although Azure King and Consort Qing
can't harm you directly,

530
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:50,372
they might target the people around you.

531
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:52,531
If you don't plan ahead,

532
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,492
Zhu Yan and the Crimson Clan

533
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:58,131
may be implicated because of you.

534
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:04,091
(What is Master's true identity?)

535
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,772
(Why would he implicate
the Crimson Clan and me?)

536
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:12,492
The best course of action now

537
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:15,171
is for you to leave your priesthood

538
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:16,691
and return to the imperial city.

539
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,731
Now, the Azure King and Consort Qing
are behaving tyrannically.

540
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:23,091
The people can no longer bear it.

541
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:26,171
If you're willing to return to Jialan

542
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,252
and reveal your identity
as the Crown Prince,

543
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:31,091
I'm sure
you'll have numerous supporters.

544
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:32,372
Crown Prince?

545
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:35,211
Crown Prince?

546
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:38,731
Master is actually the Crown Prince

547
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:41,332
from back then.

548
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:45,372
If I leave the priesthood,

549
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,211
I must undergo the Tribulations of Hell.

550
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:49,452
When that happens,

551
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:50,972
I'll lose all of my power.

552
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,131
Then how can

553
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:54,892
I protect the people of Kongsang?

554
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,051
I hope you

555
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:00,292
won't have such thoughts anymore.

556
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,892
Why is Yan'er...

557
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,091
She heard everything.

558
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,531
I'm afraid so.

(The most difficult thing in the world
is relationships.)

570
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:16,932
(Ying,)

571
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:18,372
(I want you to endure)

572
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,731
(this most difficult test)

573
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,011
(until you're willing
to descend the mountain for her.)

574
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:00,292
The Crown Prince I've been missing

575
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,011
turns out to be my master.

576
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,252
I actually kissed Master.

577
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:15,571
I must stop thinking about it.

578
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:22,691
(I'm afraid Consort Qing
won't give up easily.)

579
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:24,332
(She has already discovered
your identity.)

580
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:27,171
(She'll do everything possible
to get rid of you.)

581
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:30,051
Even Consort Qing

582
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:31,571
who's far away in Jialan knows

583
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:33,292
about Master's identity.

584
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,452
But why didn't he tell me?

585
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:38,492
I suggest you

586
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:42,452
not waste your life on a foolish idea.

587
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:45,252
No one is worth it.

588
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:50,531
It turns out

589
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:53,452
Master looks down on his past identity.

590
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:56,332
But I keep bothering him.

591
00:41:58,731 --> 00:41:59,972
I'm really foolish.

592
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:03,091
Yan'er.

593
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,332
