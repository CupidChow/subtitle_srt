20
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:09,012
Zhu Yan,

21
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,331
who looks just like her,

22
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,211
is not her reincarnation.

23
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,812
She has no feelings for you.

24
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,692
From now on, they'll travel in pairs

25
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,572
while you'll be all alone.

26
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:21,211
Stop it.

27
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,092
Stop it!

28
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:26,972
I don't want to hear that!

29
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,972
I don't want to hear that!

30
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,171
Zhi Yuan,

31
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:36,931
let's work together.

32
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:40,532
I'll help you turn Zhu Yan into Yao Yi.

33
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,051
I'll let you enjoy her soft embrace.

34
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,132
You just need to bring me across Biluo Sea

35
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,491
and locate the Sea Emperor.

36
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,252
Xuyao,

37
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,412
even if I do die,

38
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,891
I will never let you destroy Yunhuang.

39
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:15,171
Zhi Yuan,

40
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:16,171
stop struggling.

41
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,771
I feast on greed, anger,
resentment, and hatred.

42
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,491
I avoid genuine love.

43
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:22,611
Your beloved is already dead.

44
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,252
Now, there's no one
or anything in the world

45
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:26,771
that can make you reject me.

46
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,092
I'm trying to wake you up here.

47
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,372
I want you to sober up.

48
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,372
We can only achieve a win-win situation

49
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:36,211
if we work together.

50
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,532
That's right.

51
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:47,092
That's right.

52
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,171
We should work together.

53
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:52,812
You will bring Yao Yi back

54
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,812
while I'll locate
the Sea Emperor for you.

Yan'er, are you okay?

59
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,132
Here.

60
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:26,372
Take a break.

61
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,172
Eat up while it's hot.

62
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:28,492
Here.

63
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:29,812
Okay.

64
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:31,372
Waiter,

65
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,451
have you heard of this?

66
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:33,012
What is it?

67
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,971
The Crimson Clan had shielded the leader
of the rebel faction, Zhi Yuan,

68
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:37,451
for 200 years.

69
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,172
Before this, Zhi Yuan

70
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:41,172
staged a rebellion
with the Merfolk marine force.

71
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,372
And now, he's the leader of the Ice Clan.

72
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:49,012
I think he's bent on going against Kongsang.

73
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:50,492
Yeah.

74
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,771
Colluding with Zhi Yuan is a heinous crime.

75
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,372
I heard that the clan leader
and his wife took their own lives

76
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,732
to avoid punishment.

77
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,052
They deserved it.

78
00:04:59,052 --> 00:04:59,692
Precisely.

79
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:02,531
What did you say?

80
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,451
Who took their own lives?

81
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,172
The Crimson King and his consort.

82
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,012
If I must say, their clan got it easy.

83
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,372
Only two of them died.

84
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,052
After committing such a crime,

85
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,891
the entire Crimson Clan should've...

86
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:14,971
Yan'er!

87
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,812
Should've been executed, am I right?

88
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:17,651
Yeah, precisely.

89
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:18,851
They're so detestable.

Princess.

93
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:02,891
Princess.

94
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,531
Please accept my condolences.

95
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,851

96
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,612
Wake up.

97
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:38,091
Mother!

98
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:01,331
Father.

99
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,132
Please wake up.

100
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:09,252
Father.

101
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:09,971
Princess.

102
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:12,172
Please accept our condolences.

103
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,252
His Lordship and Her Ladyship

104
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,612
died because Zhi Yuan...

105
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:18,211
Even if Yuan invaded Kongsang,

106
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,771
Father and Mother could've waited for my return.

107
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,812
They could've explained themselves

108
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:26,091
in front of His Majesty.

109
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,372
Why didn't they wait for my return?

110
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,612
Did someone force them to do so?

111
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,492
Did someone force them
to take their own lives?

112
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,252
Tell me!

113
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,252
Tell me!

114
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,291
It's because Zhi Yuan

115
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,572
issued a challenge against Kongsang.

116
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:51,052
He said...

117
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:54,451
What did he say?

118
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,052
Tell me!

119
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,980
He said he would call off the war

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,732
if we handed the Crimson Clan princess to him.

121
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:03,932
If not,

122
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,291
he'd attack Jialan straight.

123
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:09,252
He'd massacre the cities he conquered.

124
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,252
Xuyao wants to use the Crimson Clan's

125
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,451
honor and reputation

126
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,012
to force you to submit to him.

127
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:16,451
That's right.

128
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,732
The Crimson Clan

129
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,732
was subjected to public criticism
because of that.

130
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,331
His Lordship and Her Ladyship
had no choice

131
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,891
but to take their own lives

132
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:29,812
to sever their ties with Zhi Yuan,

133
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,211
appease the people,

134
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:33,212
and protect the clan.

135
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:34,732
They were worried

136
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,212
that Zhi Yuan might capture them.

137
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,291
When that happens,

138
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,252
Princess,

139
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:42,132
you will be restricted.

140
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:43,452
You'll have no freedom by then.

141
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,212
Mother!

142
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:47,092
Father!

143
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:49,212
Mother!

144
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:51,012
Mother!

145
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:53,571
Yan'er.

146
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,411
This isn't your fault.

147
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,972
Mother!

148
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,931
Mother!

149
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,931
Mother!

150
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,620
(Crimson King's Residence)

151
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:47,492
Father, Mother,

152
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,092
you can head back first.

153
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,492
Once I'm done with revenge,

154
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:55,291
I'll console you back at home.

155
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,411
I no longer have parents now.

156
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,372
Father and Mother were worried
that I might not get used to

157
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:26,571
life around here

158
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:27,691
when they built this residence for me.

159
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:30,651
That's why they decorated it

160
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:33,771
just like our home.

161
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,332
However, this isn't Extreme Wind City after all.

162
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,332
The trees of Western Huang
cannot grow here.

163
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:45,252
Mother and her servants
tried to figure out a solution.

164
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,252
In the end, bay leaves,

165
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,931
pine trees,

166
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:51,811
and ginkgo trees

167
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,051
started growing here.

168
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,332
Now that Mother is gone,

169
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,732
these trees have withered too.

170
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,411
Their leaves are falling one by one.

171
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,811
These are what my mother
left behind for me.

172
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:18,732
I cannot let go of the things here.

173
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:22,691
Yan'er,

174
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:25,612
I think

175
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,571
your mother requested these leaves

176
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:30,931
to pay you a visit

177
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,332
as she was afraid

178
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:34,972
you might be heartbroken.

179
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,732
She hopes that you can continue to live on

180
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:43,492
just like how the trees of Western Huang
are surviving in this place.

181
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:47,931
Don't worry.

182
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,972
I won't fall.

183
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:55,411
I still have plenty of things to accomplish.

184
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,212
Yan'er,

185
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,811
I'll come up with a way

186
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:14,691
to deal with Xuyao as soon as possible.

187
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:17,612
You haven't slept for some days.

188
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:19,452
You should rest early.

189
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,051
(It's salty.)

190
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:34,651
(It's my tear.)

191
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:37,012
(I've regained my taste.)

192
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:37,972
Yan'er,

193
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:40,012
are you okay?

194
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:43,771
I'm fine.

195
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:47,332
Maybe I'm just exhausted.

196
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,811
I'll be fine after some rest.

197
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,452
Here.

198
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:14,651
Yan'er,

199
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:16,372
promise me.

200
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,452
Don't let your imagination run wild.

201
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,171
(Could it be that Xuyao's spell
is affecting me?)

202
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,691
(Is he going to turn me
into great-great-grandmother?)

203
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:54,811
Your Majesty,

204
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,291
Prince Shi Ying seeks an audience with you.

205
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:02,691
Greetings, Your Majesty.

206
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:04,651
Ying.

207
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,531
You're back.

208
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:10,691
The incident with the Crimson King,

209
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,571
it happened due to my incompetence.

210
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,291
I knew he was a loyal subject.

211
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,931
However, I could only sit idly by
as he sacrificed himself.

212
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:21,691
I...

213
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,492
I cannot escape my responsibility.

214
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,051
Your Majesty, please grant me
authority over your soldiers.

215
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,972
Zhu Yan and I

216
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,012
shall repel the Ice Clan

217
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,931
and uphold justice
for the Crimson King and his consort.

218
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,411
Zhi Yuan

219
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,531
is just a merfolk.

220
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:47,372
How did he end up

221
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,571
getting involved with the Ice Clan?

222
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:50,972
The current Zhi Yuan

223
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,732
is no longer the person we knew.

224
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:55,771
Now, he's just a puppet

225
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:57,531
under the God of Destruction's control.

226
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,012
What?

227
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:02,732
The God of Destruction?

228
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,291
Are you referring to...

229
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,092
That's right.

230
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,411
It's the God of Destruction,
one of the primordial gods

231
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:11,411
in Yunhuang.

232
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,012
It's the God of Destruction, Xuyao.

233
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,691
Xuyao has no powers.

234
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:16,452
However, he's extremely adept

235
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,651
at manipulating people's desires

236
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:18,891
to turn them into their puppets.

237
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:20,771
Back then,

238
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:23,051
he was the one who instigated
Emperor Xingzun.

239
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,691
Emperor Xingzun.

240
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:28,212
Your Majesty,

241
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:31,252
back then, Xuyao manipulated
Emperor Xingzun's obsession

242
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,291
toward Empress Bai Wei.

243
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,931
That's how the situation
ended up like this.

244
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:43,291
So,

245
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,732
we're going against
the God of Destruction now?

246
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,612
Our warriors who returned from
the frontline said

247
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,771
he was immortal.

248
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,732
The Ice Clan army he commanded

249
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:59,691
looked like they were possessed.

250
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,372
They charged forward
with no hesitations.

251
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,012
That's the effect of Xuyao's
bewitching power

252
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,132
after being enhanced by the Ring of Houtu
and Heavenly Divine Ring.

253
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,492
That's how the soldiers of the Ice Clan

254
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,571
turn into zombies.

255
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,291
Seems like God wants Kongsang
to die here.

256
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:17,732
Your Majesty,

257
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,452
that's why Zhu Yan and I

258
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:20,771
have to retrieve the Ring of Houtu
and Heavenly Divine Ring

259
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:23,372
before Xuyao locates the Sea Emperor.

260
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:24,732
If not,

261
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,372
Kongsang will not be
the only one in trouble.

262
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,012
The entire Yunhuang

263
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,931
might be jeopardized too.

264
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,372
And now, you're volunteering
to go against him?

265
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,132
Aren't you afraid

266
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,252
of going against a god?

267
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,531
If a god gains pleasure from
the suffering of all living beings,

268
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:48,132
he doesn't deserve to be worshipped.

269
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:51,732
Men have never slain gods before.

270
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,012
If so, I shall be the first.

271
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,691
Ying.

272
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,252
You should escape.

273
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:02,852
If I escape now,

274
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:05,972
where can all the other beings
escape to?

275
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,412
I won't escape.

276
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:38,051
Xuyao.

277
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,300
(Crimson King's Residence)

278
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:56,652
Your Highness.

279
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,331
Young Lady has headed
to the top of White Tower.

280
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,692
She said she would wait there for you.

281
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,291
The top of White Tower? Why?

282
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:02,892
Maybe Young Lady has something

283
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,452
to tell you, Your Highness.

284
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:19,851
Yan'er!

285
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:31,051
Yan'er.

286
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,331
Shi Ying.

287
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,771
You once promised me
that you'd marry me.

288
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,452
Does that promise still count?

289
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,291
Of course.

290
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:46,892
Good.

291
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,131
If so, you and I should get married right now.

292
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,652
Now,

293
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,611
I no longer have any family members.

294
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,291
Shi Ying,

295
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,172
I want you

296
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:02,252
to be my only family member
for the rest of my life.

297
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:15,972
Okay.

298
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:23,012
(Bowing to the heavens,
with the stars as witnesses.)

299
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,851
(The moon waxes and wanes,)

300
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,611
(while the stars reflect eternity.)

301
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,131
(Bowing to the ancestral hall,
seeking the ancestors' blessings.)

302
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,811
(Bowing to each other.)

303
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,131
Gods above,

304
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,100
I, Shi Ying,

305
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,972
am willing to marry Zhu Yan.

306
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,331
I will love her, protect her,

307
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,331
and support her forever.

308
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:21,692
Gods above,

309
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:23,380
I, Zhu Yan,

310
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,732
am willing to marry Shi Ying.

311
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,571
I will respect him, love him,

312
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,252
and never leave his side.

313
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:37,531
You don't drink usually.

314
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:39,371
But you should at least

315
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,371
drink during such an occasion.

316
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,331
Of course.

317
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:53,732
Yan'er,

318
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:54,972
look.

319
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:09,732
Those are the Gong and Shang Stars.

320
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,571
These two stars

321
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,972
are reflected in our cups.

322
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:18,452
Seems like these two stars
are the guests

323
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,131
God has invited to our wedding.

324
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:22,371
I have no regrets now.

325
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:40,252
Yan'er,

326
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:41,452
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,571
I couldn't fulfill the wish you made

328
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,091
in Extreme Wind City.

329
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,892
I couldn't provide you
with a lively wedding.

330
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:53,851
Initially, I thought

331
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,571
my friends and family members

332
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,252
would join us

333
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,851
as we celebrated our wedding.

334
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,412
However,

335
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:04,452
I'm already lucky enough
to hold your hands

336
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:06,771
in such a chaotic world.

337
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,012
Once the crisis in Kongsang
has been averted,

338
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:15,212
I'll definitely hold
another wedding ceremony

339
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:17,091
that you like.

340
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:25,652
The starry sky

341
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,291
is watching over us.

342
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:28,892
It's as if we've returned

343
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:32,012
to the lakeside of Starry Lake.

344
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,732
This is already

345
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,452
the happiest night of my life.

(I shall go to him.)

361
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,291
(I'll find a way to defeat him completely.)

362
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:01,212
(But since we've promised)

363
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:02,611
(to grow old together,)

364
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,692
(I'll definitely return to your side.)

00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:17,771

00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:24,492
(It looked gorgeous.)

369
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:26,811
(You guys always smiled)

370
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:28,732
(and patted my head,)

371
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,531
(saying that the robe
could only be worn)

372
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,732
(by the female leader of the clan.)

373
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:35,012
(You guys said you wanted me

His Majesty's condition suddenly
deteriorated yesterday.

403
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,851

couldn't do anything about it.

I...

411
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,091
I can't live for long.

412
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:32,291
I'll leave the kingdom of Kongsang

Don't leave us!

416
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:41,851
Father!

417
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,331
Ying.

418
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:50,412
You're here.

419
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,252
I know

420
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:57,172
that one of the two most important people
in your life

421
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:02,252
died while harboring a grudge
because of me.

422
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,051
As for the other person,

423
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:10,091
I couldn't protect her or her clan.

424
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:13,972
Do you hate me?

425
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:17,212

426
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:28,012
I've let you down

427
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:30,811
all this while.

428
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:35,412
I don't expect you

429
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:39,692
to forgive me.

430
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:42,892
But as your father,

431
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:44,892
I'm begging you.

432
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,252
Please look after Shi Yu.

433
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,892
Please protect Kongsang

434
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:57,692
and its people.

435
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,611
Do not let

436
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,452
the Menghua Dynasty

437
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:08,252
be eradicated.

438
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,892

439
00:28:17,692 --> 00:28:21,051
As an emperor

440
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:25,811
or as your father,

441
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:30,012
I was a failure.

442
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:33,452
I...

443
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,811
I've let you two down.

444
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,531
You two

445
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,331
must

446
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,692
look after each other.

447
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:48,012
Father,

448
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:49,692
I'll definitely keep my promise.

449
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:53,811
Don't worry.

450
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,131
Father.

451
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:09,892
Father!

452
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,252
Father!

453
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:14,892
Father!

454
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:17,771
Father!

455
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:33,131
(The Menghua Dynasty
will fall eventually.)

456
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:36,212
(I will lay waste to
the corrupted Jialan)

457
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,291
(and rebuild Yunhuang.)

458
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:30,051
I will take over the world.

459
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:34,051
And, I want her to turn into my Yao Yi.

460
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:49,652
Facing the Ice Clan army

461
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:50,972
who was resistant

462
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,012
against pain and death,

463
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:55,892
the soldiers of Kongsang
still fought on valiantly.

464
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:57,412
Although they tried their best,

465
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:58,811
they were already exhausted.

466
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:02,331
And, those were just their vanguards.

467
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:03,771
More of their soldiers

468
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:05,131
are on their way here.

469
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,252
Tracing back to its roots,

470
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,732
it's all because of Xuyao's growing power.

471
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:12,732
However,

472
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:14,611
right now, our priority is
to ensure Jialan's safety

473
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:15,771
by breaking free of their encirclement.

474
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:18,371
We can make other plans after that.

475
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,291
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,172
Is there anything we can do?

477
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:25,811
I brought some help.

478
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:28,091
Jiuyi Mountain will contribute
to the cause

479
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,932
when the world is in chaos.

480
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:34,091
Good.

481
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:35,611
Qing Gang,

482
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:36,652
Bai Xuelu,

483
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:40,051
you two shall be the commander and
vice-commander of this battle.

484
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:41,652
You two will lead the entire army

485
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,412
and provide reinforcements
to whoever requires it.

486
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,412
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

487
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:46,571

- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

492
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:54,012
Each of you will lead an army

493
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:55,892
to battle the Ice Clan army.

494
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:57,131
Defend your ground.

495
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:59,732
Do not let them enter the city.

496
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:01,291
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

497
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,252
Four Grand Marshals,

498
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:05,531
please lead

499
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,412
your immortal officials in the battle.

500
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,051
If you encounter any strong opponents,

501
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,571
use the smoke signal.

502
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:11,892
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

503
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,212
Our nation is on the brink of destruction.

504
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:18,012
I shall entrust Kongsang's safety

505
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,771
to you all.

506
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:22,892
We shall defend the nation
with our lives

507
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:24,692
and repay the nation.

508
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:36,371
Yuan.

509
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,091
Yao Yi?

510
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:47,692
It's you.

511
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,091
Shi Ying,

512
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:03,452
have you figured out any solutions?

513
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:05,172
I've been thinking

514
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,571
all this while.

515
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,732
No matter how strong the two divine rings are,

516
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,331
they were forged by Emperor Xingzun.

517
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:16,331
Qiyao was created by
Emperor Xingzun as well.

518
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:20,012
We could try fighting fire with fire.

519
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:21,252
It's worth a shot.

520
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,571
Since when did you turn into Yao Yi?

521
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:29,131
The day I returned to Ye City,

522
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:31,212
I saw the bodies

523
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:32,811
of the Crimson King and his consort.

524
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:36,452
I was filled with anguish and despair.

525
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,972
I began to hate my identity as Zhu Yan.

526
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:47,172
Zhu Yan is conceited.

527
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,412
In reality, she cannot achieve anything.

528
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,892
She only drags her parents down.

529
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,492
I think that's the reason

530
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:59,252
the curse in my body was activated.

531
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:02,012
If that's the case,

532
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,291
you should hate me.

533
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,012
They died because of me.

534
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:15,292
Naturally, I would hate you

535
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,332
if I was Zhu Yan.

536
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:20,651
But now,

537
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:22,852
I'm Yao Yi.

538
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:25,892
Although I cannot forgive you

539
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:27,892
for what you've done to Kongsang,

540
00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:33,492
if you can stop what you're doing

541
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:35,332
and turn over a new leaf...

542
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:43,171
You're using the same trick again.

543
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:53,731
My spell didn't work at all.

544
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:55,611
You're still Zhu Yan.

545
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:00,731
You came to me

546
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,932
so that you could trick me

547
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,131
into achieving your goal.

548
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:11,251
You're not Yao Yi.

549
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:21,812
How is it?

550
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,412
Was I right?

551
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:44,611
How did it go?

552
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,292
I sensed the power

553
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,251
of the Heavenly Divine Ring just now.

554
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:52,731
However,

555
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:53,892
there's a stronger power

556
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,452
that's fighting for the ring too.

557
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,772
I think Xuyao activated

558
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,211
the Heavenly Divine Ring's chant.

559
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:02,131
And then?

560
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:06,731
I tried my best to resist it.

561
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,332
But I was no match for him.

562
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:10,412
However,

563
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,531
Xuyao had to expend more energy

564
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,571
in order to control the Heavenly Divine Ring.

565
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:16,772
I think he cannot use his power,

566
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:18,171
which was enhanced by both rings,

567
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:19,772
to bewitch the soldiers for now.

568
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:25,051
Darned Shi Ying.

569
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,131
How dare he summoned
the Heavenly Divine Ring?

570
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,772
Now, I've lost control over my army.

571
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:32,852
He has the Emperor's Blood.

572
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:34,452
He was the original successor
of the Heavenly Divine Ring.

573
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,852
You're still speaking up for him?

574
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:42,571
I knew you were lying to me.

575
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,691
Of course I'm Yao Yi.

576
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:49,731
However,

577
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:53,251
you aren't my Yuan.

578
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:17,211
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

579
00:38:17,651 --> 00:38:19,412
the Ice Clan army has returned
to their mortal forms.

580
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,611
Seems like my prediction was correct.

581
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:31,492
The Ice Clan army has returned
to their mortal forms.

582
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:33,452
Chong Ming,

583
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,171
let's go.

584
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,571
We should use this opportunity
to achieve victory.

585
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:39,171
But what about Zhu Yan?

586
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:40,932
Shi Ying,

587
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:42,531
I know the Qiyao spell

588
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:43,932
cannot help us to retrieve
the Heavenly Divine Ring.

589
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:45,531
However, we might be able
to save Zhu Yan with it.

590
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:46,932
We can't afford to wait any longer.

591
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:48,932
What if something happens to her?

592
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:50,571
Shi Ying,

593
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:51,932
I will assist you.

594
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,131
Let's give it a try.

595
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:54,051
No.

596
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:55,892
I cannot go.

597
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:03,372
Yan'er and I made a promise

598
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:05,452
to grow old

599
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:07,372
together.

600
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:09,492
She'll definitely return to me.

601
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,051
No matter what decision she makes,

602
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,012
I'll give her my full support.

603
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:17,531
I guess we have no choice then.

604
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:20,651
What should we do now?

605
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:23,892
After Jialan breaks free
of its encirclement,

606
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:27,972
I will bring her back

607
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:31,051
no matter where she is.

608
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:38,932
Yao Yi,

609
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:41,211
I made a deal with Xuyao.

610
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,932
Since you've returned to my side,

611
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,171
I have to bring him to Biluo Sea

612
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:47,332
and locate the Sea Emperor.

613
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:49,571
Locate the Sea Emperor?

614
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:52,531
What happens after that?

615
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,492
Don't tell me

616
00:39:58,492 --> 00:39:59,531
you want to use the two rings

617
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,611
to activate the spell of destruction

618
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:03,012
and destroy Yunhuang?

619
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:07,372
Since I've already
made a promise to him,

620
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:09,932
I should honor my promise.

621
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:13,812
(This is bad.)

622
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:15,691
(Seems like Xuyao convinced Yuan
to join him)

623
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:16,772
(when his obsession with Yao Yi)

624
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,611
(was realized.)

625
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:20,131
(I have to find a way)

626
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,091
(to steal the rings from him)

627
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,412
(before he brings Xuyao to Biluo Sea.)

628
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:27,332
I'm doing this for your sake.

629
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:29,571
For my sake?

630
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:31,852
I wish to create Neo Yunhuang,

631
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:34,292
where everyone is equal.

632
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:37,372
This way, you can fall for a merfolk
without any consequences.

633
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,731
No one will criticize you again.

634
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,932
But before that,

635
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,412
I have to eradicate Yunhuang completely.

636
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:49,492
I think

637
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,171
you have a point.

638
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:55,251
Yao Yi,

639
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:57,131
do you understand my point now?

640
00:40:59,292 --> 00:40:59,812
By then,

641
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,051
we shall rule the world together.

642
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,211
Just like what Xingzun and Bai Wei did

643
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:04,531
7,000 years ago.

644
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:07,211
But Yuan,

645
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:10,051
when you activate
the spell of destruction,

646
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,372
the two divine rings will protect you.

647
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:16,131
I will be reduced to dust.

648
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:20,211
You don't need to worry about that.

649
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:22,452
I will protect you.

650
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:25,571
However, you know this too.

651
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,091
I'm not willing to become a parasite.

652
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,332
The two divine rings

653
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:52,332
were worn by Xingzun and Bai Wei respectively.

654
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:54,412
Now, I shall give you

655
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:55,691
the Ring of Houtu.

656
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:57,131
I will also teach you its incantation.

657
00:41:58,012 --> 00:41:59,211
With this, you can protect yourself

658
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:00,691
during Yunhuang's destruction.

659
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,012
In the future,

660
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:04,091
you and I will be equal.

661
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:05,611
We'll be a perfect match.

662
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:09,611
I will definitely fulfill your wish.

663
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,932
Through my entire life,

664
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:16,691
no regrets, no remorse.

665
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,292
May these mountains and seas

666
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:20,972
be boundless and limitless.

667
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,292
Through my entire life,

668
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:25,892
no regrets, no remorse.

669
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:27,611
May these mountains and seas

670
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:29,611
be boundless and limitless.

671
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:47,651
Look.

672
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:50,731
Aren't they a perfect match?

673
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:54,251
Yuan,

674
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:58,611
the incantation of this ring
sounds so compassionate.

675
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:00,611
I wonder

676
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:02,972
what the incantation of
the Heavenly Divine Ring

677
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:04,972
sounds like.

678
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:09,852
You will know
during the destruction of Yunhuang.

679
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:12,772
So,

680
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,091
when do you plan to
locate the Sea Emperor?

681
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:20,012
I...

682
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:23,452
I think it can wait

683
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:26,531
until the night of our wedding is over.

684
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:32,412
All right.

685
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:35,051
I promise you.

686
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:52,251
Wu Xian!

687
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:54,492
The Ice Clan armies have
either surrendered or died.

688
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,051
Your army is annihilated.

689
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:57,531
You won't be able to escape!

690
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:00,571
You won't be able to kill me off.

691
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:03,012
The sage gave me this.

692
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,180
Do you think you can still survive

693
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,012
without the Nine-Tailed Core?

694
00:45:59,211 --> 00:45:59,571
Yan'er.

695
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:03,131
Shi Ying?

696
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:04,691
You must've waited for a long time.

697
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:07,611
Follow me.

698
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:23,211
Yan'er,

699
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:25,131
are you okay?

700
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:27,171
I'm fine.

701
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:29,251
Although I took the initiative
to act on my own,

702
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:31,211
you understood my intention.

703
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:32,452
I'm very happy.

704
00:46:34,812 --> 00:46:36,091
I've already retrieved
the Ring of Houtu.

705
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:38,171
He still has the Heavenly Divine Ring.

706
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:39,691
However,

707
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:40,731
as long as you can get your hands

708
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,412
on the ring's incantation,

709
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:42,531
you can wield it.

710
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:44,892
Just now, I came up with an idea to fish

711
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,531
the Heavenly Divine Ring's incantation
out of him.

712
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:47,892
Yao Yi.

713
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:50,091
Yao Yi, where are you?

714
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:53,412
Shi Ying,

715
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:55,972
encountering you

716
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:00,492
was the happiest thing
that had happened to me.

717
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:06,972
Yan...

718
00:47:26,412 --> 00:47:26,972
No.

719
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:29,651
I mustn't let Yan'er
take the risk alone.

720
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:31,091
Yao Yi,

721
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:32,972
where are you?

722
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:34,852
Yuan.

723
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:35,932
Yuan.

724
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:43,611
Yao Yi,

725
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:45,892
I thought you left me.

726
00:48:00,772 --> 00:48:01,372
(No.)

727
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,412
(Yan'er's power is enhanced
by the Ring of Houtu.)

728
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:06,332
Yuan,

729
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:07,932
why would I leave you?

730
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:09,571
Yuan,

731
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:11,972
if you're still worried about me,

732
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:16,131
why don't you complete the spell

733
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:17,211
you haven't cast

734
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,332
and turn me into Yao Yi completely?

735
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:21,571
What did you say?

736
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:23,412
For your sake,

737
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:27,531
I'm willing to erase
all of my memories as Zhu Yan.

738
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:32,691
Yan'er!

739
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,292
Don't be silly!

740
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,171
Cast the spell

741
00:48:43,731 --> 00:48:45,131
and turn me into Yao Yi completely.

742
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:49,972
All right.

743
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:52,571
I'll cast the spell now.

744
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:01,852
Through my entire life,

745
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:04,571
no regrets, no remorse.

746
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,571
May these mountains and seas

747
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:10,051
be boundless and limitless.

748
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,772
Through my entire life,

749
00:49:39,091 --> 00:49:40,651
no regrets, no remorse.

750
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:44,651
May these mountains and seas

751
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:49,531
be boundless and limitless.

752
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:00,211
Through

753
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:01,492
my

754
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:03,492
entire

755
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:04,611
life...

756
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:09,452
Why isn't it working?

757
00:50:11,452 --> 00:50:12,372
Through my entire life,

758
00:50:12,932 --> 00:50:13,812
no regrets, no remorse.

759
00:50:14,772 --> 00:50:15,691
May these mountains and seas

760
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:17,292
be boundless and limitless.

761
00:50:19,651 --> 00:50:20,091
Yuan,

762
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:21,372
the horn of Kongsang
has been sounded!

763
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:23,051
Hurry up.

764
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:24,571
Cast the spell and turn me into Yao Yi.

765
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,211
Let's fight off the enemies together.

766
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:10,972
I shall enter the real state.

767
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:12,772
I shall enter the real state!

768
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,880
(I shall enter the real state)

769
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:17,812
Through my entire life...

770
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:22,892
Shapeless and formless.

771
00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:24,372
Shapeless

772
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:26,251
and formless!

773
00:51:27,412 --> 00:51:28,772
No regrets, no remorse...

774
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:30,731
The millenniums of Yunhuang.

775
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:33,571
The millenniums of Yunhuang!

776
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:36,812
May these mountains and seas

777
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:38,372
Limitless...

778
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:39,171
Limitless...

779
00:51:39,731 --> 00:51:43,051
Be boundless and limitless...

780
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:47,772
And free of worries!

781
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,580
(And free of worries)

782
00:51:59,012 --> 00:51:59,651
It's you?

783
00:52:01,332 --> 00:52:01,691
Yan'er.

784
00:52:03,012 --> 00:52:03,611
Are you okay?

785
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,332
I was barely surviving with it.

786
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:09,772
Shi Ying,

787
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:11,251
I never expected you

788
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:12,372
to learn the last part
of the incantation

789
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:13,171
at the very last moment

790
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:14,932
he was chanting the incantation.

791
00:52:17,412 --> 00:52:18,611
You lied to me again.

792
00:52:21,412 --> 00:52:22,091
Now, we have both Heavenly Divine Ring

793
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,372
and Ring of Houtu.

794
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:24,812
Xuyao,

795
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:27,131
we will never let you harm Yunhuang.

796
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:29,452
Today

797
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,012
will be our final showdown.

798
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:34,211
I'm going to kill you guys!

799
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:49,731
You guys can never kill me.

800
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:51,452
I will trap you guys

801
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:52,972
in this Illusionary Realm forever.

802
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,211
Kongsang will suffer
the same fate as you two.

803
00:53:56,372 --> 00:53:57,852
It will be shrouded by darkness

804
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:00,211
forever!

805
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:32,772
Shi Ying!

806
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:22,932
How is this possible?

807
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:23,892
Zhi Yuan,

808
00:58:24,332 --> 00:58:25,731
the person you loved was already gone!

809
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:27,892
How could you break free of my control?

810
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:30,332
Yuan!

811
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:31,492
- Yan'er.
- Don't come near me!

812
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:33,492
Don't.

813
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:36,531
Just let me perish together with Xuyao.

814
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:38,611
Yan'er,

815
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:41,972
you must've suffered.

816
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:44,972
It's all my fault.

817
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:48,972
I only managed to sober up
after so long.

818
00:58:53,332 --> 00:58:54,012
I'm sorry.

819
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:37,412
Yuan!

820
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:06,131
Yan'er!

821
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:11,531
Yan...

822
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:20,571
It's Xuyao.

823
01:00:21,412 --> 01:00:22,731
Xuyao has entered your body.

824
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:31,412
That merfolk

825
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:33,211
wanted me to leave.

826
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:35,531
Such wishful thinking.

827
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,131
I'm Xuyao, the God of Destruction.

828
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:45,012
Zhu Yan,

829
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,892
now,

830
01:00:48,372 --> 01:00:49,571
it's your turn.

831
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:53,571
Yan'er.

832
01:00:54,772 --> 01:00:55,972
The person I love is
right in front of me.

833
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:57,932
I have no obsessions.

834
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:59,412
Don't try to bewitch me.

835
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:02,171
Yan'er.

836
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:04,691
But your parents died

837
01:01:04,932 --> 01:01:06,332
because of you.

838
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:07,772
And,

839
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:08,651
Shi Ying

840
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:10,972
already died once

841
01:01:11,452 --> 01:01:12,731
because of your cursed existence.

842
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:14,972
Yan'er,

843
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,012
that's not your fault.

844
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:22,051
Do you think your beloved

845
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:23,651
can stay by your side

846
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:24,651
for the rest of your life?

847
01:01:25,372 --> 01:01:27,531
Only I am good enough for you.

848
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:27,972
Yan'er,

849
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,171
don't listen to him!

850
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:32,772
He's doing this to control you

851
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:33,412
so that he can...

852
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:42,531
- Yan'er!
- Shi Ying!

853
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:43,892
No!

854
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:50,292
Good girl.

855
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:52,131
This is more like it.

856
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:53,251
Yan'er!

857
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:54,531
I'm over here!

858
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:56,251
Do you still remember?

859
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,452
You were the one who made
the Star Revival Blood Oath

860
01:01:58,932 --> 01:01:59,852
to save my life.

861
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:01,852
Your parents

862
01:02:02,412 --> 01:02:03,492
will never blame you for this.

863
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:04,611
No.

864
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,611
I only want them to stay by my side.

865
01:02:07,372 --> 01:02:09,972
The rest must die!

866
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:22,892
Yan'er!

867
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:24,372
Yan'er!

868
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,171
It's all my fault.

869
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:28,812
It's all because
I failed to protect you.

870
01:02:31,932 --> 01:02:32,412
Yan'er,

871
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,812
please remember this.

872
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,372
Encountering you

873
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,292
was the happiest thing

874
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:40,571
that had happened to me.

875
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:56,691
Shi Ying.

876
01:03:58,211 --> 01:03:58,651
Shi Ying?

877
01:03:59,251 --> 01:03:59,972
- You are...
- Don't come near me!

878
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:06,531
Shi Ying!

879
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:07,972
You...

880
01:04:09,251 --> 01:04:10,972
This is truly unexpected.

881
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:12,571
Shi Ying,

882
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:15,651
did you think you and Zhu Yan

883
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:17,531
could trap me?

884
01:04:17,932 --> 01:04:18,332
No!

885
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:19,251
Shi Ying!

886
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:21,452
No.

887
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,412
I will seal you away with my life.

888
01:04:24,972 --> 01:04:25,372
No!

889
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:26,972
No, Shi Ying!

890
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,012
Do you think you two

891
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:31,372
can trap me, Xuyao,
the God of Destruction?

892
01:04:34,892 --> 01:04:35,531
Is that so?

893
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:37,372
Let's just wait and see!

894
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:42,892
Shi Ying!

895
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:49,852
Yan'er!

896
01:04:54,292 --> 01:04:54,972
Shi Ying!

897
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:56,852
The two divine rings
are mine now.

898
01:04:58,131 --> 01:04:58,731
Zhu Yan,

899
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:01,091
you two will never be able to kill me off.

900
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:02,571
Yunhuang

901
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,012
and Kongsang,

902
01:05:04,012 --> 01:05:05,372
it's mine now!

903
01:05:07,691 --> 01:05:08,251
Shi Ying!

904
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:09,412
You!

905
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:13,091
You two will never be able
to eliminate me.

906
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:14,812
I'm sure there's another way.

907
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:15,812
Shi Ying!

908
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:17,332
Another way?

909
01:05:18,932 --> 01:05:19,691
You two

910
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:21,051
will never be able to kill me off!

911
01:05:27,211 --> 01:05:27,932
Don't come here!

912
01:05:37,611 --> 01:05:38,051
Shi Ying!

913
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:39,372
Yan'er,

914
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,131
we can definitely get rid of Xuyao

915
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:44,452
with our powers combined.

916
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:10,731
Yan'er.

917
01:06:18,332 --> 01:06:19,332
I told you already.

918
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:21,772
You two will never
be able to kill me off!

919
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:22,812
You!

920
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,292
You're the one who killed him!

921
01:06:27,012 --> 01:06:27,412
No.

922
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,251
Shi Ying!

923
01:06:29,972 --> 01:06:30,492
Shi Ying!

924
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,651
What should I do?

925
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:34,731
What should I do?

926
01:06:36,571 --> 01:06:37,051
Yan'er,

927
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:41,012
by killing me, you'll be helping me.

928
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:42,531
This way,

929
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:44,531
I can seal Xuyao

930
01:06:45,012 --> 01:06:46,571
in my body forever.

931
01:06:55,372 --> 01:06:57,611
You two are still as naive as always.

932
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:00,611
You two can never kill me off.

933
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:02,571
I'm Xuyao.

934
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:06,211
The both two rings are mine!

935
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:07,531
Zhu Yan,

936
01:07:08,932 --> 01:07:11,211
will you kill Shi Ying once again?

937
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:13,972
Will you kill off the person you love?

938
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:19,372
Yan'er.

939
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:21,452
Yan'er.

940
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:22,611
Do it.

941
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:31,452
Do it!

942
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:12,691
I can't!

943
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:13,731
I...

944
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:16,732
I knew you couldn't do it.

945
01:08:21,572 --> 01:08:22,051
Yan'er.

946
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:24,852
Yan'er,

947
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:26,291
do you remember?

948
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,012
As long as you're willing,

949
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:31,932
you can always make it in time.

950
01:08:33,091 --> 01:08:35,091
You can always achieve it.

951
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:43,131
Shi Ying!

952
01:08:45,732 --> 01:08:46,411
Zhu Yan,

953
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:49,852
you're the cursed lady
in Shi Ying's life.

954
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:52,732
Will you lead him
to his death once again?

955
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:05,291
Shi Ying!

956
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:39,572
Shi Ying!

957
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:45,532
Yan'er,

958
01:09:48,091 --> 01:09:48,852
just do it.

959
01:09:50,411 --> 01:09:50,972
No.

960
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:52,131
Kill me.

961
01:09:55,732 --> 01:09:56,772
Do it.

962
01:10:00,732 --> 01:10:01,291
Shi Ying.

963
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:02,211
Shi Ying!

964
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:08,131
Zhu Yan.

965
01:10:13,012 --> 01:10:14,012
Why do...

966
01:10:15,852 --> 01:10:17,211
Why do we cultivate our powers?

967
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:21,692
To save the world from danger.

968
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:57,291
Yan'er,

969
01:10:58,331 --> 01:10:59,251
whenever

970
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:03,291
the Snowy Rosa blooms,

971
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,652
that means I'm here to visit you.

972
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:53,211

(whenever the Snowy Rosa blooms,)

986
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,972
(that means I'm here to visit you.)

987
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,060
(One year later)

988
01:13:42,772 --> 01:13:43,251
Your Majesty,

989
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:44,812
the Azure King and White Queen
seek an audience.

990
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:52,972
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

991
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:54,532
There are no outsiders here.

992
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:55,371
Spare the formalities.

993
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:57,812
What do you need?

994
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,652
I'm here to step down from my position.

995
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:01,211
I recommend Qing Yi

996
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:02,772
to be the Azure King.

997
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:04,491
But why?

998
01:14:05,572 --> 01:14:06,251
All clan leaders

999
01:14:06,772 --> 01:14:08,131
must station themselves
at their territories.

1000
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:10,131
I'm the Azure King

1001
01:14:10,532 --> 01:14:11,532
while Bailu is the White Queen.

1002
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,331
We never had time
to spend with each other

1003
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:15,211
even after our marriage.

1004
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:18,451
I no longer wish

1005
01:14:18,451 --> 01:14:19,291
to continue such a life.

1006
01:14:20,131 --> 01:14:21,331
Xuelu is superior to me

1007
01:14:21,532 --> 01:14:23,331
in both political affairs and working effort.

1008
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,371
If so, I shall fulfill her wish

1009
01:14:25,932 --> 01:14:27,331
of reviving Ye City.

1010
01:14:29,451 --> 01:14:29,812
All right.

1011
01:14:30,932 --> 01:14:31,451
I will approve your request.

1012
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:34,211
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

1013
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,051
Luckily, I have you two

1014
01:14:36,091 --> 01:14:36,732
as my trusted aides.

1015
01:14:37,692 --> 01:14:39,732
If not, I won't be able to deal with
incidents

1016
01:14:40,732 --> 01:14:41,812
like the Ice Clan's rebellion
and the God of Destruction's evil plan

1017
01:14:41,972 --> 01:14:43,051
one year ago.

1018
01:14:44,331 --> 01:14:46,331
I saw Zhu Yan at the entrance just now.

1019
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:48,331
Zhu Yan has been pursuing

1020
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,051
the rebels of the Ice Clan
all this while.

1021
01:14:51,812 --> 01:14:52,932
Now that the war is over,

1022
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:54,932
she can finally take a break.

1023
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:57,692
It's a shame
that the Priest of Grand Preceptor is...

1024
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:00,972
I'm sure Ying will watch over her

1025
01:15:01,932 --> 01:15:02,892
and Kongsang

1026
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:04,932
in Heaven.

1027
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:05,491
Long,

1028
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:07,411
why don't we visit Father?

1029
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,451
Long, have you been a good boy today?

1030
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:17,012
Did you make your mother angry?

1031
01:15:17,532 --> 01:15:18,772
Your Majesty, please stop joking around.

1032
01:15:19,131 --> 01:15:20,451
It would be terrifying

1033
01:15:20,451 --> 01:15:21,291
if our child could speak at this age.

1034
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:22,411
- Am I right?
- Long.

1035
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:24,051
Long, come.

1036
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:29,451
Yong Long is our first child.

1037
01:15:29,732 --> 01:15:31,211
It's not surprising even if he can talk

1038
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:32,091
before he's one year old.

1039
01:15:34,852 --> 01:15:36,852
So many things have happened
in the past few years.

1040
01:15:36,852 --> 01:15:37,812
He's so adorable.

1041
01:15:38,012 --> 01:15:41,652
I hope our child can live up to his name.

1042
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:43,291
Long.

1043
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:44,491
May Kongsang prosper

1044
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:46,131
and the Menghua Dynasty last forever.

1045
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:46,812
Look.

1046
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:48,652
Long.

1047
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:50,411
Long.

1048
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:04,331
This is the place

1049
01:16:04,491 --> 01:16:05,532
where we first met.

1050
01:16:06,772 --> 01:16:09,291
When the wind rises,
it sounds like bells.

1051
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:11,171
When the wind falls,
flowers fall like snow.

1052
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,451
But all these beautiful sceneries

1053
01:16:16,732 --> 01:16:18,091
are nothing compared to you.

1054
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,812
I kept my end of the bargain.

1055
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:26,812
What about you?

1056
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:28,732
You said you would

1057
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,491
hold another grand wedding for me.

1058
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:33,652
You said we would travel
Yunhuang together.

1059
01:16:35,131 --> 01:16:36,692
You said we would never be apart,

1060
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:37,772
just like the Gong and Shang Stars.

1061
01:16:40,411 --> 01:16:41,331
But you didn't even

1062
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:43,171
appear in my dream

1063
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:44,331
