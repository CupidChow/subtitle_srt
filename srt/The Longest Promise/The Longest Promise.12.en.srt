19
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,068
Greetings to Priest.

20
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,107
Whose bracelet is it
on the Priest's hand?

21
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,107
I have no idea.

22
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,508
Is it yours?

23
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:04,228
I don't know.

24
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,027
It looks alike.

25
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,187
Whose bracelet is it?

26
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,467
Red light.

27
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:13,868
A red light?

28
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:14,508
How could it be hers?

29
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:15,827
It looks like the bracelet
Zhu Yan woven.

30
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:16,587
Yes.

31
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:17,667
You're kidding me.

32
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:18,387
No way.

33
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:19,508
Look, Yan.

34
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,987
Priest used your grass bracelet

35
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:21,707
to do a demonstration.

36
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,068
It really is Zhu Yan's.

37
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,267
Seriously?

38
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,147
It really is in red.

39
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:30,427
You've witnessed

40
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,068
the function of Spirituality Grass

41
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,387
enhancing mental focus.

42
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,427
Speaking of determination,

43
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:36,948
there's no one in Jiuyi Mountain

44
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:37,948
as strong-willed as the Priest.

45
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:41,908
Is there anyone willing
to challenge him?

46
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:42,827
Let me do it.

47
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:43,667
Sure.

48
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:53,987
What is he doing?

49
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,628
Anyone else?

50
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:06,908
Go, Yan.

51
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:09,348
Forget it, I'm not going.

52
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:13,188
Priest.

53
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,107
What a cheap trick.

54
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,867
The Priest won't be swayed so easily.

55
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,587
Students with stronger power

56
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,547
can practice with each other.

57
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:24,387
Let's get started.

58
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,508
Come on, let's give it a try.

59
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:27,427
Sure, let's go.

60
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:28,628
As expected from Qing Gang.

61
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,587
He is strong-willed as well.

62
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:37,587
Qing Gang's bracelet

63
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:38,308
doesn't move a bit either.

64
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:39,028
Yes.

65
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:47,107
General Qing.

66
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,348
It's starting to move, isn't it?

67
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:49,667
Look.

68
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:50,188
It's moving.

69
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:50,867
It's moving.

70
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:51,948
It's moving.

71
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:53,387
It's spinning.

72
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:54,107
Princess Xuelu is amazing.

73
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:56,348
It's starting to spin.

74
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:58,867
I knew it.

75
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,107
General Qing must've liked Xuelu.

76
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,188
General Qing, why are you blushing?

77
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,147
General Qing.

78
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,587
You've got to learn more

79
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:05,387
from the Priest.

80
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,987
Why are you leaving, General Qing?

81
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:07,987
General Qing?

82
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:12,468
Well...

83
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:13,667
I'm impressed.

84
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,107
His brilliant reputation is destroyed
in an instant.

85
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:17,908
Come on, give it a try.

86
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:18,427
Try it.

87
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:19,308
It's moving.

88
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,028
It's moving.

89
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:22,108
Come.

90
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,188
I'm impressed.

91
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:23,827
It moves. Stay still.

92
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:24,668
Give it a try.

93
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:25,748
It's moving.

94
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:26,347
Look at mine.

95
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:27,227
See.

96
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:28,868
Priest,

97
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,387
thanks for choosing the bracelet I made

98
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:32,428
despite its shabbiness.

99
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,707
Here comes another one.

100
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,188
Push it in.

101
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:40,227
Get in.

102
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:41,188
Mine is moving as well.

103
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:42,147
Why isn't yours moving?

104
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:45,628
Quick, try it.

105
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,147
Right.

106
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:47,188
Like this.

107
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:47,748
Like this?

108
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,707
(I'll give him a good scare.)

109
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:55,508
Priest,

110
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,748
why are you staring at me like this?

111
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,948
Do you

112
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,027
like me?

113
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,308
(This can't scare you either.)

114
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:38,347
It's thundering.

115
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,068
There's thunder.

116
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:44,628
Why is it thundering all of a sudden?

117
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,668
Guys, there's thunder in the mountain.

118
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,147
I'm afraid there'll be heavy rainfall.

119
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,907
Let's call it a day.

120
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,428
Please go back and study harder.

121
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:53,948
Gathering spirituality

122
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,707
is the foundation
of all magic techniques.

123
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,548
Thank you, Priest.

124
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,628
Come on, let's go.

125
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:02,387
Try it again.

126
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,347
Let's go, Xueying.

127
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,587
Okay, sure.

128
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:08,907
I don't know what she's said

129
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:10,988
that aroused the thunder.

130
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,467
Not to mention she's the cursed lady.

131
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,548
Even if she's not,

132
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,347
she'll also be

133
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,587
an obstacle in his future.

134
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:19,787
Ying. Luckily, I'm a man of foresight.

135
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,188
So I fed you Red Fruit.

136
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:40,907
What's going on?

137
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,068
I learned it from the sutra.

138
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,628
But why can't I calm my mind?

139
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,988
You can't calm down

140
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:47,907
because you got too many

141
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,387
distracting thoughts in your mind.

142
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:51,787
For practitioners,

143
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,068
it's taboo

144
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,707
to have distracting thoughts.

145
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:55,827
Let's work hard together.

146
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:59,387
Priest, why are you here?

147
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:00,907
This is

148
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,227
the place where I meditate.

149
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:08,467
Well,

150
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,628
I'll return this seat to you.

151
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:38,548
This place is spacious.

152
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,108
It won't hurt to accommodate me here.

153
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,027
Maybe this Spirituality Grass Bracelet

154
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,628
will stop moving once I imitate

155
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:47,027
the pose when you cast a spell.

156
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:47,988
Stop being so talkative.

157
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,548
Do you know that the Spirituality Spell

158
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,027
is the most basic magic technique?

159
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,587
The others have already mastered it.

160
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,267
Well, once again, I'm the last

161
00:07:58,387 --> 00:07:59,428
to learn it.

162
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,387
But I'm sure I can master it.

163
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,347
(Don't move, get a grip.)

164
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,627
What's the matter, Priest?

165
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,188
It's distracting me

166
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,028
when you sit next to me.

167
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:54,747
It's odd.

168
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,908
What's wrong with the weather?

169
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:09,788
Since it's raining now,

170
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,268
why don't you learn

171
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,867
to scurry across the rain
with spirituality?

172
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,068
That'd be great.

173
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,987
Scurry across the rain
with spirituality?

174
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:39,668
I once heard

175
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,388
that as long as we're quick enough,

176
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,467
we'll be able to pass

177
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,627
through the gaps between the raindrops

178
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:45,788
without getting soaked.

179
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,188
It's easy.

180
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,788
You can do it too.

181
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,548
Priest, don't mock me.

182
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:52,987
Staying focused is the foundation,

183
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:54,548
I can't even do that.

184
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:55,507
How could I pass through

185
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,467
the gaps between the raindrops?

186
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:07,268
You stay focused

187
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:08,707
and let your consciousness

188
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,148
follow this grass bracelet

189
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,388
to walk between the raindrops.

190
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,507
Remember this,
even if the sky collapses,

191
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,467
just ignore it.

192
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:16,788
This grass bracelet is

193
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:18,908
the only thing on your mind.

194
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:39,948
(Even if the sky collapses,)

195
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,028
(just ignore it.)

196
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:42,107
(This grass bracelet is)

197
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:43,867
(the only thing on your mind.)

198
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,188
I actually made it.

199
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:06,948
You're the last to learn it.

200
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:08,627
But still, congratulations.

201
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:10,827
Thank you, Priest.

202
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:36,587
Priest,

203
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:40,188
is it you?

204
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:46,268
I caught you.

205
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:47,948
(Let go of me.)

206
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:50,987
You're so cute.

207
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:51,548
(What are you doing?)

208
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,028
Let me tickle you.

209
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:55,908
(Don't be rude.)

210
00:11:57,747 --> 00:11:58,268
(Don't touch me.)

211
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,747
(Zhu Yan, let go, let me go.)

212
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,587
Don't go, Priest.

213
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,788
Stop there.

214
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,788
I'm coming for you.

215
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,028
Where are you going?

216
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:43,467
What is this?

217
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,068
You... Don't come near me.

218
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,347
I'm allergic to your fur.

219
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,587
How dare you eat my walnut?

220
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:13,587
I...

221
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:24,908
I...

222
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:26,227
I...

223
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:30,788
It's you.

224
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,107
(Is the curse of the Red Fruit)

225
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:33,987
(taking effect?)

226
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:39,548
Why aren't you surprised

227
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,148
to see me turning into an animal?

228
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,308
As if

229
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,788
you expected it.

230
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,148
Who said I'm not surprised?

231
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:46,908
Besides,

232
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:48,987
you're back to your normal self.

233
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:51,707
That's great

234
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:52,548
as long as you're back to yourself.

235
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:53,347
Otherwise,

236
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,268
there will be rashes

237
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,747
all over my body due to allergies.

238
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,467
It'll affect my appearance.

239
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:58,707
Really?

240
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:00,347
Why do I feel like

241
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,068
you don't worry about me?

242
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,388
Who said I'm not worried about you?

243
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:36,347
It's impossible.

244
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,028
What did she do to you?

245
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,987
She? Who is she?

246
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,028
Why do I feel like you know

247
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:41,747
way more than I do?

248
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:43,428
What else have you hidden from me?

249
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:46,548
You'd better tell me everything
before I get mad.

250
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,148
On my count of three.

251
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,028
You're so close

252
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:49,587
to the Crimson Clan's Princess recently.

253
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:50,227
I'm very worried.

254
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,148
So I rummaged through
the Hall of Books.

255
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:52,788
I finally found a panacea.

256
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,028
You turned me into an animal.

257
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,227
Is this a panacea?

258
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,467
The book only stated

259
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,308
that it could restrain the practitioner

260
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,827
from the temptation of females.

261
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,347
I didn't expect it

262
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:03,867
to be a curse like this.

263
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,507
Amazing.

264
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,428
You can't have intimate contact
with females

265
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,107
when you turn into an animal.

266
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:12,268
I got it.

267
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,268
You'll be back

268
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:13,948
to your normal self

269
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,188
after 15 minutes.

270
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:15,987
Look.

271
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:17,188
You look completely fine.

272
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:18,668
It's innocuous.

273
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,347
Innocuous?

274
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:21,867
Why don't you try it?

275
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:23,908
It's not necessary. I'll do it myself.

276
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,268
Look, a person with a pretty face

277
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,347
will still look beautiful

278
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,347
even in animal form.

279
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:38,908
Don't worry.

280
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,308
You looked cute when you were

281
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,467
in an animal form.

282
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:44,948
That's not my question. I...

283
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:47,308
I want to know how to lift the curse.

284
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:51,028
Well, will you believe me
if I tell you that?

285
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:52,627
It's said to be

286
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:55,268
unclear.

287
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:58,148
If it doesn't work,

288
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,028
I'll return to my original form

289
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:00,467
to accompany you
when you turn into an animal.

290
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:01,068
Besides,

291
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:02,747
what's wrong with being an animal?

292
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,148
I've been a bird for ten thousand years.

293
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:05,467
And I'm still well and alive.

294
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,107
Or

295
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,028
have you been

296
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,188
looking down upon me?

297
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,467
You... You...

298
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,347
Lords, sorry to interrupt you.

299
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:23,827
Frankly speaking,

300
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,388
she's responsible for this.

301
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:26,827
Priest,

302
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,428
I've brought you something good.

303
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,148
Here it is.

304
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:31,948
I brought this over

305
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:32,948
from Extreme Wind City.

306
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,747
It's a hearty meal I prepared for you.

307
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,268
No wonder you always

308
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,948
look like you've been through
a lot of hardships.

309
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,747
It's because you haven't found

310
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,308
the food that's suitable for yourself.

311
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,227
Take your stuff and leave.

312
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,308
And do not tell anyone
about what you saw

313
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,388
and heard today.

314
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,188
But there's a lot of homework
I come to you

315
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:57,747
for advice about.

316
00:16:59,107 --> 00:16:59,548
For example...

317
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,028
It's delicious, take a bite.

318
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:07,827
This is silly.
If you have nothing to ask,

319
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:09,107
please leave now.

320
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,227
I do have questions.

321
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,388
Actually, what I'd like to ask is that

322
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:17,668
it must be common for the spirits
to turn into human form

323
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,267
in a wonderful place
like Jiuyi Mountain, right?

324
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:23,227
For example, he

325
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,227
needs thousands of years
of cultivation base

326
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:27,668
to form a pretty look

327
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,507
like this, right?

328
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,507
Of course.

329
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,267
My human form is

330
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,267
the most gorgeous one

331
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,507
among all the divine beasts.

332
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:36,267
Don't you think?

333
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:37,267
You're right.

334
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,987
What about the white beast of Priest?

335
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:42,547
How many delicacies does it need

336
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:43,467
to turn into a human form?

337
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,868
I guess you'll need the amount

338
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,227
as high as Qianyue Peak, right?

339
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:51,987
Yes, that's right.

340
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,628
My original form is an animal.

341
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,588
But my favorite food is

342
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,267
not fruits but human souls.

343
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,027
If you don't leave now,

344
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:02,227
you'll be my food.

345
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:06,828
So you were the cutie

346
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,067
I saw today.

347
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,707
Master White,

348
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,507
today is not the first day

349
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:13,307
or the fifteenth day of the lunar month.

350
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,588
Why do you return to your original form?

351
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,507
So from now on,
you're not allowed to touch him.

352
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:19,787
Not even with a finger.

353
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:20,467
Got it?

354
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:21,787
So,

355
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,307
was it because of that hug?

356
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:25,148
What?

357
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,787
You actually let her hug you?

358
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,868
I'll explain to you later.

359
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:33,227
Why aren't you leaving?

360
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,828
But there's one more thing

361
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,188
I'd like to ask you.

362
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:40,188
Shoot it.

363
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,307
I'd like to know

364
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,267
what happened to Master White's tail...

365
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:46,307
Goodbye.

366
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:53,428
That's impressive.

367
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,948
One more time, Priest.

368
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:01,628
Do you really think

369
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,108
that I'm transformed
by the spirit in the mountain?

370
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:07,588
What do you think?

371
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,067
(After all the fuss,)

372
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,467
(you won't feel awkward)

373
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,668
(when you see me afterward.)

374
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,668
See you tomorrow, Master White.

375
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:45,908
(Zhi Yuan,)

376
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:49,668
(I'll wait for you at Cangwu Abyss.)

377
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,227
It's already been two weeks

378
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,348
since you entered Jiuyi Mountain.

379
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,747
Your credit has been recorded
in your grade book.

380
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:00,267
I guess you're well aware

381
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,987
that there will be
a theory exam tomorrow.

382
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,467
I hope that you'll learn new things

383
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,668
from your revision.

384
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:13,348
Bai Xuelu, you got a score of 59.

385
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,747
(Bai Xuelu, score of 59)
You're ranked first.

386
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,987
Qing Gang, you got a score of 58.

387
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:19,307
You're ranked second.

388
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,188
Zhu Yan, you got a score of 20.

389
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,148
You're ranked last.

390
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:29,108
What's going on?

391
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:33,108
Unexpectedly,

392
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,747
General Qing is just one point

393
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,027
behind Princess Xuelu.

394
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:36,787
Well,

395
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,348
this is the end of the class for today.

396
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:40,628
If there's anything
you don't understand,

397
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:42,027
feel free to come and ask me.

398
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:44,747
Priest.

399
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:46,267
Take a look at this.

400
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:46,787
Look at this.

401
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:47,828
About Wind-manipulating Spell,

402
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,267
there's one thing I don't understand.

403
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:49,828
Eat more nuts.

404
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:50,227
Let's go.

405
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:50,948
Let's eat together.

406
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:51,428
Both of us need

407
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:52,428
to boost our brainpower.

408
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:53,388
Thank you, Yan.

409
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:53,987
Look at this.

410
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,027
This is the crucial part of the spell.

411
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,067
They look like

412
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,467
a couple in this picture.

413
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,188
You're right.

414
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:01,868
You must always remember this.

415
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,027
I've told you

416
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,987
that spirituality is
the basis of all magic techniques.

417
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:10,507
Besides the things above,

418
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,428
you must practice harder
when you go back.

419
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:19,668
Priest,

420
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:20,828
do you eat nuts?

421
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:25,348
It's crispy and delicious.

422
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,588
Why would Priest eat

423
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:28,588
this kind of thing?

424
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,948
You never know the happiness
of a fish as you're not it.

425
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:33,588
You're not the Priest,

426
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,027
how would you know

427
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,908
that he doesn't eat nuts?

428
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,908
There are many things you don't know.

429
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:00,388
Since

430
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:02,307
you've been detoxified now,

431
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:03,547
I'm sure you won't stay

432
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:04,467
in the mountain

433
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:05,787
and be the first disciple of the Priest.

434
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:08,507
So it seems

435
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,227
that the Priest's first disciple

436
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,108
can't be anyone else but Bai Xuelu.

437
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:14,948
Actually, it's been tough for her.

438
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:16,307
Tough for her?

439
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,067
I've studied magic techniques for years.

440
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,067
I'm not as good as the Priest,

441
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,227
but I also can tell

442
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:23,628
if one is talented.

443
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:25,628
She's not an innate talent.

444
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,668
She earns this result

445
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:28,428
with her own efforts

446
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:29,787
as she practices hard for it.

447
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,707
She's worked so hard.

448
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:34,067
It really makes...

449
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:36,787
Qing Gang,

450
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:39,348
in this case, you've been impressed

451
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:40,507
by Bai Xuelu, haven't you?

452
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,108
Do you

453
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:47,828
like her?

454
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,267
What are you talking about?

455
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,307
A word of advice.

456
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,987
You can tell if one is a talent.

457
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:56,348
But you're not a good judge
of character.

458
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:57,668
I know Bai Xuelu

459
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,067
very well.

460
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:00,747
She's a pretty lady

461
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,908
who's scheming and honey-lipped.

462
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,707
You have to protect yourself
and stay away from her.

463
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:08,307
Xuelu is just competitive.

464
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,388
She doesn't mean to hurt anyone.

465
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,227
You don't know her.

466
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:13,547
I think

467
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:15,388
you're really in love with her.

468
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,388
You're screwed, Qing Gang.

469
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:28,507
Try this first.

470
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,987
This pastry tastes good.

471
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,547
Actually, she came to me yesterday.

472
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:42,908
General Qing.

473
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:45,108
General Qing.

474
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:47,388
General Qing.

475
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,868
Are you avoiding me?

476
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,828
What I said to you

477
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,188
by Han Lake that day

478
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:05,987
was a joke.

479
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:07,987
Did you take it seriously?

480
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:09,027
A joke?

481
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:12,428
Then, why would Consort Qing

482
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:13,868
send you over?

483
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,747
It was a lie.

484
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:18,948
You lied to me?

485
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,668
I just wanted to figure out

486
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:22,588
your purpose for this trip.

487
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,188
I'd like to know more about you.

488
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:25,108
I meant no harm.

489
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,588
Look, I didn't tell anyone

490
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:28,948
about the Priest's identity.

491
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:29,668
Did I?

492
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:34,868
Why would you want to know me?

493
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,027
Because we're rivals.

494
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,188
Yes.

495
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:48,188
General Qing, you got deceived again.

496
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:51,787
Didn't you

497
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:53,067
already give up

498
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:54,707
on your mission for this trip?

499
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:56,828
As you've got nothing to do
in Jiuyi Mountain,

500
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,547
Azure Clan will surely summon you back
to the army

501
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,628
to make contributions.

502
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,307
You'll eventually leave the mountain.

503
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:02,507
You certainly won't compete with me.

504
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:04,987
To be frank,

505
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:06,348
I admire

506
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,908
your character and ability.

507
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:10,787
I'd like to be friends with you.

508
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,948
Due to my outstanding appearance,

509
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,027
people around me are envious of me.

510
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,067
There are very few people
who are true to me.

511
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,267
And I'm not a legitimate daughter
like Xueying.

512
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:20,707
So I've got to do

513
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:22,588
everything on my own.

514
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,707
That's why I develop
a competitive personality

515
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,307
and defensive character.

516
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,388
I'm afraid if I don't fight for myself,

517
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:29,908
I'll be treated

518
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,027
as a pushover.

519
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:33,588
Over time,

520
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:35,027
I've forgotten what to do

521
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:35,787
to make friends with others.

522
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:37,868
Princess,

523
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:39,987
actually, you don't have

524
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:41,388
to think so badly
of the people around you.

525
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,027
As long as you're true to them,

526
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:46,148
I'm sure you'll be able to make friends.

527
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:49,747
You're right.

528
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,467
My way of making friends

529
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,267
might've scared you.

530
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:55,547
I hereby

531
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:57,267
apologize to you.

532
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:58,348
You don't have to do this.

533
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,267
Thanks for your advice.

534
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:06,868
Please accept this, General Qing.

535
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,227
Don't tell me

536
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,668
this was from her.

537
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,628
She gave it to me.

538
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:23,027
I just want you

539
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:24,388
to feel her kindness.

540
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,668
It really is her kindness.

541
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:41,707
Zhu Yan.

542
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,920
(Qingyun Palace)

543
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:00,668
According to Qing Gang,

544
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:03,547
the Priest of Grand Preceptor
is not Shi Ying.

545
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:04,747
If he was

546
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,428
just someone unrelated,

547
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,027
why would High Priest of Grand Preceptor

548
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,428
work so hard for the sake of this man?

549
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:12,547
Anyway,

550
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,027
we can't let our guard down.

551
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:17,188
In this case,

552
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:18,948
there will be a lot of variables

553
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,467
before Yu ascends the throne.

554
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,747
We still have to continue

555
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:24,668
our alliance with Ice Clan.

556
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:26,948
If things got exposed,

557
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:28,348
Ice Clan

558
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:30,348
would be one of our retreats as well.

559
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:55,628
Wake up, Qing Gang.

560
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:56,668
Qing Gang.

561
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,027
We're going to be late.

562
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,148
The exam is over.

563
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:14,547
We've finished the exam.

564
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:15,148
We've finished the exam.

565
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:19,428
Xuelu,

566
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:20,507
the top student in this exam

567
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:21,507
has got to be you.

568
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:30,747
The exam is over.

569
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,067
General Qing is the one

570
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,668
who I want to deal with this time.

571
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:38,428
You're really unlucky.

572
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,668
I already said
that I'll leave the mountain.

573
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:43,668
Why must you do this?

574
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:45,707
One's mind is unpredictable.

575
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:46,747
How would I know

576
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:48,668
if you'd change your mind?

577
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,787
I dare not guess what's on your mind.

578
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:53,188
I only want to take the position
of the first disciple

579
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:54,507
fair and square.

580
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:55,868
You called drugging someone

581
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,108
a fair approach?

582
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:57,628
Drugging someone?

583
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:58,428
I achieved my goal

584
00:28:58,628 --> 00:28:59,467
with my own method.

585
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:00,987
It's fair and square.

586
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:02,148
So everything you said yesterday

587
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:04,628
was to gain my trust?

588
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:06,467
That's right.

589
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,188
Your magic technique is

590
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,747
way stronger than mine.

591
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:13,227
But you're indeed bad

592
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:14,707
at dealing with people.

593
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:17,307
We've only met several times.

594
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:18,067
I can't believe you tried

595
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:19,588
to influence me
with self-righteous speech.

596
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,747
It's really hilarious.

597
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:27,987
As you worry a lot about me,

598
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:29,868
is it because you like me?

599
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:37,467
But you

600
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,628
should know your place.

601
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,787
This is outrageous.

602
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:45,747
Are you alright?

603
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:50,948
Greetings to Priest.

604
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,628
You should keep quiet at Cunsi Hall.

605
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:55,027
What are you doing here?

606
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,948
Princess Zhu Yan missed the exam

607
00:29:59,148 --> 00:29:59,707
and she took it out on me.

608
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,428
I wonder what you two did last night.

609
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,067
Both of you actually overslept

610
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:05,987
and missed

611
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,507
today's most important exam.

612
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:09,148
It's really ridiculous.

613
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:11,267
She...

614
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:13,747
Firstly, you were absent from the exam.

615
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:16,188
Secondly, you disregarded the class.

616
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,507
Thirdly, you hurt your classmate.

617
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:19,588
Do you admit your fault?

618
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,547
What wrong have I done?

619
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,388
It was because of her.

620
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,507
Only children will make excuses.

621
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:26,747
A scholar only cares about the outcome.

622
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,467
You've made mistakes.

623
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:29,428
You should take responsibility

624
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,227
for your own behavior.

625
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,507
You don't have to feel upset.

626
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,948
Actually, whether you sit
for this exam or not,

627
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,987
it doesn't make any difference, does it?

628
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:51,987
Because even if you sit for it,

629
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:53,668
you won't be able to be
the first disciple either.

630
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:56,828
You're no match for me.

631
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:58,108
You...

632
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,067
I look down upon you, so what?

633
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:04,668
As Qing Gang has failed,

634
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,588
the position of the first disciple is

635
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:08,428
within my grasp now.

636
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:10,348
And you

637
00:31:11,428 --> 00:31:13,668
are just a worthless person.

638
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:24,787
Yan.

639
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:27,787
It's my fault for dragging you down.

640
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,348
Just ignore what she said.

641
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:33,987
Yan,

642
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:37,307
you knew my sister.

643
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:39,908
Don't mind her.

644
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:40,547
Yes.

645
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:41,547
Tell me.

646
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,307
What are my chances
of getting the position

647
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,908
of the first disciple against Bai Xuelu?

648
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:53,588
You're going to compete
for the position?

649
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,108
Why must we let a scheming person

650
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,507
like her to have her way?

651
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,388
The Priest's first disciple

652
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,668
must not be her.
She doesn't deserve it.

653
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:06,307
I insist on

654
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,307
fighting against her.

655
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,027
What do you think?

656
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:12,067
Yan,

657
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:16,707
I know you're frustrated.

658
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,948
And I know you've worked hard.

659
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,388
But my sister gains

660
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:22,747
the top grade.

661
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:25,348
And you're still ranked last.

662
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,027
Unless you could gain

663
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:29,628
a complete victory over her

664
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:30,948
at the final contest.

665
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,348
Instead of

666
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:36,348
a narrow victory.

667
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,467
You've got to beat her

668
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,188
until she can't fight back.

669
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:41,747
Isn't it like defeating you?

670
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:43,987
It's easy.

671
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:46,108
I'm someone who mastered

672
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:47,908
Million Books Transmission
in six hours.

673
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:54,027
Yan, I believe that you can do it.

674
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:54,707
Okay.

675
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:56,628
So do I.

676
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:58,547
Actually, I know

677
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,227
that you choose me

678
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:03,467
because we're friends.

679
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,467
You support me because

680
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:09,027
you think you've dragged me down.

681
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:11,067
In fact, all of you

682
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:12,388
don't think I can win the contest.

683
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:13,868
But who am I?

684
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:15,628
I am Zhu Yan.

685
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:17,908
I won't give up

686
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:20,547
until the last moment.

687
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:21,828
Well said.

688
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:23,227
Well said.

689
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:24,747
Among the three of us,

690
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:27,067
one

691
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,467
has made a wish
that shouldn't be made.

692
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:36,227
One has loved someone he shouldn't love.

693
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:41,307
One has messed with someone
who's hard to deal with.

694
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,027
All of us have picked

695
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,948
the most difficult paths in the world.

696
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:47,908
We're all idiots.

697
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,868
Here, to idiots.

698
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,588
Here, to idiots.

699
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:52,428
Here, to idiots.

700
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:53,668
Qing Gang.

701
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:54,467
To idiots.

702
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:54,948
Cheers.

703
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:03,507
Good.

704
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,148
One more.

705
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:12,987
Xueying.

706
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,388
All of you are lightweights.

707
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,987
Fine, I'm through with you.

708
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:26,228
I'm going to practice magic techniques.

709
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:30,627
What are you going to do with it?

710
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,948
Of course, it's to defeat Bai Xuelu

711
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:35,987
and become the Priest's first disciple.

712
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:38,908
You want to be my first disciple?

713
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:41,667
Priest?

714
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:45,828
Why are you here?

715
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,268
Priest, you're here.
You must drink as well.

716
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:01,428
Why do you avoid me?

717
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:03,748
It makes me upset.

718
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:05,708
I got it.

719
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:07,708
You think

720
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,107
I can't defeat Bai Xuelu, right?

721
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:11,107
That I can't be your first disciple.

722
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:13,627
About the first disciple,

723
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:15,908
we got to make things clear.

724
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:18,908
Why are you avoiding me?

725
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,187
Do you think you won't have to talk
about it by avoiding me?

726
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,107
You got to get this straight.

727
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,828
I just can't understand

728
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,228
how I'm inferior to Bai Xuelu.

729
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:32,348
I'd like to be

730
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,507
the Priest's first disciple as well.

731
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,187
Just tell me.

732
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:40,027
How am I inferior to her?

733
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,428
You're hugging me.

734
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:48,187
You didn't transform.

735
00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:53,948
Your tail has appeared.

736
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,067
Just drink up, Master White.

737
00:35:59,107 --> 00:35:59,467
You...

738
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,587
What?

739
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,987
Transform, Master White.

740
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:10,948
You can do it.

741
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,467
Transform, come on, do it.

742
00:36:13,948 --> 00:36:14,948
Quickly transform.

743
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,067
Priest, quickly transform.

744
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,348
- Quickly transform.
- Master White.

745
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:21,987
Continue...

746
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,788
with your dance.

747
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:27,147
You...

748
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,467
Why do you collapse again?

749
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:33,828
I'll stop drinking with you.

750
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,507
I'm going to practice magic techniques.

751
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,587
I'm going to Cultivating Hall.

752
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:55,027
What are you looking at?

753
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,547
Keep them company.

754
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,147
I'm going to practice magic techniques.

755
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,920
(Cultivating Hall)

756
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:14,547
Master White!

757
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:19,708
Over here.

758
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:21,748
Master White.

759
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:26,428
Come out.

760
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:34,828
Wake up, Master White.

761
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:43,748
You think

762
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:45,667
I can't find you as you hide here?

763
00:37:57,348 --> 00:37:58,507
Master White.

764
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,587
Master White, come out.

765
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,348
Quick, come out.

766
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:03,987
Come on out.

767
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:04,667
Zhu Yan,

768
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,187
you should go back to your room.

769
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:08,067
Come out.

770
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:11,948
Tell me honestly.

771
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,908
Did you

772
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:16,627
hide my Master White?

773
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,467
Master White,

774
00:38:25,027 --> 00:38:26,027
I know you're here.

775
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,147
Master White.

776
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:33,187
Why are you looking for Master White?

777
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:39,107
Why am I looking for Master White?

778
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:40,107
How would I know

779
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:42,627
why I'm looking for Master White?

780
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:44,708
No.

781
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:46,828
I'm taking Master White

782
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,067
to Extreme Wind City

783
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:50,748
to meet a lot of people

784
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:52,467
and enjoy good food.

785
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,147
I want to take him

786
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:57,987
riding, hiking,

787
00:38:58,187 --> 00:38:59,348
and doing anything fun.

788
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:01,948
I just won't take you.

789
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:07,627
Unless you take me
as your first disciple.

790
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:08,868
Am I right?

791
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,308
No, if I'm your first disciple,

792
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,308
I won't take you home.

793
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,748
Master White.

794
00:39:20,948 --> 00:39:21,987
Do you really want
to be my first disciple?

795
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:24,268
Master White.

796
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,308
Master White.

797
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,667
Master White.

798
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:40,828
Master White.

799
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:42,667
Are you done?

800
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:46,667
It's your fault.

801
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,987
You hide

802
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,828
my Master White.

803
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:56,187
Let go.

804
00:39:58,748 --> 00:39:59,667
What now?

805
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,467
I don't even have the right

806
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,828
to blow my nose now?

807
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:06,667
Stop.

808
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,828
I feel a bit dizzy.

809
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:22,708
Master White,

810
00:40:24,228 --> 00:40:25,308
you're here.

811
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,147
(Zhu Yan.)

812
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:29,587
You're the best.

813
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:30,587
(Don't come near me.)

814
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:31,348
(Stay back.)

815
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,107
(Zhu Yan.)

816
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:35,587
(This is ridiculous.)

817
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:42,228
Just let me sleep with you.

818
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:44,467
(Nonsense, let go of me.)

819
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:45,788
(Stop messing around.)

820
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:48,788
(Let go of me.)

821
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:52,027
(Let go.)

822
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:53,268
Master White,

823
00:40:53,748 --> 00:40:55,107
you're the best.

824
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:56,667
(Let go, let go, Zhu Yan.)

825
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:03,748
High Priest,

826
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,708
I've surpassed Qing Gang

827
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:06,948
and achieved the top spot

828
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:09,027
in today's written exam.

829
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,027
And I'm able to use the Ice Soul

830
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:13,147
you bestowed on me freely.

831
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:15,107
I have total confidence in winning

832
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:16,587
the contest two weeks later.

833
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:18,788
I was right about you.

834
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:22,708
Very well.

835
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:31,667
After you become his first disciple,

836
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,748
you'll live on intimate terms with him.

837
00:41:34,948 --> 00:41:36,348
You're young and pretty,

838
00:41:37,268 --> 00:41:39,147
and you're sensible,

839
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:41,507
all he thinks about is
the practice of magic techniques,

840
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,428
but he's hot-blooded.

841
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:45,507
I hope that

842
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:48,467
you could reignite his passion
for the mortal world.

843
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:53,388
By then, you'll become
the Emperor and Empress of Kongsang.

844
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:57,868
Yes, I'll obey your order.
