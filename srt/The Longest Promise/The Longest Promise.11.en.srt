Don't you

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,840
still owe me a wish?

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,999
Then, I'll wish

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
for this now.

23
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,839
I must find a way

24
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,880
to stop this from happening.

25
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,399
(Zhu Yan, keep yourself together.)

26
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,880
(He is nice to you)

27
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,559
(because you joined the faction.)

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,320
(It doesn't mean anything.)

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:12,639
(That was close.)

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,799
(I almost forgot
about the important thing.)

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,200
Give it to me.

32
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,559
What?

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,559
My hair.

34
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,000
Priest, you have beautiful hair

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,679
but I only took a strand.

36
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,119
When I return to Western Huang,

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,839
I won't be seeing you again.

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,519
I'm keeping this hair

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
to reminisce about

40
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,760
the sunset we saw today

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,799
in the valley.

42
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,920
Priest,

43
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,079
please give me this memory.

44
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,720
Memory?

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,600
Your wish has been granted.

46
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,679
Not erasing your memories

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
is my mercy for you.

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't raise more problems.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,359
Priest.

50
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,280
How can you turn on me like that?

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,319
You are still the same.

52
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,239
I wish you only remember
the magic techniques

53
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,520
and not me

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,359
when you return to Western Huang.

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,199
Hand it over.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,600
The Priest's hair

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,600
is so black and soft.

58
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,480
It's pretty.

59
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Princess Zhu Yan.

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,160
Come in.

61
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:23,759
Did you get it?

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,199
Here you go.

63
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,759
How is it? I do keep my promises.

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,840
Thank you.

65
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:40,920
Wait a second.

66
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,559
Qing Gang wouldn't use poison

67
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,960
even during a life-and-death situation.

68
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,160
Why would he use the Priest's hair

69
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,640
to improve his magic technique?

70
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,799
He's definitely not

71
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,040
a man of evil ways.

72
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,999
No way. I have to go take a look.

73
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,080
(The Priest's hair...)

74
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,359
They have indeed merged.

75
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,600
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

76
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,799
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,199
Qing Gang.

78
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,480
Is this what you call

79
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,400
the enhancement technique?

80
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,640
I don't think it looks like it.

81
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,679
It seems like you are
trying to harm someone.

82
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
And this brush.

83
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,199
What is this?

84
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:10,559
Princess Zhu Yan.

85
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,799
I don't want to hurt you.

86
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
It's all right if my friend hurt me,

87
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm just afraid to be used by a friend.

88
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,679
You either come with me

89
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,720
to speak to the Priest

90
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,239
about this

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,920
or kill me

92
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:25,920
to shut my mouth.

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,040
What? Can't you do it?

94
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,920
Don't blame me then.

95
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:40,686
Is she going to report it?

96
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:44,960
Go.

97
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,759
Priest.

98
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,080
Priest.

99
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,600
Is this important?

100
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,359
(This brush)

101
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,480
(Ying)
is made from your lanugo

102
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,999
on the 100th day after you were born.

103
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,439
The first word you wrote

104
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,679
was your name.

105
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,520
Tell me.

106
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,319
What is your name?

107
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,119
Ying. I'm Shi Ying.

108
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
(Ying)
Yes.

109
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,119
This brush

110
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,080
is the first brush in your lifetime,

111
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,439
you have to keep it well.

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,759
Yes, Mother.

113
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,640
Where did this brush come from?

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Previously, Qing Gang asked me

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
to get your hair.

116
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,199
It felt strange to me

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
so I went to his room

118
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,679
to ask about it.

119
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,600
I saw him

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,559
putting your hair and this brush

121
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,599
together.

122
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:42,640
So,

123
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,479
your words and actions today

124
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,400
were just means

125
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
to get my hair

126
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,199
and not to learn.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,079
Shouldn't you be worried

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,719
about your safety now?

129
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:52,719
You're concerned

130
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,760
about these details instead.

131
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,679
It's because I care about you

132
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,839
and every disciple.

133
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:02,439
This is my first time being a Master.

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
I want to do my best.

135
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,199
Every word I said today

136
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,360
was true.

137
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,280
Your virtuous teachings

138
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,439
are beneficial to me for life.

139
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,520
These days, I've come to realise

140
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,280
the differences

141
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,599
between myself and the other disciples.

142
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,520
A few days ago,

143
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:21,559
I wasn't convinced by

144
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,799
what you said

145
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,959
at the Emperor Valley.

146
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,559
But now, I understand.

147
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,000
My words were harsh a few days ago,

148
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:34,679
but you don't have to belittle yourself.

149
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,599
Learn more in the mountains,

150
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
and when you leave,
continue to train hard.

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,719
You can achieve something great too.

152
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,719
As for this thing, don't overthink.

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,520
It will not harm me.

154
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,640
I remember

155
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,160
that it is in this book.

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,199
Could it be that I have a poor memory

157
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
because I'm old?

158
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,120
Say this chant
and eat the Red Fruit of South Mountain

159
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,199
to constrain the bodies

160
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,040
and be free from women's seduction.

161
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,719
This is good. Now Shi Ying

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,679
won't be involved with the girl.

163
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:50,098
(The way to break the spell is unclear)

164
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,280
You're here, indeed.

165
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,920
How can I keep someone waiting?

166
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,199
It seems Princess Zhu Yan

167
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,559
has told everything she's seen to you.

168
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,520
You already knew

169
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,599
my mission this time.

170
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
I am aware that

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,799
you have better powers

172
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,319
but this is my mission.

173
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
I have no choice but to risk my life.

174
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,839
Bone Eroding Ivy. Not bad.

176
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,520
Why won't you kill me?

177
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,599
What else do you have up your sleeves?

178
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,160
Bring it on.

179
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,599
Oh, you can also use poison.

180
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,880
You can't
complete your mission like this.

181
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,120
I have a mission that I must achieve,

182
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,120
it cannot end this way.

183
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,079
Once the identity of the Priest
is confirmed,

184
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,520
you will use the Azure Clan's
magic techniques

185
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,880
to release

186
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,479
the Magpie Branch seal in your body.

187
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,040
Then, you will become the poisonous

188
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,640
Magpie Branch.

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,000
At that time, you just need to

190
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
have any form of
physical contact with him

191
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,079
and the poison of Magpie Branch

192
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
will transfer to his body.

193
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,280
He will then die from poison.

194
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,799
Once the magpie is released,
it brings forth death.

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,920
If he doesn't die,
your death is guaranteed.

196
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,360
Sorry.

197
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,520
Are you the Magpie Branch?

198
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:46,000
(Once the magpie is released,
it brings forth death.)

199
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,760
(If he doesn't die,
your death is guaranteed.)

200
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,920
Priest. Why?

201
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,120
Did you try to commit suicide

202
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,959
because you think
killing me with poison

203
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,280
makes you feel guilty?

204
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
But the Magpie Branch

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,559
has been transferred to your body.

206
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,640
Of course, I'm aware.

207
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,079
However, the poison in your body

208
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,760
is detoxified.

209
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,240
Priest.

210
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
This poison will work immediately.

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,679
You're saving me with your life.

212
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,439
My life is not worth it.

213
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,040
But you...

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm doing this

215
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,679
because I'm confident.

216
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,120
The Magpie Branch can't harm you?

217
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,719
I can use the spiritual power in my body

218
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
to suppress it at my fingertips for now

219
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,479
and force it out of my body.

220
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,120
Look.

221
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,719
I'm fine now, right?

222
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,679
(This famous)

223
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,160
(Magpie Branch poison)

224
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,719
(can't even harm him.)

225
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,559
Priest.

226
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm here to kill you

227
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,719
but you saved me.

228
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,000
Qing Gang. You're kind.

229
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,520
You and I have a strong affinity.

230
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,520
I only came in the night

231
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,719
to teach my disciple.

232
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,679
Your behaviours were only

233
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,360
showing me that

234
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,679
you're trying your best just now.

235
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,240
So, you don't have to worry.

236
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Winning or losing

237
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,199
is only natural when exchanging blows.

238
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,599
If you sought death once you fail,

239
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,160
that would be a waste

240
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,479
of your body

241
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,640
and the blood of the green bats

242
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,799
that you inherit.

243
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,360
Qing Gang. Do you know how I could

244
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,439
easily see through your sword skills?

245
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,360
It must be your powers

246
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,640
that surpassed mine.

247
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,520
(The swordsmanship of the green bats)

248
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,640
(is the best in the world)

249
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,959
(not because of its aggressive)

250
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,120
(or deadly nature,)

251
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,320
(but its ability to take advantage
of one's weakness,)

252
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,599
(conquering the hard with softness.)

253
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,520
(Befriending all natures
and not overpowering them.)

254
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,000
(Its non-violent nature)

255
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,199
(allows it
to have endless possibilities.)

256
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,319
(Take advantage of one's weakness,
conquering the hard with softness.)

257
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
Qing Gang. I wish you can

258
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,640
appreciate Qing
as a precious surname in the future.

259
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,559
Priest. Your teachings

260
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,240
will be carved into my heart.

261
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,640
I will not disappoint
the blood of the green bats

262
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,640
in the future.

263
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,599
I will also

264
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,959
not reveal

265
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
your identity to anyone.

266
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:51,520
Everything is in the past now.

267
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,719
From now on, I'm only

268
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:55,679
the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of the Jiuyi Mountain.

269
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you for the old gift.

270
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,799
I have nothing else to return
the favour except for this.

271
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,279
This is the Green Bats Sword​.

272
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,999
I hope you wouldn't disappoint it.

273
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:12,999
Thank you, Priest.

274
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:32,479
Didn't you go to look for Qing Gang?

275
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,479
You're poisoned.

276
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,719
Magpie Branch.

277
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,320
What?

278
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,039
Hold me.

279
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,600
You knew he had

280
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,519
Magpie Branch on his body

281
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,560
and you still went to find him?

282
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,320
I can suppress the poison

283
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,759
with my powers

284
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,479
but if the poison in Qing Gang
isn't nullified,

285
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
he will die from the poison.

286
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
You... How long can you hold on?

287
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,439
It's only a few hours, tops.

288
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
His life is not as precious as yours!

289
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,400
Priest! Priest!

290
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,439
Priest.

291
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,600
I thought about the matter.

292
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,080
It's not that simple.

293
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,519
Priest... You...

294
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,320
Did Qing Gang do this?

295
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,439
Qing Gang... Qing Gang accidentally

296
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,479
got himself poisoned.

297
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,959
He is looking for my hair

298
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
to use it

299
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,239
to nullify the poison.
He has no ill intentions.

300
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
You cured him

301
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,999
but got yourself poisoned instead?

302
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,560
He didn't know about it.

303
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,279
Please keep your voice down.

304
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,519
Don't worry about him.

305
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,431
Think of a way to remove the poison

306
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,479
of the Magpie Branch.

307
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,360
Magpie Branch?

308
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,719
What is that?

309
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,479
Let's go to the High Priest.

310
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,959
No way. He doesn't know

311
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,920
how to eliminate this poison.

312
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,360
If he finds out that I am poisoned,

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,320
he'd only blame Qing Gang for it.

314
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,600
This is bad.

315
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,959
You...

316
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,199
This poison can't be contained anymore.

317
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,080
Look. This shape...

318
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,199
Does it look like a flower?

319
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,719
Now is not the time

320
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,080
for flowers.

321
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,479
Magpie Branch.

322
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,320
Magpie Branch is also
known as Butterfly Flower.

323
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,640
I have another way that we can try.

324
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,640
Stop fooling around.

325
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,560
I believe in you.

326
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:14,880
This...

327
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,439
Be careful. Here.

328
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,279
It's here.

329
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:25,999
Are you taking us here

330
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,759
because of what happened the other day?

331
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,560
What happened the other day...

332
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:30,840
No.

333
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,640
Since it's called Butterfly Flower

334
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,160
and the poison looks like a flower,

335
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,679
perhaps only butterflies can help.

336
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,759
This is the only way to lure

337
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,400
the glowing butterflies
in the middle of the night.

338
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,400
This is impossible.

339
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
Chong Ming.
Can you think of any alternatives?

340
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,279
If you can't,

341
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,679
even if I'm being unbelievable,

342
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,800
we have no choice but to try it.

343
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,479
Priest.

344
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,719
Please hold this Seven Star Lamp.

345
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,400
They absorb a human's vitality.

346
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
Please resist it yourself, Priest.

347
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,400
I used to suffer from this in the past.

348
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,560
I wanted to take a chance.

349
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,039
I can't believe I was right.

350
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,560
This poison requires your powers

351
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,279
to suppress it within your fingertips.

352
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,199
You were thinking outside of the box

353
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,400
and thought of the glowing butterflies.

354
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,439
You were lucky to get it right.

355
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,820
(Foolish, reckless, mischievous)

356
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,220
(Stubborn)

357
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,479
Thank you.

358
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,400
You save me and yet you thank me.

359
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,120
In the past, I was insolent.

360
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Coming to Jiuyi Mountain this time

361
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,679
made me realise that
I fall far behind others.

362
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,120
But I never thought that

363
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,999
the Priest with strong powers

364
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,719
would need me too.

365
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,400
Understanding this,

366
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,199
I won't be taken aback

367
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,239
by my incompetence anymore.

368
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,439
Yes.

369
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,719
I'm much weaker than others.

370
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,959
I can never be your first disciple.

371
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:20,400
But I have my strengths too.

372
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,759
In the future,

373
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,759
I will work much harder.

374
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
(This kid is kind,)

375
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,840
(but she's a cursed lady after all.)

376
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,239
(The hair on the brush)

377
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,120
(didn't merge with Priest's hair.)

378
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,560
(The Priest isn't the Crown Prince.)

379
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,640
(Qing Gang is at your disposal.)

380
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,039
(I can leave the mountain
at the end of the month.)

381
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,679
Now,

382
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,679
they will not send anyone

383
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
to disturb the Priest anymore.

384
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,080
Princess Xuelu.

385
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,439
How long have you been here?

386
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,999
Not too long.

387
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,999
What did you see?

388
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,279
It's enough for me
to see everything clearly.

389
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,759
Men and women are
not supposed to be close.

390
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,759
For the sake of your reputation,

391
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,640
please leave this place immediately.

392
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:05,239
This place does not
belong to General Qing.

393
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,800
Why should I leave?

394
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,519
Besides, you are the one

395
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,679
who is naked.

396
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,600
You are the one
who should worry about your reputation.

397
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,920
Please don't play tricks on me.

398
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,120
All right.

399
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,199
Tell me

400
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,360
what was the letter to Azure King about

401
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,719
and I'll leave.

402
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,080
The letter was not written
to the Azure King.

403
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,640
It must be for Consort Qing then.

404
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:46,327
Actually,

405
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,519
Consort Qing entrusted me

406
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,199
to do the same thing.

407
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,400
But,

408
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,239
you're panicking now.

409
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,880
You must be hiding something.

410
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:01,920
Moreover,

411
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,959
that person must
be the former Crown Prince.

412
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
I saw that you used

413
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,560
the most poisonous Magpie Branch
of the Azure Clan against him.

414
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,679
And surely, you did not

415
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
tell the whole truth

416
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,199
because I saw you

417
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,679
being loyal to the Priest.

418
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,800
You just revealed yourself.

419
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,880
I now have something against you.

420
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,800
What are you trying to do?

421
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,320
Don't worry.

422
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,279
I will keep
the Priest's identity a secret.

423
00:27:57,085 --> 00:28:00,285
(Zuowang Palace)

424
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,400
High Priest.

425
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,959
Xuelu has something to report.

426
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,400
High Priest.

427
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,719
Xuelu just saw

428
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
that Qing Gang reported to Consort Qing.

429
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
The Azure Clan's threat
towards the Priest

430
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,479
has been dissolved.

431
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,759
How do you know that the Azure Clan

432
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,320
is threatening the Priest's life?

433
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,360
You don't have to hide it

434
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,080
from me anymore, High Priest.

435
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,840
You admire me

436
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,120
because of

437
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
my surname.

438
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,800
This is important to the Priest,

439
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,640
right?

440
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,640
I was right about you.

441
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,920
You are much stronger

442
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,560
than your cowardly father.

443
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,320
But those who make assumptions about me

444
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,880
are the ones I hate the most.

445
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,999
Do you think you can

446
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,719
behave so proudly and negotiate with me

447
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,239
just because of your surname

448
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,640
and your information?

449
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,880
I dare not.

450
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:15,199
I will follow

451
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,479
Priest's orders for life.

452
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,239
For life?

453
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,279
That's not for you to decide
at the moment.

454
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,880
When you get the seat
as the first disciple,

455
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,320
then you're worthy to discuss the plan.

456
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:28,519
Xuelu has the same intention
as the High Priest.

457
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,400
I must become the first disciple.

458
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,160
This weapon is called Ice Soul.

459
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,640
It is the Dragon's Bone

460
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,881
obtained from the Mirror Lake

461
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:51,920
from a few hundred years ago.

462
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
It complements the spiritual power

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
of the White Clan.

464
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,840
It can also suppress
the Crimson Clan's fire.

465
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,880
When you compete,

466
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,719
it will give you an extra advantage.

467
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,439
I will wait for you.

468
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,640
Thank you, High Priest.

469
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,199
Rise.

470
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:15,679
You mentioned the Magpie Branch poison

471
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,679
was eliminated by Shi Ying

472
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,999
without anyone's help.

473
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,679
Chong Ming was there too.

474
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,360
Even the Magpie Branch poison

475
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,080
can't kill the Priest,

476
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,999
it is surely a blessing moving forward.

477
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,640
It was ready since a long time ago.

478
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,719
Really?

479
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:44,999
Qing Gang.

480
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,400
Did you know how much trouble you caused

481
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,320
to the Priest's life a few days ago?

482
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:55,719
The Priest?

483
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,439
Is the Priest in trouble?

484
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,199
Could it be that the holiday yesterday
was because...

485
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,320
Of course, he's fine.

486
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,920
How did you
get yourself poisoned, you fool?

487
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,519
Did you know

488
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,360
how much effort he spent
to eliminate the poison?

489
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,239
You have to be more careful
in the future.

490
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,679
I'm sorry for causing trouble
to the Priest.

491
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,640
No wonder.

492
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,560
As the Shadow Warrior general,

493
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,679
you insist on coming here

494
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
to grab the seat as the first disciple.

495
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:23,800
You actually wanted him

496
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,560
to cure you.

497
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,800
Is that what the Priest said to you?

498
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,199
Yes.

499
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,999
Also, if you still consider me

500
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:32,719
a friend,

501
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,080
please tell me about your problems

502
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,160
in the future.

503
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,519
Although I'm not

504
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,800
as capable as the Priest,

505
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:39,759
perhaps,

506
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,479
I could be of help.

507
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,199
All right.

508
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:45,999
Thank you.

509
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,519
Princess Zhu Yan.

510
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,120
Have you done yesterday's work?

511
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,759
No.

512
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,479
Have you done the work

513
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,560
that Master assigned? Show me.

514
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,160
According to the ranking,

515
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,600
you should be sitting there.

516
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,199
Yan.

517
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,880
If you like it,

518
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,400
I'll give you one.

519
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,199
I think this is it.

520
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,679
Look.

521
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:13,999
No.

522
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,560
Like that.

523
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,360
Master is here.

524
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,279
All right. Pass it around.

525
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

526
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,160
Everyone.

527
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,999
This is today's topic.

528
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,439
Spirituality Grass.

529
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,160
This Spirituality Grass

530
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,080
is green as jade.

531
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,600
There are thorns on the stem.

532
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,719
Every branch is lush.

533
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,719
Rounded and bluish are deemed the best.

534
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,039
Lord Immortal Officer,

535
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,439
may I ask what is
the Spirituality Grass for?

536
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,719
Do not laugh.

537
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,199
Princess Zhu Yan is asking
because she doesn't know.

538
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,320
It's a good thing.

539
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,320
The most important thing in
practising is

540
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,759
removing all distracting thoughts
and staying focused.

541
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,920
This Spirituality Grass will help you

542
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,360
stay focused.

543
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,560
Once we've woven it together

544
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,479
and infuse spiritual power,

545
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,120
wear it on the wrist during practice.

546
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,959
If there are any distracting thoughts,

547
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
it will make a rustle

548
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,439
on its own.

549
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,160
Thank you, Lord Immortal Officer.

550
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,160
I understand.

551
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,959
Lord Immortal Officer.

552
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,719
Cultivating spirituality is

553
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,719
the basic.

554
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,759
Will the Priest

555
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,279
teach us in person?

556
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,239
The Priest will personally

557
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,479
check your work.

558
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,800
If you have excess energy,

559
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,719
you can weave another grass bracelet.

560
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,640
The Priest will be here later

561
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,640
and pick one

562
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,479
to use for tomorrow's demonstration.

563
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,039
Yan.

564
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,120
Why are you forcing yourself?

565
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,519
Having one is enough.

566
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,640
Why are you making another?

567
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,360
Use mine.

568
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,280
Look at mine.

569
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,840
Greetings, Priest.

570
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:34,959
Priest.

571
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,519
I weaved

572
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,680
this Spirituality Grass Bracelet for you.

573
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,959
What is that?

574
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,720
How dare she bring that up?

575
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,800
What an eyesore.

576
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,119
I said so.

577
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,159
As expected,

578
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,680
it's hideous.

579
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,320
Here.

580
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,760
Clean the wounds on your hands.

581
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,119
He said this medication is the best

582
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,079
for cuts.

583
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,479
When you wake up the next morning,

584
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,280
the wounds will be gone.

585
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,639
It smells so nice.

586
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,119
Who gave you this?

587
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,119
He knew that
I was going up the mountains,

588
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,840
so he found out about

589
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:28,280
the Jiuyi Mountain's lessons.

590
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
He was worried that I would suffer

591
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,400
so he ordered men to send me

592
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,119
things that may be useful

593
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,920
before leaving.

594
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,439
Prince Shi Yu

595
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,039
does care about you.

596
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,559
What else did he give you?

597
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,680
Show me.

598
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,400
That's a lot.

599
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,599
This is Hua Qin House's sweet

600
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,039
from Jialan City.

601
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,599
There are only 10 boxes made in a day.

602
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,720
You'd have to queue in the night.

603
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,119
He was worried that it'd be
too tough to train

604
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,800
so he gave me this for some sweetness.

605
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,320
Prince Shi Yu

606
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,559
is very nice to you

607
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,800
and cares about your safety.

608
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,479
I'm impressed.

609
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,760
He's not the kind of womanizer.

610
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:25,559
Hopefully,

611
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,840
I'll see him
at the mid-autumn festival.

612
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,920
Moreover, hard work like

613
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,400
weaving Grass Bracelet

614
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,599
isn't something you would do

615
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
in the past.

616
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,999
Now, you're making two in a row.

617
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,400
Xueying.

618
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,639
In all that you do,
as long as you've tried your best,

619
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,840
it doesn't matter

620
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,119
even if it fails.

621
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,320
The same goes for your relationship.

622
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,240
I weave the Grass Bracelet the same way.

623
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,320
Even though my Grass Bracelet

624
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,760
is hideous,

625
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:01,959
didn't the Priest

626
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,559
accept it too?

627
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,280
This has the highest score,
and this has the lowest, right?

628
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,039
I agree.

629
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,320
Who made

630
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,920
this hideous one?

631
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,240
It's her again?

632
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:56,519
Why would you choose her Grass Bracelet?

633
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
You've changed.

634
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,959
This Grass Bracelet is a mess.

635
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,119
In the past,

636
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,959
you'd throw it immediately.

637
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,760
It's very ugly.

638
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,559
Let me fix it for her.

639
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,559
Why did you choose it then?

640
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,880
For the sake of rejecting

641
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,439
Zhu Yan's infatuation,

642
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,240
I said many hurtful things to her.

643
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,360
If it was someone else,

644
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,439
they would have given up entirely.

645
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,599
Zhu Yan is the only one
who remained unchanged.

646
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,760
I want to encourage her.

647
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,720
Are you moved

648
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,999
by the Magpie Branch incident?

649
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,320
Don't forget.

650
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,159
She is the person to bring you doom
in your life.

651
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,760
I don't care about that.

652
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,360
What?

653
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,720
You... What did you say?

654
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,119
Let me finish.

655
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
Life and death are up to the heavens.

656
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,720
I never doubt it.

657
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,479
Moreover, Zhu Yan will not stay
in the mountains forever.

658
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,400
She doesn't have the ability.

659
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:49,959
No.

660
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,519
I want to know what you think.

661
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,400
I wouldn't let her stay.

662
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,680
If she knew,

663
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,079
the Crown Prince that
she's been thinking about

664
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,320
is someone...

665
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,519
is me who is disheartened,

666
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,840
she will be shocked.

667
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,119
Even though the High Priest

668
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,880
has let his guard down now,

669
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,680
to prevent old matters

670
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,920
from being brought up...

671
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,519
Chong Ming. You don't have to worry.

672
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,840
You've stated so many reasons

673
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,280
not to keep her in the mountains

674
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,400
but you've been thinking for her
in every matter.

675
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,400
She must have a place

676
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,079
in your heart.

677
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,840
How can I not worry?

678
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,920
Say this chant
and eat the Red Fruit of South Mountain

679
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,039
to constrain the bodies

680
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,559
and be free from women's seduction.

681
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,119
Don't fool around.

682
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,800
This fruit is

683
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,479
what I've prepared

684
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,400
specially for you.

685
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,240
It's delicious.

686
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,240
Try it. Eat it.

687
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,280
Here.

688
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,519
I'm not eating.

689
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,840
It's delicious.

690
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:10,999
I made this, especially for you.

691
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,599
You're not eating it?

692
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,479
It's good.

693
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,800
Taste it. Try it.

694
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
Eat. Eat.

695
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:19,200
Eat. Hurry.

696
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,400
Eat it

697
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,519
and I won't bother you.

698
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,320
Red Fruit of
the Jiuyi Mountain's South Sky.

699
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,479
The one who eats it remains
righteous and blessed.

700
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,240
Keeping the purity of Dao.

701
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:37,639
What are you doing?

702
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,840
I'm saying it's midnight.

703
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,720
Time to rest.

704
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,519
Unlike you,

705
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,800
I do fear

706
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:46,840
the effects of ageing.

707
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:48,047
Farewell.

708
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:13,880
Sister.

709
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:15,720
How is mine?

710
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,599
Look at my bracelet.

711
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,159
Is it pretty?

712
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,159
Who are you calling sister?

713
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:19,999
You're older than I am.

714
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:20,840
Of course, you're my sister.

715
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,360
The Priest is here.

716
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,039
All right. The Priest is here.

717
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,360
All right.

718
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,320
No more talking.

719
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,559
Greetings, Priest.

720
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,920
Whose bracelet is the Priest wearing?

721
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:34,880
Whose is it?

722
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,159
Whose is it? I don't know.

723
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:39,999
Whose is it?

724
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,639
This...

725
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,320
Red light.

726
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,200
It looks like Zhu Yan's.

727
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:50,639
It does.

728
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:51,360
This...

729
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,200
Yan. Look.

730
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,519
Priest is using your Grass Bracelet

731
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,360
for demonstration.

732
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
