Priest woke up before the first light

35
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,464
and he insisted on
going to Jiuyi District.

Priest lit some calming incense

00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,305
He thought

40
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:56,624
you needed more rest.

41
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:02,705
(Jiuyi District?)

42
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:06,145
Back in the Jiuyi District, you were...

43
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:11,624
You're

44
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:12,425
from Jiuyi Mountain.

45
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:13,305
You're Priest...

46
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:14,825
Oh, god.

47
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:15,944
Master

48
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:17,304
must've found something out

49
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,025
and gone there to check my identity.

50
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,304
Don't worry.

51
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,664
Lord Chong Ming is with him.

52
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:22,745
It shouldn't be a problem.

53
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:25,344
Princess.

54
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,304
It's raining heavily outside.

55
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:27,424
Bring an umbrella.

56
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,385
I've searched all over Jiuyi District.

57
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,265
Where did Master and Chong Ming go?

58
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:53,864
Your Highness.

59
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:54,984
Chong Ming.

60
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:02,625
You...

61
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:07,265
Your Highness.

62
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:12,945
You're drenched.

63
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:13,945
It's my fault.

64
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:14,984
I didn't tell you earlier.

65
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,224
He wants to find herbs for allergy.

66
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:22,145
So, I took him here.

67
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,585
I really want to know

68
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,304
what happened between us.

69
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:30,864
And I become more eager

70
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,344
when I spend more time with you.

71
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,185
But

72
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,864
I only want to hear our story

73
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,585
directly from you

74
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:40,984
or

75
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:42,304
I try to recall them myself.

76
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,224
I don't want to hear it
from anyone else.

77
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:48,344
So,

78
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,544
don't worry.

79
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,664
Thank you.

80
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,344
Let's have some brew tonight.

81
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:06,265
Because of this umbrella?

82
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:07,864
No,

83
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,185
because of this.

84
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:17,224
(Luckily, today is the last day.)

85
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:19,664
(You may drink as much as you want.)

86
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:51,025
(Zhu Yan.)

87
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:52,464
(On the last day,)

88
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:54,344
(you must take Shi Ying)

89
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,945
(to the Starry Lake,)

90
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,385
(the place where you performed
Star Revival Blood Oath.)

91
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,825
(When his soul is secured,)

92
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:04,784
(seven stars will rise upon
the Starry Lake,)

93
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:08,585
(and he will be granted
a complete rebirth.)

94
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:24,424
Why sigh?

95
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:30,025
I've come across a poem

96
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:31,904
in the Elseword Legend.

97
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,705
"Sunset is magnificent,

98
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,745
sadly, it's transient."

99
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,344
It's a good poem

100
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,945
but somehow melancholy.

101
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,705
To me,

102
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:51,904
I think it should be,

103
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,304
"The magnificent sunset

104
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:56,825
is an eternal sight for us."

105
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:09,904
What I'm saying is

106
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,025
even though I've forgotten

107
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,544
what happened to us before,

108
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:15,544
however, a thought

109
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,185
has become clearer in my mind.

110
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,104
I want to tell you,

111
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,904
no matter what happened in the past

112
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,145
and how many times we need to reunite,

113
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:31,224
I just want to be with you

114
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:31,825
and...

115
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:43,625
(His soul fire)

116
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,105
(has completely tempered)

117
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:46,904
(and won't teeter again.)

118
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:53,304
(Please let me do as I wish,
one last time.)

119
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,025
I want to dance for you.

120
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,745
You performed this dance for me before,

121
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:15,784
right?

122
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,465
That scene

123
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,105
seems to

124
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,465
have imprinted in my mind.

125
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:10,944
We were in love, right?

126
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,584
I was going to ask you

127
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,865
if we can lead a life like this forever,

128
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:29,944
can't we?

129
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,265
We

130
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:39,544
live forever?

131
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:41,584
Can we?

132
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,345

00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,105
And there are many more out there.

189
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:56,824
Due to your inaction,

190
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:58,465
the entire Kongsang
is plagued with chaos.

191
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,225
And the only Empress
who was loyal to you

192
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,345
was killed by you.

193
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,025
The only Crown Princess
who was loyal to you

194
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,584
was driven away by you, either.

195
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:06,824
Why did you

196
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:10,505
extend my life?

197
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,064
I know it.

198
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:17,544
You want me

199
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:21,104
to avenge Bai Yan.

200
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:22,185
Shut it.

201
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,544
I don't want to hear her name

202
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:26,864
from your mouth.

203
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:29,425
I extended your life

204
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:30,905
because I want you

205
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,104
to give both Bai Yan

206
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,665
and Ying

207
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,705
the belated justice.

208
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:53,985
I can't see anything.

209
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:57,144
(You might end up)

210
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:00,425
(losing your hearing and sight.)

211
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:00,864
No.

212
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:03,624
I can't let him find me
and see me like this.

213
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,505
Your Majesty.

214
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:43,265
You wretched woman.

215
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:45,665
Wretched woman!

216
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,584
How dare you poison me!

217
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,425
I didn't do that.

218
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:53,824
Not me, Your Majesty.

219
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:55,344
High Priest

220
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,185
hasn't returned here for decades.

221
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,624
And now he shows up

222
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:00,745
right away you fall sick.

223
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,304
Because he wants to frame me.

224
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,425
He aims

225
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:07,225
to slander Yu

226
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:09,304
and pave the way for Shi Ying

227
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,784
to ascend to the throne.

228
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:13,344
I never want Ying

229
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:15,985
to return to the mortal world.

230
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,225
What?

231
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,104
It's all your fault.

232
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,784
You poisoned me.

233
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:29,064
I

234
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,584
must kill you now.

235
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:33,544
I

236
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:36,985
want to kill you!

237
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:40,025
Your Majesty.

238
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:41,705
You can kill me.

239
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:45,905
But I have one condition.

240
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:47,824
Please

241
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:52,185
let me take the fall all alone.

242
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:54,505
I wish

243
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,425
you won't blame the Crown Prince.

244
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:12,705
I've never expected

245
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:14,225
it was this woman

246
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,705
who has been meddling

247
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:20,505
behind my back all these years.

248
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:23,104
I'm

249
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:25,745
so blind.

250
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,185
She deceived you?

251
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,544
You're well aware of
suspicions that existed.

252
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,824
But for the sake of your loved one,

253
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,225
you have let Bai Yan and Ying

254
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,144
suffered mistreatment
they never deserved.

255
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,425
Now that the truth has come to light.

256
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:48,705
I deeply regretted

257
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,784
the harm done to Bai Yan.

258
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,304
What are you waiting for?

259
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:54,945
Issue a decree right now

260
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:56,544
to clear their names.

261
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:57,745
Yes, I will.

262
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:00,304
I promise you.

263
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:01,864
I will

264
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,824
restore the position of the Crown Prince
to Shi Ying now.

265
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,705
But do you truly

266
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:09,465
want him

267
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:12,544
to continue to pursue cultivation?

268
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:13,905
Do you want him

269
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,905
to return to this dirty palace

270
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,384
and acknowledge you,

271
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,185
the ludicrous father,

272
00:22:21,185 --> 00:22:22,544
who caused his mother's death?

273
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:28,225
I only wish Ying to stay away

274
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:30,144
from illness and calamity

275
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:31,945
and live a long life.

276
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:34,905
Please.

277
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,465
You're my brother.

278
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:39,225
I beg of you.

279
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:41,584
Can you...

280
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,544
Can I let Ying come back

281
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:45,344
and acknowledge you as his father?

282
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:46,824
Absolutely not.

283
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,665
Someone.

284
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:56,624
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:58,384
Convey my decree.

286
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:01,185
Azure King is stripped of his title

287
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:02,905
and demoted to a commoner.

288
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:04,384
Confer Bai Yan

289
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,225
the posthumous title of Empress Renjia

290
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:12,025
and relocate her casket
to the Emperor Valley.

291
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:15,584
The former Crown Prince, Shi Ying,

292
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:17,824
suffered an undeserved punishment.

293
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:19,665
Restore his position

294
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:23,864
of the Prince with immediate effect.

295
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:25,784
Yes, Your Majesty.

296
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,505
She has been unconscious
since three days ago.

297
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:01,465
What has happened to her?

298
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:02,864
Xuelu.

299
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:04,544
Have you figured anything out yet?

300
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,425
I've tried all healing methods,

301
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,185
but it didn't help.

302
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,425
I guess

303
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:17,665
her sickness wasn't caused
by an external force.

304
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,344
There can only be one possibility.

305
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:21,584
What's it?

306
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:23,745
Zhu Yan's sickness

307
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:25,624
is beyond cure

308
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,384
because it's not a mortal sickness.

309
00:24:29,304 --> 00:24:29,864
Do you still remember

310
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:30,985
the strange symptoms in her

311
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,144
when we came across her?

312
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,025
Zhu Yan!

313
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:38,225
Zhu Yan!

314
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:44,745
Zhu Yan.

315
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:46,144
What has happened to you?

316
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:49,505
Don't send me back to Jiuyi Mountain.

317
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:49,945
Zhu Yan.

318
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:53,905
Zhu Yan.

319
00:24:58,544 --> 00:24:59,144
That night,

320
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,784
she couldn't hear or see,

321
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:03,945
nor could she recognize us.

322
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:05,505
You're right.

323
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,144
I've come across something

324
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:08,025
in an ancient record.

325
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:09,465
If a living person

326
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:11,265
breaks into the boundary of Yin and Yang

327
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,705
and violates certain taboos,

328
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,304
they will lose five senses,

329
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,745
and their symptoms are
very similar to those of Zhu Yan.

330
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:20,025
If your guess is correct,

331
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,544
medical skills can't save her

332
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:24,025
but magic techniques.

333
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:27,225
But she doesn't want us

334
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,344
to send her to Jiuyi Mountain.

335
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,025
Probably something's wrong

336
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,584
between Priest and her.

337
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:39,064
However, she's too vulnerable

338
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,104
for a rough trip now.

339
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:44,784
Is there any solution

340
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,384
stated in the ancient record?

341
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,824
The five senses of a person correspond
to the principle of the five elements.

342
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:51,465
Eyes relate to Wood,

343
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:53,104
which is the expertise
of the Azure Clan.

344
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,745
While ears relate to Water,

345
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:56,665
the White Clan is near Mirror Lake

346
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:58,705
and is proficient in
water magic techniques.

347
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,905
We might be able to save Zhu Yan

348
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,225
by securing her sight and hearing

349
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:03,864
if we join hands.

350
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:05,185
Let's act now.

351
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:07,185
If we borrow something from nature,
we must return it.

352
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:08,505
To perform this magic technique,

353
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:09,824
we need to borrow forces

354
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:11,304
from the artifacts
that contain spiritual power

355
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,104
of Wood and Water.

356
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:17,465
Fortunately, Bai Fenglin

357
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,265
handed the Moon Blade to me.

358
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:21,665
Qing Gang.

359
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:24,185
Take your sword out now.

360
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,025
This sword is given by the Priest,

361
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,584
it's not the artifact of the Azure Clan.

362
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,465
I came from the side branch of the clan,

363
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,544
with few members of a neglected family.

364
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:35,025
As long as I can remember,

365
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:36,985
I've never obtained any artifacts
from the clan.

366
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:41,064
I'll go and borrow one.

367
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:41,945
Can she still wait?

368
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,265
I can't even take one piece

369
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:52,265
of the ancestral artifacts.

370
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:55,344
Ancestral artifacts?

371
00:26:58,665 --> 00:26:59,144
You can.

372
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,544
But you've already given it to me.

373
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:10,262
Xuelu.

374
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:13,824
I have already had
the most precious treasure

375
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:15,104
of the Azure Clan,

376
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:16,304
I don't need anything else.

377
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:19,705
The weapons of the Azure Clan

378
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,864
are provided by you.

379
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:23,784
Are you from the Ice Clan?

380
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,265
I'm the Chief Sorcerer of the Ice Clan,

381
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,304
Wu Xian.

382
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:30,104
I came here
under the order of my master.

383
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:32,185
I'm the Provincial Military Commander,

384
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:33,705
General of Valiant Cavalry.

385
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:36,185
Aren't you afraid that I'll take you
to the Emperor for punishment?

386
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,185
You can only corporate with my master

387
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,304
to end your trouble once and for all.

388
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,544
You keep mentioning your master.

389
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,465
Who's your master?

390
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:51,505
Where's he now?

391
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:04,104
If you collaborate with me,

392
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:05,945
you will know.

393
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,304
Back then,

394
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:20,985
your assassination of Shi Ying

395
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,624
caused the Ice Clan heavy casualties

396
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:27,144
and Shi Ying remained unscathed.

397
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,784
We didn't kill him

398
00:29:28,985 --> 00:29:30,225
because it wasn't the right time.

399
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:33,344
Had we finished Shi Ying at Nvluo Creek,

400
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:36,505
the Azure Clan would take hold
of the entire world.

401
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,384
They wouldn't have collaborated with us

402
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,265
and let my clan infiltrate Kongsang.

403
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,544
Now that my master

404
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:43,985
has already cleared
all trouble in his way.

405
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:48,344
He will send the Ten Sorcerers
to your aid.

406
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:50,624
Why did your master

407
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:52,985
choose me out of all?

408
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:54,624
What's he after?

409
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:58,584
Take my master
to the White Tower of Jialan.

410
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,384
It should be

411
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,104
an easy feat for you, right?

412
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:10,106
Are you aiming

413
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:11,544
for Heavenly Divine Ring?

414
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,025
It's a sacred relic

415
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:15,824
that contains the primordial force.

416
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,824
Only one who possesses
the Emperor's Blood

417
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:19,465
will be chosen.

418
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:24,344
Why do you Ice Clan need this?

419
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:28,064
My master sincerely admires
the magic techniques of Kongsang

420
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:29,985
and he would like to witness
the sacred relic

421
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:31,745
to satisfy his curiosity.

422
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,905
Where exactly is your master?

423
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:18,705
Congratulations on obtaining
the two divine rings.

424
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,144
Who are you?

425
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,665
We won't go back on our promise.

426
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,784
The identity of my master

427
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:29,384
isn't something
a commoner like you can know.

428
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:42,064
Shi...

429
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:53,025
You...

430
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,624
I was so worried about you.

431
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:00,104
How do you feel now?

432
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:01,864
Chong Ming.

433
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:03,665
Why are you here?

434
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:04,864
Isn't this...

435
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,265
Isn't this the netherworld realm?

436
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:17,104
I'm in Jiuyi Mountain now?

437
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:19,705
It shouldn't be.

438
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:21,225
I'm supposed...

439
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,185
I'm supposed to be dead, right?

440
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:25,104
You're resurrected

441
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,465
because of Star Revival Blood Oath.

442
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:29,505
It's been more than ten days

443
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,505
since the battle
at Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

444
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:35,025
Star Revival Blood Oath?

445
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,225
Star Revival Blood Oath.

446
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:40,784
It's Yan'er.

447
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:43,985
It's her, right?

448
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:45,544
How's she now?

449
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:46,465
Where's she now?

450
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:49,465
She only took three days

451
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:52,265
to divine Star Revival Blood Oath

452
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:56,705
and then she gave you half of her life.

453
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:59,584
Both of you have 27 years left.

454
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:03,705
Then, she left when she saw you safe.

455
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:05,824
She wanted me to tell you

456
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:08,705
to take care of yourself

457
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,505
and don't worry about her.

458
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:22,584
It was the High Priest behind this, right?

459
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,144
He forced her.

460
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,465
She shouldn't have committed to this.

461
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:32,745
I've failed her.

462
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:36,225
I killed her loved one.

463
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:38,384
But I didn't expect to trouble her

464
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,344
even when I'd died.

465
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,985
She could've lived a longer lifespan.

466
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,465
I know you're worried about Zhu Yan.

467
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,265
But you killed Zhi Yuan

468
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,265
for the sake of the nation.

469
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:49,304
Besides,

470
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,945
you died for her.

471
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:53,905
You know her character very well.

472
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,144
If she hadn't saved you,

473
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:57,465
she would've been living
in guilty all her life.

474
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:02,945
Anyway,

475
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:05,144
you died because of her

476
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:06,705
and she saved your life.

477
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,345
Given this,

478
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:11,305
I think

479
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,505
both of you're not
indebted to each other.

480
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:17,465
Not indebted to each other?

481
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:25,624
She doesn't hate me.

482
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,425
But she doesn't forgive me either.

483
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:30,305
Otherwise,

484
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:33,465
why wouldn't she meet me even once?

485
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:39,865
It's fine.

486
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:42,104
I don't know

487
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,584
how to face her too.

488
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:49,184
Shi Ying, where are you going?

489
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:53,825
Shi Ying.

490
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:57,345
Please leave me alone.

491
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:53,865
What are you doing?

492
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,505
A few days ago, Miss Zhu Yan

493
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,184
gave me a piece of snow cake she made.

494
00:35:57,544 --> 00:35:58,184
It was tasty.

495
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:00,219
So, I asked for the recipe from her.

496
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:01,345
However,

497
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,425
I can't handle the cooking time well.

498
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:04,825
Come, help me...

499
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:08,345
Priest.

500
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:09,985
You're awake.

501
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:12,664
You said

502
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,264
that Zhu Yan was here for a few days

503
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:16,825
and she made the snow cake.

504
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,425
Why did she make the snow cake?

505
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:20,785
Um...

506
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:22,945
I'm not sure.

507
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:25,664
Are you going to confess

508
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,064
only when I take you

509
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:28,544
to the High Priest?

510
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:30,584
I'll tell you.

511
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:33,624
In fact, you've already woken up

512
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,425
a few days ago.

513
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,905
But you lost your memory for some reason.

514
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,025
Miss Zhu Yan

515
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:41,144
had been looking after you

516
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,744
for three days and three nights
before she left.

517
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,385
And that's all I know of.

518
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:25,583
Why did you ask me here?

519
00:37:29,985 --> 00:37:31,064
Because I remember everything

520
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,184
when I'm here.

521
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:40,025
At this place,

522
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,104
I spent three days with her

523
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:44,144
as the Crown Prince.

524
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:46,425
And she danced

525
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:49,624
the last dance for me here.

526
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:51,104
Right?

527
00:37:57,264 --> 00:38:00,865
(Starry Lake is
where Yan'er and I first met.)

528
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:03,144
(She would surely choose this place)

529
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:06,584
(if she wanted to make an end with me.)

530
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:12,865
You're remembering?

531
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,544
Why did you keep this from me?

532
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:19,104
I...

533
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:20,505
Why did you lie to me?

534
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,385
Zhu Yan

535
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:26,305
has already learned of the tale of doom.

536
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,385
She chose to leave you

537
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:29,985
because she didn't want
to hurt you anymore.

538
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:32,544
So, she hid for feelings

539
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:34,224
for you

540
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,264
and made a clear break with you.

541
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:36,945
She...

542
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:39,385
Wait.

543
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,345
How do you recall everything?

544
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:43,825
High Priest said

545
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,825
you wouldn't remember anything
in these three days.

546
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,144
Her feelings for me?

547
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:49,264
What feelings?

548
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:52,544
Didn't you remember everything?

549
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:53,825
Tell me.

550
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,264
What are her feelings for me?

551
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:57,624
You tricked me.

552
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,064
I've lost my memories,

553
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,465
but I didn't lose my heart.

554
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:09,345
I knew it.

555
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:12,184
She gave half of her life

556
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,425
to save me.

557
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:16,985
She had been looking after me

558
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:18,144
for three days.

559
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:21,664
She made the snow cake for me.

560
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:23,584
She danced for me.

561
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,264
Though she told me
that she liked Zhi Yuan,

562
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,945
the man she sacrificed for

563
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:35,544
is me.

564
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:39,345
So,

565
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,064
Yan'er loves me, right?

566
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,345
She said that she liked Zhi Yuan

567
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:48,064
because she wanted to save him.

568
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:51,945
Chong Ming.

569
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,825
I've never pleaded with you before.

570
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,144
This is the only time I beg you.

571
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,184
Please tell me the truth.

572
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:10,865
I'm going to look for her.

573
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:11,825
But...

574
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:13,425
Don't stop me, Chong Ming.

575
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:15,825
Since Yan'er was willing

576
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,184
to sacrifice half of her life

577
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,624
for my revival,

578
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:21,744
why can't I muster
the same courage as her

579
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:23,945
to fight for another chance
for our relationship?

580
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:26,305
She didn't hesitate,

581
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,305
and so do I.

582
00:40:30,104 --> 00:40:30,505
Ying.

583
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:33,905
Your Supreme Majesty.

584
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:44,744
Glad to see that you're good.

585
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:47,664
I'm sorry to make you worry.

586
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:50,704
Ying.

587
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,305
It's my fault.

588
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:56,945
I shouldn't have forced you
into experiencing the mortal world.

589
00:40:58,465 --> 00:40:59,385
I've thought it through.

590
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:02,465
From now on, you will stay
in the mountain

591
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:03,985
for cultivation

592
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:05,704
like you used to do.

593
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,945
I'll groom you

594
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:11,785
to be the invincible cultivator
in Jiuyi Mountain.

595
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,664
Zhu Yan is the cursed lady for you.

596
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:27,905
You can't look for her.

597
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:29,624
I won't allow you

598
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:31,985
to risk your life again.

599
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:35,865
I died for Yan'er

600
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,465
and was revived because of her.

601
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:42,865
We can make changes to the doom.

602
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,345
It's under our control.

603
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:46,345
No.

604
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:47,704
I won't allow you to go.

605
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:01,785
Your Supreme Majesty, you raise me

606
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:03,544
and guide me.

607
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:07,465
You've devoted your life for my sake.

608
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:10,345
And you never stop
considering me even now.

609
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,624
I truly appreciate that.

610
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:14,505
However,

611
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:16,184
I, Ying,

612
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:19,025
have died once

613
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,305
and I know what matters to me.

614
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:23,785
I want to stay with her

615
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:24,985
and look after her.

616
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:26,905
I don't wish to waste

617
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:29,064
the second life she gave me,

618
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:31,144
even if it's just for a moment.

619
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:36,985
In my last life,
I've failed my cultivation duty.

620
00:42:38,544 --> 00:42:39,224
And in this life,

621
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:42,104
I don't want to fail my loved one.

622
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:50,345
Your Supreme Majesty, please allow me

623
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,184
to go through Tribulations of Hell

624
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,664
and ditch the priesthood

625
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,264
for reclaiming Yan'er.

626
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:02,785
Get up.

627
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:18,985
In your last life,

628
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,184
I'd always forced you.

629
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:23,985
But in this life,

630
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,865
you should decide your own fate.

631
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:31,425
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.
