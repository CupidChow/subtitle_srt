19
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:08,559
Yan'er.

20
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:16,799
Master.

21
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,399
Are you sure you want to
give up your priesthood?

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,559
Yes.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,399
I've made up my mind.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Won't you regret it?

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,239
Never.

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,839
I got it.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,320
Master,

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
whatever decision you make,

29
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,079
I'll support you.

30
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:39,239
Yan'er,

31
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,200
you got it all?

32
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,440
That's what you were trying to tell me

33
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,600
the day before yesterday, isn't it?

34
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,480
I look forward to this day.

35
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,040
Yan'er,

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,200
since you already know my feelings,

37
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,440
I'll protect you

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,559
for the rest of your life.

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,480
What are you writing?

40
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,359
I'm writing a letter to Zhu Yan,

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,040
telling her where we are

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,959
and to come and visit me
when she has time.

43
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,519
Good.

44
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,399
You shall invite her

45
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,160
to attend our wedding then.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,280
I...

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,679
I'll write that in too.

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,399
Why are you writing bad things about me?

49
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,000
No, I'm not.

50
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,480
Give it back to me.

51
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:09,559
Give it back to me.

52
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,079
Give it back to me.

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,319
Quick.

54
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,199
Watch out.

55
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,280
Come on.

56
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,319
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,879
the camp of marine force
has already been cleared.

58
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,080
Our men will be evacuated by today.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
It's finally done.

60
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,520
Do you miss your mother?

61
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,160
I miss her.

62
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,239
I want to avenge her.

63
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,999
It's not bitter in your heart

64
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,799
when you've got sugar in your mouth.

65
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,759
That's what you told me.

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,040
Sumo,

67
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,640
I'll teach you a magic technique.

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,559
When you Merfolk pass away,

69
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,239
your souls return to Biluo Sea.

70
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,879
We'll send it to your mother,

71
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,720
okay?

72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,239
Thank you.

73
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,319
Sister.

74
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,720
(A lifetime together, never lose,
never forget, never be separated)

75
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,620
(Shi Ying, Zhu Yan)

76
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,319
(Why is the Evil Star lit up again?)

77
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:31,759
Look,

78
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,880
there's an extra star.

79
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,559
I think

80
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,520
I've seen something like this before.

81
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,120
I saw a star

82
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
suddenly light up.

83
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,360
I remember now.

84
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,040
It's in the cave I sent you

85
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,040
and your mother to.

86
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,319
Sumo.

87
00:08:59,439 --> 00:08:59,760
Sumo,

88
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,640
what's wrong with you?

89
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,559
Sumo,

90
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,160
what's wrong with you?

91
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
(Clinic)

92
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:21,880
Sir,

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,959
please check on this kid.

94
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,640
What are you doing here?

95
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
There's a search
for the Merfolk in Ye City.

96
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,240
Get him out of here.

97
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,959
Please check on him.

98
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,280
I'll pay 10,000 golden pearl.

99
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,199
Let me check on him.

100
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,040
(Something's not right.)

101
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,160
(His bloodline has
a special power reserve.)

102
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,679
(This is the power
of the God of Dragon.)

103
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,199
(Is this boy
the Sea Emperor of the Merfolk?)

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
(That's why she's willing)

105
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,719
(to pay 10,000 golden pearl.)

106
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,319
Sir, how is he?

107
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,199
(She's wearing the Dragon Blood Jade.)

108
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,880
(The boy is definitely the Sea Emperor.)

109
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:00,679
So it's a Merfolk

110
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,240
practicing the magic techniques
of the Kongsang people.

111
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
He's really seeking death.

112
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,559
Magic techniques are second to none?

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
(Sumo must have been)

114
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,959
(eager to avenge his mother's death,)

115
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,319
(so he stole my book
of magic techniques.)

116
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,559
Miss,

117
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,880
the one you're wearing

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
should be a sacred relic
of the Merfolk Clan.

119
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,439
You can try to help him with it.

120
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,319
You mean this?

121
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,199
Yes.

122
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,479
Put it on his chest.

123
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:15,920
Sir,

124
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,280
what's going on?

125
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,679
This jade

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,520
contains true dragon's blood,

127
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,839
so it can save the lives of the Merfolk.

128
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,079
How about this, Miss?

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,559
I'll take the boy

130
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,799
to the second floor for
a further treatment.

131
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:28,599
I'll take him there.

132
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,360
It's okay.

133
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,559
I'll do it.

134
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,559
Please wait here.

135
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,079
I don't want anyone to interrupt.

136
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:34,880
Got it?

137
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,319
Thank you, sir.

138
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,839
This is what I should do.

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
What a kind physician.

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,640
Young Lady.

141
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,199
Young Lady, the physician said

142
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,120
no one's allowed in

143
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,439
while he's giving treatment.

144
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes.

145
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm feeling a little uneasy about it.

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,160
Don't worry.

147
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,559
I'm sure I won't make any noise.

148
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,360
I just want to see if he's awake.

149
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,400
Young Lady...

150
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,360
Sumo's gone.

151
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,679
Young Lady.

152
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:47,839
Young Lady.

153
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,880
We must get Sumo back.

154
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,599
Is it true that
this kid is the Sea Emperor?

155
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,520
Yes.

156
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,920
His name is Sumo.

157
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,040
Somehow

158
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,799
he ended up in the hands
of the Crimson Clan's Princess.

159
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,240
I saw him

160
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,000
absorbing the Dragon Blood Jade

161
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,479
worn by the Crimson Clan's Princess.

162
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,439
There's only one drop

163
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,360
of true dragon's blood in the world

164
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,959
and only the Sea Emperor

165
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,799
who returned after
7,000 years can absorb it.

166
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:21,799
Isn't that right?

167
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,679
The dragon's blood identifies him,
and the dragon's mark reveals him.

168
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,920
But if the Sea Emperor

169
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,479
doesn't recognize his identity,

170
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,439
the dragon's mark will fade away.

171
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
I've tried my hardest

172
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,479
to get to you in time

173
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,400
for you to see the dragon's mark.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,640
Don't forget to reward me handsomely.

175
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,880
So you're the Sea Emperor.

176
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:57,679
Sister.

177
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,240
Sister, where are you?

178
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,360
Sister, come and save me now.

179
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,319
Sister?

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,479
It's the Crimson Clan's Princess.

181
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,400
We have completed the deal.

182
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,599
I'll take my leave now.

183
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,640
Goodbye.

184
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,959
How dare a Kongsang man

185
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,280
try to make a deal with us Merfolk.

186
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,360
What is this place?

187
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,240
Let go of me!

188
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,319
Let go of me.

189
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,559
Guard the chamber.

190
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:52,319
I'll change his dreams.

191
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:52,920
Yes.

192
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm going to fabricate the memory
of the Crimson Clan's Princess

193
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,920
abandoning him

194
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,160
to deepen his hatred for Kongsang people

195
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,799
and overwrite his previous memories.

196
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,479
We, the marine force,

197
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,559
don't need a Sea Emperor who's a traitor.

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,079
(Lord Left Envoy's something.)

199
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,400
(How dare he place
the hopes of the Sea Kingdom)

200
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,640
(in the hands of a Kongsang person)

201
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,799
(and trick us into
withdrawing our army.)

202
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
(Perhaps he's still indulging)

203
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,559
(in the illusion of
peaceful coexistence)

204
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,679
(between the two clans.)

205
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,760
We're a few hours away from success.

206
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,360
Elder Jian,

207
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,959
someone delivered this just now.

208
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,320
(Jialan City Map)

209
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,479
Jialan City Map.

210
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:56,839
Where is he?

211
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,439
He's gone.

212
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,240
He also left a message

213
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,880
saying that it would be useful to you

214
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,520
and that you would know who he was.

215
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,920
Could it be

216
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,760
that he's the one who sent

217
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,319
the Extreme Wind City Map then?

218
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Who is he?

219
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,400
How does he know so many

220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,240
Kongsang secrets?

221
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Whoever he is,

222
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,240
we can use this opportunity
to attack Jialan City,

223
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
break the truce

224
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
and blame it on Zhi Yuan,

225
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,839
and then use Shi Ying

226
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,000
to get rid of Zhi Yuan who's a traitor.

227
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,839
Why did the Evil Star
suddenly light up last night

228
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,719
when it was already dim?

229
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,360
It's in the sky,

230
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,760
but it's not something dangerous.

231
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't worry, Your Supreme Majesty.

232
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,679
You solved

233
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,120
this matter,

234
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,760
and earned a great deal of credit.

235
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,999
I am worried

236
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,719
that something unexpected will happen.

237
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,360
Your Supreme Majesty, look.

238
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,160
The Evil Star has turned into

239
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,360
a nebula of great evil in an instant.

240
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,840
What's going on here?

241
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,239
Judging from this,

242
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,519
the Evil Star will replace
the Kongsang Emperor Star

243
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
in 70 years,

244
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,679
and will destroy Kongsang.

245
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,320
Excuse me,

246
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,439
have you seen this boy?

247
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,239
No.

248
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,719
Madam,

249
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,759
excuse me.

250
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,239
Have you seen this boy?

251
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,479
No.

252
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,320
It's murder!

253
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,679
Thank you.

254
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,439
The marine force is here! Run now!

255
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
It's murder!

256
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,320
Run now!

257
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,439
The marine force is here.

258
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,719
The marine force is here.

259
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,600
Run now!

260
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:12,759
Run now!

261
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,479
Who are you?

262
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,640
Why do you hurt people?

263
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,759
Where's the Sea Emperor?

264
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,759
Go. Go.

265
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,199
Go home now.

266
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,160
Why?

267
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,239
Isn't there a truce?

268
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,479
Mother.

269
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,320
(The Merfolk in the Sea Emperor's care)

270
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,560
(are living in my old house.)

271
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,640
(No one can cause them any trouble.)

272
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:09,999
(Don't worry.)

273
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,640
Lord Immortal Official.

274
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,959
Thank you, Lord Immortal Official.

275
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,239
Thank you, Lord Immortal Official.

276
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,840
Please rise.

277
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,239
Go home now.

278
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,080
Ying,

279
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,320
the Evil Star is intensifying.

280
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,120
The marine force is on the rampage.

281
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,679
It seems

282
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,640
the Sea Emperor deceived you.

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,959
Your Supreme Majesty, please
return to the palace immediately

284
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,880
to protect the Emperor.

285
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,199
Chong Ming,

286
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,519
send a letter to Qing Gang

287
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,239
and Bai Fenglin as soon as possible

288
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,239
and tell them to lead their troops
here immediately

289
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,279
to control the situation.

290
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,279
Got it.

291
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,999
The marine force isn't one of us,

292
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,719
and they won't submit to us.

293
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,519
You've already given them a chance.

294
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,759
I

295
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,479
will go to the Sea Emperor now.

296
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,600
Don't hurt my son!

297
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:54,719
No!

298
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,199
Mother!

299
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,959
Son!

300
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,719
You're liars!

301
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:01,640
Mother!

302
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:04,120
You're beasts!

303
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,039
Kill them.

304
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,199
No!

305
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,719
Mother!

306
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,120
Mother!

307
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,400
No!

308
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,800
Stop it!

309
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,999
Why did you kill them?

310
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,519
I'm helping you, Lord Zhi.

311
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,320
The Evil Star has turned vicious.

312
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:36,880
So the Sea Emperor

313
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,279
must do something vicious.

314
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,679
You took Sumo...

315
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,519
That's right.

316
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,360
We've taken back the Sea Emperor

317
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,920
from Kongsang people.

318
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:50,160
These people

319
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,640
and the people in the city,

320
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,600
they're all dead because of you.

321
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,600
You fantasize about peace.

322
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,199
Today, I will use their blood

323
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,320
to break your pact with Shi Ying.

324
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,080
These blind men

325
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,320
have been assimilated
by Kongsang people.

326
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,800
Anyone who offends the Sea Kingdom

327
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,199
shall be punished by death.

328
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,320
Kill them.

329
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:12,600
No, Elder Jian!

330
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,239
Elder Jian!

331
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,560
Elder Jian.

332
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,800
Elder Jian.

333
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,800
Elder Jian.

334
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,080
Elder Jian.

335
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,039
Xi,

336
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,400
Priest of Grand Preceptor is on his way.

337
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,560
Take them away.

338
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,439
I'll hold him off.

339
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,640
Lord Zhi,

340
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,279
you've endured

341
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,880
so much suffering for us

342
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,479
so that we Merfolk can live

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,959
in peace and security as we did.

344
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,400
But they're

345
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,320
so cruel

346
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,880
that they don't care
about our life and death.

347
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,400
The marine force

348
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,840
is rotten to the core.

349
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,679
They deserve to die.

350
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:41,959
Lord Zhi,

351
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,679
just stay out of this mess.

352
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,999
Yeah, stay out of it.

353
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,039
Lord Zhi, stay out of it.

354
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,160
Madam,

355
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,160
I understand what you said.

356
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:53,959
But there are

357
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,679
millions of

358
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,279
innocent people like you
among the Merfolk.

359
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,160
How can I leave you behind?

360
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,039
There are many people

361
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,479
in the marine force

362
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,679
who have gone astray

363
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,920
under Elder Jian's influence.

364
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,519
Now the only way out

365
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,600
is for us to be united

366
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,679
and return to Biluo Sea.

367
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm taking over the marine force

368
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,039
from today.

369
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,519
I'll protect my people.

370
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,719
You will all

371
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,400
follow my orders from now on.

372
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,080
From now on, we'll follow
your orders, Lord Zhi.

373
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,160
Lord Zhi,

374
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,959
Elder Jian is bent on

375
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,239
killing our people.

376
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,840
The marine force

377
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,759
is no match for Kongsang Army.

378
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
It's not going

379
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,640
to be easy for the Merfolk.

380
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:44,920
Sumo and the people

381
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,360
are waiting for you to come back
and straighten things out.

382
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,160
Lord Zhi,

383
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,519
take care!

384
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,719
Lord Zhi, take care.

385
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,479
Get up now.

386
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:57,999
Xi,

387
00:24:59,279 --> 00:24:59,999
I'll leave it all to you.

388
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:03,920
Guys,

389
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,840
lead everyone to retreat with me.

390
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,039
- Yes.
- Yes.

391
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
Lord Zhi, take care.

392
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,840
Take care, Lord Zhi.

393
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:12,920
Lord Zhi, take care.

394
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,400
- Lord Zhi, take care.
- Lord Zhi, take care.

395
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,199
Did you

396
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,640
kill them?

397
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,920
(They did die because of me.)

398
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,519
You're the reason

399
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:40,999
the marine force broke the pact,

400
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,239
and the Evil Star rose.

401
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,360
(I can't let Shi Ying know about)

402
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,239
(Sumo's existence.)

403
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,279
It's me.

404
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:52,959
Alright.

405
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,600
You'll die for your crime.

406
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,120
(Sumo and the people)

407
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,519
(are waiting for you to come back
and straighten things out.)

408
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,360
(Lord Zhi,)

409
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
(take care.)

410
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,800
(No,)

411
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,519
(I can't die yet.)

412
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,120
Quick.

413
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,160
It ate the bait.

414
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,120
It ate the bait.

415
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,880
It's all my fault

416
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,320
for failing to be
a good judge of character.

417
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,239
I will avenge you.

418
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,239
Rest in peace.

419
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,160
Master.

420
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Who did this?

421
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,439
Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan.

422
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:55,519
Yuan?

423
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,400
Yan'er,

424
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,600
he's no longer

425
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,759
the Keeper Yuan you knew.

426
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:02,920
He's now

427
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,160
the Sea Emperor of the Merfolk.

428
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,759
When the interests

429
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,999
of the two clans clashed,

430
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,080
he sided with the marine force.

431
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:11,999
Master,

432
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,600
there must be a misunderstanding.

433
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,600
Yuan may have done this for some reason.

434
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,519
Stop it!

435
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,360
Yan'er,

436
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:19,920
today,

437
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,360
I don't want to hear any more

438
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,679
explanations about him.

439
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm going to kill all Kongsang people!

440
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm going to kill all Kongsang people!

441
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,999
No wonder the Evil Star
has turned vicious.

442
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,120
Dream alteration

443
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,719
can be quite harmful to people.

444
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,800
A slight mistake will
result in death or insanity.

445
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,840
He's just an immature kid.

446
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,080
Kill them all.

447
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,239
I didn't expect Elder Jian

448
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,199
to be so heartless as to do this.

449
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,080
He's caught in a nightmare

450
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,519
that was deliberately created for him.

451
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,840
I wonder when he'll wake up.

452
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,039
If he sees the nightmare as reality,

453
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,479
even if he wakes up,

454
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,400
he'll be filled with hatred
for Kongsang people.

455
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,199
After the Evil Star turns vicious,

456
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,199
Shi Ying will not let
the Sea Emperor go.

457
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,439
Now that the war has resumed,

458
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,199
Kongsang people are in an uproar.

459
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,759
It's not safe
for the Merfolk to walk around,

460
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,439
whether they're in
the marine force or not.

461
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:22,719
Stay here

462
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,160
and look after Sumo for the time being.

463
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,679
Alright, Yuan.

464
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,279
As if facing an abyss.

465
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,959
As if facing an abyss.

466
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Yuan.

467
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:55,679
Yan'er?

468
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,719
Yuan,

469
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,320
I had a hard time

470
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,959
following the paper crane to find you.

471
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,360
I don't believe you're going

472
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,400
to lead the marine force to war,

473
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
let alone kill
my master's former followers.

474
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,039
Elder Jian did all this

475
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,479
and passed the blame on to you,

476
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,560
didn't he?

477
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,080
Yan'er,

478
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,560
it's already happened.

479
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,199
Nothing I say is going to help.

480
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,840
The marine force started the war.

481
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,160
It's me who failed

482
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
to abide by the pact I made
with Priest of Grand Preceptor

483
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,800
and let him down.

484
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,400
I've killed Elder Jian.

485
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,279
I will try to get
the marine force to call a truce.

486
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,320
Yuan,

487
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,320
Elder Jian

488
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,999
had been in charge
for hundreds of years,

489
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,640
and his power is deep-rooted.

490
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,999
Will the marine force obey you?

491
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,840
I'm the Sea Emperor.

492
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,999
They'll obey me sooner or later.

493
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,279
Yan'er,

494
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,039
I'll do my best to make everything right.

495
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,320
You must believe in me.

496
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:49,959
I believe in you.

497
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,920
Right,

498
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,880
I took Sumo

499
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,199
to the physician a few days ago.

500
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,199
He was abducted by a man

501
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,239
named Shen Tu.

502
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,920
I couldn't find him with the paper crane.

503
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,120
(Right,)

504
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,239
(the paper crane can't get into)

505
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,239
(Merfolk's dungeon.)

506
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,679
Besides,

507
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
the Dragon Blood Jade you gave me

508
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,080
was also absorbed by Sumo.

509
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:10,679
(So that's how)

510
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,679
(Yan'er, Sumo)

511
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,800
(and the Dragon Blood Jade are related.)

512
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,560
(I can't let Yan'er know
how miserable Sumo is.)

513
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:19,959
Yuan.

514
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,439
I didn't expect so much to happen

515
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,840
in such a short time.

516
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,840
The situation is critical.

517
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,080
The physician

518
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,600
brought him back because he didn't want

519
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,080
the Merfolk's child to fall into

520
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,560
the hands of Kongsang people.

521
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,360
He meant well.

522
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
Is Sumo awake now?

523
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,479
Where is he?

524
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,199
Why don't you take me to see him?

525
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:43,959
I've

526
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,600
asked someone

527
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,519
to send him back to Biluo Sea.

528
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,519
The Merfolk is more at home
in the sea after all.

529
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,719
Actually,

530
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I'd like to explain

531
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,160
something to Master

532
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
but I can't

533
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,199
see him now.

534
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:07,679
You don't have to explain.

535
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:09,719
You just have to trust

536
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,239
that I'll take care of everything.

537
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,880
What's wrong with you and your master?

538
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:16,999
Nothing.

539
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,120
Yuan.

540
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,239
Ruyi.

541
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,479
This is my younger sister, Ruyi.

542
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,279
This is the Crimson Clan's Princess

543
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,959
I've been telling you about, Zhu Yan.

544
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,160
Ruyi,

545
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,999
it's so good

546
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,239
to see you two reunited.

547
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,160
Princess Zhu Yan,

548
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,800
I've heard a lot about you
from my brother.

549
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,199
Thank you for taking care

550
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,479
of my brother all these years.

551
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,959
Yan'er,

552
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,759
regardless of the reasons behind the war,

553
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
now that the relationship
between the two clans

554
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,679
is so intense,

555
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,959
it would be inappropriate
for you to stay by my side

556
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,959
to avoid being used by someone
who has an evil intention.

557
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,239
That will cause harm
to the Crimson Residence.

558
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,519
And I'll be careful not

559
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,080
to let anyone know

560
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,800
that I used to be the housekeeper
of the Crimson Residence.

561
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,679
Alright.

562
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,959
It's a time of crisis.

563
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,840
Take care of yourselves.

564
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,439
Be careful.

565
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,679
Prince Shi Ying has arrived.

566
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,759
Your Majesty.

567
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,360
Spare the formalities

568
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,560
when you're with me.

569
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:30,600
Your Majesty.

570
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,360
I'm here to ask for forgiveness.

571
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,239
The marine force went back on their word

572
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,439
and resumed the war.

573
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,279
I believed them

574
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,479
and gave them time
to regain their strength.

575
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,039
It's all my fault, Your Majesty.

576
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,039
Things have come to this.

577
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,719
What do you think you can do about it?

578
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
Without the Sea Emperor,
the marine force

579
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,279
is like a scattering of sand.

580
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,959
I will do my best

581
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,080
to capture the Sea Emperor.

582
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,560
No.

583
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,320
I want you

584
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,679
to kill the Sea Emperor,

585
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,039
wipe out the marine force

586
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,880
and end this war

587
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,640
once and for all.

588
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,039
If the Sea Emperor doesn't die,

589
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,039
there will be more marine forces

590
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,720
to attack Kongsang.

591
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,920
As long as the Sea Emperor is alive,

592
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,079
the Merfolk will never give up.

593
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,920
The rise of Evil Star threatens
the peace of Kongsang.

594
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,280
It doesn't matter if the Sea Emperor
is a man or a woman,

595
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:28,959
old or young,

596
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,439
it doesn't matter

597
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,439
what his reasons are,

598
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,680
what matters is that

599
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,280
he must die.

600
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,039
This is the only way to dispel
the doubts of the officials,

601
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,599
relieve the anger of the people,

602
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:46,720
and stop the potential turmoil of the Merfolk.

603
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,999
(His Majesty's words may be biased,)

604
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,280
(but it's the only way to solve
the millennium-long chaos)

605
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,840
(caused by the marine force.)

606
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

607
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,639
I'll kill the Sea Emperor myself

608
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,119
not to get credit but
to atone for my mistake.

609
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,280
We all make mistakes.

610
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,240
If you can make it up in time,

611
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,320
it's not too late.

612
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,400
If I want to make up for it,

613
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,119
I have to admit my mistake
before the public,

614
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,079
not to mention

615
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:18,760
that there are some mistakes

616
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,880
that can't be made up for.

617
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,840
I shall take my leave now.

618
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,800
All these years,

619
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,439
we've been holding back here,

620
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,920
waiting for

621
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,999
the Evil Star to rise,

622
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,880
and the return of the Sea Emperor.

623
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Guys,

624
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
our chance

625
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,159
has finally come.

626
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:57,599
This time,

627
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,559
we'll beat Kongsang!

628
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,159
Beat Kongsang!

629
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
Beat Kongsang!

630
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,079
Beat Kongsang!

631
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,200
What is our goal?

632
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,439
Restore our kingdom!

633
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,760
Restore our kingdom!

634
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,840
Restore our kingdom!

635
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
Restore our kingdom!

636
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,200
Is it the summon of Biluo Sea?

637
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,559
I've been wanting to go back
to Biluo Sea for a long time.

638
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:39,720
Guys,

639
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,439
why should we put up with

640
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,720
the suffering of war?

641
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,320
Do you want to go back to Biluo Sea?

642
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,400
We don't want a war.

643
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,639
What do you want?

644
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,400
We want to restore our kingdom.

645
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,439
We don't want a war.

646
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,159
Shut up!

647
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,079
We don't want a war.

648
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,800
You're lowering
the morale of the troops.

649
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:56,760
Do you want to live?

650
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,519
I'm the Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan.

651
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,519
I never meant to start a fight

652
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,240
with Kongsang people.

653
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,599
I just want my clan

654
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,079
to have enough for a living.

655
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,079
Those who wish to return
to Biluo Sea to live in peace,

656
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,479
I will do everything in my power

657
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,159
to open a way out for all of you.

658
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,800
That's great.

659
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,840
That's great.

660
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,479
That's great.

661
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,479
We can finally go back.

662
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
We Merfolk are born on the sea

663
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,959
and our souls will return to Biluo sea.

664
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,200
We've been wandering
in the world of Kongsang people

665
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,159
for thousands of years.

666
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,999
It's time to return to our own land.

667
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,800
I'd like to return to Biluo Sea.

668
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,840
We'd like to return to Biluo Sea.

669
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:15,190
(Movement Information of Kongsong Army)

670
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,360
It's already 3 pm now.

671
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,119
Those who would like
to return to Biluo Sea,

672
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:23,920
come with me.

673
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,159
- Yes.
- Yes.

674
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:52,880
Search!

675
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,200
Over there. Quick.

676
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,159
Report!

677
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:16,599
General, we just found this.

678
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,079
There's no one here.

679
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,920
(Movement Information of Kongsong Army)

680
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,599
Come here and search.

681
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,479
Let's go over there.

682
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,519
General Qing, what have you found?

683
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,959
There's information about

684
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,840
our day's movements

685
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
in the camp of the marine force.

686
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,280
That's why

687
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,519
the battle with the marine force

688
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,880
dragged on lately.

689
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
It seems there's a spy

690
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,999
among our generals.

691
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,760
This is a very serious matter.

692
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,479
We must find this man.

693
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,599
He must be eliminated.

694
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,519
Why are you still

695
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,039
reading military books at this hour?

696
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,320
You're a woman,

697
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,999
do you wish to
lead the troops in battle?

698
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,760
You wouldn't have come to me

699
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,159
if you didn't have something to ask.

700
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,200
If you have something to say,
just say it.

701
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:33,720
Though our clan is large,

702
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
you and I are the only
two outstanding ones.

703
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,599
Father has passed on to me

704
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,240
the most precious treasure
of the clan, the Moon Blade.

705
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,240
If I can master it,

706
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,599
it means I have
the best magic techniques

707
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,559
of the White Clan.

708
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,999
We're bound together.

709
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,119
Together we glory, together we lose.

710
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,880
If something happens to me,

711
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,766
you won't just sit back
and do nothing, right?

712
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,320
I have left a military letter

713
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,720
in the hands of Qing Gang

714
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,680
and I need you to retrieve it for me.

715
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,400
Since I am a woman

716
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,920
and can't lead troops
on the battlefield,

717
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,119
I will not be involved
in military affairs.

718
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:21,959
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

719
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,519
Please leave now.

720
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,920
That's a coincidence.

721
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,599
I know you miss your mother so much

722
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,680
so I moved her memorial tablet

723
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,200
to a quiet place.

724
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,680
I thought once the war is over,

725
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:35,680
I'll take her memorial tablet

726
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,800
back to the house,

727
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,240
don't you want to?

728
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,240
Don't worry.

729
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,959
If you bring me back what I want,

730
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,479
I will fulfill your filial piety.

731
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,519
What do you want?

732
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,999
It's not something important.

733
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,400
It's just a piece of information

734
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,639
I accidentally left at Xichuan Camp.

735
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,479
Xichuan Camp?

736
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,240
You secretly sent information
to the marine force?

737
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,079
Why?

738
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,959
Because I don't want the war to end.

739
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,599
Only when the war lasts

740
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,599
will I be able to

741
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,760
call the shots with
my lucrative Jade Tears.

742
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,280
Only if the war is tough

743
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,159
will I be able to take the credit

744
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
for this battle.

745
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,680
Are you out of your mind, Bai Fenglin?

746
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,800
You're treating this war
like a child's play

747
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,320
for your own gain.

748
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:26,840
You've committed a heinous crime.

749
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,280
Xuelu.

750
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
You and I are on the same boat.

751
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,519
I am the White King's only son.

752
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,720
If I'm convicted for this,

753
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,599
do you think everyone in our family

754
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,840
can get away with it?

755
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:49,760
Except for your mother's
memorial tablet,

756
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,559
the lives of hundreds of people

757
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
in the residence are at your mercy.

758
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,240
Xuelu.

759
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,800
All I need is for you

760
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:59,920
to retrieve the thin sheet of paper for me.

761
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,999
If I get the letter back,

762
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,200
Qing Gang will find out immediately

763
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,400
that you're the one who did it.

764
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,479
Words alone are no proof.

765
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,200
There's nothing he can do about me

766
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,959
without the evidence.

767
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,079
Xuelu,

768
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:19,999
you're a smart girl.

769
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
You should know
the pros and cons, right?

770
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,439
Just tell me

771
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,959
you'll do it or not.
