19
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,646
Have you met with your parents?

20
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:29,446
Master.

21
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:31,646
You wanted me to go down the mountain

22
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,127
because my parents came to fetch me.

23
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:35,367
And you didn't want me

24
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,166
to be torn between,

25
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:38,926
am I right?

26
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,166
I've left home for two years.

27
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:44,206
And now my parents

28
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:45,646
have personally come to fetch me.

29
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:47,847
If I insist on staying here,

30
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,926
this decision will put you
in a disadvantaged position.

31
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:52,847
I've thought it through.

32
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,166
I don't wish

33
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:54,926
to cause trouble to everyone.

34
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,326
Tomorrow,

35
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,926
I'll go down the mountain
with my parents.

36
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:02,166
Master.

37
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,606
I'm aware

38
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,687
that great trouble broke out

39
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,606
due to your identity being exposed.

40
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,967
This is also the reason

41
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:11,446
why my parents showed up here.

42
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:13,007
However,

43
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,407
please take good care of yourself.

44
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,766
No matter where I am,

45
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:22,766
my heart will always be with you.

46
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:27,726
I know.

47
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:29,687
You may leave now.

48
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,166
Master.

49
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,166
When can I come back?

50
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,967
You're determined to pursue cultivation

51
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,367
and you wouldn't want to return
to the mortal world

52
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,206
for those worldly hassles.

53
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,127
Anyway, I believe this trouble

54
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,606
will be over before long.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,247
I can come back here by then,

56
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:56,367
right?

57
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,967
In fact, there are many other reasons
to come back here.

58
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,127
For example,

59
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,687
I can pretend to be feverish

60
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,807
and you'll tell others

61
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,606
that my sickness requires
long-term consumption

62
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,847
of medical herbs
that grow in Jiuyi Mountain.

63
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:14,127
So, you can summon me back.

64
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:15,926
Or

65
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,727
you can come to Extreme Wind City.

66
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,687
I'll take you to horse riding, sand surfing,
and camel riding.

67
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,846
We can try out
grilled lamb skewers together too.

68
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:26,846
When I miss you,

69
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,047
I'll play the jade flute.

70
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,526
And I'll practice magic techniques

71
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,007
you taught me.

72
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,326
Jade Bone?

73
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,446
It's the ancient artifact passed down

74
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,127
from Empress Bai Wei.

75
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,086
This is your last gift as my disciple.

76
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:14,567
Master.

77
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,167
You must remember

78
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,687
to come to Extreme Wind City and see me.

79
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,406
You must come.

80
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,286
Remember to come and see me.

81
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:45,286
You must come.

82
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:47,406
I'll miss you.

83
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,406
Are you really letting her leave?

84
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,047
How ruthless.

85
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,526
You know what predicament I'm in.

86
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,567
And it'll get worse if I let her stay.

87
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,167
But now you've given her

88
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,127
the Jade Bone,

89
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,487
which's the love token

90
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,927
Emperor Xingzun gave to Bai Wei.

91
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,367
Also, it's the brothel gift entrusted by
the emperors of the Kongsang

92
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,167
to their empresses.

93
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:31,846
Shi Ying.

94
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:33,807
Apparently, you can't let her go.

95
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:34,646
Why did you...

96
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:35,446
Be that as it may,

97
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,687
I'll never give it

98
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:40,966
to any other woman in my life.

99
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:45,487
The hairpin will keep Yan'er company.

100
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,167
High Priest, I appreciate your effort

101
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,446
in taking care of my daughter
over these years.

102
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,326
We shall take our leave.

103
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:06,326
Hold on.

104
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,646
A while ago, Princess Zhu Yan
was injured badly

105
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,646
in the Cangwu Abyss.

106
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:16,966
I'd like to check out on her

107
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,086
if the poison in her has been removed.

108
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,007
The residual poison
has already been cleared.

109
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:37,927
She's out of danger.

110
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,727
Thank you, High Priest.
Till we meet again.

111
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,367
You've been reading
this bamboo slip for so long.

112
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,446
Why don't you change it?

113
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,007
(I want to remind you)

114
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,327
(that both Azure King and Consort Qing
couldn't hurt you.)

115
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,046
(Maybe they will)

116
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:52,607
(lay their fingers on people around you.)

117
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,007
(If you don't plan ahead,)

118
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,286
(Zhu Yan and the Crimson Clan)

119
00:08:57,886 --> 00:08:59,247
(will be dragged into the mire
because of you.)

120
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,840
(Extreme Wind City)

121
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,447
Coming through.

122
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,367
Please pay more attention

123
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,127
to what I told you just now.

124
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,007
I'll leave it all to you.

125
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:34,967
Please rest assured.

126
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:37,247
Yuan.

127
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:44,367
Yuan.

128
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:47,406
I've been looking for you
since I came back

129
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,007
and there's no sign of you.

130
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,207
Turns out you're here.

131
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,367
I thought you've been to somewhere else.

132
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,327
You're a difficult man to see,

133
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:58,847
Keeper Yuan.

134
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:00,727
I thought

135
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,727
that you were avoiding me.

136
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:11,766
Surely, you jest.

137
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:13,447
Previously, I didn't want to disturb

138
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,327
your recuperation.

139
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:21,646
In fact,

140
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,327
I should thank you, Keeper Yuan.

141
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:26,087
Yuan, do you know that?

142
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,087
My master and I

143
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,447
ran into the God of Dragon
in Cangwu Abyss before.

144
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,487
Fortunately, you gave me this jade

145
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,686
and the God of Dragon didn't harm me.

146
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:39,207
Yuan.

147
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,286
Do you know why?

148
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,166
What did the God of Dragon say to you?

149
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:46,087
I'm clueless

150
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,806
about what it said to me.

151
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,926
But he mentioned

152
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,327
that I'm not one he's waiting for.

153
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,406
Besides, the sacred relic
of the Merfolk Clan

154
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,286
is protecting me,
although I come from Kongsang.

155
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,367
Yuan, you're a merfolk.

156
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:04,327
Do you understand

157
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,686
what his words mean?

158
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:07,727
(The God of Dragon
has already woken up from its slumber.)

159
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:09,607
(It seems that the day will arrive soon.)

160
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,007
(As expected, Princess is fated with
Dragon Blood Jade.)

161
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:13,286
(Is the Sea Emperor)

162
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,447
(connected to her in some way too?)

163
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,247
Yuan.

164
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:18,886
Yuan.

165
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,207
To be honest, I have no idea
about the origin of this jade.

166
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:26,487
But since the God of Dragon
didn't harm you,

167
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:27,766
it means this jade is useful.

168
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:29,127
Don't take it off.

169
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:31,087
By the way, Princess,

170
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,727
I haven't congratulated you

171
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:33,926
that your initial wish
has finally come true.

172
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,406
Initial wish?

173
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,967
Do you mean

174
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,967
that Master is the late Crown Prince?

175
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:46,127
Back then, you made a vow
to learn magic techniques

176
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:47,447
because you wanted
to revive the Crown Prince.

177
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,886
And your wish is fulfilled now.

178
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:51,406
Though

179
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,686
there is no technique
to revive a dead person,

180
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,327
however, the Crown Prince
was resurrected.

181
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:57,447
I'm over the moon to know this.

182
00:11:58,247 --> 00:11:59,087
Surprisingly,

183
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,286
the Crown Prince
whom I've admired since young

184
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,607
turns out to be my revered Master.

185
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,566
(I've known her affection
for the Crown Prince)

186
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:07,926
(since she was little.)

187
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:09,447
(Now that the Crown Prince)

188
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,566
(has become her master,)

189
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,886
(it seems that Princess
has become closer with the Priest.)

190
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,166
(But)

191
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:17,526
(who am I to feel sad?)

192
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:19,007
However,

193
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,127
the exposure of his identity

194
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,367
to the public

195
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,487
has caused a lot of trouble.

196
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,367
Master didn't want

197
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:29,487
my parents be too worried about me,

198
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:31,646
so I was sent down the mountain.

199
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,766
Frankly,

200
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:34,967
I wanted to stay in the mountain

201
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,526
to keep him company

202
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,007
and share his worries.

203
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,166
The two accidents that happened to you

204
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,207
really worried the King
and Queen Consort.

205
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,327
Luckily, Priest is highly skilled

206
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,566
and the High Priest will help him

207
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,127
overcome the difficulties.

208
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,487
Princess.

209
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:57,766
Princess.

210
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:13,847
Master?

211
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:22,686
Princess Zhu Yan.

212
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,207
(You're going to meet
with Young Master Mo.)

213
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,806
(He comes from a literate origin.)

214
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,007
(Please make sure
you keep your manners in check.)

215
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:32,967
Please take a seat, Princess.

216
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:44,727
Princess.

217
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,007
Princess.

218
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,087
What would you like to eat today?

219
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,886
I'll order the food I usually eat.

220
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:53,327
One serving of roasted mutton leg.

221
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,926
The fattier, the better.

222
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,607
Five jin of spiced beef.

223
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:58,727
I'll order more later.

224
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:02,046
Oh, I want the strongest liquor too.

225
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:04,847
Sure, right away.

226
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,007
I forgot to ask you.

227
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:10,526
You haven't ordered anything yet.

228
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:11,967
That'd be enough.

229
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:13,127
But I wonder

230
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,286
if you can finish all the food, Princess.

231
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:17,766
That's just the beginning for me.

232
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,447
There are appetizers for me.

233
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,166
You have a great appetite.

234
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:23,886
How impressive.

235
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:25,247
I

236
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:27,406
greatly admire you.

237
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,087
Young Master Mo, why don't you eat?

238
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,646
Are you not satisfied
with the food I ordered?

239
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,046
Well, my future husband

240
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,967
must have the same palate as me.

241
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,166
If we have no common interest

242
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,526
in savoring food,

243
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,087
I'm afraid

244
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,646
it'll be a big problem in the future.

245
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,526
I really like

246
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,087
the food you ordered.

247
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,406
If so, have more.

248
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,286
Please spare me.

249
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,007
Spare you?

250
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:31,727
Come with me.

251
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:32,967
Please let go of me.

252
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:34,847
Where are you going?

253
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,007
Let go!

254
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,207
I'm bringing you home.

255
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:41,367
Come on.

256
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:44,327
Who's that?

257
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:46,967
Who?

258
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,286
Let go of that filthy hand.

259
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,447
Didn't you hear that she said no?

260
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,166
Hey, you better not poke
in your meddling nose.

261
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,087
If you dare to cause trouble

262
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,487
in Extreme Wind City again,

263
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,646
you will end up

264
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,286
like your blade.

265
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:18,727
I'll slash off

266
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,367
the sinful part of yours.

267
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:27,607
What a heroine.

268
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:30,207
You're a heroine.

269
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,646
I... I'll leave now.

270
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,727
Get lost now. Scram.

271
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,046
Get out of here and never come back.

272
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:37,127
Leave now.

273
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:39,367
Young lady.

274
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:41,646
Up.

275
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:44,607
Did you get hurt?

276
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,367
Thank you for saving me.

277
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,166
Take it with you
and start some small businesses.

278
00:16:58,806 --> 00:16:59,607
Thank you.

279
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,566
You should take the high road
and spare him

280
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:05,286
as he didn't get the way he wanted.

281
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,447
You're a lady.

282
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,007
How could you wield the blade

283
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,326
and speak vulgar words in front

284
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:13,766
of the public?

285
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,407
Vulgar words?

286
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:17,806
Just now,

287
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,606
he was harassing a woman

288
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:20,647
under this broad daylight.

289
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,806
What's wrong with me
giving him a warning?

290
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:25,647
If you disapprove of his conduct,

291
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:26,647
you can report it to the official,

292
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,046
men can handle this.

293
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:29,207
You're a woman.

294
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:30,366
You don't have to meddle in this.

295
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:32,126
You're right.

296
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,727
Had a useful man like you

297
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,046
stood up just now,

298
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,647
I wouldn't have to do that.

299
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,126
Am I right, folks?

300
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,126
- Yes.
- Rightfully so.

301
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,007
- True.
- Yes.

302
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:45,887
Enough.

303
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:47,887
I'd had enough of you.

304
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,967
You're so conceited,
lack of table manners,

305
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:51,566
and reckless in your word and deed.

306
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:52,687
You're not virtuous at all.

307
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,167
Women who stomp on men

308
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,487
won't have a bright future.

309
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:56,887
Did you hear what you said?

310
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:00,086
Must women roll with the punches

311
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:01,447
and speak gently?

312
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,326
I, Zhu Yan, have been practicing
magic techniques for years

313
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:06,687
and I've never thought
of stomping on anyone.

314
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:07,887
But

315
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:10,447
I have backbone

316
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,927
and no one can look down upon me

317
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,927
and being fastidious about my behavior.

318
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,007
If this accident were to happen again,

319
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,727
I would still be the first one
to stand up.

320
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:21,566
- Well said.
- Well said.

321
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,286
You don't have to endure me.

322
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,647
Well said.

323
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:25,687
Well done, young lady.

324
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,487
Brave lady. Well done.

325
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:30,927
(Master, I miss you so much.)

326
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,967
(Today,)

327
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:34,927
(I saved a poor girl.)

328
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,687
(But someone accused me of being nosy,)

329
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,887
(saying that women shouldn't
learn magic techniques.)

330
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,366
(I always remember)

331
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,487
(what you said to me back then.)

332
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,126
(Women can protect the nation too.)

333
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:51,887
(If all men)

334
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,487
(were like you,)

335
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:57,126
(there wouldn't be so many injustices.)

336
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,960
(Zhu Yan)

337
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:22,126
Zhu Yan seems to
have some respect for her master.

338
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,007
Look, she remembers

339
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,207
to send me some Crimson Flowers.

340
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,366
Look at this.

341
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,687
I'm going to try out
the recipe she recommended.

342
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:33,247
My face is going
to glow radiantly tomorrow.

343
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:36,447
Hold on.

344
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,526
I don't think this is edible.

345
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,407
Where's my recipe?

346
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:41,927
Is it with you?

347
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,407
Where's the recipe Zhu Yan gave me?

348
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,167
Is it here?

349
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:50,126
Where's it?

350
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,366
(Master.)

351
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:11,407
(As promised,)

352
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,046
(you have to teach me the next move)

353
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,086
if I reach the top of the tree.

354
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,126
Keep your word.

355
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:18,046
We shall see, then.

356
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,487
That's easy. Look at me.

357
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,167
How was my performance?

358
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,366
It's far from the top of the tree, though.

359
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:52,887
That's not a big deal.

360
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,046
If I can't achieve that in one day,
I'll take one month.

361
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:57,766
Failing that,

362
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:58,766
I'll take one year.

363
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,086
If I still fail,

364
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,046
I'll stay by your side for my whole life.

365
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,126
I can acquire everything eventually.

366
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,046
Come on and look.

367
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:22,687
Young master, take a look at this.

368
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:23,887
This is good.

369
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,086
Princess.

370
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:27,566
This is good too.

371
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,086
Take this.

372
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:37,247
Here, look at this.

373
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,286
Please have a look
at the patterned fabric.

374
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,126
Young lady, please take a look
at the patterned fabric.

375
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:41,766
This fabric is great.

376
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:47,007
Winters on Jiuyi Mountain are long.

377
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:49,447
Maybe I can pick one for Master.

378
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:52,126
Princess, you've been out for long

379
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:53,447
and bought so many things

380
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,566
for your master.

381
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,967
Did you come to see me

382
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,566
or to buy presents for your master?

383
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:01,647
I'm sorry to leave you hanging

384
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,247
for so long.

385
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:05,326
But I haven't done buying presents

386
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,247
for my master.

387
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:08,766
Perhaps we should meet up another day.

388
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:10,207
Take this.

389
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:12,647
Young master...

390
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:14,207
Keep the change.

391
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:15,487
Thank you, young master.

392
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,207
You've misunderstood me.

393
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,086
Seeing how respectful
you treat your master,

394
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:19,766
you must value relationships.

395
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,326
It's my honor to be tight with you.

396
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,007
You can buy whatever you want.

397
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,126
I'd like to show some of my respect

398
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:30,887
for your old master too.

399
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,247
He's not old.

400
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:34,927
He looks more handsome than you.

401
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,606
Truth be told, I'm playful-natured

402
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:39,207
and I want to travel around.

403
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:41,086
I have no plans to get married

404
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:42,326
in the next five years.

405
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:45,846
I bid you farewell.

406
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:48,326
It's fine. I can wait for you.

407
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,606
Because you're worth it.

408
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,606
But we only spend one day together.

409
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:56,286
How could you be sure

410
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:57,647
that I'm worth it?

411
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,007
You're famous in Extreme Wind City,

412
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:01,167
Princess Zhu Yan.

413
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:02,846
You're known as Jiang Bead Flying Flame,

414
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,566
the most valuable gem

415
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,086
on this grassland.

416
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:08,727
I beg to differ

417
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,647
in describing a person

418
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,727
as a valuable gem.

419
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,286
Please pardon me.

420
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:15,806
What I mean is

421
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:17,046
that you're the only daughter
of the ruler of Western Huang,

422
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,046
Crimson King.

423
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,887
You, of course, are nobler than the rest.

424
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:21,687
Everyone is born equal.

425
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:23,566
No one is nobler than others.

426
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,286
That's what the scroll says.

427
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,447
There's no way you and I can be compared

428
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,487
to the likes of them.

429
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:31,647
Both of us were born

430
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,967
with a silver spoon.

431
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,366
We're the noblest ones since birth.

432
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,687
Can I catch your attention

433
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,887
if I'm not the daughter
of the Crimson King?

434
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,007
But you're.

435
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:43,526
Once we get married,

436
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:46,086
our birth will be the noblest person

437
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,086
in the entire Western Huang,

438
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,447
regardless of lineage or wealth.

439
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,887
But I don't like you.

440
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,887
I have someone I like.

441
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,887
Everyone knows that you just returned

442
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:58,566
from cultivation in Jiuyi Mountain.

443
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,167
In Jiuyi Mountain,

444
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,286
there are only cultivators
with no worldly desire.

445
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:03,526
How can you meet

446
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:04,887
someone you like there?

447
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:07,286
You...

448
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:12,286
I like him.

449
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:14,687
Princess.

450
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,046
Yuan.

451
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:21,687
Him?

452
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:22,967
It's impossible.

453
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:24,727
He's a lowly merfolk.

454
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:26,366
He's less than worthy of you.

455
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:27,407
You...

456
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:31,407
A merfolk isn't even a human.

457
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:32,366
How could he say that?

458
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:35,447
All he has is his tolerable look.

459
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:38,046
What's wrong with merfolks?

460
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:39,487
Merfolks are human too.

461
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,366
Because of people

462
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,366
with a mindset like yours,

463
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,286
the rift between the two races
never disappears.

464
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:47,606
Listen to this well.

465
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,167
I like Yuan.

466
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:56,126
To me,

467
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,927
he's nobler than people like you
who bully others.

468
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,007
Yuan and I share many in common.

469
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:04,766
You're nothing.

470
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,526
You don't even worth calling his name.

471
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,487
So what if he's a merfolk?

472
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:10,846
In my eyes,

473
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:12,326
Merfolk are nobler

474
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,727
than the arrogant Dark Clan

475
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,007
like you.

476
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,487
How dare you say that!

477
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:18,887
(Princess has actually)

478
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,366
(said the same thing as Yao Yi.)

479
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:26,487
I'm telling you,

480
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:27,887
I...

481
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,007
I tolerate you

482
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:30,846
because of the Crimson King.

483
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,286
You should stop it

484
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:33,806
and apologize to me now.

485
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,366
Then, I'll let this pass.

486
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,487
You should apologize instead.

487
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:40,766
Yuan, tell him

488
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,927
how much you like me.

489
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:43,927
You know it very well.

490
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:45,766
You're the one

491
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,046
I care the most in my life.

492
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:49,727
- Good!
- Good!

493
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,766
- Well done!
- Well done!

494
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:56,447
Off you go.

495
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:58,766
Never show up before me.

496
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:04,126
Princess.

497
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,606
I understand

498
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:07,967
you did that

499
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,526
to drive the young master away.

500
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,207
However, I'm afraid

501
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,167
that it'll blemish your reputation.

502
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:14,526
Whatever, I don't care.

503
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:15,806
Anyway, I'm not getting married

504
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,727
in my whole life.

505
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,046
Well, let's not dwell on this.

506
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:21,407
Take me to eat something delicious.

507
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:22,487
Yanfeng Restaurant is right ahead.

508
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:23,207
Let's go.

509
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:26,487
What good food do we have today?

510
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,526
Yuan, do you know

511
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:32,247
how many blind dates

512
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,766
my parents arranged for me?

513
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,247
Eleven.

514
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,167
I'm worn out already.

515
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:40,887
All gentlemen they introduce to you

516
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:42,766
are from well-off families.

517
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,566
No one will bully you

518
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,086
if you marry into those families.

519
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,286
Needless to say, I know

520
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,086
they're doing this for my own good.

521
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,126
But I need a man
who can get along well with me.

522
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:54,846
That guy just now,

523
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,286
the son of the wealthiest man
in Western Huang,

524
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:58,846
he might seem elegant on the outside,

525
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,247
however, he belittles others

526
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,086
because he thinks he's rich.

527
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,967
He even humiliated you
before the public.

528
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:08,046
To me,

529
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,326
he can't compare to one of your fingers.

530
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,167
Princess, you've been staying with me
since you were little.

531
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:16,887
Naturally, you think
everything is good about me.

532
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:18,687
That's not the reason.

533
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:19,687
Speaking of your appearance,

534
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:21,247
not even one in the Western Huang

535
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,207
looks more gorgeous than you,

536
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,566
let alone in Extreme Wind City.

537
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,167
As for your character,

538
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:29,447
I can't see anyone

539
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,366
who's as gentle and considerate as you.

540
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:32,967
Plus, in terms of knowledge,

541
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,366
you're so well-versed

542
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,407
and there's nothing that can stump you

543
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:37,407
since I was little.

544
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:38,967
Well, Princess.

545
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:41,927
Let's stop talking about it. Eat up.

546
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:44,366
Here.

547
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,647
Yuan, I'm really curious

548
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,566
about what kind of woman
can catch the attention

549
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,647
of a perfect person like you.

550
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,247
Yuan, I know merfolks

551
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:00,806
will only have their gender fix

552
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,407
after they fall in love with someone.

553
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:04,526
How does the lady you like

554
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:06,007
look like?

555
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:08,806
She must be gorgeous, right?

556
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,366
Did you two end up together?

557
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:16,927
Yuan.

558
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:22,647
Yes.

559
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:25,927
She's gorgeous.

560
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:28,167
I love her very much.

561
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:31,247
Merfolk can only love one person

562
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,766
in their lifetime.

563
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:34,806
I only love her.

564
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:37,967
Over hundreds of years,

565
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:40,447
I only love her.

566
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,606
How touching.

567
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,566
How does it feel

568
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:48,526
when you're in love with someone?

569
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,727
How do you know she's the right one?

570
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,526
You feel happy and worried

571
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,447
because of that person.

572
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,207
Everything just becomes interesting

573
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,526
when you're with the person.

574
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,326
Thank you, Priest.

575
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,207
You feel relaxed

576
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:32,086
when you two are together.

577
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,766
Sometimes, without a word being spoken,

578
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,286
both of you can understand each other.

579
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:40,366
(Gong Shang)
So, Master chose this artifact too

580
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,007
back then

581
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,447
and we came up with the same name.

582
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:47,366
You can't leave the person
even for a second

583
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,326
and want to protect the person

584
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,447
from the slightest danger.

585
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:56,366
Master?

586
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,687
(Have I developed feelings for Master?)

587
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:06,647
(That's impossible.)

588
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:08,247
(Zhu Yan.)

589
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,407
(Master is rid of worldly desires.)

590
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,526
(You shouldn't
blaspheme him with your feelings.)

591
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:13,927
(You shouldn't even entertain yourself
with this thought.)

592
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,207
So, is this love?

593
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:21,247
I mean

594
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,606
nothing's special about it, though.

595
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:25,887
In this case,

596
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,606
I like Yuan too.

597
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:29,366
Look.

598
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,487
I never eat vegetables.

599
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:33,326
But I would eat it

600
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:34,727
when you asked me to.

601
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:37,606
Plus, I feel the most relaxed

602
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:40,207
when I'm with you.

603
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,806
Sometimes, you would know things

604
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,326
I don't tell.

605
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:45,806
Besides,

606
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:47,606
I want to protect you too.

607
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:54,606
(You feel happy and worried)

608
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:56,846
(because of that person.)

609
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,366
(Everything just becomes interesting)

610
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:01,766
(when you're with the person.)

611
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:06,566
(You feel relaxed)

612
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,647
(when you two are together.)

613
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:09,927
(Without a word being spoken,)

614
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,766
(both of you can understand each other.)

615
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:15,326
(You can't leave her even for a second.)

616
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:18,967
Yan'er!

617
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,447
(And want to protect her)

618
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,046
(from the slightest danger.)

619
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:24,967

I don't know since when

627
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:58,806
my feelings for Princess

628
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:00,967
is more than just to protect her.

629
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,007
But I'm know

630
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:07,326
she's not you.

631
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:09,487
I shouldn't

632
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:12,326
and I can't allow this to continue.

633
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,727
So, I've decided to leave
the Crimson Residence

634

Hello!

658
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,046
What are you?

659
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,046
What are you?

660
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,327
I'm Zhu Yan!

661
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,206
I'm Zhu Yan!

662
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:00,246
No, it can't be.

663
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:02,206
How come I can hear her voice?

664
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,327
There has never been noise

665
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,487
passed through my spiritual barrier.

666
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:14,807
It's strange.

667
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:17,206
There's no echo

668
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,566

Do you really like Zhu Yan?

676
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:53,606
Jade Bone.

677
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,526
Why are you so sparkling

678
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:57,487
when you're here?

679
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:29,887
What's this place?

680
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:31,726
The ground is as clear as the mirror.

681
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:33,646
This is amazing.

682
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:36,566
I must write to Master

683
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:37,807
to tell him about this.

684
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:52,807
It'd be great

685
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:55,166
if he could come here now.

What's going on now?

700

Indeed,

701
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:22,086
