20
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,828
Master looks down on his past identity.

21
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:06,147
But I keep bothering him.

22
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,827
I'm such a fool.

23
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:12,748
Yan'er.

24
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,188
Master.

25
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:16,987
Master.

26
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:20,588
Master.

27
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,748
So you know my identity now.

28
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,188
I thought the Crown Prince

29
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,827
was no longer in this world.

30
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,707
I only wanted to revive him.

31
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,827
That's why I repeatedly bothering you.

32
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,227
Master,

33
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,748
was I annoying back then?

34
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:46,227
How could I find you annoying?

35
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:02,267
Yan'er,

36
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:05,348
it was an act of kindness

37
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,107
giving the flower to you in Jialan.

38
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:10,628
But when the nation criticized
and insulted him,

39
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,148
you believed in him, cherished him,

40
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:15,827
and went through great suffering

41
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:17,827
to bring him back to life.

42
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,427
You even risked your own life.

43
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,827
And now, you repeatedly

44
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,788
put yourself in danger
and endure torment to protect me.

45
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:30,507
How could I blame you?

46
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,188
I kept my past identity hidden from you

47
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,628
because the past was too unbearable.

48
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:39,387
I didn't want to look back.

49
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,667
Also,

50
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,348
I don't want you to suffer

51
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,827
for my sake anymore.

52
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,068
I was too arrogant.

53
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,267
I thought

54
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:59,468
by severing your fixations,

55
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,267
everything would end.

56
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:03,547
But I didn't expect

57
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,348
it would push you

58
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,068
toward a deeper state of agony.

59
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,068
Yan'er, forgive me.

60
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,468
It's my fault.

61
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,348
No, it's not.

62
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:17,747
It was my fault.

63
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,867
I was obsessed with my own attachment

64
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,307
and never considered your feelings.

65
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:27,508
You never mentioned the past

66
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,187
and not leaving a single trace behind.

67
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:33,028
For a person

68
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,307
to go to such lengths,

69
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,508
they clearly have been deeply hurt.

70
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,187

71
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:43,227
the most powerful techniques
in the world,

72
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,667
they can't heal past wounds.

73
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,788
Master, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:52,987
I...

75
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,348
I don't know how to console you.

76
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:00,468
Yan'er,

77
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:03,307
meeting you in this lifetime

78
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,107
is my greatest consolation.

79
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,067
Is this the technique you used

80
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:16,667
for the sacrificial rites back then?

81
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,867
What do you want to say to him?

82
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,268
He once gave me

83
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,227
a blooming Snowy Rosa that never wilts.

84
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,067
I've always wanted

85
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,708

115
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,467

116
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:02,347

00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:04,947

122
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,547
But I don't like

123
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:52,028
this embroidered handkerchief.

124
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,268

is quite beautiful.

127
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,388
I'll take it and make a cloak out of it.

(It's wonderful)

129
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,707
(that you're still alive.)

130
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:36,988
Could it be

131
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,108

00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:01,067
I acknowledge my mistakes

135
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,388
and willingly accept the punishment
for my impure thoughts.

136
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,228
The Enlightenment and Wisdom Sword

137
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,028
can strip and separate flesh
from the body

138
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,547
to sever worldly attachment.

139
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,228
Begin.

140
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:26,388
Arms!

141
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:28,467

145
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,508

147
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:41,947
Lungs!

148
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:44,028
Liver!

149
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:45,868
The Priest has yet
to recover from his injuries.

150
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:47,667
This kind of torture

151
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:48,868
has already exceeded the limit.

152
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,347
Just let it go.

153
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:52,148
Priest, just forget it.

154
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,827
Priest, go back and rest.

155
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,388
Keep going.

156
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:58,148
Keep going!

157
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,388
Gall!

158
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:32,268
Priest,

159
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,707
you should head back
to Cultivating Hall and rest.

160
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:37,628
No need.

161
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,347
I still need to reflect upon my actions.

162
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,067
Tomorrow at this time,

163
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,908
I'll wait for all of you here.

164
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:32,868
Deliver my order,

165
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:36,187
release the azure birds,

166
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:37,988
and spread the news to the world

167
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:41,427
that the Priest  is Shi Ying,
the Crown Prince.

168
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:45,187
Why are you bringing the plan forward?

169
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,868
Ying failed in his ascension
just to save Zhu Yan.

170
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:50,748
I don't know

171
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,547
when there will be another chance
for him to reach the real state.

172
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,628
Nowadays, the world is full of crises

173
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,187
and the situation is getting more tense.

174
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,347
It's the perfect time for him to emerge.

175
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,868
I can't wait any longer.

176
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,547
But if the Priest leaves the priesthood

177
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:07,788
and returns to the mortal world,

178
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,748
he must go through
the Tribulations of Hell.

179
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:11,827
He hasn't reached the real state.

180
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:13,228
Even if he manages

181
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:14,707
to overcome the ordeal
of the Tribulations of Hell,

182
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:17,467
his own spiritual power
may not be preserved.

183
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:20,707
I would never make

184
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,307
such a risky decision.

185
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,988
Since the day Ying
entered Jiuyi Mountain,

186
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:29,748
I've already begun refining this pill.

187
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,947
The Tribulations of Hell
may be difficult.

188
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,268
But Ying's cultivation is the highest

189
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,748
among all the generations
of Immortal Officials.

190
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:38,347
When the time comes,
as long as his true essence is intact,

191
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,467
with my years of spiritual cultivation,

192
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,067
and by administering this pill to him,

193
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,547
the injuries to his body

194
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:46,628
and the damage to his spiritual power

195
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,108
can quickly recover.

196
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:50,467
However,

197
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,347
there's one thing I don't understand.

198
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:54,827
Why didn't you punish Zhu Yan?

199
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:56,947
Ying's determination may be strong.

200
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:59,587
But he has a special affection
for Zhu Yan.

201
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,587
So I plan

202
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,228
to spare her life

203
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,108
and take the risk to use her,

204
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,427
to trigger Ying's desire
to leave the priesthood.

205
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,547
But Princess Zhu Yan

206
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,667
is destined to be the Priest's doom.

207
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:14,467
I...

208
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,187
To ensure Ying's safety,

209
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:21,707
I've placed a deadly curse on Zhu Yan.

210
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:26,788
As long as she dares

211
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,628
to have any murderous intent
toward Ying,

212
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,748
the curse will bring her to her death.

213
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:33,148
In short,

214
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:35,148
the day when Ying returns

215
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:37,187
to Jialan is not far away.

216
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:39,748
However, in addition to this curse,

217
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,228
I still need one more person.

218
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,748
Someone who can always stay

219
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,388
by Ying's side to provide guidance.

220
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,788
So that Zhu Yan, this chess piece,

221
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,427
can be used to the fullest.

222
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:53,707
Do you know

223
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,347
the assassination attempt
didn't succeed?

224
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,028
Instead, it prompted
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor

225
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,108
to take action early.

226
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,827
I've already
started hearing rumors circulating

227
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,148
among the people

228
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:06,508
that the former Crown Prince
is still alive.

229
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:08,748
At this time,

230
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:10,547
he dares to spread the news.

231
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,187
Aren't they afraid

232
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,707
of being accused
of deceiving the Emperor?

233
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,868
How would you know
what the Emperor is thinking?

234
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:20,028
But if the news

235
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,028
of that person being alive

236
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,268
reaches the Emperor's ears,

237
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,347
that's when things will truly go bad.

238
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:26,788
It looks like

239
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:28,947
we shouldn't have trusted

240
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:30,347
the Ice Clan at all.

241
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,788
If the Ice Clan truly intended

242
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:37,707
to cooperate with us

243
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:39,667
and wanted the assassination
to succeed in one go,

244
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:41,988
they would have sent all ten Sorcerers

245
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:43,988
instead of just three.

246
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,508
Sure enough, we're not of one mind.

247
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,628
Now, we can only

248
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,067
gather and unite various forces quickly.

249
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,707
We can't delay the marriage alliance
with the White Clan any longer.

250
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:57,908
Even if we have to,

251
00:16:58,587 --> 00:16:59,868
I absolutely won't choose

252
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,947
that weak and clumsy Bai Xueying.

253
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,307
Princess Xuelu has arrived.

254
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,748
Greetings, Your Highness.

255
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:19,948
You did a good job with the task

256
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,307
I assigned you last time.

257
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,627
I've always been fair

258
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,307
when it comes to rewards and punishment.

259
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:27,547
Now,

260
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,028
it's time for me to fulfill
my promise to you.

261
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:33,948
Thank you, Your Highness.

262
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,547
It's an honor for me

263
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,387
to serve you.

264
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:39,508
I don't need any reward.

265
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,508
Bai Xuelu,

266
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:44,268
do you think

267
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:45,827
I gained power in the imperial harem

268
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,307
all these years for nothing?

269
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:49,827
Listen.

270
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,748
I know what's on your mind.

271
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,907
Don't pretend to be sick and confuse me

272
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,627
and don't have any other thoughts.

273
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:58,827
Understand?

274
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,827
I wouldn't dare.

275
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:05,307
When you're engaged to Shi Yu.

276
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,268
I'll immediately request the Emperor

277
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:10,067
to appoint him as the Crown Prince.

278
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,067
By then, it will be a done deal.

279
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:14,867
No one else will be able
to create trouble.

280
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,228
Why are you still hesitating?

281
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:19,307
Could it be

282
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,188
that you have any other choice?

283
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:27,668
Thank you for your reward,
Your Highness.

284
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,107
I shall wait for your good news.

285
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:58,028
Princess,

286
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,428
Princess Zhu Yan

287
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:00,988
sent an urgent letter.

288
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:15,307
Please tell Prince Shi Yu

289
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:16,948
that I can't meet him tonight.

290
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
Come inside
if you have something to say.

291
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:27,508
Don't stand at the door.

292
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:28,428
Others will laugh if they hear you.

293
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:37,748
Was it you

294
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,347
who tampered with the letters
I wrote to Yan?

295
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:45,228
Don't deny it.

296
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,547
The servants have already told me.

297
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,547
Why did you lure Yan to Nvluo Creek?

298
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,268
Do you know you almost had her
and the Priest killed?

299
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,107
You think too highly of my ability.

300
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,708
I was just following orders.

301
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:07,708
Who gave you orders?

302
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,107
Whose command are you following?

303
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:11,988
Why should I tell you?

304
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,347
I have received the rewards for it.

305
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,587
Also,

306
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:18,788
stop meeting Prince Shi Yu

307
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,067
in private in the future

308
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,827
because he's my future husband.

309
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,107
It was Consort Qing.

310
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:30,708
She's going after the Priest.

311
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,067
But why?

312
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,827
Why are you doing this?

313
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:41,147
The Priest is our master

314
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:42,508
and Consort Qing bears

315
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,867
no grudges against him.

316
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:45,547
It's because you're
the legitimate daughter

317
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,228
that you're so naive.

318
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:50,788
It's because you don't need to care

319
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:51,867
about what's happening around you.

320
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,067
Xuelu,

321
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:56,307
why can't you

322
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,428
let go of your background?

323
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,788
Actually, no one around

324
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,587
will look at you strangely.

325
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,188
You can't even tell a person's emotions

326
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,067
and changes in the world.

327
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:07,988
You can never understand

328
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:09,228
the mistreatment I've endured.

329
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:12,307
Your noble birth

330
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:13,428
has already taken care

331
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:14,428
of all the dark side for you.

332
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,748
So even if you've experienced
some grievances,

333
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:17,948
they are just minor issues

334
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,708
that simply go away with the wind.
How about me?

335
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,268
Since I was born,

336
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,107
I've seen through the fickleness
of the world

337
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:23,907
and the scheming hearts of human beings.

338
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:25,988
Everything I have now

339
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:27,307
is what I've fought for myself.

340
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,748
If I take one wrong step,

341
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:32,028
I won't be able to hold my head up
for the rest of my life.

342
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,468
Xuelu!

343
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:36,708
Xuelu,

344
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,867
my darling daughter.

345
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:41,188
I've always known

346
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,988
that you are exceptional.

347
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:44,627
Consort Qing has informed me

348
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,387
about your betrothal to Prince Shi Yu.

349
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:48,268
Very good, very good indeed.

350
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,107
Father,

351
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:52,387
you've always known

352
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:53,627
that Prince Shi Yu and I

353
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:54,428
have been...

354
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,268
Xueying,

355
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,107
how can you be so insensible?

356
00:21:57,907 --> 00:22:00,508
What you and Prince Shi Yu have
is just puppy love.

357
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,587
When it comes to marriage,

358
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,827
it should be decided by parents

359
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,067
and matchmakers.

360
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,907
Besides, Prince Shi Yu

361
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:07,907
is going to ascend the throne.

362
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:10,228
He needs a wise and capable empress

363
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:11,948
to assist him.

364
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:13,547
Look at your sister.

365
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:15,587
She's dignified and virtuous,

366
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,508
embodying the qualities of an empress...

367
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,228
That's enough, Father. Please stop it.

368
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:24,748
All right.

369
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,587
I'll go to the kitchen right away

370
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,028
and prepare a bowl

371
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,468
of premium bird's nest for you.

372
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:49,268
I'm not fighting

373
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,228
over Prince Shi Yu with you.

374
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:52,748
I only desire the position
of the Empress.

375
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:54,508
You're the legitimate daughter.

376
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,627
You're still able
to feel Father's heartlessness.

377
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:59,468
If I were in your place today,

378
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,668
what would become of me?

379
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:04,147
So I can only fight for it.

380
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:15,788
Shi Yu,

381
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:17,988
are you really going

382
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,307
to marry someone else?

383
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:45,827
Who would have thought

384
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,627
that the sacred ring
of the Menghua Dynasty

385
00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:49,067
isn't in the realm of Kongsang,

386
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,268
but in the ruins

387
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,508
of the fallen Sea Kingdom?

388
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:56,788
Bai Wei, even after your death,
you still...

389
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:58,907
Great.

390
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:00,188
That's great.

391
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,188
You sure are ruthless.

392
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:36,508
Bai Wei,

393
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:39,188
one day,

394
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,188
I'll definitely obtain this ring.

395
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,627
You can't stop me.

396
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:48,668
You can never stop me!

397
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:16,387
Chong Ming.

398
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:19,788
Didn't you ask me

399
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:20,948
to come and play chess?

400
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,867
Since Ying arrived here,

401
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,228
this is the first time
he has suffered such a severe injury.

402
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:29,907
You'll be responsible

403
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:31,708
for his daily necessities
and meals from now on.

404
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,668
Of course.

405
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,708
He has lost more than half of his blood

406
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:47,907
and suffered a significant decline
in his abilities.

407
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:49,228
Fortunately,

408
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,948
the curses

409
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:51,748
and dooms on him

410
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,788
have vanished as a result.

411
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,867
So the life doom has been lifted?

412
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,508
Life doom?

413
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:04,547
From the time Ying arrived here
until the age of eighteen,

414
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,748
he has never met any woman.

415
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:08,508
So why would he
be facing life dooms?

416
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,107
Even if there were any,

417
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:13,347
it has become void
because of this incident.

418
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,347
Your Supreme Majesty, keep playing.

419
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:19,948
I need to check
on the medicinal decoction.

420
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:39,627
Yan'er,

421
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,907
the peach oolong tea you gave me

422
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:42,788
tastes really good.

423
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:45,988
Have some tea and rest.

424
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:46,748
You've been practicing

425
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:47,547
for four hours already.

426
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:48,708
No.

427
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:50,028
I must not slack off.

428
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,307
Master's situation will only become

429
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,468
more and more dangerous.

430
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:57,587
I must practice diligently.

431
00:26:58,347 --> 00:26:58,907
So

432
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:00,827
I can be of help the next time

433
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,428
the enemies come.

434
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:06,508
Or else I'll just be a hindrance

435
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:07,988
like I was in the Cangwu Abyss.

436
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:09,468
It's really delicious.

437
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,347
Won't you have a cup too?

438
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:12,387
By the way,

439
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:15,028
how did you manage to bring him out
from the Cangwu Abyss?

440
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:16,668
I tried holding
and carrying him on my back.

441
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:18,228
I've tried everything.

442
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:19,788
But he didn't transform?

443
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,907
I find that strange too.

444
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,988
Perhaps it's because he lost
too much spiritual power

445
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:26,587
causing the spell to lose effect.

446
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,428
(It seems what the High Priest said
is true.)

447
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:30,827
(All the dooms and curses)

448
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,428
(are really lifted.)

449
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:36,428
Princess.

450
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:40,268
(Yan,)

451
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:41,547
(a while ago my sister)

452
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:42,627
(impersonated my handwriting)

453
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,147
(to lure you to Nvluo Creek.)

454
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:45,468
(I hope you are safe.)

455
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:48,508
(My sister's intentions
are far beyond ours.)

456
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,428
(We must be cautious)

457
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,988
(in our future correspondence.)

458
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:53,508
Indeed, it was her.

459
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:55,827
No,

460
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:56,907
I must go and tell Master now.

461
00:27:57,748 --> 00:27:58,147
What's the matter?

462
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,547
I'll go with you.

463
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,543
(Star Gazing Hall)

464
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:16,748
Kindly announce

465
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:18,067
that disciple Zhu Yan requests
an audience.

466
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:19,228
The Priest said

467
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:20,067
no one is allowed to enter.

468
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,827
Then why are they allowed to enter?

469
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:27,028
The Priest said

470
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:28,627
only Zhu Yan is not allowed to enter.

471
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:30,188
You must have heard him wrong.

472
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:32,347
Why would Master refuse to see me?

473
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:33,788
Just a few days ago, we even

474
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:34,668
saw fire cloud together.

475
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:37,988
Perhaps he's at some barrier
and cannot meet you.

476
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:38,988
It's all right.

477
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:40,107
I can go and help you relay the message.

478
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:44,988
Ying,

479
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:46,387
you don't have to worry anymore.

480
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,067
The High Priest has told me

481
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:49,907
that your life doom have been lifted,

482
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:50,788
just like the curse I placed on you.

483
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,347
When you were on the verge of death,

484
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:53,587
it has been lifted.

485
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:55,708
Shi Ying,

486
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:58,668
I've accompanied you
on this mountain for years

487
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,587
and often lamented your loneliness.

488
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,347
You possess great cultivation.

489
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:06,228
But you have a still heart
without any desires.

490
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,228
The only one
who brought a smile to your face

491
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,067
is your cursed lady.

492
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,268
But now, fate has smiled upon you.

493
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:13,468
Your life doom have been lifted.

494
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,228
Have you thought of anything else?

495
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:22,387
Since I have chosen this path,

496
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,668
I should cut off

497
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:27,268
all worldly attachments.

498
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:28,107
No.

499
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:29,468
This is not your destiny.

500
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,387
You and the Princess of the Crimson Clan

501
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:32,268
may not confess it.

502
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:33,587
But you share the same affection.

503
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,508
Why won't you leave the priesthood

504
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:36,668
and return to the mortal world

505
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,147
to be with her?

506
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:42,147
Leave the priesthood and be together?

507
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:46,468
No.

508
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,387
Even if I have accumulated

509
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,028
many karmic obstacles in my heart,

510
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:52,347
I can eliminate them

511
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:54,228
as long as I adhere to the rules.

512
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:59,107
The heart of Dao is always present,
but a sincere heart is rare.

513
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:00,748
Over the thousands of years,

514
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:03,107
I've seen many people like you

515
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,188
who end up with regrets.

516
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,307
I don't want you to have regrets.

517
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,468
If you utter
such blasphemous words again,

518
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:13,188
don't appear before me anymore.

519
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,268
What... What did you say?

520
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:16,988
Open your eyes.

521
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:18,428
Look into my eyes and say that again.

522
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,948
The one who reaches the real state
can control heaven and earth,

523
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:23,587
and grasp the Yin and Yang.

524
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,547
Fine, you stubborn little priest.

525
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:27,107
You dare to threaten me
with breaking ties with me.

526
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:28,107
Do you think

527
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:28,948
I'll be the one to suffer in the end?

528
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,347
Those who can control heaven and earth,

529
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,107
grasp the Yin and Yang,
rearrange the stars and the moon.

530
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:33,788
You...

531
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:34,627
You're beyond saving.

532
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,428
The one who reaches the real state
can control heaven and earth.

533
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,067
You're really beyond saving.

534
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:40,508
Do you hear me?

535
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,668
Rearrange the stars and the moon,
reshape heaven and earth.

536
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,028
The one who reaches the real state
can control heaven and earth,

537
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,788
grasp the Yin and Yang,

538
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,587
rearrange the stars and the moon,

539
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,547
reshape heaven and earth.

540
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:55,028
The one who reaches the real state
can control heaven and earth...

541
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:55,907
Master,

542
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:58,748
why won't you see me
when everything is well?

543
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,508
Have I done something wrong?

544
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,268
Master,

545
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,228
if you refuse to see me,

546
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:10,067
(Star Gazing Hall)
I'll keep kneeling.

547
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:12,347

548
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:15,788

♪Cultivating amidst the fleeting time
of this mortal world♪

559
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:55,508
Master,

560
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,867
why won't you see me?

561
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:09,228
Master.

562
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:13,867
Zhu Yan,

563
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:15,788
come in.

564
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,028
Master.

565
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,307
Master, you're finally willing
to see me.

566
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,587
I've been worried about you.

567
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:55,587
I've recovered from my injuries.

568
00:32:56,347 --> 00:32:57,428
So you don't need to worry.

569
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,948
About the incident at Nvluo Creek,

570
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:00,907
I fell for Bai Xuelu's trick

571
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,387
because she tampered

572
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,268
with Xueying's letter.

573
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:05,708
I understand now.

574
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:07,228
This isn't your fault.

575
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:09,228
Master,

576
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,668
why did you refuse to see me?

577
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:13,268
Chong Ming said

578
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,147
you were overcoming a hurdle.

579
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:16,748
Now

580
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:18,788
that you're willing to see me.

581
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:22,788
Does that mean you've passed the hurdle?

582
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,147
(Yes.)

583
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,228
(I've encountered a hurdle.)

584
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:29,067
(But that hurdle)

585
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:30,547
(is you.)

586
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:32,587
I'm glad you've overcome the hurdle.

587
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,268
Snowy Rosa is blooming again
at this time.

588
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:39,387
I can go and admire

589
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:40,587
the flowers together with you.

590
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:48,147
Didn't you used

591
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,827
to love Snowy Rosa the most?

592
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:55,867
I asked you to come in

593
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:58,587
to express my gratitude formally.

594
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:01,547
Master,

595
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,428
why are you suddenly so polite?

596
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:06,948
The skills you have learned

597
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,307
are within you

598
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,347
and they will accompany you for life.

599
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:14,708
You must always remember

600
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:16,347
that you are the disciple

601
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:17,827
of the Priest of Jiuyi Mountain.

602
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:20,628
When dealing with any situation,
you shouldn't be arrogant

603
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,947
with your skills

604
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,507
or excessively suppress your emotions.

605
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:27,387
You're straightforward

606
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:28,947
and you tend to act impulsively.

607
00:34:29,788 --> 00:34:30,987
You must learn self-control

608
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,027
and not act recklessly.

609
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:35,507
Only then I can put my mind at ease.

610
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:38,987
Master, can you please clarify

611
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:40,947
what you want to say?

612
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,347
Now that you've completed your training,

613
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:47,987
you can leave the mountain

614
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,947
and never come back.

615
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:53,068
Master,

616
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:55,507
did I do

617
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:57,507
anything wrong?

618
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,068
You didn't do anything wrong.

619
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,467
It's just that the time has come.

620
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,628
Every encounter and farewell

621
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,628
has its own timing.

622
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:11,148
And our fate has come to an end.

623
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:14,027
Why would it end?

624
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:15,628
Our fate

625
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,987
will never end in this lifetime.

626
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,307
The Crown Prince

627
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,387
whom I admired the most
when I was a child

628
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:22,467
and my most respected Master turned out

629
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:23,867
to be the same person.

630
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,387
It shows there's a hidden fate

631
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,427
that has kept me by your side all along.

632
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:31,467
In the future, I still want to master

633
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:32,987
the Celestial Assault
and Sprawling Roots

634
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,827
to fight against those evil enemies
alongside you.

635
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:38,748
Master,

636
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,307
please stop speaking in riddles
with me anymore.

637
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,188
Are you worried
that I might be hurt

638
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:44,588
because there are people
who want to harm you?

639
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:46,548
But I'm not afraid.

640
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,748
Just like back then in Nvluo Creek,

641
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:53,347
we can

642
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,268
fight together.

643
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:04,588
It's all your imagination.

644
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:06,548
But why?

645
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,628
Could it be

646
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,108
because I've acted abruptly?

647
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:11,867
It's not because of you.

648
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:13,507
I've made up my mind.

649
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,387
You can leave now.

650
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,068
But will you not miss me

651
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,347
after I leave?

652
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,947
Just like how I will think of you.

653
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:28,228
I'm used to being alone.

654
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:29,987
But that was before.

655
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,027
Ever since I ascended the mountain,

656
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:33,708
we've been cultivating, meditating,
and dining

657
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,387
together all the time.

658
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:40,467
You were no longer alone.

659
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,387
In any case,

660
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:44,228
I'll never leave you.

661
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,188
It smells so good.

662
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:41,507
This fish soup smells so good.

663
00:37:47,427 --> 00:37:48,188
It's for you.

664
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,987
I'll accept it then.

665
00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:58,947
Your culinary skills are really good.

666
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,268
Lord Chong Ming.

667
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:02,708
Lately,

668
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,827
my master has been urging me
to leave the mountain.

669
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:07,987
But if I really leave,

670
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,507
you won't be able
to taste this tasty fish soup anymore.

671
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,188
Your master is a stubborn person.

672
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,307
I've advised him.

673
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:19,068
But he won't listen.

674
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,307
Look at you.

675
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:22,307
You have both magical powers

676
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:23,867
and great cooking skills.

677
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:26,548
Where else can he
find a disciple like you?

678
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:28,467
That's right. You really know
what to say.

679
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:29,228
So

680
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:30,548
he deserves to suffer alone.

681
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,108
Maybe...

682
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,347
Maybe he'll come to his senses
in a couple of days.

683
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:42,347
Princess,

684
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,387
Crimson King and Queen have arrived.

685
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:45,387
They're currently waiting for you.

686
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:46,668
What?

687
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:49,387
Why did Father and Mother
suddenly come?

688
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:51,027
Could it be...

689
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,467
(I'll return home now.)

690
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,588
(Your father and I will draft a letter
for you to take leave.)

691
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,307
(We'll bring you home
in less than half a month.)

692
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:57,668
They must have found out

693
00:38:57,827 --> 00:38:58,827
about the incident at Nvluo Creek.

694
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:00,387
Oh, no.

695
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:04,387
Yan'er, is there any fish soup left?

696
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:08,907
To be honest,

697
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:13,387
I'm here to bring my daughter home.

698
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,188
About this matter, my wife

699
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,748
has mentioned this to you before.

700
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:19,748
I brought the official documents
this time.

701
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:28,387
Do we, at the Jiuyi Mountain,

702
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:31,307
are unable to reassure you?

703
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,748
With the Priest's careful guidance,

704
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:37,467
Yan'er is indeed fortunate.

705
00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:40,228
But our daughter has grown up

706
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:41,387
and should get married.

707
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:42,827
As parents,

708
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,027
we shouldn't hold her back, right?

709
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:48,507
Your Supreme Majesty,

710
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,867
Princess Zhu Yan has completed
her cultivation in the mountain.

711
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:54,507
I informed her about the matter

712
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:55,307
of leaving the mountain before.

713
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:57,427
Since

714
00:39:58,108 --> 00:39:59,588
the Princess's parents
have come personally to take her back,

715
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:02,947
let them take her away this time.

716
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:05,708
Thank you, Priest
for your guidance to my daughter.

717
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:06,907
Even after she leaves the mountain,

718
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:08,708
the Crimson Residence will never forget

719
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,108
the kindness shown by Jiuyi Mountain.

720
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:12,588
Since that's the case,

721
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:16,108
we'll arrange for you to leave tomorrow.

722
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,347
Thank you, High Priest.

723
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:20,347
I shall take my leave.

724
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:26,907
Ying,

725
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:29,788
today

726
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:32,108
is your mother's death anniversary.

727
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,148
Go and visit her.

728
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:38,427
