00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,100
Best wishes

20
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,139
for a long harmonious relationship.

21
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,419
Best wishes

22
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,459
for a long harmonious relationship.

23
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,060
Best wishes

24
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,179
for a long harmonious relationship.

25
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,780
I heard the Princess of Crimson Clan

26
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,179
is not willing to be married here.

27
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,540
That princess' heart

28
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:03,699
belongs to someone else.

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,419
But this wedding was granted

30
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,859
by the Emperor.

31
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,979
If she refuses to marry,

32
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,500
it'll anger the Emperor

33
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,459
and the whole Crimson Clan

34
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,780
will be implicated.

35
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,019
The auspicious hour has arrived.
Let's proceed with the ceremonial union.

36
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,139
Young Lady,

37
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,620
it's not late to stop this.

38
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,060
Young Lady,

39
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,099
you can never return once you step out

40
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,459
of this tent.

41
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,300
His Lordship and Her Ladyship
are not young anymore.

42
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,740
You're their only daughter.

43
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,579
Do you really have the heart
to abandon them?

44
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,339
Even if I stayed here,

45
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,500
I can never see them

46
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,500
in this lifetime either.

47
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,659
It's no different than being dead.

48
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,300
Please receive the wedding gifts,
Your Highness.

49
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,060
First bow.

50
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:02,940
Second bow.

51
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:06,579
Third bow.

52
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,060
(It's actually a decoy.)

53
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,339
Exchange nuptial wine.

54
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,620
Best wishes

55
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,940
for a long harmonious relationship.

56
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,860
Best wishes

57
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,300
for a long harmonious relationship.

58
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,060
Good!

59
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,380
Sand demon! Run!

60
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,819
Completely outrageous.

61
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,659
Finally,

62
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:54,620
no one will force me

63
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,019
to marry again in this life.

64
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,220
Father.

65
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,340
Mother.

66
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,299
Forgive me.

67
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:15,899
We shall bid farewell

68
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,380
in this lifetime.

69
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:22,343
Who's there?

70
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:52,422
Master.

71
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,343
You...

72
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:04,863
How could you do this

73
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:05,983
to the gift I gave you?

74
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,142
Master,

75
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,022
what brought you here out of a sudden?

76
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:10,782
I...

77
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,422
I thought I would never see you again

78
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,063
in this lifetime.

79
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:18,262
Didn't you invite me

80
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:19,983
to your wedding feast?

81
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,502
The Principal Sorcerer
of the Huotu Tribe

82
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:24,662
possesses profound magical powers.

83
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:25,943
He could easily see

84
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:27,583
through your tricks.

85
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:29,583
The Principal Sorcerer

86
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,583
actually has such powers.

87
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,502
It looks like I underestimated him.

88
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:34,863
So

89
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,022
you put on a show

90
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:38,302
to escape the wedding

91
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,343
right under his nose.

92
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,583
You're truly ignorant
of the consequences.

93
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,943
Didn't you draw a line between us?

94
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,063
Why are you here to lecture me?

95
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:50,142
To be honest, if it weren't for you

96
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:51,463
who appeared out of nowhere,

97
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,262
I would have escaped.

98
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:54,662
Escaped?

99
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,463
Yes.

100
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,103
I learned this trick

101
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,223
from you.

102
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:00,943
Deception and transformation,

103
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,703
like a cicada shedding its skin.

104
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,502
But with your skills,

105
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:05,943
how can it be convincing?

106
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,142
Even if they don't immediately realize

107
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:09,382
the substitute

108
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,743
was merely your puppet,

109
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,382
Great Consort Suda

110
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,302
and Lord Ke'erke are not fools.

111
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,302
Won't they later discover

112
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,302
that the famous Jiang Bead Flying Flame

113
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:19,542
is nothing more

114
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,302
than a wooden-headed fool?

115
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:23,063
You...

116
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:24,823
All right.

117
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:26,382
My plan has many flaws.

118
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:27,382
But Master,

119
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,063
as the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain,

120
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,022
you're always busy and rarely seen.

121
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:32,823
Did you come all this way

122
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:33,703
just to expose

123
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,063
your disciple's plan to flee
from a marriage?

124
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,382
But

125
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,823
the wedding ceremony is canceled.

126
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:40,142
Master's long journey

127
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:41,463
was in vain.

128
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:43,782
It's okay.

129
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,662
I can wait for the next one.

130
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:46,902
What?

131
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:48,223
The next one?

132
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,983
There won't be another one.

133
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,623
Master, just return my Jade Bone quickly.

134
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:53,502
I was actually planning

135
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:54,343
to retrieve it myself.

136
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:06,022
Forget it,

137
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,182
explaining is pointless.

138
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,902
Whatever I say will be wrong.

139
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,063
Come back with me

140
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,262
and see the mess you've made.

141
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:36,623
Don't worry.

142
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,902
We're invisible under the umbrella.

143
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,502
No one can see us.

144
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:41,983
How is she?

145
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:54,422
The Princess is severely injured

146
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:55,823
and needs immediate treatment.

147
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:57,502
Quickly carry her into the tent.

148
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:58,142
Yes.

149
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:58,983
Even if it's not obvious,

150
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,542
but checking the pulse reveals

151
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:03,103
that this fake person is already dead.

152
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:05,902
What exactly do the Great Consort

153
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:07,142
and this Principal Sorcerer
intend to do?

154
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,463
It'll be a little challenging.

155
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:22,422
We can only...

156
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,302
Ke'erke,

157
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,103
you should withdraw for now.

158
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,623
Have the area surrounded

159
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:43,583
and don't let anyone approach the tent.

160
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,303
If the Jialan envoys ask,

161
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:47,823
tell them the Principal Sorcerer

162
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,182
is currently saving Her Highness's life.

163
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,422
They should not enter
as it's a life and death matter.

164
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:52,382
Understand?

165
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:00,503
Go now.

166
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:10,742
In this gruesome situation,

167
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:13,823
Lord Ke'erke's reaction is expected,

168
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,702
but this Great Consort looks too calm.

169
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:18,343
She doesn't feel surprised or sad

170
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,982
over her daughter-in-law's death.

171
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:23,902
In the face of my lifeless body,

172
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,623
your mind

173
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,623
remains sharp and agile.

174
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:29,863
That's not normal too.

175
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:31,343
Great Consort,

176
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:32,222
we can only resort

177
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:33,382
to another method now.

178
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:35,023
Luckily, the materials
are already prepared.

179
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,982
I can perform the ritual now.

180
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:01,142
Why did they obtain

181
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,982
so many merfolks' eyes?

182
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:03,863
That's too cruel.

183
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:06,103
(The clues about the merfolks)

184
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,023
(are indeed related
to the Great Consort.)

185
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:10,662
Yuan.

186
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,902
I hope Yuan is safe.

187
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:14,942
Yuan?

188
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,343
He's our residence's keeper.

189
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,583
I saw him a couple of days ago.

190
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,422
The color of the Jade Tears
would darken significantly three days

191
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,382
after separating from the body.

192
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:26,902
Since you saw him recently,

193
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:28,063
so

194
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:29,783
his eyes are not among these.

195
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,382
What are they up to?

196
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,222
Jade Tears fall to the ground.

197
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,462
Fire burns in the blood.

198
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,222
The devouring of the demon.

199
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:09,702
The return of the dead!

200
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,063
It seems like she has come back to life.

201
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,503
It can completely deceive
with a fake appearance.

202
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:12,702
I intended

203
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:14,142
to have you use your magic tonight

204
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,823
to control Zhu Yan's mind

205
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:16,702
and manipulate her as we wish.

206
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,343
Now, with her remains,

207
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,783
it'll be even easier

208
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,382
to create another one.

209
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:24,783
Congratulations, Great Consort.

210
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,783
We've successfully gained control

211
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:27,263
over the Crimson Clan's Princess.

212
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,462
The entire clan

213
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:30,182
is within your grasp.

214
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,662
You can confidently raise an army

215
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,263
and claim the Western Huang as yours.

216
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:39,823
To think

217
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:41,623
that she had ill intentions
when seeking marriage.

218
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,783
My father and mother

219
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,182
had always trusted
the Huotu Tribe so much.

220
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:46,863
Yet, they secretly harbored

221
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:49,103
such treacherous thoughts.

222
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,382
(Searching for the Sea Emperor
may be urgent.)

223
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:52,543
(If I ignore)

224
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,382
(the Great Consort's treasonous act,)

225
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:54,823
(Western Huang will engulf in war,)

226
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:55,902
(and)

227
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:57,462
(countless innocent people will suffer.)

228
00:20:58,142 --> 00:20:59,662
They even wanted
to turn me into a puppet.

229
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,823
Their malice knows no bounds.

230
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:03,623
Don't worry.

231
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,063
I won't let such a thing happen.

232
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:11,422
Something's not right.

233
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:13,662
How come this puppet lacks vitality?

234
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:15,222
She just died.

235
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:16,343
How can her soul and spirits

236
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:17,623
be completely absent?

237
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,863
Are you saying...

238
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:21,422
This puppet is fake.

239
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:22,982
The Princess is still alive.

240
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,023
Fake?

241
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,382
I'm the real Princess
of the Crimson Clan.

242
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:31,623
They...

243
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,063
Master.

244
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,702
That puppet is a fake.

245
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:41,783
You can't deceive anyone with that.

246
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,422
Two princesses?

247
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:46,422
Great Consort,
which one do you want to keep?

248
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:47,942
Of course, we can't keep the real one.

249
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:36,462
Master.

250
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:38,343
I knew you won't abandon me.

251
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:39,982
I said this before,

252
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:41,583
you won't turn into a puppet.

253
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:43,462
When did I break my promise?

254
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:46,063
Are you Jiuyi Mountain's
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

255
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,422
Yes.

256
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:49,103
You practice dark magic,

257
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,623
sacrificing living beings.

258
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:53,023
Such acts go against the natural order

259
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:54,583
and must be punished.

260
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,263
You're just a mere Immortal Official,

261
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:58,583
an outsider,

262
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,182
who can only deal with matters
of magic and rituals.

263
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,023
You can't meddle

264
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:02,503
in the affairs of our Huotu Tribe,

265
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:03,662
and you definitely can't stop me

266
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:05,942
from punishing my daughter-in-law
for escaping this marriage.

267
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,662
Today, I absolutely won't

268
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,783
let these two leave Susahalu!

269
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:15,343
Capture them!

270
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:16,503
Mother,

271
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:18,343
what's going on?

272
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:22,583
Your Highness?

273
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,303
You saved her?

274
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,783
Your future wife

275
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:28,702
colludes with an outsider,

276
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:30,142
attempting to wipe out Huotu Tribe

277
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:31,263
in one fell swoop.

278
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,982
Jiuyi Mountain and the Crimson Clan

279
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,343
are using this wedding
as a ploy to deal with us.

280
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,942
It's clearly their conspiracy!

281
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:39,583
Trying to make yourself look innocent.

282
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:40,942
It was clearly you

283
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,023
who wanted to turn me into a puppet,

284
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:43,303
to control the Western Huang.

285
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:44,942
To practice dark magic, many merfolks

286
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:46,662
in the Huotu Tribe have disappeared.

287
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:47,982
Lord Ke'erke, didn't you notice

288
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,222
any unusual signs?

289
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:51,863
Everyone,

290
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,303
draw your bows!

291
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:07,942
Master,

292
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:09,343
that day,

293
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:11,343
we didn't die together
in the Cangwu Abyss.

294
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:12,543
Today,

295
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,503
it seems we're destined

296
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,742
to die together in this desert.

297
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:17,382
In the next life...

298
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,583
You won't become a puppet,

299
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:20,063
and you won't die.

300
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:22,662
You have to trust me.

301
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:26,222
Release the arrows!

302
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,742
(Master's power)

303
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:14,142
(has unexpectedly advanced so much.)

304
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:21,142
How is this possible?

305
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:23,702
He can actually

306
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:25,222
control millions of arrows

307
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,942
by controlling one arrow.

308
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:28,863
This means he can single-handedly

309
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:31,103
stand against millions of people.

310
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:32,702
It's impossible.

311
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:34,182
It can't be!

312
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:35,902
Principal Sorcerer.

313
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:37,063
Principal Sorcerer!

314
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:38,182
Principal Sorcerer!

315
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:43,982
Great Consort Suda,

316
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,662
will you confess
and accept the punishment?

317
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:56,422
Two princesses?

318
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:57,662
Great Consort,

319
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,142
which one do you want to keep?

320
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:00,583
Of course, we can't keep the real one.

321
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:07,023
You planned to kill the Princess
of the Crimson Clan,

322
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,503
to conspire and cause chaos
in the Western Huang.

323
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:10,863
The evidence is conclusive.

324
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:11,982
Do you admit your crime?

325
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:20,023
So everything

326
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:22,303
was a trap you set up.

327
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:24,982
(Master left)

328
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,422
(to make the Great Consort
lower her guard.)

329
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:29,023
(So that he could obtain)

330
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,623
(her confession firsthand.)

331
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:31,503
Fine.

332
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:34,942
I admit my crime.

333
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,222
Master, are you all right?

334
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:02,583
Are you hurt?

335
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,142
Lord Ke'erke,

336
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,583
now you know the entire truth.

337
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:10,182
Your mother,

338
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,142
conspired with crooked sorcerer
and planned rebellion.

339
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:13,543
And your father,

340
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,023
I'm afraid he also died

341
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:16,182
under the forbidden magic

342
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:17,222
of that Principal Sorcerer.

343
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,382
You and the soldiers here

344
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,902
are the true warriors.

345
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,222
Are you all going to rebel

346
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,422
and conspire with her?

347
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:26,863
In the laws of Kongsang,

348
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,343
we've always punished the ringleaders

349
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:29,662
and condemned the accomplices.

350
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,343
If you truly care for your people,

351
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,063
you should stop before it's too late.

352
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:35,863
At this point,

353
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,142
everything is my mother's fault.

354
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,263
As the Cheif of the Huotu Tribe,

355
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:42,462
I'm willing to bear
all the responsibility.

356
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:43,742
I ask that you

357
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,783
won't implicate the entire clan.

358
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,103
As long as you don't rebel,

359
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:50,662
I'll request the Emperor

360
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:52,902
to spare the innocent.

361
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:58,902
Thank you, Priest.

362
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:06,303
Mother,

363
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:08,543
Mother, for the sake of our people,

364
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,263
you must live on.

365
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:32,823
Ke'erke!

366
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:36,023
Ke'erke!

367
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:37,942
Son!

368
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,462
My son!

369
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,023
Son.

370
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:52,623
My son.

371
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,783
Ke'erke!

372
00:28:58,462 --> 00:28:58,982
Ying!

373
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:00,023
Yan'er.

374
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:02,182
How did you end up fighting

375
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:03,462
while I went to inquire about Guwei City?

376
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:04,303
See?

377
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:05,263
As soon as I'm gone for a moment,

378
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:06,142
you make a mess like this.

379
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:07,303
Yan'er,

380
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:08,263
it's been a while since we last met.

381
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:09,462
Why the long face?

382
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:11,142
Did Ying ruin your wedding

383
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,063
and make you unhappy?

384
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,742
Great Consort Suda's conspiracy

385
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:16,142
was all for Ke'erke.

386
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:17,462
And Ke'erke in turn,

387
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,023
took his life to atone for her sins.

388
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:22,182
I'm sure she's in utter despair now,

389
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:23,303
with no other thoughts.

390
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:25,303
Chong Ming,

391
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,263
go to the tent and take her away

392
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:28,422
and interrogate her rigorously.

393
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:30,702
We'll surely extract the whereabouts
of Guwei City from her.

394
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:37,182
Master,

395
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:39,982
why didn't you save him earlier?

396
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,823
Ke'erke intended to use his sacrifice

397
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:44,863
to clear the name of the Huotu Tribe.

398
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,823
So the matter ends here.

399
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,063
I'll hand over the Great Consort

400
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:51,382
to the Jialan envoys

401
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:52,982
and have her sent back for trial,

402
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:54,863
without implicating more people.

403
00:29:57,783 --> 00:29:59,063
You could have saved him earlier.

404
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,462
But why didn't you?

405
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:02,343
I...

406
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:03,982
I did try to save him.

407
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:05,623
I didn't have enough time.

408
00:30:05,662 --> 00:30:06,103
No,

409
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:07,623
you had enough time.

410
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,142
When Great Consort Suda's dagger

411
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,303
was about to strike me,

412
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:11,462
you had enough time.

413
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:13,503
Yan'er,

414
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:15,902
you're stronger than you think.

415
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:17,742
Remember this.

416
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,742
As long as you're willing,

417
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:21,623
you'll always have enough time.

418
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:22,702
You can always

419
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,103
do it.

420
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:38,942
Let's go.

421
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,023
The escape failed

422
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:53,623
and I was caught again.

423
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:54,863
Young Lady!

424
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:56,503
Young Lady, you're back!

425
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:58,583
I'm glad you're safe.

426
00:30:58,863 --> 00:30:59,583
The situation was so chaotic

427
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:01,263
that I could only hide from fear.

428
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:08,263
This is...

429
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:10,863
This is my master.

430
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:13,863
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

431
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:17,023
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
what brings you here?

432
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:21,222
Young Lady, what did I tell you?

433
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:23,503
He does have you in his heart.

434
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:26,863
Yufei,

435
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:28,982
go and inform the escorts

436
00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:31,382
that I'm fine so they're not worried.

437
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,343
I have important matters to attend to

438
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:42,863
and will leave shortly.

439
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,462
I've already written a letter
to your father,

440
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:47,382
asking him to come
and take you back as soon as possible.

441
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:51,263
So you didn't visit Huotu Tribe

442
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:52,182
because of me.

443
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:54,222
But a mere coincidence

444
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:55,942
that led to my rescue.

445
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:57,382
Yes.

446
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:03,982
Master, you sure are busy.

447
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,623
After a brief encounter,
then you have to leave.

448
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:10,702
About you escaping the marriage,

449
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:12,583
I won't tell your father.

450
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,662
But I have one question to ask you.

451
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,263
Are you truly aware

452
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:21,982
of the consequences of this matter?

453
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:24,823
Didn't you lecture me before?

454
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:26,863
Bring trouble to one's parents,

455
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,543
and a plan with loopholes everywhere.

456
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,023
Put out your hand.

457
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:38,182
Master,

458
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:39,863
are you going to hit me?

459
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:41,503
In Jiuyi Mountain,

460
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:43,063
I only taught you magic techniques.

461
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:45,222
I never used rules to restrain you.

462
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:47,902
Since you are now in the mortal world,

463
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:49,783
let me teach you

464
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:51,863
the rules of being a royal clan member.

465
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:55,702
Master,

466
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:56,702
are you going to teach me?

467
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:58,783
I thought you were busy.

468
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:00,103
How do you have time to teach me now?

469
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:01,982
Don't come closer.

470
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:03,982
If you come any closer,

471
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:06,783
I am capable of doing anything.

472
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:11,543
What are you trying to do?

473
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,422
I'm not a child anymore.

474
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,103
I'm already an adult.

475
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,422
I even had a husband who died.

476
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,942
If you dare to hit me again,

477
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:24,543
I will scream.

478
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:25,982
There are so many people outside.

479
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,503
I'll call them all here.

480
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:29,462
See if you dare to hit me
in front of them.

481
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:33,263
Let me go!

482
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,182
Or else...

483
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:35,702
Or else I'll scream for help!

484
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:36,942
If you dare to hit me,

485
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:37,583
I'll...

486
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:40,263
You hit me for real.

487
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:46,343
Fine.

488
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:47,943
Go ahead and hit me again.

489
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:49,103
I hit you

490
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,543
because I want you to remember

491
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:52,383
that as the Princess
of the Crimson Clan,

492
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:53,662
you should never

493
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:54,862
risk your own life

494
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,742
and the lives of your clansmen.

495
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,463
The wedding congratulatory letter
was just my wish,

496
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:05,662
not a command.

497
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:07,543
Your desires

498
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,583
are in your own hands.

499
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:12,943
It doesn't matter
if it's Qing Gang or Ke'erke.

500
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,342
If you want to marry, then go ahead.

501
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:16,742
If you don't want to,

502
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:18,903
then convince your parents
of your decision.

503
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:22,583
If you marry and later discover
their treasonous intentions,

504
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:23,702
you can also inform your father

505
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,702
through messengers

506
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:27,342
instead of resorting to running away.

507
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,543
Why? You don't agree?

508
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:34,742
What you said is right.

509
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:36,943
But you only know how to speak logically

510
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:38,943
and don't understand my struggles.

511
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,662
If I refuse to marry,

512
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:42,142
Consort Qing will use this

513
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,182
against my father.

514
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:44,903
So I can only marry.

515
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:47,262
But I am unwilling.

516
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:49,023
So I planned the escape.

517
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,342
I thought

518
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:00,383
after you leave Jiuyi Mountain,

519
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:02,782
the Azure Clan
would no longer trouble you

520
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:03,943
and your clansmen.

521
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:05,583
Consort Qing
didn't cause us trouble

522
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:06,702
because of you.

523
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:08,623
Father said

524
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:10,063
it was because my father

525
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:11,262
refused to submit to her.

526
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,423
That's why Consort Qing

527
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,983
deliberately did this to force him.

528
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:17,063
She's using this as means
of personal revenge.

529
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:18,822
You can write a letter to inform me.

530
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,302
Although I'm usually not in the palace,

531
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,423
it won't be difficult

532
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,503
for me to enter Jialan City

533
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,383
and have a chat with Consort Qing.

534
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:30,702
So

535
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,142
you're concerned about me.

536
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:35,662
Am I right?

537
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,423
But you never tell me anything.

538
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,583
You never tell me what's on your mind,

539
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:43,822
your plan,

540
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:44,742
and everything about you.

541
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,302
You treat me like an outsider.

542
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,463
I'm not a worm in your belly.

543
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:49,943
How would I know?

544
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:55,302
I'm aware of it.

545
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:56,822
I won't dream

546
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:57,943
of returning to Jiuyi Mountain anymore.

547
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:00,063
You no longer have

548
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:00,943
to send me any wedding wishes

549
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:02,702
or be concerned about me.

550
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,142
Actually, it's my own fault

551
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:07,983
for not being proficient enough in magic

552
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:09,623
to protect my family.

553
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:13,142
If I had your strategies and abilities,

554
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:15,383
I wouldn't be controlled by others.

555
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,943
(It's good that you think that way.)

556
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:21,262
(Keep your distance
from Jiuyi Mountain and me)

557
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,302
(to avoid getting involved in conflicts.)

558
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,782
(I hope this will be the last time)

559
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:28,903
(you get implicated by me.)

560
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:40,583
Master,

561
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:42,023
why are you grounding me again?

562
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:44,463
General Jiang Chen of the Kongji Army

563
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:46,222
will temporarily take over Huotu Tribe.

564
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:47,742
The rest of the matters

565
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:49,463
will be handled

566
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:50,543
after your father arrives.

567
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:53,023
Didn't you want to possess

568
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:54,583
the same abilities as me?

569
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:55,742
Then stay here

570
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:57,543
and practice magic seriously.

571
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:03,423
If you want to go out,

572
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:04,822
you can break my barrier

573
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:07,383
after you finished reading this book.

574
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,503
When that time comes,
no one can stop you.

575
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:21,782
Master!

576
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:28,463
What is it?

577
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:32,262
Master,

578
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:34,862
we have to separate

579
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:36,662
after a brief meeting.

580
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:39,142
I feel reluctant.

581
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:41,063
Why not take me

582
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,063
with you wherever you go?

583
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,943
I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

584
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:50,983
You're just using sweet words to escape

585
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:52,063
because you can't defeat me.

586
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:54,702
Instead of playing these tricks,

587
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:56,862
it's better to focus on practicing magic

588
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:58,702
and escape from this barrier.

589
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:06,742
So what if you have advanced skills
in magic?

590
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,623
I didn't say anything.

591
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:31,262
Sure enough,

592
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:32,302
you treat me as an outsider.

593
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:34,782
You refuse to teach me your expertise.

594
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:38,103
So what?

595
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:41,342
Having advanced magic skills

596
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:43,262
does make a person superior.

597
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:44,503
You...

598
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:57,342
When Princess was in trouble,

599
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,623
the Priest of Grand Preceptor arrived.

600
00:38:59,182 --> 00:38:59,943
It looks like

601
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:01,543
they have developed
some kind of affection

602
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:03,383
at Jiuyi Mountain.

603
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:04,702
That's for sure.

604
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:14,662
Did you say goodbye to Zhu Yan?

605
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:15,742
What did you talk about?

606
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:17,983
Nothing much.

607
00:39:19,063 --> 00:39:19,822
After leaving the mountain,

608
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:21,983
Zhu Yan may behave out of line.

609
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:25,103
But her mentality has matured.

610
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,742
Just listen to yourself,

611
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,903
you speak with a master's tone.

612
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,782
(What you said is right.)

613
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:33,742
But you only know how to speak logically

614
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:35,623
and don't understand my struggles.

615
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:37,342
If I refuse to marry,

616
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:38,862
Consort Qing will use this

617
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:39,903
against my father.

618
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:41,463
So I can only marry.

619
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:43,822
But I am unwilling.

620
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,063
So I planned the escape.

621
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:51,222
I am

622
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:53,583
her master, to begin with.

623
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:58,543
Did you get any information

624
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:00,142
from Great Consort?

625
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:01,983
She took her own life.

626
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,503
But before she died,

627
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,423
she told me the location of Guwei City.

628
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,342
It's located outside Tianqian Pass,

629
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:09,742
where many merfolks are imprisoned.

630
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:11,222
There might be clues
about the evil force.

631
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:13,983
We shouldn't waste time.

632
00:40:14,463 --> 00:40:15,383
Let's leave immediately.

633
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,623
What are you doing?

634
00:40:24,983 --> 00:40:26,103
I inadvertently resolved the rebellion

635
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:27,822
in the Huotu Tribe.

636
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,383
But the presence of the Huotu Tribe
in the Crimson Clan's territory

637
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,583
might cause trouble for the Crimson King.

638
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:35,623
I send the azure bird

639
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:37,182
to deliver the evidence
of the Great Consort's treason

640
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:39,182
back to Extreme Wind City.

641
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,623
Jiuyi Mountain is a place
outside the world

642
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,142
and shouldn't be involved
in the affairs of Jialan.

643
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,503
The credit for suppressing the rebellion

644
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,302
should go to the Crimson King.

645
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:50,543
Although you are in the outside world,

646
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:51,983
you possess strategic thinking

647
00:40:52,103 --> 00:40:53,103
and governance abilities.

648
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:54,423
In my opinion,

649
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:56,182
if you're willing
to leave the priesthood

650
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:56,782
and return to Jialan,

651
00:40:56,983 --> 00:40:59,583
you can bring peace to the world
and marry...

652
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:03,023
All these problems

653
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:04,302
will be easily resolved.

654
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:05,503
Second.

655
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:08,302
What do you mean, second?

656
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:09,903
You've gone too far with your words.

657
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:10,983
You mentioned this once before

658
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:12,862
in the Hall.

659
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,103
Three strikes and you're out.

660
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:15,983
If there's a third time,

661
00:41:16,342 --> 00:41:18,142
we don't need to meet again.

662
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:21,583
No need to take it
so seriously, Shi Ying.

663
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:22,983
I was just joking.

664
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:27,063
Pretend I never said it.

665
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:42,983
Be gentle.

666
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:47,383
Priest of Grand Preceptor
sure is heartless.

667
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:49,383
Look how swollen your palm is.

668
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:51,742
Nonsense.

669
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,503
With Master's skills,

670
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,503
if he really wanted to harm me,

671
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,222
it would be easy.

672
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,262
If he were truly heartless,

673
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:00,383
how do I only suffer

674
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:01,623
some superficial injuries?

675
00:42:02,662 --> 00:42:03,423
Anyway,

676
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:04,623
you really know how to defend
the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

677
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:05,662
No wonder...

678
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:09,742
No wonder

679
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:11,862
people say that you two...

680
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:13,983
This one.

681
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,302
Nonsense!

682
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,342
Deliver my command.

683
00:42:19,822 --> 00:42:20,623
If anyone dares

684
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:21,543
to spread slanderous remarks

685
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:22,423
against my master,

686
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:23,543
they will be immediately punished
by death.

687
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:26,623
After all, I'm the Princess
of Western Huang.

688
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:29,342
I'm capable of handling such matters.

689
00:42:30,182 --> 00:42:30,662
Of course.

690
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:32,742
I'll convey your command.

691
00:42:36,302 --> 00:42:38,423
It's all my fault
for speaking carelessly earlier,

692
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,142
causing trouble for my master.

693
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:53,782
Indeed,

694
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:55,063
this barrier

695
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:56,702
was specifically set up

696
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:58,782
to block me only.

697
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:11,782
Barrier...

698
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:13,463
Oh no.

699
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:15,623
How could I forget about Lady Yu
and her child?
