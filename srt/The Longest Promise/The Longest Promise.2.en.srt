(It seems that Bell of Cleansing)

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,660
(requires very refined techniques.)

21
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,060
(No.)

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,460
(I still need to practice diligently.)

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,580
(So that I can give this item to Mother)

24
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,900
(before her birthday.)

25
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,340
(Extreme Wind City)

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,900
(Crimson Residence)

27
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,980
Princess, you travel
further and further away.

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,700
This time you've been away
from home for ten days.

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,660
We've had to hide it so well.

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,260
Fortunately, you returned in time today.

31
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,140
Otherwise,

32
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,740
we wouldn't be able to
cover up for you this time.

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,620
I wonder why Mother

34
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,100
sought me out today?

35
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,620
Could it be that another young mister

36
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,540
has come to propose marriage again?

37
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,660
In the current Extreme Wind City,

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,660
who dares to come
and propose marriage to you now?

39
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,820
You keep wanting to

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,500
compete with every suitor who comes.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,180
They haven't even finished
healing from their injuries.

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,940
I heard that this time,

43
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
it seems to be someone from Jialan.

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,180
It seems they are planning

45
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
to invite you to participate in

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,940
an event called
the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Is it the Grand Ceremony of Worship

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,140
at Jiuyi Mountain that takes place
only once every ten years?

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,580
Well...
I'm not sure though.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,540
Princess.

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,580
Where are you going again?

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,980
Granny, please have some tea.

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

54
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,380
I heard that the Princess

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,340
has reached adulthood now.

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,020
So I made this trip specifically.

57
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,340
(Zhu Changxiang, Crimson Clan's Consort)
I'm sure you know that

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,500
according to ancestral customs,

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,580
the eldest daughter of the Bai family

60
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,900
will become the lead dancer

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,220
at the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,300
But if the other Saintesses
who are dancing

63
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,540
perform exceptionally well,

64
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,460
it can bring honor
to the family as well.

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,220
The influential figures from
the Six Ministries are all gathered here,

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
it's also a good
opportunity to select a husband.

67
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,940
I'm afraid Yan'er has already

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,700
neglected her dancing.

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,780
I'm going.

70
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,780
Father.

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,620
Mother.

72
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,540
Granny.

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580
I want to participate
in the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

74
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,260
But if your dancing skills
are not up to par,

75
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,900
you won't be able to go.

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,340
Give me three days.

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,300
I will definitely sharpen my skills.

78
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:50,992
(Star Gazing Plaza, Jiuyi Mountain)

79
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,900
Jiuyi Mountain

80
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,700
welcomes all lords and princesses.

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,700
Come on.

82
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,700
Slow down.

83
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,540
Bai.

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,220
Are these the offerings you prepared

85
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,500
for the Star-gazing Ceremony?

86
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,500
It seems that in these years,

87
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,980
Ye City hasn't been doing well.

88
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,680
These few years,

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,400
Qingzhou has been greatly
benefited from the Dragon's grace.

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,660
I can completely provide

91
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,580
some assistance to you.

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,380
On this trip,

93
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,300
I brought two daughters with me.

94
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,060
One of them

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,620
is a candidate for Star Gazer.

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,020
A box of fine pearls
from the Bai Residence.

97
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,540
Although we brought fewer offerings,

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,860
the purpose is

99
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,740
to ease the future
Consort of Crown Prince.

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,260
Qing.

101
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,660
Don't you agree?

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,620
You're mistaken.

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
The Crown Prince doesn't exist yet,

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,060
so there's no Crown Princess yet.

105
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,300
Once there's an Crown Princess,

106
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,740
there will be an Crown Prince.

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,080
I haven't seen you for three days only.

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,740
What an impressive progress!

109
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,260
Let me test your skills.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,980
Come.

111
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,940
Chong Ming.

112
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
(Divine Bird Chong Ming, Jiuyi Mountain)

113
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,180
I haven't seen you for just a few days,

114
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,180
and yet you've developed a pig's habit

115
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,820
of crashing into trees.

116
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,780
What?

117
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
How dare you say that I'm a pig?

118
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,060
You...

119
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,140
Did I ruin my appearance?

120
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,660
Did I?

121
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,020
Did I?

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,820
Oh no.

123
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,260
It's alright.

124
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,540
It's not a big deal.

125
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,020
Do you know how difficult it is

126
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,380
for me to have this appearance?

127
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm Chong Ming,
the King of Hundred Birds.

128
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,340
I've cultivated for thousands of years

129
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,180
and now have finally
transformed into a human.

130
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,460
But I

131
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,180
haven't finished my cultivation yet.

132
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,620
I haven't shown
this beautiful face to others.

133
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,980
I must protect this face well.

134
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,620
Indeed.

135
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,260
I indulged too much in my own beauty

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,300
and forgot about the important matter.

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,180
As they say, beauty brings disaster.

138
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,340
The ancient bird was right.

139
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,380
What's the matter?

140
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,340
Don't you know about
the Jiuyi Grand Ceremony?

141
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,340
Come with me and see the excitement.

142
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,700
The Jiuyi Mountain only has this event

143
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,660
once every ten years.

144
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,140
Even the Four Grand Marshals

145
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,740
are itching to go up the mountain.

146
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,540
I won't go.

147
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,300
Are you afraid of being seen by others?

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,940
Although you cannot leave the valley

149
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,060
before you turn 18,

150
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,020
I have already prepared

151
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,060
the attire of a divine servant for you.

152
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,420
We just need to
quietly go up the mountain

153
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,660
and take a quick look.

154
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,860
No one will notice.

155
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,060
I won't go.

156
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,860
You called me a pig just now.

157
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,740
If you hadn't moved away,

158
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,740
how would I've possibly
crashed into the tree?

159
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,620
Besides,

160
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,020
why would I hit you?

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,940
It was to distract

162
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,620
your attention,

163
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,900
so you could rest well.

164
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,020
But you didn't appreciate
my good intentions at all.

165
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,820
I know the reason you trained tirelessly

166
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
is that you can go out

167
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,220
and bring back your mother.

168
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,940
But because of that prophecy,

169
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,700
you cannot see any women

170
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,300
before you turn 18,

171
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,100
and can only stay

172
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,660
within the Emperor Valley
of Jiuyi Mountain.

173
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,740
But there's still plenty of time left.

174
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,700
Don't be in a rush for results.

175
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,620
Take it slowly.

176
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,220
Return this to me.

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:39,900
You.

178
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,820
You!

179
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,140
That's all you have to say?

180
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,500
If I had known you were so boring,

181
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,460
I wouldn't have followed you

182
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,020
three years ago

183
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,100
when you saved me.

184
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,940
It's too late.

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,740
You little Grand Minister.

186
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,860
I'll go back and find a way.

187
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,180
I'll definitely make you go.

188
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,860
Chong Ming.

189
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,500
Thank you.

190
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
Lord Immortal Official.

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,780
I have a question.

192
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,140
Within this Jiuyi Mountain,

193
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,340
which divine official
has the highest magical abilities?

194
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,620
Within this Jiuyi Mountain,

195
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,100
there are distinctions between
immortal officials and divine servants.

196
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,420
I am only a divine servant.

197
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,500
Only immortal officials can study magic.

198
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,100
The immortal officials are divided

199
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,140
into four ranks
according to their abilities.

200
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,980
They are Grand Minister, Grand General,

201
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,420
Grand Marshal, and Grand Preceptor.

202
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,740
The one with the
highest magical power is naturally

203
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,080
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor

204
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,140
who presides over
the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

205
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,980
How powerful is the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor's cultivation?

206
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,420
No one has ever seen it.

207
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,020
Rumor has it that he can command
the Yunhuang Compendium.

208
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,740
Command the Yunhuang Compendium?

209
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,220
That's so amazing.

210
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,560
Then does he know

211
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,020
Primordial Spirit-Gathering Spell?

212
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,500
I've never heard of it.

213
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,100
How could such

214
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,540
a world-defying spell exist?

215
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,864
(Mansion on Jiuyi Mountain)

216
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,620
My Lord, here's the accommodation
for you and the Princess these few days.

217
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,540
Thank you.

218
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,980
Chi Song.

219
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,780
Tell them to move all the things in.

220
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,060
Sure, My Lord.

221
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,020
Lord Immortal Official.

222
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,740
I would like to ask

223
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,740
about this Jiuyi Mountain.

224
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,300
It has stood for
thousands of years without falling.

225
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
Could there be some
ancient secret techniques

226
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,500
that can transcend

227
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,660
the boundary of Yin and Yang?

228
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,340
Seeing that you cultivate here,

229
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,020
have you heard of it before?

230
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,340
There's one saying that goes
"Life and death are predestined."

231
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,780
which says that

232
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,340
the life and death of humans
are predestined by fate.

233
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,780
Good day to you,
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

234
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,660
You may leave first.

235
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,780
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

236
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,900
If one forcibly breaks through
the boundary of Yin and Yang,

237
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,300
it goes against the natural order

238
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,300
and is a taboo for cultivators.

239
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,660
How could there be anyone in the world

240
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,540
who has learned such a technique?

241
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,220
Yes, High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

242
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,220
Why are you so sure?

243
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,060
Just because you don't know,

244
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,460
how can you say so for the others too?

245
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,340
Young Lady...

246
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,940
Can't you be a bit more modest?

247
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,820
Because of such questions,

248
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,620
I have answered them countless times.

249
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,860
It seems that
Princess Zhu Yan is a curious person.

250
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,380
So let me remind you.

251
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,900
Jiuyi Mountain is dangerous.

252
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,300
Apart from the places
where guests reside

253
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,540
and the places of worship,

254
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,580
do not trespass elsewhere.

255
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,740
Especially
the Emperor Valley beyond the mountain

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,860
which is the tomb of
Emperors throughout history.

257
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,220
It is a forbidden area.

258
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,300
Empress Bai Wei's

259
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,940
Ring of Houtu is guarding it.

260
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,260
Not only that, Chong Ming,
the ancient mythical beast,

261
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,460
is guarding inner valley as well.

262
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,860
Those who trespass will not return.

263
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,260
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

264
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,980
My Lord, I came to see

265
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,540
how you're doing here.

266
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,420
Are you getting used to it?

267
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,340
Definitely.

268
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,580
This way, please.

269
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,380
Young Lady.

270
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,660
Just forget it. Give up.

271
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,020
Is what the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor said true?

272
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,060
No, no.

273
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,500
The cultivators with
the highest magical abilities

274
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,740
are always in seclusion.

275
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,340
Although the High Priest of
Grand Preceptor is known as

276
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,460
the foremost expert in magic,

277
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,660
I think

278
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,540
there may be others who

279
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,620
are more formidable than him.

280
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Young Lady.

281
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,540
Why don't you listen to what others say?

282
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,900
Surely this Jiuyi Mountain

283
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,740
must have other
extraordinary individuals.

284
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,220
I will definitely find them.

285
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I see.

286
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,220
Although the water
is without any origin,

287
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,180
if I want to succeed in this technique,

288
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,780
I must trace it back to the source.

289
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,620
Please deliver this item

290
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,460
to the Kunyuan Palace in Jialan

291
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
and hand it to Empress Bai Yan.

292
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,980
Mother only needs to consume this item

293
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,860
to restore her voice

294
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,900
that was hoarse from the fire that day

295
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,420
and it will become clear again.

296
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,220
Mother,

297
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,340
I really miss you.

298
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,340
I will bring you back

299
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,940
when I turn 18.

300
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,180
Something terrible has happened!

301
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,100
Something terrible has happened!

302
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,580
Something terrible has happened!

303
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,420
I've ruined my face. Look!

304
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,820
Chong Ming, your face...

305
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,980
Is it very serious?

306
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,700
If we don't treat it, it will heal.

307
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,500
Young man.

308
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,580
What kind of attitude is this?

309
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,420
Don't you know that
for thousands of years,

310
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,140
how many people

311
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,900
have envied my youthful appearance?

312
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,060
Throughout history,

313
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,620
has any mythical creature

314
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
been written about by the Heavenly God?

315
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,900
Or has any mythical creature

316
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,540
been sung about by Yue Chan?

317
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,900
None at all.

318
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,540
So,

319
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,780
this heavenly bestowed beauty

320
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,180
cannot have any flaws.

321
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,580
Understood.

322
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,140
Then what should I do?

323
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,820
Well, my wound

324
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,260
was scratched by a tree branch.

325
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,140
So, you need to bring me
two qian of Danbai ginseng,

326
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,220
one inch of Zixia vine,

327
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
half a catty of Banhe grass,

328
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,380
and half a piece of Mingchan peel.

329
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,260
Then, I'll boil and consume them
to invigorate my blood circulation.

330
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,540
Understood. I'll go...

331
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,340
Hold on!

332
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,740
Additionally, I need three Zihan leaves,

333
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,240
and two Ruyi flowers.

334
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,420
Then, I'll just grind and apply them

335
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,820
to promote skin regeneration.

336
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,100
Zihan leaves and Ruyi flowers?

337
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,780
All of them can only be found on

338
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
Medicine God Peak.

339
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,140
Then let's go to
the top of Medicine God Peak.

340
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,740
We'll pick a few leaves,

341
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,460
pluck a few flowers and come back.

342
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,260
I'm not asking you out

343
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,140
just because it's lively

344
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
on the mountain now.

345
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,140
They have their fun,

346
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,860
what does it have to do with us?

347
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,620
After I disfigured myself,

348
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
it's been two hours

349
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,980
that I haven't had
the mood to look in the mirror.

350
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I just want to restore
my youthful appearance.

351
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,580
I never want to transform back
into my true form to carry you again.

352
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,620
After all, this human form of mine

353
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,300
possesses the beauty
that can captivate a nation.

354
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,700
Even in my fledgling bird form,
I am delicate and exquisite.

355
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,340
It's just that my original form
is big and ferocious.

356
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,700
It's not cute at all.

357
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Young Lady.

358
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
The 'Star Gazer' leading this dance

359
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,580
is Princess Xueying from the Bai family.

360
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,060
You two have been close since childhood.

361
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,620
This time, you can use this opportunity

362
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
to have a chat.

363
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,020
Quick, look!

364
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,580
Look, there's the Ancient Divine Bird.

365
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,740
That's the legendary Chong Ming.

366
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,980
Chong Ming...

367
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,900
It looks like there's also a person

368
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,620
on Chong Ming's back!

369
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
A person?

370
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,740
The person who can control Chong Ming

371
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
must be a formidable expert.

372
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I'm going to take a closer look!

373
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,300
It's almost time for the performance!

374
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,700
That area is restricted.
We can't go there!

375
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,620
Young Lady, come back here!

376
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,900
Young Lady!

377
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,020
I'll be waiting
for you at the gathering!

378
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,460
Hurry back!

379
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,140
(I clearly saw it flying around here.)

380
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
(Where could it have gone?)

381
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,100
Both Chong Ming
and the expert are nowhere to be seen.

382
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,500
It's just you, a little white bird.

383
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,700
Little white bird.

384
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,420
You're so cute.

385
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh! You're hurt!

386
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,220
Let me help you.

387
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Don't be afraid.

388
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,460
I've saved countless

389
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,180
little white birds like you.

390
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,380
I've helped at least hundreds of them.

391
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
They can even survive

392
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,140
in the Western Desert.

393
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,220
You're now in Jiuyi Mountain.

394
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,420
You have to be strong.

395
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,500
Come on.

396
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,340
(What are you doing)

397
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,700
(to this venerable face of mine?)

398
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,500
Hey! Come back!

399
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Where are you going?

400
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,660
So, you're not
a little white bird after all.

401
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,140
You are the Divine Bird Chong Ming.

402
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,060
(Someone like you
would know that I am Chong Ming.)

403
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
(You have a good eye.)

404
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,940
Divine Bird Chong Ming.

405
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,860
You must be over 9,000 years old.

406
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,540
According to the Yunhuang Compendium,

407
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,900
Chong Ming has two pupils,

408
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,540
so it is also known as
the Twin-eyed Divine Beast.

409
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,380
It resembles a dancing phoenix
yet sounds like a roaring dragon.

410
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,660
It can fly up to the Ninth Heaven
and descend into the Five Oceans.

411
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,220
Its literary skills are so superb
that it can list a hundred herbs of the world.

412
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,340
They say that it can
breathe back life with just a touch.

413
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,220
Its martial skills are superior to those of
tigers, leopards, bears, and fiends,

414
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,780
and can easily
drive away all sorts of evil spirits.

415
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,940
An ancient creature
that mere divine beasts couldn't even compare.

416
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,500
Chong Ming is at the top of the pyramid.

417
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,140
Lord Chong Ming,

418
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,820
may I ask if you have a master?

419
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,860
(Master? I do not have a master!)

420
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,380
Lord Chong Ming.

421
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,260
Please pardon my blunder.

422
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,180
What I meant was,

423
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,100
do you have an immortal friend
you cultivate with?

424
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,180
If you do, may I ask if

425
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,740
you can introduce me to that person?

426
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,780
(You truly have no self-awareness.)

427
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
(I've only given you
the slightest bit of courtesy.)

428
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,180
(Yet, you took
an inch and ask for a mile!)

429
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,500
(How can my immortal friend)

430
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,100
(meet someone like you)

431
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
(just because you asked for it?)

432
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,420
Lord Chong Ming.

433
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,940
You truly are straightforward.

434
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,460
Lord Chong Ming.

435
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,740
Did you just use

436
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,460
your noble and beautiful feathers

437
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,580
to whack me earlier?

438
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,940
According to the records
in the Yunhuang Compendium,

439
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,020
these feathers could ward off
evil spirits and are antidotes to poisons.

440
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,860
New ones replace
the old ones every three years.

441
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,820
It is considered a top-grade tribute.

442
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,340
I am truly fortunate

443
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,700
to come in close contact
with such wondrous feathers.

444
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Princess.

445
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Where are you?

446
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,540
Princess!

447
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,820
I'm here!

448
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Princess, please come quickly.

449
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,820
The court maid at the music house said

450
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,700
that if she doesn't see you

451
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
within an hour,

452
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,780
your qualification
as a dancer will be revoked!

453
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,860
If that happens,

454
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,860
it won't look good for His Lordship.

455
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,180
Lord Chong Ming.

456
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,620
I'll take my leave, then.

457
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,900
I hope we can meet again next time.

458
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,260
Princess!

459
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,700
Princess!

460
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,740
That little girl.

461
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,140
She speaks so eloquently.

462
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,060
I've just given her a test,

463
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,860
yet she disappeared.

464
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,620
She lacks sincerity indeed.

465
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,660
Who are you talking about?

466
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,060
A naive little girl

467
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,260
with no knowledge of the world.

468
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,900
By the way,

469
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,580
she even asked me about you.

470
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,940
Asked about me?

471
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,100
She looks really beautiful.

472
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,280
(Bai Xuelu, Princess of White Clan)

473
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,020
Like a celestial being.

474
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,300
She dances so well.

475
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,980
Impressive.

476
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,820
Princess Xuelu dances so well.

477
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,620
She should be the Star Gazer.

478
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,940
Exactly.

479
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,200
(Zi Qianqian, Princess of Purple Clan)
Star Gazer, Star Gazer!

480
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,460
(Xuan Shuang, Princess of Dark Clan)
Star Gazer, Star Gazer!

481
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,460
Star Gazer, Star Gazer!

482
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,460
Star Gazer, Star Gazer!

483
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,840
(Bai Xueying, Princess of White Clan)

484
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,860
Oh my, it's so beautiful.

485
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,820
Yes, it is.

486
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,220
So beautiful.

487
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:34,980
Yes.

488
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,780
Exactly.

489
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,780
Young Lady.

490
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,460
Young Lady.

491
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,820
This is a once-in-a-decade performance.

492
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,020
The princesses from other families

493
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,900
are all dressed to the nails!

494
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,300
They're practically
dripping with jewelry.

495
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,340
But, you...

496
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,300
The 'Star Gazer'

497
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
is always
the Bai family's legitimate daughter.

498
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Xueying is the only

499
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
legitimate daughter of the Bai family.

500
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,860
So, why do they

501
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,060
call Bai Xuelu the Star Gazer?

502
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,140
Although Princess Xuelu
is a low-born daughter,

503
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,540
everyone praises her

504
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,580
for her exceptional dancing skills.

505
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,220
They want her to perform

506
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,100
before Princess Xueying.

507
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,140
And now that Princess Xuelu is dancing,

508
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,460
everyone is amazed by her skills.

509
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,580
Amazed? By what?

510
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,180
I think

511
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,660
Bai Xuelu must have bribed them

512
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,740
and deliberately created a scene

513
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,940
to embarrass Xueying.

514
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,020
Xueying is my friend,

515
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,740
and she shouldn't be treated unfairly

516
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,020
in matters like this.

517
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,380
She shouldn't
be bullied by her sister.

518
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,180
I have to intervene.

519
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,620
Where is Xueying?

520
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,260
So beautiful.

521
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,220
Star Gazer, Star Gazer.

522
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,180
Xueying is the Star Gazer.

523
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,380
Star Gazer.

524
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,180
Why are you here?

525
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,820
Xueying is the true Star Gazere.

526
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,780
Young Lady.

527
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,260
The Star Gazer
you have been eagerly awaiting

528
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,980
has heard your enthusiastic cheers!

529
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,980
Thank you, Bai Xuelu,

530
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,300
for an opening for Princess Xueying.

531
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,980
Xueying.

532
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,460
Come here.

533
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,020
Yan.

534
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,620
Listen to me.

535
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,180
I can't do it.

536
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
It's okay.

537
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,900
Yan...

538
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,700
Xueying, don't be afraid.

539
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,980
You can do it.

540
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,340
I believe in you.

541
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,460
Go for it.

542
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,740
Princess Xueying is so beautiful.
She's so lovely.

543
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,460
Nice!

544
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,500
The two princesses of the Bai family

545
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,500
have their own strengths.

546
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
The Dance of the Star Gazer

547
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,340
is a ceremonial dance

548
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,580
intended to pay respects to the gods.

549
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,500
So, one should be
sincere and humble while performing,

550
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,500
communicating only with the divine forces
of heaven and earth,

551
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,140
without excessive interaction
with other factors.

552
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,020
It is only with such intentions

553
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,580
that the dance could flow
as naturally as water.

554
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,020
Princess Xueying,

555
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,340
you truly understand

556
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,020
the meaning behind this dance.

557
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,820
The Star Gazer is Xueying!

558
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,820
Xueying,

559
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,580
that's great!

560
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,180
Yan.

561
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,180
Thank you.

562
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,980
Xueying!

563
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,540
Xueying, you are the Star Gazer.

564
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,300
That's fantastic!

565
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,712
(Ice Clan Hall, Western Sea Glacier)

566
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Kongsang has fallen into such a state,

567
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,740
(Sage, Ice Clan)
yet they still extravagantly prepare

568
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,620
(Sage, Ice Clan)
for the Star-gazing Ceremony.

569
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,780
(Wu Xian, Chief Sorcerer of Ice Clan)
Reporting to your excellency,

570
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,500
(Wu Xian, Chief Sorcerer of Ice Clan)
the people are ready.

571
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,860
Very good.

572
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,060
The Jiuyi Mountain

573
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,020
has the weakest security
due to the ceremony.

574
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,740
We must take advantage of this opportunity

575
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,420
and infiltrate the Emperor Valley.

576
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,500
Find the Ring of Houtu for me.

577
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,460
Yes.

578
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,300
As long as I obtain

579
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,980
the blessing of the Ring of Houtu,

580
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,620
this will be

581
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,860
your final ceremony.

582
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,900
After ten years,

583
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,460
there will be no more Kongsang.

584
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,100
Take a look.

585
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,220
It's so beautiful.

586
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,620
When my mother was still alive,

587
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,340
she specially hired skilled craftsmen

588
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,900
and spent three whole months

589
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,740
sewing it for me.

590
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,980
The purpose was that one day

591
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
I could wear it

592
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,940
and become a Star Gazer.

593
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,380
Indeed, it's magnificent.

594
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,740
Finally, your mother's wish

595
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,940
has been fulfilled.

596
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,220
That's right.

597
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,140
Little sister's dress alone

598
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,620
could easily overshadow me.

599
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,660
Bai Xuelu,

600
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,980
what are you up to?

601
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,060
Yan,

602
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,620
don't be so stingy.

603
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,660
You can play

604
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,140
with my sister's dress,

605
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,100
but even though
I'm her elder sister,

606
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,700
I can't even touch it.

607
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Princess Xuelu,

608
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,580
please don't call me Yan.

609
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
We're not that familiar.

610
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,140
Fine, Zhu Yan.

611
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,460
There's no need for you
to be so hostile toward me.

612
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,100
When I was watching
Xueying's performance,

613
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,900
I realized

614
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,940
I'm not as good as Xueying

615
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,780
in terms of background and skill.

616
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,260
I just wanted to see your dress.

617
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,060
I just wanted to imagine

618
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,580
how I would look wearing it.

619
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,860
Is that not allowed?

620
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,980
I'd be happy to oblige, elder sister.

621
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,020
I heard that this kind of silk

622
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,100
will produce a colorful haze

623
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,180
when it's illuminated by sunlight.

624
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Elder sister!

625
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,260
Princess Xuelu! Princess Xuelu!

626
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,100
Are you okay?

627
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,660
The dress.

628
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,740
My dress.

629
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,500
The dress.

630
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,700
What do we do now?

631
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,180
Yan.

632
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,540
What do we do now?

633
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,980
Bai Xuelu,

634
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,180
you did it on purpose!

635
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,820
How could I do it on purpose?

636
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,580
I almost fell myself.

637
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,940
Yan.

638
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,540
She didn't mean to.

639
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,100
In the end, it's all my fault

640
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
for not taking good care of the dress.

641
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,940
You...

642
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,260
This area below the mountain is
the forbidden land of the Emperor Valley.

643
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,740
Intruders will be killed.

644
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,940
If the dress has fallen down there,

645
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,860
it is lost forever.

646
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,940
The Star Gazer has lost her own dress.

647
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,500
What will she wear for the dance?

648
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
The dress

649
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,140
cannot be completed in a short time.

650
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,540
She can't just randomly pick a garment!

651
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,820
That will only make people mock her.

652
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,100
Moreover,

653
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,740
isn't it a grave mistake

654
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,180
now that the Star Gazer
has lost her dress?

655
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,220
She can't even

656
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
take care of her own dress.

657
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,340
How can we trust her as the lead dancer?

658
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,540
Princess Xueying.

659
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,500
Granny.

660
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
According to the ancestral rules,

661
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,020
you are indeed the Star Gazer.

662
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,380
However, they also have a good point.

663
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,180
Based on past precedents,

664
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
if the sacred dress is lost,

665
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,660
your qualification as the lead performer

666
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,620
will also be forfeited.

667
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,060
If you can't

668
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,940
come up with a solution

669
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,500
before the ritual ceremony begins,

670
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,420
then the position of the lead dancer

671
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,740
will have to be given to someone else.

672
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,980
Alright.

673
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,000
Xueying.

674
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,720
Mother.

675
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,340
(I must help Xueying)

676
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,460
(retrieve the dancing dress.)

677
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,300
The Star Gazer is
already within our grasp,

678
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,900
and attracting Prince Shi Yu

679
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,220
is also easily achievable.

680
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,060
Why isn't Young Lady happy?

681
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,180
Xueying is such a fool.

682
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,100
She really risked her life back there

683
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,180
to pull me up.

684
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,980
Are you feeling bad for her, Young Lady?

685
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Before going up the mountain,

686
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,580
we were determined to succeed.

687
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
She is the legitimate daughter
of the Bai family,

688
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,500
she is born to be

689
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,380
the first choice of
the Crown Princess.

690
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,140
But you, Princess...

691
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,940
Please forgive me, Princess.

692
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,820
I spoke out of turn.

693
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,060
I won't feel bad for her.

694
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,820
Stand up.

695
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,500
That person

696
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
doesn't have much time left in the palace.

697
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,220
The throne of Kongsang
has been empty for a long time,

698
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,540
and Father is deeply concerned

699
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,580
about the future of the Bai family.

700
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,180
If one day

701
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,780
I become the Crown Princess

702
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,100
and ascend to the throne,

703
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,860
let's see then

704
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,380
who would dare to question my background

705
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,420
and point fingers at me.

706
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,420
Yufei.

707
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,460
Yufei.

708
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,300
This knockout ink is indeed useful.

709
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,260
(Nameless Mountain Abode, The Emperor Valley)
She says one thing but means another,

710
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,420
and she has a honeyed tongue,

711
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,820
but she just talks

712
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,980
without any action.

713
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,620
Truly despicable.

714
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,740
Is that so?

715
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,180
But I think she's quite capable.

716
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,920
She managed to keep you occupied

717
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,360
from noon until now.

718
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,540
Ying,

719
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,540
does that mean

720
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,140
you admire her?

721
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,340
It's burnt.

722
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,980
My beauty lotion!

723
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,420
Oh no.

724
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,140
Hurry!

725
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:39,380
(The Emperor Valley)

726
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,780
(The Emperor Valley.)

727
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,180
(The High Priest of Grand Preceptor
has talked)

728
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,340
(about The Emperor Valley.)

729
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,420
(It is the tomb of the emperors
and empresses throughout history.)

730
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,240
(It is guarded by Empress Bai Wei's)

731
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,420
(Ring of Houtu.)

732
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,380
(It is strictly forbidden to trespass.)

733
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,260
(Those who dare
to enter will never return.)

734
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,140
I've seen Chong Ming,

735
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,540
it's not that scary.

736
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,500
Besides,

737
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,660
isn't the Ring of Houtu

738
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,180
just guarding Kongsang?

739
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,660
How could it kill people?

740
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,300
All places in this world

741
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,700
that have names are accessible to all.

742
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,620
I don't believe

743
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,180
that trespassers will die.

744
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,100
Please, please,

745
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,860
please, my lords.

746
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,980
Who's there?

747
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,220
You can't see me. You can't see me.

748
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,660
Such beautiful flowers.

749
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,460
It is said that in The Emperor Valley,

750
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,220
there is the most brilliant
suspended lake in the world,

751
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,940
the Starry Lake.

752
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,620
Could it be that

753
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,100
I unintentionally

754
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,140
came to the shore of the lake?

755
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,100
It's mist-filled here.

756
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Where is the Starry Lake?

757
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,140
The dancing dress.

758
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,340
So,

759
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,540
this is Starry Lake.

760
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,500
Just now,

761
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,340
that was the wind-manipulating technique.

762
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,940
Lord Immortal Official.

763
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,820
Do you live in The Emperor Valley?

764
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,500
You are Chong Ming's

765
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,380
divine friend, right?

766
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,220
I finally found you.

767
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,380
(So she is)

768
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
(the woman Chong Ming mentioned.)

769
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,780
I am Zhu Yan,

770
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,900
the Princess of the Crimson Clan.

771
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,300
I am also a practitioner of magic,

772
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,860
and I am honored to be
in the same field as you.

773
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,420
(Zhu Yan?)

774
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,300
(Isn't her
the Crimson Clan's princess I met)

775
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,340
(back in the Helu Garden?)

776
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,540
I want to ask

777
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,420
if there is really a spell

778
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,020
in this world

779
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,740
to gather the primordial spirit?

780
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,940
(Her passion for magic)

781
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,980
(hasn't changed a bit.)

782
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,780
Why aren't you speaking?

783
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,940
Could it be that

784
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,020
you can't speak?

785
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,380
Oh my,

786
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,860
he can't hear me too.

787
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,820
What a pity.

788
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,660
He looks so beautiful,

789
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,060
and his aura is quite extraordinary.

790
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,700
But Crown Prince is different.

791
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,100
They say he is
blessed by the divine spirit.

792
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,420
He is radiant like the sun and the moon.

793
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,380
He will surely understand my thoughts.

794
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,140
(Her personality hasn't changed either.)

795
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,060
Divine Bird Chong Ming?

796
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,260
You can transform into a human?

797
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,940
You really met a woman.

798
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,820
Could she be your...

799
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,820
What am I to him?

800
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Why are you not killing her?
