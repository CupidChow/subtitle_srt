00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:58,168
Your Highness, don't worry.

20
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,207
His Highness has only
suffered a minor wound.

21
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:01,528
Nothing serious.

22
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:03,648
I think it'll heal

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,047
in a few days.

24
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:09,847
I got it.

25
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:10,768
You may take your leave now.

26
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,048
Does it hurt?

27
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:30,847
It hurts like hell.

28
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:32,847
It's my fault for being careless.

29
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,847
That day, after receiving the instructions

30
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:36,208
from you and Uncle,

31
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,208
I wanted to go scouting alone,

32
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:40,768
but I didn't expect to be seriously
injured when I mistakenly entered

33
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,167
the hunting ground.

34
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:45,368
Is that so?

35
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:50,447
I missed you every day

36
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,048
and wanted to come back,

37
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,208
but I never had the chance.

38
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:54,648
Now

39
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:56,727
I can spend time with you.

40
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,727
Consort Qing, Prince Shi Yu,

41
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,208
Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain has arrived.

42
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:04,567
He said he's here
to visit Prince Shi Yu.

43
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,328
Ying is here.

44
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:16,407
It's okay.

45
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,488
If you want to see him,

46
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,088
go ahead.

47
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:22,407
I can't stop you anyway.

48
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:24,088
However,

49
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:26,287
let me put this upfront.

50
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,368
You're seriously injured.

51
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:30,968
Promise me

52
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:32,887
you'll take your medicine on time.

53
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:57,928
Go to imperial physician
and check it out.

54
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,567
If Yu's medicine is ready,

55
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,127
bring it to me first

56
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:03,768
before serving it to him.

57
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:05,048
Yes.

58
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,607
You can never imagine

59
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,008
that my Gu Poison

60
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:46,807
has to be met with spiritual power

61
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:47,847
before it can take effect.

62
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,088
Is this spiritual power?

63
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:20,287
Ying,

64
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:21,648
I don't feel any pain anymore.

65
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:23,727
How is that possible?

66
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:24,528
Really.

67
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:25,568
It doesn't hurt anymore.

68
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:28,847
Don't move.

69
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:29,407
Lie down.

70
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,367
You've suffered a serious injury.

71
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,287
You'll need some time

72
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,247
to recover.

73
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,968
Take this spiritual pearl,

74
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,287
it contains my spiritual power.

75
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,568
When you're in pain,

76
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,448
put the spiritual pearl
in the palm of your hand,

77
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,807
and the spiritual power
will ease the pain.

78
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,167
Thank you, Ying.

79
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:56,008
With this,

80
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,088
I really don't feel any pain.

81
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:58,487
Yu,

82
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,487
there are rarely any beasts in Ye City.

83
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:02,807
How can there be any hunters?

84
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,487
If you have a problem,

85
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:06,968
you can write to me.

86
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:08,727
Why hurt yourself?

87
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,208
I've been making up
this lie for a long time,

88
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:14,287
but you've blown it.

89
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:17,247
I just don't want to

90
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,008
stay in the army anymore.

91
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,008
I want to come back sooner.

92
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:19,888
But...

93
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:21,648
It's not true that I was assassinated,

94
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,088
but it's true that I'm injured.

95
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,568
Please be compassionate to me, Ying.

96
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,487
And withdraw the army on my behalf.

97
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,768
If you don't agree,

98
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,487
then I'll have to leave it
to Bai Fenglin.

99
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,768
Qing Gang is a man of integrity.

100
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:38,727
Why won't you entrust it to him?

101
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,847
After all, Ye City is
the White Clan's territory.

102
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,768
Qing Gang is a warrior
of the Azure Clan.

103
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,487
Bai Fenglin won't listen to him.

104
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:47,448
Ying,

105
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,888
withdrawal is a big deal for Kongsang.

106
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,568
It concerns millions of people.

107
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:53,727
Please promise me

108
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:54,968
for the sake of the people.

109
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:58,688
Why are you asking me

110
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,008
when you've already figured it out?

111
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,528
I promise you.

112
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,128
Consort Qing has arrived.

113
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:12,607
Be careful.

114
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,528
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
so you're here too.

115
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:22,807
It so happens

116
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:23,847
that I've asked imperial physician

117
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:25,167
to decoct some medicine for Yu.

118
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:29,528
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
please help him to drink it.

119
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:37,247
Ying,

120
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,128
I'm better now.

121
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:38,727
I can drink it myself.

122
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:40,247
No way!

123
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:41,047
Don't touch it!

124
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,847
The medicine bowl is poisoned.

125
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:03,167
Mother,

126
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:04,568
could it be you?

127
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:05,367
Shut up.

128
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:06,607
Mother,

129
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,688
do you think I'm three years old?

130
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:09,047
Yu,

131
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,847
I have offended a lot of
people in the palace

132
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,448
by entering the palace
without a clue some time ago.

133
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,047
It's possible that some of them

134
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,487
have a grudge against me

135
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:19,128
and want to harm me.

136
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,208
Speak.

137
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:34,048
Who is trying to harm Yu?

138
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,007
You won't speak, will you?

139
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:38,647
Aren't you afraid

140
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:39,887
I'll punish you with
nine familial exterminations?

141
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:03,088
Yu.

142
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:04,808
Ying,

143
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:06,727
don't try to comfort me anymore.

144
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:37,168
Young Lady,

145
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:38,328
you've been sitting here

146
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,367
all night with a glum face

147
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,208
since you got back.

148
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,208
Yufei,

149
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:45,968
you've come just in time.

150
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,088
I've got a lot to tell you.

151
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:50,328
Come on.

152
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:51,168
Sit down.

153
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,247
I really can't figure out

154
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,527
why Master gave up his priesthood.

155
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:57,968
Priest of Grand Preceptor
is definitely going to

156
00:09:58,048 --> 00:09:59,088
rejoin the mundane world

157
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,688
and resume his position
as the Crown Prince.

158
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,328
Young Lady, don't you know

159
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,367
the rumor has already spread widely?

160
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:05,208
They say

161
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,928
that Prince Shi Yu is too gentle

162
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,527
to protect Kongsang,

163
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,208
while Priest of Grand Preceptor
is decisive

164
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,007
and always puts
the people's well-being first.

165
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,847
He is the best person
for the Crown Prince.

166
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:15,048
Nonsense.

167
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,847
My master doesn't care about that.

168
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,887
I believe Priest of Grand Preceptor

169
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,448
won't want to fight
for power for himself.

170
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,208
But

171
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,607
he's a man who's willing
to compromise himself

172
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:23,887
for the sake of the people.

173
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,088
Now that

174
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,808
the war between Kongsang
and Merfolk is over.

175
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,007
It's not far from the day
when the people

176
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:30,968
will live and work in peace.

177
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:32,847
It's not that simple.

178
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:34,168
Even if there's no marine force,

179
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,367
there's still the Ice Clan.

180
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:36,847
Maybe they'll come back

181
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,647
to attack us again.

182
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,247
Everyone's worried about this.

183
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,808
And didn't you just say

184
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,168
that Priest of Grand Preceptor read
the congratulatory wedding scroll today?

185
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:47,527
I don't think

186
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,808
it's because he doesn't want to

187
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:49,928
lose face in front of you.

188
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,048
He must be

189
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,247
planning for the future.

190
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,328
After all, every emperor of Kongsang

191
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:55,968
has to marry a woman of the White Clan.

192
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:56,887
Stop the nonsense.

193
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,127
The more you talk,
the more ridiculous it gets.

194
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,688
I was told to pass this to you.

195
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:12,448
It's from Xueying.

196
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:16,568
(Yan, I have something to tell you.
Let's meet at the Yulu Teahouse at noon.)

197
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:21,577
(White King's Residence)

198
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,288
This is where the most
important commands of Kongsang

199
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:30,968
are sent.

200
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:33,887
Ying,

201
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,487
you're finally back here.

202
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,007
Your Supreme Majesty,

203
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:40,487
I'm entrusted with the task by Yu.

204
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,688
Although Yu's injury is not serious,

205
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,767
he needs some time to recuperate.

206
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:46,808
But the withdrawal of the army

207
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,208
is imminent

208
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,168
and we can't wait any longer

209
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:52,247
so I have to take care of
this matter for the time being.

210
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,328
You're the best man for the task.

211
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:57,887
Although Qing Gang and Bai Fenglin

212
00:11:58,288 --> 00:11:59,328
are the top generals

213
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,048
in their clans,

214
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,727
they don't get along.

215
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:05,288
If the withdrawal of the army
is entrusted to them,

216
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,448
they might constrain each other

217
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,607
and lead to chaos.

218
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:10,928
Ying,

219
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:12,088
withdrawal of the army

220
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,367
is an important matter for Kongsang.

221
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,208
It concerns the safety of the people.

222
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,607
You must do your best.

223
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,527
Don't ever let me down.

224
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:23,527
I know the responsibility is heavy

225
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:24,808
and I will do my best.

226
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,048
After Yu recovers,

227
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,328
I'll return the military power to him.

228
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,247
Have you found out who the Sage

229
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,767
behind the Ice Clan is?

230
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,727
The real mastermind behind the Ice Clan

231
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,928
is indeed Emperor Xingzun.

232
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:48,808
Emperor Xingzun, Lang Gan?

233
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:50,767
Is it true?

234
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,247
I saw it with my own eyes.

235
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:54,127
That day,

236
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:55,767
I left with Wu Xian.

237
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,247
I never expected

238
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,487
that Emperor Xingzun

239
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:06,328
would end up like this

240
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,767
because of his obsession.

241
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:09,767
Since ancient times, no emperor

242
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,727
can escape the trials of love.

243
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:16,448
Ying,

244
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,568
the Ice Clan's crisis has been resolved.

245
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:20,847
All that's left is the marine force.

246
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:25,408
You've been entrusted with
this task at a short notice.

247
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,208
The peace of Kongsang is in your hands.

248
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,247
You mustn't let us down.

249
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,328
When this is over,

250
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,247
you will be honored
in the history of Yunhuang

251
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:36,887
for centuries.

252
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,607
I don't care

253
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:40,767
about fame.

254
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:42,767
I only care about

255
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,288
the things

256
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,448
my mother taught me when I was little,

257
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,607
my duty to heaven and earth,

258
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,759
to the people, to my family.

259
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:57,408
You mean

260
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,448
you want to take Xueying away

261
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,247
and leave the position of
Crown Prince to my master?

262
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:03,847
Yes.

263
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,208
Won't Consort Qing find out

264
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,048
if you sneak out of the palace?

265
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:11,968
I've got it all arranged.

266
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:13,968
By the time my mother finds out,

267
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,928
Xueying and I will be long gone.

268
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:19,408
I've told my father

269
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,288
I'll go to spend some time
in the temple.

270
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:22,568
It so happens

271
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:23,847
that High Priest of Grand Preceptor,
Priest of Grand Preceptor

272
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,568
and Qing Gang are all
living in my house now.

273
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,288
My father is too busy with them

274
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:28,607
to notice us.

275
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:32,408
I don't think

276
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,088
this is a good idea.

277
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,847
It will put you both in danger.

278
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,288
Is there no other way?

279
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:40,727
If I don't leave,

280
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:42,607
my mother will kill my brother

281
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,487
for the position of Crown Prince.

282
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,367
More importantly,

283
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:48,408
I don't want to let
the people of Kongsang

284
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,487
and Xueying down.

285
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,367
I have the same thoughts as Yu.

286
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,568
Instead of being a Crown Prince
and a Crown Princess,

287
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:02,607
we would rather be a couple who share
our happiness and sorrows.

288
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:07,568
We're relieved to leave
Kongsang in the hands

289
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:08,847
of Priest of Grand Preceptor.

290
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,208
The marine force's base camp is located

291
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,968
at Mirror Lake, just outside of Ye City.

292
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:16,767
It's closest to the Azure Clan's troops.

293
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:18,367
General Qing,

294
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,847
you need to send more men
to keep an eye

295
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,288
on the marine force.

296
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:24,487
Your troops

297
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,487
can delay withdrawal for two days.

298
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:28,288
Yes.

299
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:31,727
General Bai,

300
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,088
your troops as the main force

301
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,568
will be withdrawn immediately.

302
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,088
Immediate withdrawal?

303
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,647
I'm afraid

304
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,168
my soldiers in Ye City

305
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,808
won't obey your order.

306
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,448
General Bai, what do you mean?

307
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,208
Priest of Grand Preceptor is here
to be the military governor.

308
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,408
All troops must obey his orders,

309
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,767
and all soldiers in Ye City

310
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,048
are no exception.

311
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:05,808
Don't misunderstand me.

312
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:08,367
I'm not against you.

313
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,767
It's just that my soldiers in Ye City

314
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,647
are all hardcore.

315
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,527
They only recognise competence,

316
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:15,727
not rank.

317
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,928
They've always obeyed me

318
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,328
because I've known Merfolk's habits

319
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,727
from years of

320
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,367
dealing with the marine force.

321
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,928
Though your magic techniques
are outstanding,

322
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,808
you've been in isolation
in Jiuyi Mountain

323
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:31,887
since you were a child,

324
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,127
and you only killed
a few hundred Merfolk

325
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:39,527
in Huotu Tribe,

326
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,247
so it's really hard for me to convince

327
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,448
my soldiers to obey your orders
without a doubt.

328
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:44,887
How dare you defy the military governor?

329
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:47,887
General Qing,

330
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,647
don't exaggerate it.

331
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,847
I'm not allowed to tell the truth

332
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,367
by the laws of Kongsang?

333
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:58,088
Besides,

334
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:00,647
Ye City

335
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:03,808
is my territory.

336
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,567
General Qing,

337
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,287
you're not trying to
overpower me, are you?

338
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,208
General Bai's right.

339
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:14,408
If I want the troops to obey me,

340
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,007
I must have some real skills.

341
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:38,087
What is this?

342
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:41,888
General Bai,

343
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:44,287
you claimed to know Merfolk well,

344
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:45,408
but you don't even know

345
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:46,727
their best technique,

346
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:47,928
Water-manipulating Spell.

347
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:01,738
(White King's Residence)

348
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,567
(How did I get here?)

349
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,208
(It so happens)

350
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,928
(that High Priest of Grand Preceptor,
Priest of Grand Preceptor and Qing Gang)

351
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:11,928
(are all living in my house now.)

352
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:15,928
(No one but Kongsang's safety)

353
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:18,327
(can sway Master's heart)

354
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,448
(and make him give up his priesthood.)

355
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,087
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

356
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,767
You're here to see
Priest of Grand Preceptor, right?

357
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,287
You'd better go back.

358
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,608
Priest of Grand Preceptor is busy with

359
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,688
the truce and withdrawal of the army.

360
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,648
Don't disturb him.

361
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:49,287
I...

362
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,007
Greetings, Princess Xuelu.

363
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:00,567
Your Supreme Majesty,

364
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:03,168
I'm sending some refreshments to Ying.

365
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:06,567
Go ahead.

366
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,128
Didn't you say that Master
is busy with important affairs

367
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:15,128
and can't be disturbed?

368
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,247
Why could Bai Xuelu enter?

369
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,368
You still don't get it?

370
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,007
Ying is going to be the Crown Prince

371
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,888
and ascends to the throne in the future.

372
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:25,648
According to the custom,

373
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:27,487
he must marry

374
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:28,928
a princess of the White Clan.

375
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:31,928
Not to mention

376
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:33,448
the fact that Kongsang

377
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,648
is in a state of turmoil.

378
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,208
Ying needs the forces

379
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,848
of the White Clan too.

380
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:40,408
But back then,

381
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,968
it was because Bai Xuelu lied to me

382
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:45,208
that Master was attacked
by the Ice Clan at Nvluo Creek

383
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:46,727
and almost lost his life.

384
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:48,968
I knew about that.

385
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,287
Times have changed.

386
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:54,648
Right now, Ying needs Bai Xuelu
more than anything else.

387
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,888
You're a princess

388
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,087
and the future chief of your clan,

389
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:00,807
so you should know what's at stake

390
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,287
and learn to
take the big picture into account.

391
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:05,848
Anyway,

392
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,767
does my master agree?

393
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,327
Whether he agrees or not,

394
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,408
come with me and you'll see.

395
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:22,928
You've got a lot on your plate.

396
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:24,567
Here are some pastries

397
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,807
I've prepared for you.

398
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:30,087
One of them

399
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:31,648
is the Crown Prince,

400
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,208
and the other is the Crown Princess.

401
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,448
They are a match made in heaven.

402
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:37,448
Before that,

403
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,448
the timing wasn't right,

404
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:41,047
and there was
some disagreement between them.

405
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:44,807
Now that Ying will
soon return to his place.

406
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:46,567
The two of them

407
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,928
are committed to each other,

408
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,408
so they have a tacit understanding of each other.

409
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:05,688
Zhu Yan,

410
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,767
you're no longer a kid.

411
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:11,047
You should be sensible

412
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:13,968
and stop bothering
your master in the future.

413
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,247
Got it?

414
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:23,368
Let the servants

415
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,608
serve the refreshments from now on.

416
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:26,888
You don't have to come anymore.

417
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:32,327
Are today's pastries

418
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:33,688
not to your liking?

419
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:38,608
I'm going out.

420
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:47,327
I'm a little hungry.

421
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,327
I'll eat the pastries.

422
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:56,487
Cuihe.

423
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:03,928
You may leave now.

424
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,928
General Qing, are you trying
to help me out?

425
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:11,608
Well, you'd better think it over.

426
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:13,408
There's going to be

427
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,527
more and more scenes like this.

428
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,128
Is what you want

429
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,567
really worth such a trade?

430
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,368
You know that Priest of Grand Preceptor
doesn't fancy you.

431
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,128
Since I've chosen this path,

432
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:32,608
I know

433
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:34,727
what's going to happen.

434
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:36,448
General Qing, please

435
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:39,208
don't underestimate my tolerance.

436
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:43,047
I have never underestimated you.

437
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:44,727
I'm just...

438
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,727
I just can't bear to

439
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:51,327
see you stoop.

440
00:22:55,928 --> 00:22:57,527
General Qing, thank you
for you kind intention.

441
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:00,007
I'll follow

442
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,168
the path I've chosen.

443
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,247
If I give up halfway,

444
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,720
I'll definitely regret it.

445
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:27,928
Yan'er.

446
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:35,208
Yan'er.

447
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,727
What brings you here?

448
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:37,807
I...

449
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,007
Master.

450
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:41,287
(You should be sensible)

451
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:42,688
(and stop bothering
your master in the future.)

452
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:46,368
I...

453
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,968
I'm here to look for Xueying.

454
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:51,247
She's not around.

455
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,128
So I'm taking a look around.

456
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,688
You look pale.

457
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,527
Are you not feeling well?

458
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,287
Yes.

459
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:03,368
I'm not feeling well.

460
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:05,007
I

461
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,327
might have eaten something bad.

462
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:11,087
Master, don't worry.

463
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:12,567
You shall get on with your work.

464
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,368
I'll just go home and rest.

465
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:16,567
Yan'er,

466
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,727
are you free tomorrow?

467
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:22,567
I'd like...

468
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:24,408
I'd like to ask you out for a walk.

469
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:27,247
Master,

470
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,608
you're asking me out?

471
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,047
There's something
I didn't finish last time,

472
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,168
and I want to tell you in person.

473
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:38,608
Okay.

474
00:24:41,168 --> 00:24:41,767
Well, Master,

475
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,368
I'll get going now.

476
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:44,968
You shall get on with your work.

477
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:46,408
Don't see me off.

478
00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:02,487
You're so smart.

479
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,368
You should know what to do.

480
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:10,527
What?

481
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,487
What other choice do you have?

482
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:17,368
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,
don't worry.

483
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:19,727
I'll give up everything,

484
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,087
for the position of Empress,

485
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,168
including my feelings.

486
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,567
I didn't mean to
ruin their relationship.

487
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:28,368
It's

488
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,007
Zhu Yan's fault for getting in my way.

489
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:48,567
Well,

490
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,287
you've been staring
at the window ever since

491
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,208
you met Zhu Yan.

492
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:54,408
Is there

493
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:56,448
a Zhu Yan on the window?

494
00:25:58,527 --> 00:25:59,408
Yan'er seemed

495
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,047
a bit upset today.

496
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:06,087
It's my fault.

497
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:06,807
It's all my fault.

498
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:08,848
I forgot to give you some tips.

499
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:11,287
I'm sure you didn't give

500
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:12,368
Zhu Yan a good impression

501
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,487
when you were on your last date.

502
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:15,527
This time,

503
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:17,327
she felt uneasy when she heard

504
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,688
you were asking her out again.

505
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:21,287
Well,

506
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,408
where would you like to go next?

507
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:26,848
I'll follow you.

508
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:28,727
I'll follow you.

509
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:30,408
Okay.

510
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:31,888
I'm going to find it.

511
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:33,608
So I won't waste your efforts

512
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:34,928
in fulfilling my wish.

513
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,007
Think about it.

514
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:37,767
When she went out with you,

515
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:39,448
did it seem like she was on a mission,

516
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:40,648
like when she did

517
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:42,208
her homework in the mountains?

518
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:48,688
In my opinion,

519
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,848
the biggest problem between you and her

520
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,487
is the title of master and disciple.

521
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:55,848
But I already

522
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:56,848
told her last time

523
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,968
to stop taking me as her master.

524
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:00,448
"But I already

525
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,408
told her last time

526
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,767
to stop taking me as her master."

527
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:03,648
Hear it out.

528
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,047
Didn't you still sound like a master

529
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,327
when you said that?

530
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,087
I know

531
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,567
you haven't had a crush
on anyone for a long time,

532
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,767
so it's not easy for you
to say something like that.

533
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:14,087
It's alright.

534
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:15,848
I'll teach you a couple of tricks.

535
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:17,527
Remember this.

536
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,567
This time, when you're
going out for a walk,

537
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:21,648
you should always think that

538
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:22,848
it's not Priest of Grand Preceptor

539
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:24,007
assigning homework

540
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:24,928
to his disciple, Zhu Yan,

541
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:27,168
but Ying Ying and Zhu Zhu

542
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:28,968
are having fun together.

543
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,368
You have to do things that lovers do.

544
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:35,767
For example,

545
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:36,848
if she likes a lively atmosphere,

546
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:39,047
you can start by treating her
to a storytelling.

547
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:39,928
Remember,

548
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,247
that must be a romantic story.

549
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:45,727
When Zhu Yan's heart flutters,

550
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,527
you can give her a jade pendant
and confess your love to her.

551
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:50,928
Jade pendant?

552
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:52,848
But would Yan'er

553
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:54,848
like something as common

554
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:55,648
as a jade pendant?

555
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:56,968
Besides,

556
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,327
I already gave her the Jade Bone

557
00:27:58,688 --> 00:27:59,408
last time.

558
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:02,608
Are you sure

559
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,247
you're the Crown Prince
who was born a god?

560
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,487
Are you sure you're
Priest of Grand Preceptor of Yunhuang?

561
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:07,807
Did you really achieve enlightenment?

562
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:09,327
I wasted my breath, didn't I?

563
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:11,087
Yes.

564
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:12,128
The Jade Bone

565
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:13,727
can only be owned by
the Empress of Kongsang.

566
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:14,848
But she doesn't know.

567
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:15,888
Think about it.

568
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,128
When you gave her
the Jade Bone last time,

569
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:19,688
was it like a master giving his disciple

570
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:20,928
a magic weapon when they're parting?

571
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:23,408
You have to let her know

572
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:24,487
that from now on,

573
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:25,968
you're a man and a woman,

574
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:27,487
not a master and a disciple.

575
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:31,527
I see.

576
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:37,567
Finally, my thousands of years
of idle theorizing

577
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:38,727
could be put to good use.

578
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,368
I can't laugh.

579
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:41,327
My wrinkles are coming out.

580
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,087
(It seems)

581
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,648
(Master's return to Jialan
is a foregone conclusion.)

582
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,567
(Master will no longer be my master,)

583
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,368
(but the Emperor of Yunhuang,)

584
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,327
(the people's guardian)

585
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:17,208
(and)

586
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,168
(Bai Xuelu's husband.)

587
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,327
(Why am I so sad?)

588
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:37,968
Young Lady,

589
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:39,128
look who I've brought with me.

590
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,087
You haven't seen each other
for a few days.

591
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,168
I brought Sumo to meet you.

592
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,648
Come on, sit down.

593
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:46,208
Young Lady,

594
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:47,688
what's wrong with you?

595
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,007
My master

596
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,527
asked me to go out with him
again tomorrow.

597
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,087
I was right about that.

598
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:56,608
Last time,
when Priest of Grand Preceptor

599
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:57,888
said he's giving up his priesthood,

600
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,087
he must have told you
only half of the story,

601
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:00,247
he's meeting you tomorrow

602
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,087
to tell you the rest.

603
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,767
After all, he's your master.

604
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,007
If he's going to become
the Crown Prince again,

605
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,327
he'll have to give you an explanation.

606
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:09,168
It's a real blessing for Kongsang.

607
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:10,968
Stop guessing.

608
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,648
Tell the keeper

609
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:15,327
to get the carriage ready.

610
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:17,087
Yes.

611
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:22,287
(It seems)

612
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:25,208
(that Master's return to
the position of the Crown Prince)

613
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,408
(is both inevitable)

614
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,648
(and the wish of the people.)

615
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:35,287
Sister,

616
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:37,727
why are you unhappy?

617
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,287
This is for you.

618
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:41,368
My mother used to say

619
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,327
that having sugar in your mouth

620
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:45,208
makes your heart less bitter.

621
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:48,368
Sumo,

622
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,087
I can't believe you initiated
talking to me.

623
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,047
What book are you reading?

624
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:05,327
It's a book of magic techniques.

625
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:08,287
My master wrote it to me.

626
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,368
The one

627
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:12,848
who's going to be
the Crown Prince again?

628
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:15,448
Yes.

629
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,368
Don't you want him
to be the Crown Prince again?

630
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:26,047
My master is talented,

631
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,327
his magic techniques are second to none,

632
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,527
and he's the chosen one.

633
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:36,208
My thoughts don't matter.

634
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:38,888
Magic techniques are second to none?

635
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:07,128
Master.

636
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:10,767
Yan'er, you're here.

637
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:12,527
Have a seat.

638
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,408
I've been to this store before.

639
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,327
It should be very crowded right now.

640
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:28,928
Why are we the only ones here?

641
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,727
We didn't get to see the puppet show

642
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:32,648
the last time we wanted to.

643
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:33,688
So

644
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:35,247
I found the stall owner

645
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:36,247
and convinced him

646
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:37,968
to play another one

647
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:39,247
just for you and me.

648
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:44,047
Mister, Miss,

649
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:45,727
what play would you like to watch?

650
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:46,727
Do you want to watch

651
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:48,327
"Tales of the Righteous Demon"
from ten years ago?

652
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:49,327
(Remember,)

653
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:51,567
(that must be a romantic story.)

654
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:55,648
Boss,

655
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,408
we don't want to watch that play today.

656
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:58,527
We'll watch

657
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:00,807
"Emperor Xingzun and Bai Wei's Betrothal".

658
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:02,208
Alright.

659
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,688
A moment please.

660
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,928
(I can't believe
Master chose this play.)

661
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:09,287
(Is he hinting at me?)

662
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,408
As everyone knows,

663
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:13,767
seven thousand years ago,

664
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,208
Emperor Xingzun and Empress Bai Wei

665
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:19,928
reunited the scattered
Six Clans of Yunhuang

666
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:23,168
and banished the Ice Clan
to Northern Plains

667
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,287
and became a legend.

668
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:26,928
And because of Emperor Xingzun's

669
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:28,487
deep love for Bai Wei,

670
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:30,648
he made a vow.

671
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,007
Never to be parted from one another

672
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:43,408
for eternity.

673
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,247
Is it because of the oath
between Emperor Xingzun

674
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:47,928
and Empress Bai Wei

675
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,648
that future emperor can only marry

676
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,567
a woman with the surname Bai?

677
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:53,527
Yes.

678
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:55,208
That's how much Emperor Xingzun

679
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,408
loved Bai Wei.

680
00:33:58,087 --> 00:33:59,007
Eternally in love

681
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:00,688
with only one woman.

682
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:10,167
(Eternally in love with only one woman.)

683
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:12,567
(Why do I feel like crying?)

684
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:15,487
(It must be because
I haven't been able to adapt)

685
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,167
(to the change in Master's identity.)

686
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:18,567
(No.)

687
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:20,448
(I can't show it.)

688
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:21,647
(Or I'll affect Master's mood.)

689
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,007
Yan'er.

690
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:33,848
That's a great play.

691
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,248
(Chong Ming's idea really works.)

692
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,339
(Hefeng Storytelling Store)

693
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:01,487
Yan'er,

694
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:02,527
what's wrong?

695
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:03,808
You look like

696
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:05,167
you've got something on your mind.

697
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:08,328
Nothing.

698
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,527
I'm just remembering the play.

699
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,007
(When Zhu Yan's heart flutters,)

700
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,968
(you can give her a jade pendant
and confess your love to her.)

701
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:20,487
Yan'er,

702
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:22,888
Ling Long Pavilion is just ahead.

703
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:24,167
I heard

704
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:25,448
that they have

705
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:26,888
the best jewellery in Kongsang.

706
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,448
Why don't we go there

707
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:31,368
and pick up some jewellery?

708
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:34,007
You know

709
00:35:34,888 --> 00:35:36,968
I seldom get in touch with women

710
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:38,888
and I don't know their thoughts,

711
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:40,167
so

712
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:41,928
I don't know what to pick.

713
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:45,047
(Master wants me to pick out something)

714
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,527
(for him to give to Bai Xuelu.)

715
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:49,328
Yan'er,

716
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:50,527
what's wrong?

717
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:53,728
(I can't share Master's worries.)

718
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:56,848
(This is the only thing I can do
to help him.)

719
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:58,248
(I must do it well.)

720
00:35:58,888 --> 00:35:59,408
Okay.

721
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:12,768
Please have a look.

722
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:30,928
This is good.

723
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,047
I'll get this then.

724
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,248
You two have good taste.

725
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:36,288
This is the perfect

726
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:37,768
jade pendant for betrothal.

727
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:18,207
- Yan'er.
- Master.

728
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:21,607
Go ahead.

729
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:23,368
I...

730
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:27,768
I suddenly recalled

731
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,408
that I have something urgent
to do at home.

732
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:30,647
I have to go now.

733
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,368
Well, I'll take you home.

734
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:35,527
It's alright.

735
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,167
I can go back on my own.

736
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:45,687
Madam, thank you.

737
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:46,607
It's alright.

747
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:28,167
How's it?

748
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:30,607
Isn't Zhu Yan happy?

749
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:35,487
I don't know why

750
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,408
Yan'er left when she saw me buy this.

751
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:39,848
I went after her,

752
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:41,368
but I couldn't catch up with her.

753
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:45,007
That's a good thing.

754
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:46,728
Think about it.

755
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,888
Zhu Yan must have guessed your intention

756
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:51,087
so she's shy.

757
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,647
That's how girls are.

758
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,607
Let her calm down for a few days

759
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:04,768
before you confess your love to her.

760
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:05,808
When the time comes,

761
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,047
it will definitely work.

762
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:13,087
Princess,

763
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:14,647
Princess Zhu Yan has arrived.

764
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:26,408
This is...

765
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:30,167
You like this jade pendant?

766
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,687
This is the jade pendant
of Ling Long Pavilion.

767
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,567
I got it yesterday.

768
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:38,848
This is the only one in the world.
Rare, isn't it?

769
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,848
(As expected, Master gave it to her.)

770
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:45,207
(I didn't expect Master
to give it to her so quickly.)

771
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:46,848
You're

772
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:48,928
always reluctant to get along with me.

773
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,567
What brings you here today?

774
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:57,928
My master gave you this jade pendant?

775
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,368
So you're here to ask about

776
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:01,408
this jade pendant.

777
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:04,448
You must be clear about this.

778
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:06,607
You're just his disciple.

779
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:08,808
You must follow the rules
and behave properly.

780
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:10,047
You mustn't cross the line.

781
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,248
You can say whatever you want

782
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:15,527
about me,

783
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:17,007
as long as

784
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:23,768
you treat my master well in the future.

785
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:27,288
Since I've bet on him,

786
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:29,774
I'm going to be nice to him.

787
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,647
Thank you then.

788
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:09,087
Yan'er.
