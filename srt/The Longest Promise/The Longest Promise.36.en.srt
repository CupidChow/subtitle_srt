19
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,849
Zhu Yan,

20
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,608
after Ying's soul stabilizes
in three days,

21
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:02,968
what are your plans?

22
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,808
Your Supreme Majesty,
please rest assured.

23
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,569
I'll leave him.

24
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,608
In this lifetime,

25
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,208
we shall never meet again.

26
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:20,608
Zhu Yan...

27
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:25,608
I'm the cursed lady for him.

28
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,409
I have already caused him to die once.

29
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,809
How could I dare to stay by his side,

30
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,009
causing him pain,

31
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,969
injury,

32
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:39,888
or even death again?

33
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,168
The feeling of watching

34
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:46,608
the most important person

35
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,448
slowly dying

36
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,529
in my hands.

37
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:55,089
Experiencing it once

38
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:57,928
in a lifetime is enough.

39
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:03,648
Very well.

40
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,289
Once Ying's soul returns,

41
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,328
he'll forget everything that happened

42
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:11,608
within these three days.

43
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,048
At that time,

44
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:15,488
you should do

45
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,048
what we discussed today

46
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,129
and leave the mountain alone.

47
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,168
All right.

48
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,849
Did you see anything just now?

49
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:50,249
Your Highness,

50
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,168
I didn't see anything.

51
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:33,328
Who are you?

52
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:34,809
What is this place?

53
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:37,648
You're finally awake.

54
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:54,968
What time is it now?

55
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:56,369
Why am I here

56
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,408
when it's Father's birthday celebration?

57
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:01,528
This letter is for you.

58
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:03,768
For me?

59
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,589
(To Shi Ying)

60
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:17,729
(Ying,)

61
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:19,929
(when you killed the Sea Emperor,)

62
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,648
(you were accidentally hit
by the Merfolk's spell.)

63
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,208
(Your spiritual power
was temporarily sealed,)

64
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,369
(and your memories
are in a state of confusion.)

65
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,369
(You should stay in the mountains
and rest quietly for several days.)

66
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:28,929
(You'll naturally recover
and be perfectly fine.)

67
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,848
The High Priest has gone to Jialan

68
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,328
to report to His Majesty

69
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,288
about the uprising
of the Merfolk marine force

70
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:37,489
that you've ended.

71
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,968
The Merfolk marine force revolted?

72
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:42,768
That's right.

73
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:45,328
The High Priest asked me
to take good care of you.

74
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,328
So just nurse yourself back to health

75
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,408
in Jiuyi Mountain without worries.

76
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:49,729
There is no need to be concerned.

77
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:56,249
Then who are you?

78
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:57,689
Me?

79
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:00,448
I'm your maidservant.

80
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,569
You're my maidservant?

81
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:08,929
How come

82
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,408
I've never seen you before?

83
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,328
I came after His Majesty's birthday.

84
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,009
I guess you have forgotten about me.

85
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,288
Your Highness, you must be thirsty.

86
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:22,848
I'll go and get you some water.

87
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:24,848
You just regained your consciousness.

88
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,369
Don't exert yourself too much.

89
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,049
Thank you.

90
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:48,648
(That's odd.)

91
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:50,249
(What's wrong with me?)

92
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,968
(I can't tell if it's cold or hot.)

93
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:54,528
(You should also guard)

94
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,129
(against the infiltration of the energy
from the realm in-between.)

95
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,249
The damage

96
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,288
caused by it is serious.

97
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:02,328
It can bring you

98
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:04,929
unforeseen and immeasurable aftereffects.

99
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,288
(Sight, sound, smell, taste,
and touch, the five senses.)

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,208
(The first step is losing
the sense of touch.)

101
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,009
(Could this be the aftereffect
of the enery from the realm in-between?)

102
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:28,809
Your Highness,

103
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,129
your water is here.

104
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,249
You scalded your hand.

105
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,408
It's okay.

106
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,249
Wait here.

107
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:55,049
Let me help you apply this ointment.

108
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,288
That's weird.

109
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:12,088
How did I know this ointment

110
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:14,009
was in that box?

111
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,288
You probably have forgotten.

112
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,609
You used to stay
at Jiuyi Mountain frequently.

113
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:20,569
See?

114
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,049
This is your residence.

115
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:24,528
Your wardrobe is over there.

116
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:25,689
Inside

117
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,088
are all the clothes you usually wear.

118
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:28,689
Follow me.

119
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:44,249
No wonder

120
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,489
the furnishings in this place

121
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,089
match my preferences perfectly.

122
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:57,648
Your Highness,

123
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,449
do you wish to bathe and change clothes?

124
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:01,768
Yes.

125
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,209
Then you should step aside.

126
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,168
(If I leave Master by himself here,)

127
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,329
(what if he discovers)

128
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,489
(something amiss again?)

129
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:12,528
(It could disrupt his memories)

130
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,648
(and eventually extinguish his soul. )

131
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:19,489
Absolutely not.

132
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:22,729
I was the one who assisted you

133
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,009
in washing and grooming.

134
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,449
It's my responsibility.

135
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,768
The knot in front is not loosened.

136
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:46,969
I...

137
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:49,688
Let me do it myself.

138
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,089
Okay.

139
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,849
Then I'll help you prepare

140
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,009
the washing items.

141
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,648
You're not my maidservant.

142
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:46,568
Because there would never be

143
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,928
such a clumsy maidservant in the palace.

144
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,209
Who are you really?

145
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:08,209
Why do you

146
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,168
insist on staying by my side?

147
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:15,609
I have a feeling

148
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:17,408
that we're more than just a simple

149
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,129
master-servant relationship.

150
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,209
(Oh, no.)

151
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,009
(Master's soul fire is changing.)

152
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,089
(Could it be that he's remembering
the scene at Cangwu Abyss?)

153
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,249
I don't know why,

154
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,209
but this scene feels familiar.

155
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:56,089
Your Highness, you guessed it right.

156
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,768
I'm not your maidservant.

157
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,528
I've done you wrong

158
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,609
in the past.

159
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,568
Since then, I couldn't face you.

160
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,129
When I heard

161
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,089
that you was injured

162
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:14,209
and needed someone to take care of you,

163
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,048
I hurried over

164
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,609
to make amends for my past mistakes.

165
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,768
Who exactly are you,

166
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:24,528
and what have you done to me?

167
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,768
Your Highness, since you have
lost your memory,

168
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,249
there's no need to dwell on the past.

169
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:35,849
Even if I were to tell you,

170
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,568
you wouldn't remember.

171
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:39,768
The moment

172
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:41,568
you regain your memory,

173
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,489
you'll surely despise me.

174
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,009
When that time comes,

175
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,609
there will be no need
to bring up old matters.

176
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:33,648
Your Highness.

177
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,168
Thank you.

178
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,688
(Master has lost his memory.)

179
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,568
(I'm afraid he won't like)

180
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,849
(the tastes developed
in Jiuyi Mountain.)

181
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:49,489
(I should prepare)

182
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:50,888
(some food that the Crown Prince likes.)

183
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:52,928
(With an increased appetite,)

184
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,329
(Master can recover faster.)

185
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:01,288
Shi...

186
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:02,648
Shi...

187
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:10,888
Your Highness,

188
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:12,969
you're awake, huh?

189
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:18,688
Who are you?

190
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:19,969
Why do you look

191
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:20,729
so familiar?

192
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:22,288
He's Chong Ming,
the divine bird of the mountains.

193
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,609
He has crossed paths

194
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:25,808
with Your Highness before.

195
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:28,688
Nice to meet you.

196
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:31,928
Your Highness,

197
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:33,808
I'm the Grand Marshal Feng,

198
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,489
the leader of the Four Grand Marshals
in Jiuyi Mountain.

199
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,009
This morning, the High Priest

200
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:38,808
sent a message from Jialan.

201
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:40,729
His Majesty
has made further arrangements

202
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:41,969
regarding the Merfolk marine force.

203
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,408
Your Highness is advised to rest
and recuperate in the mountain.

204
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,449
There's no need to return
to the imperial city with haste.

205
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,048
I may be physically weak.

206
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,249
But I'm still capable of moving.

207
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,528
I can't stay here for too long.

208
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:54,288
Oh, no.

209
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:54,849
No, no, no.

210
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:55,808
You can't leave.

211
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:56,688
You barely stayed alive...

212
00:15:58,688 --> 00:15:59,969
Chong Ming
has always been straightforward.

213
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,648
I hope you don't mind it.

214
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,369
Did it take

215
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,288
a great deal of effort to save me?

216
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,009
All thanks to the High Priest.

217
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,688
So it's better to wait

218
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:14,609
for High Priest's return

219
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,609
and express your gratitude
before leaving.

220
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:17,449
Yes, she's right.

221
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:18,369
That's exactly it.

222
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,129
I have other matters to attend to.

223
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:22,089
So I shall take my leave.

224
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:23,408
See you later.

225
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,089
I'll go and see them off.

226
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,449
Please take good care of Shi Ying.

227
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:36,808
Make sure nothing untoward will happen.

228
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:38,249
Don't worry.

229
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,528
Go now.

230
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,729
You three are behaving strangely.

231
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:53,768
Especially you.

232
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,528
You seem to be quite familiar

233
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,609
with the situation in the mountains.

234
00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,729
That's because I stayed
in these mountains

235
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,768
for several months before.

236
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,088
Although I can't remember who you are,

237
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:08,608
since the High Priest

238
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:09,969
assigned you to stay by my side,

239
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,568
and the divine bird and Immortal Official

240
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:13,848
also trust you,

241
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,249
it shows you're not a bad person.

242
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,449
Maybe you did do something to wrong me.

243
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:23,568
But

244
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,009
that was already in the past.

245
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,169
I won't make a fuss about it anymore.

246
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:29,568
I forgive you.

247
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:31,608
But it doesn't mean

248
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:32,689
I need you to take care of me.

249
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:33,689
So

250
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,288
you can leave with them.

251
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,249
Your Highness,

252
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:45,489
are you sure

253
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,568
you don't need me to take care of you?

254
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,848
This mountain is quiet.

255
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,288
The Immortal Officials
are carrying out their duties.

256
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,009
Your Highness will be bored alone.

257
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:55,409
It's just a few days,

258
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:56,128
so it's fine.

259
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,009
The Immortal Officials usually

260
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:01,929
have light meals.

261
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,169
Are you all right with that too?

262
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:07,808
It's just a few days,

263
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:08,568
so it's fine.

264
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:09,889
In that case,

265
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:10,969
Your Highness will be confined

266
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:13,729
to this Cultivating Hall for a few days.

267
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,368
Jiuyi Mountain is steep

268
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,608
and overgrown with dense grass.

269
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:19,969
You have lost your memory,

270
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:21,768
and you can't use magic technique.

271
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,528
If there was no one to accompany you

272
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,449
when you get lost in these mountains,

273
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:32,249
you don't even have anything to eat.

274
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,048
When that happens,

275
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,808
you might end up absorbing
the spiritual energy around you.

276
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:41,969
Come on.

277
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,328
Your Highness,

278
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:44,409
please let me stay.

279
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:45,649
I swear

280
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,328
that I won't be a chatterbox
in these few days.

281
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:52,528
Very well.

282
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:54,848
Since you insist on staying,

283
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:57,088
then I'll trouble you

284
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,328
to take me to the Emperor Valley first.

285
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:00,489
It's the burial place of my ancestors.

286
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,608
So I should pay my respects.

287
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:18,689
Greetings, Your Highness.

288
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:28,729
Watch your steps, Your Highness.

289
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:29,929
Greetings, Your Highness.

290
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,088
Greetings, Your Highness.

291
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,048
Your Highness,

292
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:39,048
please follow me.

293
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,249
What's going on?

294
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,009
Are you lost?

295
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:33,088
Leave.

296
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:42,328
Go now.

297
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:54,048
This is bad.

298
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:55,328
That's the direction

299
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:56,528
to Empress Bai Yan's tomb.

300
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:58,288
Your Highness,

301
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,568
wait for me!

302
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,249
Your Highness, slow down!

303
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:21,808
Your Highness!

304
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:23,848
Your Highness,

305
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,689
the dense forest in the valley
has many forks.

306
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,328
We must not enter rashly.

307
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,449
I don't know why,

308
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:33,449
but after paying respects
to the ancestors,

309
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,288
I still feel there are some

310
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:36,288
unfinished rituals.

311
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:39,969
It's in the woods behind you.

312
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:41,288
Your Highness,

313
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:42,969
it's already late in the day.

314
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,368
Jiuyi Mountain's rules

315
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:46,128
prohibit nighttime visits
to the Emperor Valley.

316
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,288
We should leave now.

317
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:00,848
I've heard

318
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,808
that the fireflies in the Emperor Valley

319
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:04,048
have always accompanied

320
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:05,969
the tombs of the emperors
and empresses of Kongsang.

321
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:07,009
They are quite spiritual.

322
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:08,449
But why are they

323
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,528
taking refuge in your sleeve today?

324
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,969
They seem to have lost their way.

325
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:18,768
They look like

326
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:19,929
newborns.

327
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:21,729
How about this?

328
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:23,568
We'll leave after we send them back

329
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:24,568
to the forest.

330
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:27,929
Your Highness possesses great kindness.

331
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:44,929
Look.

332
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:47,048
That is their mother.

333
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:52,808
They've found their home.

334
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,249
Why do I

335
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,288
feel so sad?

336
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,128
(Master left his mother at a young age.)

337
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:09,969
(Even without memories,)

338
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:11,969
(after witnessing such a scene,)

339
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,409
(it's natural to feel)

340
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:14,449
(an unconscious sadness.)

341
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:26,889
(Master can never see)

342
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,528
(the late Empress again
in this lifetime.)

343
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:31,249
(In this dream of three days,)

344
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:33,929
(I'll let him reunite
with his mother once more.)

345
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,368
(Yesterday's thoughts
are realized today.)

346
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:42,649
(The previous owner of this object)

347
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
(returns to the world.)

348
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:45,808
(Transform!)

349
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:50,009
Ying.

350
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:57,449
Mother?

351
00:23:58,808 --> 00:23:59,729
Why are you here?

352
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:01,568
Ying,

353
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:03,768
I know everything

354
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,249
that you've done

355
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,328
for the world.

356
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:08,328
You have grown up.

357
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:10,568
I'm proud of you.

358
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:18,249
Mother,

359
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,288
it feels like

360
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:23,249
I haven't seen you for a long time.

361
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:26,528
Ying,

362
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:28,768
take good care of your injuries.

363
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:32,368
I'll be waiting for you in the palace.

364
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:13,689
Your Highness.

365
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:15,048
Actually,

366
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,449
when you were still recovering,

367
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:19,009
Chong Ming brought a message

368
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:20,409
from Empress Bai Yan.

369
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,169
So I replayed it.

370
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:24,848
So

371
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:27,288
do you think
my Transmission Spell is great?

372
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:34,649
Thank you.

373
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:46,088
You know what?

374
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,689
Every year at this time,

375
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,929
Jialan City is filled with Snowy Rosa.

376
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:53,969
Mother would personally

377
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:55,088
make snow cakes for me.

378
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:56,969
The ones she made

379
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,489
were the most fragrant and delicious.

380
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:00,088
Throughout Kongsang,

381
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:01,288
there's no other pastry

382
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:02,649
that tastes better than hers.

383
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:05,768
The Empress must be

384
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:06,929
very skilled in cooking.

385
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:07,889
Indeed.

386
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:09,808
Everything I eat in the palace

387
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,848
is personally prepared by my mother.

388
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,009
She said

389
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:15,368
she loved watching me eat voraciously.

390
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:16,088
She said

391
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,048
that's how a child should behave,

392
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,009
rather than pretending

393
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:21,169
to be a grown-up prince.

394
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,288
Oh, there's a dish

395
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,528
called Cloud Mist Shrimp,

396
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,848
made with river shrimp and tea leaves.

397
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,568
It signifies trying a new tea
with new flavors

398
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:35,689
and enjoying poetry and wine
in the prime of life.

399
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:36,969
It's exceptionally delightful.

400
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:47,249
Don't just stand there.

401
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:48,649
Come and have a seat.

402
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,288
If there's a chance,

403
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,249
I'll ask my mother...

404
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:56,328
to make...

405
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,649
to make snow cakes for...

406
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:03,489
for you.

407
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:13,808
(During these three days,)

408
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:15,969
(Shi Ying's soul is in
an intermediate state)

409
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:17,048
(where it's not complete.)

410
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:18,848
(He'll sleep at sunset)

411
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,209
(and rise at sunrise.)

412
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,489
(Every year at this time,)

413
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,449
Jialan City is filled with Snowy Rosa.

414
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,249
Mother would personally

415
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,808
make snow cakes for me.

416
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:34,649
The ones she made

417
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,128
were the most fragrant and delicious.

418
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,489
Throughout Kongsang,

419
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:38,689
there's no other pastry

420
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,009
that tastes better than hers.

♪Snowy Rosa at the temple,

431
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:01,088
It's not that the Snowy Rosa

432
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,249
It's just that I can't smell it.

(I've only spent one day with her.)

440
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,808
(Why do I feel closer to her?)

441
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:44,169
Your Highness.

442
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,288
You said you did

443
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:54,608
something wrong to me.

444
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,729
So I despise you.

445
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:01,528
But it's strange.

446
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:03,288
I don't feel any of that

447
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,088
toward you in my heart.

448
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:07,568
Normally,

449
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,729
even if a person loses their memory,

450
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:11,009
their body

451
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,528
would naturally reflect
their attitude toward others,

452
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:15,128
right?

453
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,528
Your Highness, you're overthinking it.

454
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,808
(Ying may have lost his memories.)

455
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:30,608
(But during these three days,)

456
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:31,489
(his feelings toward you)

457
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:33,048
(will become stronger)

458
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,368
(with each passing day.)

459
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:35,689
(So you must be careful.)

460
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:36,929
(Don't be discovered by him.)

461
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:40,249
That's because

462
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:41,969
you're a person of great virtue.

463
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:43,768
Even if I've grown extremely repulsive

464
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,409
in your heart,

465
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:47,528
you'll still treat me

466
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:48,729
like anyone else.

467
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:54,009
Your Highness,

468
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:55,608
please stop worrying about me.

469
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:59,489
And stop bringing up the past again.

470
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,048
Did you make this?

471
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:11,969
My cooking skills

472
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,608
may not be as good
as your mother's cooking.

473
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,128
But it's better than nothing.

474
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:15,969
Have a taste.

475
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:25,128
Thank you.

476
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,409
It's delicious.

477
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:34,288
I don't know why

478
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,449
I always feel

479
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:36,848
more at ease

480
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:38,528
when I'm with you.

481
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:40,689
It's like...

482
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,689
It's like we used to

483
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:44,729
sit side by side like this,

484
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:45,889
eating something.

485
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,009
How could that be possible?

486
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,409
Your Highness, you're noble and esteemed.

487
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,009
How could I

488
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:53,328
behave with such impropriety?

489
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:03,368
But I think...

490
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:03,848
By the way,

491
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,729
you mentioned

492
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:06,969
so many foods you wanted to eat
the other day.

493
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:09,889
So I have instructed the divine servants

494
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:11,249
to go down the mountain and buy them.

495
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,969
If you don't mind my cooking skills,

496
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,088
I can make them for you

497
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:17,048
one by one and serve them

498
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,209
for you to taste.

499
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:20,689
Thank you.

500
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,449
Is there a marketplace nearby?

501
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:24,929
I want to go
and wander around by myself.

502
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:25,848
You can't!

503
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,568
Your injury has not fully healed.

504
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,009
How can you wander around freely?

505
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:36,649
I want to understand
the sentiments of the people.

506
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:37,889
If you're worried,

507
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:39,689
you can accompany me.

508
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,288
Why does Ying suddenly want to go

509
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,209
to the marketplace?

510
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:51,969
Could it be

511
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:53,368
that subconsciously

512
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,009
he wants to relive the time

513
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,009
when you both went
to the marketplace in Ye City?

514
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:57,848
Whatever the reason may be,

515
00:32:58,489 --> 00:32:59,969
I can't stop Master.

516
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:01,729
Chong Ming,

517
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,328
the people in Jiuyi District
all know us.

518
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:05,969
We should go to a further marketplace.

519
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,528
With me around, it's easy.

520
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
(Cultivating Hall)

521
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:01,729
So this is the legendary divine bird,

522
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:02,768
Chong Ming.

523
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:04,929
Can it fly us there?

524
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:05,929
Yes.

525
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,289
Later, you can sit behind me.

526
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,168
If you're afraid,

527
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,769
you can hold onto its feathers.

528
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,048
Chong Ming, let's go.

529
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:47,969
Lotus pods!

530
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:49,969
Fresh lotus pods!

531
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,568
- Ruyi pastry! Ruyi pastry!
- Lotus pods!

532
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,009
Lotus pods!

533
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:53,648
Homemade pastries!

534
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:54,728
Miss, try this lotus pod.

535
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:55,369
Have a taste.

536
00:34:55,688 --> 00:34:56,568
Come and have a taste!

537
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:57,929
Lotus pods!

538
00:34:58,849 --> 00:34:59,528
Do you like it?

539
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:02,289
Chong Ming, pay for it.

540
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:05,088
- Here you go.
- Don't drop it.

541
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:07,048
Come and take a look
at some fresh fruit.

542
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,769
Fresh and sweet figs.

543
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,168
Would you like some?

544
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:12,728
Figs.

545
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:14,929
Chong Ming, buy some.

546
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:21,489
Come on.

547
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,208
Watch this.

548
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:27,168
Incredible!

549
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:35,449
Then I'll wait for you up ahead.

550
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:46,048
What is this?

551
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:52,849
Why do I feel

552
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,409
you'll definitely like this creature

553
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:55,929
when I see it?

554
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,568
(Could it be)

555
00:35:58,568 --> 00:35:59,608
(that Master is remembering something?)

556
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:01,449
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

557
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:10,929
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

558
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,088
How about this?

559
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:16,849
I'll buy one and give it to you

560
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,289
as a token of gratitude

561
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,009
for taking care of me these days.

562
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:23,289
It's okay.

563
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:24,809
I won't be able to take care of it.

564
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,528
We're not meant to be.

565
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:31,688
Miss,

566
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,088
aren't you...

567
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:33,568
No!

568
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:35,568
I don't know you.

569
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:36,889
This is my first time here.

570
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:37,608
This...

571
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:39,128
That's not right.

572
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:40,409
Back in Jiuyi District,

573
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,168
you were clearly...

574
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:46,608
Aren't you...

575
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:49,289
Jiuyi Mountain's Priest...

576
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,329
Your little white creature has escaped.

577
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,688
Go after it now.

578
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:53,648
- Let's go.
- My little white creature!

579
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:54,168
We...

580
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:01,489
Your Highness.

581
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,289
Actually, I have average appearance
since I was young

582
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:05,369
and don't stand out among the crowd.

583
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:06,889
I often get mistaken for someone else.

584
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,329
I've gotten used to it.

585
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,248
Average appearance

586
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,489
and don't stand out among the crowd?

587
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,688
We should hurry

588
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:16,688
and find Chong Ming.

589
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:29,009
Miss Zhu Yan.

590
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,969
This is the seasoning you requested.

591
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:32,929
However, the seasoning in the mountains

592
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,208
is made from heaven and earth's
condensed spiritual essence.

593
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:35,409
It's different from the mortal world.

594
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,009
This is "Susha",

595
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:39,849
derived from rocks in the wind.

596
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:40,809
It tastes salty.

597
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:44,728
This is "Mishuang",

598
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,248
extracted from the fragrant fruits
of ancient trees.

599
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,489
It tastes sweet.

600
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,168
This is "Huojing",

601
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:51,688
formed from the residual ashes
of ancient wood.

602
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:52,688
It's spicy.

603
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,369
This is "Meihe",

604
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,688
refined from green plums used
in brewing.

605
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:57,648
It tastes sour.

606
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:58,849
Salt,

607
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:00,688
sugar,

608
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:02,409
chili,

609
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:03,409
vinegar.

610
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:04,369
Correct.

611
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:05,688
All right.

612
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:13,648
It's all because I lost
my sense of touching.

613
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:14,889
I can't feel the weight.

614
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:36,409
(Soon, all your senses)

615
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:37,969
(will gradually fade away.)

616
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:40,568
(Finally,)

617
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,128
(I've lost my sense of taste.)

618
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:45,248
Never mind that.

619
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:46,969
I'll go ask the divine servants instead.

620
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,568
His Highness insists on coming to ask...

621
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,489
Is there anything I can help with?

622
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,809
Haven't you heard the saying

623
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,929
that the kitchen is the battlefield
of the Kitchen God?

624
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:03,809
We can't allow anyone else to interfere.

625
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,889
If you want to help,

626
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:08,048
just wait to eat.

627
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:08,489
Come, let's go.

628
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:08,969
- Off you go now.
- Let's go.

629
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:09,969
It's all right.

630
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,208
We can help you wash the vegetables.

631
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,128
Am I right, Chong Ming?

632
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:13,208
You don't have to.

633
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:13,688
Take these.

634
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:14,969
Don't drop them.

635
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:18,329
Just listen to me

636
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,208
and rest here.

637
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:22,449
Leave the rest for us.

638
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:24,048
We'll be happy

639
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,248
when we work together with you.

640
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:26,088
Or else

641
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,009
we won't enjoy

642
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:28,128
this meal either.

643
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,688
Am I right, Chong Ming?

644
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,088
Exactly.

645
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:34,528
Let's wash the vegetables.

646
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:49,688
(I'm fortunate enough to be able)

647
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,168
(to spend time with my master
during these three days.)

648
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,168
(Heaven has been kind to me.)

649
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:57,009
(This will be the last time)

650
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,048
(I cook for Master in this lifetime.)

651
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,369
(I must not disappoint him.)

652
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:09,889
(I'll taste each seasoning one by one.)

653
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,608
It stimulates my stomach.

654
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:24,889
This is Meihe.

655
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:29,690
(Meihe)

656
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:54,449
It's Huojing.

657
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:57,889
Oh, Zhu Yan.

658
00:40:58,409 --> 00:40:59,088
Remember not to add too much of this

659
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:00,369
when you're cooking later.

660
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,240
(Huojing)

661
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:10,088
It's salty.

662
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:15,889
I've overcome

663
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:17,329
the first obstacle.

664
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:40,648
Here you go.

665
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,128
Your Highness, please eat more.

666
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:45,168
So you can recover faster.

667
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:46,489
Chong Ming,

668
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:47,648
eat with His Highness.

669
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,568
I'll go and clean up the kitchen.

670
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:51,568
Wait.

671
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,409
Why is your voice hoarse?

672
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:01,528
What happened to your face?

673
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,528
I didn't think you would notice.

674
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:08,449
It's...

675
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:09,889
It's just an old condition of mine.

676
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:11,568
I always have some allergy symptoms

677
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:13,329
during seasonal changes.

678
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:14,528
It seems like

679
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:15,889
it's going to rain.

680
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:18,969
Is your allergy that serious?

681
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:20,329
Your Highness.

682
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:24,728
Sorry for my abruptness.

683
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,048
Let me fetch some tea.

684
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:33,608
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:34,969
I...

686
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:36,969
I don't know why.

687
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,568
But seeing you like this,

688
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:40,568
I feel deeply saddened.

689
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:42,248
I really want to comfort you.

690
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:44,769
It was just a moment
of impulsiveness so...

691
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:45,329
I understand.

692
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:47,849
It's just

693
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:50,889
that I'm a guilty person.

694
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:53,128
I'm not worthy
of Your Highness's sympathy.

695
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:54,329
I can feel it.

696
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:55,849
The relationship between you and me

697
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,208
is not as you described.

698
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,688
I may have lost all my memories.

699
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,568
But my heart tells me

700
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:04,128
that I have never minded or blamed you

701
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:06,369
for whatever mistakes

702
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:08,409
you may have made.

703
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:09,128
On the contrary,

704
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,248
I feel a strong connection with you.

705
00:43:20,048 --> 00:43:21,688
Your Highness, you should eat your meal.

706
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:23,889
If the food gets cold,

707
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,009
it would truly be a shame

708
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,369
after all my hard work.

709
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:29,329
If you don't stay,

710
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,728
it'll be tasteless for me.

711
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:35,568
Come.

712
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:37,568
Have a seat

713
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:39,009
and eat with me.
