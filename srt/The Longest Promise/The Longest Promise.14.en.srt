19
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,223
(When the God of Dragon is awake,)

20
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,423
(the Crimson Clan will
definitely be jeopardized.)

21
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,502
(Water counters fire.)

22
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:21,583
(I have to make plans for
Princess Zhu Yan in advance.)

23
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:27,383
Princess.

24
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:28,143
Yuan,

25
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:29,023
I actually became

26
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,462
Priest of Grand Preceptor's
first disciple.

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,902
(I never expected Princess)

28
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:35,942
(to become the first disciple.)

29
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:37,383
(This is good too.)

30
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:38,782
(She can learn magic techniques)

31
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:39,942
(from Priest of Grand Preceptor.)

32
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:41,462
(That way, she can
protect herself in the future.)

33
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,383
(It's just)

34
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,143
(that if the God of Dragon wakes up
in a few days,)

35
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:46,062
(Jiuyi Mountain)

36
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:47,983
(will become the riskiest place instead.)

37
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,023
(And, I cannot stay here for long.)

38
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,103
I actually mastered
the Cloud Ascension Spell

39
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,023
and defeated Bai Xuelu

40
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:56,182
at the very last second.

41
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,942
Who would've expected me

42
00:02:59,062 --> 00:02:59,742
to remain

43
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:00,942
in the mountain instead?

44
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:02,703
Yuan, what do you think?

45
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,222
Don't you think I'm a genius
at learning magic techniques?

46
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:06,303
If so, do you wish to learn

47
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:07,703
the merfolk's Fushui Spell?

48
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,742
We can see if you're a genius by then.

49
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:10,942
Sure.

50
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,143
But

51
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:13,742
there's no water here.

52
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,703
Princess, please focus on
your spiritual power

53
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,023
and activate the Mirage Spell.

54
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:17,902
This time,

55
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,222
let's head inside together.

56
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:20,423
Okay.

57
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,983
(I should teach her)

58
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:23,902
(some underwater magic techniques)

59
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,423
(so that she can fend for herself.)

60
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:44,902
It's as beautiful as always.

61
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:49,062
After you master the Fushui Spell,

62
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,062
you can act underwater

63
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:52,303
normally,

64
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,143
as if you were truly underwater.

65
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:58,902
Take a deep breath.

66
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,662
Close your eyes.

67
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:02,742
Exhale slowly.

68
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,222
Imagine that you're a fish.

69
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:37,623
Yuan,

70
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,422
I think I already mastered it.

71
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:41,823
Let me show it to you.

72
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:43,342
Okay.

73
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,782
(What's wrong with me?)

74
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:56,143
(Could it be that the dragon blood)

75
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:57,542
(has been suppressing me for too long?)

76
00:04:58,222 --> 00:04:59,263
(I cannot focus.)

77
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,222
(We need show solemn attitude
for the first day of)

78
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:22,623
(the apprenticeship ceremony)

79
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,503
(to show the propriety of
the Crimson Clan.)

80
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:30,383
Solemn attitude?

81
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:35,462
This won't do.

82
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:45,943
I think

83
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,383
this is the lovable look

84
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:49,703
that all first disciples have.

85
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,063
Master,

86
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,383
do I look good today?

87
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:14,662
Master,

88
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:15,862
this is my first day

89
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,302
being your disciple officially.

90
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:18,902
I wanted it to be more formal.

91
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,982
That's why I got into this getup.

92
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:22,623
Look at me.

93
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,023
Do I look nice?

94
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:29,263
Master, do I look nice?

95
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:29,862
Change your attire.

96
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,063
But I spent two hours

97
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:35,302
preparing them.

98
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,623
These accessories

99
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,063
will distract you.

100
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:43,063
What's worse is

101
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:46,623
that the hairpin will
make your head heavier.

102
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,023
And, it'll make you react slower.

103
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:50,063
These earrings

104
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:51,982
will obstruct your hearing.

105
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:05,503
You guys only had a basic understanding

106
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,982
of magic techniques last month.

107
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,422
I already mastered
the Wind-manipulating Spell.

108
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,342
How is that just a basic understanding?

109
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:13,743
The Wind-manipulating Spell

110
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:15,943
is the most basic magic technique.

111
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:17,623
From today onward,

112
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,862
I'll teach you magic techniques
from all clans.

113
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:21,982
Since you're from the Crimson Clan,

114
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:23,023
we shall start with

115
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,023
the fire magic techniques.

116
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,023
Come.

117
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,422
Show me

118
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,782
what you've learned.

119
00:08:58,263 --> 00:08:58,702
Stop.

120
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,743
First, there's an issue with
your casting gesture.

121
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:18,743
Second,

122
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:21,942
you don't release your spiritual power
through your index finger.

123
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:25,422
You let them seep through your palm.

124
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:28,302
Third,

125
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:29,983
you kept your hands too fast.

126
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,182
Your spiritual power wasn't able

127
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:32,902
to circulate entirely.

128
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,103
Again.

129
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:48,743
That's still wrong.

130
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:01,743
Master,

131
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,223
you're powerful

132
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:05,343
because you learned
magic techniques of all clans.

133
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:06,782
But I've only ever learned

134
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,822
the fire magic techniques
of the Crimson Clan since young.

135
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:09,942
I've recited the same chant

136
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,023
thousands of times.

137
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,623
It won't be any lesser
than your attempts.

138
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,023
But for some reason,

139
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:17,302
they don't work

140
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:18,422
when I train under you.

141
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,383
That can only prove

142
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:21,582
that the numerous training

143
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,023
you've done before this

144
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,822
wasn't up to standard.

145
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:26,223
I need to correct them

146
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,422
one by one.

147
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,343
Since you're my disciple,

148
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:30,863
I have to be strict with you

149
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:31,863
and help you to improve.

150
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:34,103
I have to do my duty as your master.

151
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,623
Master,

152
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:37,863
actually,

153
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,302
it's not like I learned
all my magic techniques

154
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:41,062
from the family

155
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,582
or my teachers.

156
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:43,662
I've also read many

157
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,822
magic technique manuals.

158
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:46,902
However,

159
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,422
there might be a difference
in understandings

160
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,023
when it comes to magic techniques

161
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,023
due to the different systems.

162
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,782
For example...

163
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:55,983
For example, the manual I liked

164
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,463
has an old man

165
00:10:58,662 --> 00:10:59,463
and a kid

166
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:00,383
playing with fire

167
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:02,662
on the book cover.

168
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,023
The old man you mentioned,

169
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:07,863
is he wearing fire snakes on his ears

170
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,863
and stepping on fire dragons
with his feet?

171
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:10,863
That's right.

172
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:11,623
Master,

173
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:12,983
have you read the manual before?

174
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,822
That's not an old man.

175
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,182
That's the God of Fire, Zhu Rong.

176
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:19,743
And, the kid you mentioned,

177
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,422
he isn't a kid.

178
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:22,582
That's the devil.

179
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,223
The book describes

180
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,223
the story of Zhu Rong

181
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:26,942
repelling the devil with fire.

182
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,743
There's nothing fun about it.

183
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:31,062
Did you actually

184
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:33,582
read the manual?

185
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,223
I...

186
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:37,582
I can't stand it
when there's a deviation

187
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,343
in your basic understanding
of magic techniques.

188
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:42,182
Even though you could cast fire ball,

189
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,383
you still need to practice it

190
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,343
repeatedly under me.

191
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:48,542
There's no fun
on the path of cultivation.

192
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,103
There's only suffering.

193
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:51,942
Do you understand?

194
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:54,582
I do.

195
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,062
Continue your practice.

196
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,143
Again.

197
00:12:58,422 --> 00:12:58,983
General Qing,

198
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:01,542
thank you for taking care of me.

199
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,182
Tomorrow, we shall

200
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,143
go on our separate ways.

201
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,582
It was nothing.

202
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:06,542
You don't need to be so courteous.

203
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,383
Maybe it's due to the long trip.

204
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,822
Xuelu hasn't been doing too well lately.

205
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,463
Princess Xuelu is very competitive.

206
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,702
The first disciple selection
has affected her greatly.

207
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:28,822
Once we part ways tomorrow,

208
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,343
Princess Xueying, I hope

209
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:31,383
you can take good care of her.

210
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:33,062
Do not let her attempt
something silly again.

211
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,143
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

212
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:48,902
General Qing.

213
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:49,863
You can show yourself now.

214
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:02,743
General Qing,

215
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:03,902
you always follow me when I go outside.

216
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:06,702
You finally showed yourself tonight.

217
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:08,623
What exactly are you up to?

218
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,822
I'm afraid that you might be in danger

219
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:11,822
when you head outside alone.

220
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,902
You think I'm a weak woman

221
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,542
just because I lost to Zhu Yan,

222
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,343
am I right?

223
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,942
When it comes to being hard-working,

224
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:22,942
I won't lose to anyone.

225
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:24,863
Is that why you sneak out at night

226
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:26,983
to practice the Cloud Ascension Spell?

227
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,463
You need to take your training
one step at a time.

228
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,623
If you're too hasty,
you'll hurt yourself.

229
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:33,463
I'm just unsatisfied with the result.

230
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:34,863
I would've never lost

231
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:35,902
if she didn't master the spell

232
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:36,942
out of the blue.

233
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:38,623
Even a person like her
can master the spell.

234
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,702
Why can't I?

235
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,343
You don't need to despise Zhu Yan.

236
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,223
Actually,

237
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,503
you and she are pretty similar.

238
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:48,542
She and I?

239
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,463
Forget it.

240
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:53,983
Although I'm not good at socializing,

241
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:56,422
I will make a bold guess.

242
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:58,662
You just think that people

243
00:15:58,782 --> 00:15:59,942
with a better background than yours

244
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,343
don't work as hard as you.

245
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,223
It's because she's the daughter
of the head wife

246
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,023
while you're the daughter
of a concubine.

247
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:17,463
I know

248
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,702
that you aren't a genius
at magic techniques.

249
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:20,503
You must've suffered a lot

250
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,503
to get to where you are today.

251
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,942
You're trying your best
to master the Cloud Ascension Spell

252
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,343
to prove

253
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:30,782
that you aren't inferior to anyone else.

254
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:35,263
But you know that I'm also the son
of a concubine.

255
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:38,422
I'm from the branch family
of the Azure Clan.

256
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:42,702
I understand your feelings.

257
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:44,782
You don't understand at all.

258
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,863
Do you know the identity of my mother?

259
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:49,623
I don't understand the marriage alliance

260
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:51,463
among the Six Clans.

261
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,662
However, since it's your mother
we're talking about,

262
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,662
I'm sure she should be a gracious

263
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,023
and talented lady of noble birth.

264
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:05,062
Gracious and talented?

265
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:06,422
You're right about that.

266
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:09,743
Back then, countless men

267
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,703
did everything they could

268
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:11,983
just to make her smile.

269
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:13,663
However, she wasn't a lady

270
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,862
of noble birth.

271
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:18,342
She was

272
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,302
a courtesan.

273
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:23,223
However...

274
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:24,463
However, the leader of the Six Clans

275
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:26,503
doesn't allow clan members
to take courtesans as their concubines.

276
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:27,423
Am I right?

277
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,342
She's been teaching me
how to read and write

278
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,142
ever since I could remember.

279
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:34,782
She believed

280
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:35,862
that I would be successful one day

281
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,142
and that my father would recognize me.

282
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:40,782
She even came up with a flattering name

283
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,622
like Xuelu for me.

284
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,263
I was born in a courtesan house.

285
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:48,223
However, she believed

286
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,782
that I could stay untainted.

287
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:52,663
Is she

288
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:55,703
still doing well?

289
00:17:58,423 --> 00:17:59,342
When I was five,

290
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,622
she committed suicide

291
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,062
in order to give me a chance

292
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:05,822
to return to the Bai Residence.

293
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:08,223
Outsiders only know

294
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:09,423
that I was the daughter

295
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,862
of the White King.

296
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:12,983
But no one

297
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,382
knows who my mother was.

298
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,102
Don't you think it's a joke?

299
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:20,382
How is this a joke?

300
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,622
Your mother was abandoned
by the White King

301
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:24,342
even though she was devoted to him.

302
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,183
The White King is the joke here, not her.

303
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,102
You don't despise my background?

304
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,142
No one would be a courtesan

305
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,423
out of choice.

306
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,102
Why should I despise
a pitiful girl like you?

307
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:45,862
That's why I want to prove

308
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,743
that I can become

309
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:50,382
the strongest woman in Kongsang

310
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,703
no matter my background.

311
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:53,423
I will not lose to Zhu Yan,

312
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,703
Xueying, or anyone else.

313
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,142
By then,

314
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,943
I can put my mother's memorial tablet

315
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:02,663
in the Bai Residence gloriously.

316
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:05,463
Xuelu,

317
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:06,503
I...

318
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,102
General Qing,

319
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,622
I'm grateful for what you've said.

320
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:12,102
But you and I

321
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:13,663
have our own paths to take.

322
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,023
We're destined
not to take the same path.

323
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:42,943
Xuelu

324
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,263
actually has such a pitiful background?

325
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:30,302
I'm sure General Qing

326
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,023
will be disheartened

327
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:33,822
if he finds out that we're leaving
without bidding farewell.

328
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,183
You heard everything last night, right?

329
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,142
I didn't mean it.

330
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:42,983
That's fine.

331
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:44,822
There's no need to pity me.

332
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,622
I'm not pitying you.

333
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:48,782
I just think

334
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,503
that Father is truly...

335
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:51,903
That's why I expect myself

336
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,183
not to lose to anyone since young.

337
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:55,782
I don't hate Father.

338
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,782
But you,

339
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,023
as the descendant of the direct line,

340
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:02,142
you don't behave like one at all.

341
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:03,582
What a waste.

342
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:05,503
Sister.

343
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:07,582
I don't care if you pity me

344
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:08,342
or understand me.

345
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:09,382
Keep your emotions away.

346
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:11,463
In the future,

347
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,223
we shall fight for the position

348
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:14,263
of the Empress.

349
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:16,582
I will not go easy on you

350
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,023
just because you're my little sister.

351
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,423
Wrong. Do it again.

352
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,423
Master,

353
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,183
is the casting gesture that important

354
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,023
as long as

355
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,382
we can get the job done?

356
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:47,503
If everyone

357
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:48,782
follows the beaten path,

358
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:49,743
we can never invent

359
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:50,862
new magic techniques.

360
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:52,862
Repeating the wrong gesture

361
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,183
10,000 times

362
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,822
can only reinforce
your ridiculous mistake.

363
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,943
If so, you're inferior to a layman

364
00:21:59,102 --> 00:21:59,943
who has only trained for half a day.

365
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:05,743
Divine servant.

366
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,743
Priest.

367
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:19,782
Priest, I...

368
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:20,943
Don't panic.

369
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:22,503
Just follow my instruction.

370
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,263
How long have you been practicing
fire magic techniques?

371
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,622
I am not a cultivator.

372
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:51,102
I've never learned
any magic techniques before.

373
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,263
Zhu Yan,

374
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,183
do you admit defeat?

375
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:11,703
Yes,

376
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:13,622
Master.

377
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:14,703
Very good.

378
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:16,423
Continue your training.

379
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,423
Does he need to humiliate me like that?

380
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:26,503
It's not like

381
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,062
I didn't improve at all

382
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:28,862
in the past few days.

383
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,943
(I'll do it seriously for once.)

384
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:35,342
(I'm sure I'm better than
a mere divine servant.)

385
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,142
(Zhu Yan,)

386
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,062
(why are you so useless?)

387
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:55,183
(You can't even master
an easy technique like this.)

388
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,342
(How could you train under
Master like this?)

389
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:03,703
Do you know your mistake now?

390
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:06,463
I...

391
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:10,423
My head

392
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:12,582
is hurting like crazy.

393
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:15,542
I'm sure it's because

394
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:16,983
I've learned too much
in the past few days.

395
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:17,622
My knowledge of more than 10 years

396
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,263
has been subverted.

397
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:22,023
Master, look.

398
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:22,903
It hurts here.

399
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:24,663
It hurts here too.

400
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,142
Master,

401
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,743
I feel like my head is cracking.

402
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,263
Please allow me to rest.

403
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,663
It hurts!

404
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:44,903
Master,

405
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:45,822
I've already

406
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,102
mastered the gesture

407
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:48,503
you taught me.

408
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,342
Princess,

409
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:52,782
Priest of Grand Preceptor has left
the mountain around seven

410
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:53,862
to check on the plague.

411
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:55,342
A plague broke out in Jiuyi District.

412
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,183
The villagers are seeking shelters
in the mountains.

413
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:00,542
Why didn't anyone tell me about it?

414
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:01,943
I know some medical skills.

415
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:04,263
Maybe I can help them out.

416
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:06,582
By the way,

417
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:07,663
where's Lord Chong Ming?

418
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,423
He's in the Hall of Books' infirmary.

419
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,582
Lord Chong Ming!

420
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:28,862
There might be

421
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,062
some misunderstandings between us

422
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:30,903
before this.

423
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:31,943
However, since I'm already

424
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,142
Master's disciple,

425
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:34,743
I will cherish this chance

426
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,382
and try to get along with you
and Master.

427
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,983
What has that got to do with me?

428
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:42,862
Since I'm going to train under Master

429
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:44,183
in the mountain,

430
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,743
naturally, I need to get along

431
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,142
with people beside him.

432
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:49,983
It's best

433
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:51,342
if you don't appear in front of me.

434
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:54,822
Lord Chong Ming,

435
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:55,983
are you going to leave the mountain

436
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,183
and meet up with Master?

437
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,263
You don't say?

438
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,062
You should get out of the way

439
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,263
since you knew that I would
go to deliver medicine to him.

440
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:03,342
Lord Chong Ming,

441
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:04,943
what's wrong with your hands?

442
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,703
What's wrong with my hands?

443
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:08,142
Lord Chong Ming,

444
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,903
how could you carry such a heavy thing

445
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:12,983
with your delicate hands?

446
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:14,903
Why don't you

447
00:26:15,062 --> 00:26:16,542
let me carry your basket for you?

448
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,463
You want to leave the mountain
together with me?

449
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:20,463
Just you wish.

450
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:22,703
I know some medical skills too.

451
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:23,862
I can help you guys out.

452
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:25,663
For example,

453
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:27,102
Lord Chong Ming,

454
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,743
the effect of your favorite facial mask

455
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:31,503
will be enhanced

456
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:32,903
if you add a dash of

457
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,023
Crimson Flower to it.

458
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:35,903
Are you serious?

459
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,142
If so, where can I get
this Crimson Flower?

460
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,582
Crimson Flowers can only be found

461
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:41,862
within the Western Desert.

462
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,503
But I have plenty of them
in my residence.

463
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,062
Lord Chong Ming, just one word

464
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:47,703
and I'll ask my servants
to send them here by tomorrow.

465
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,903
Lord Chong Ming,

466
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:51,263
why don't you bring me with you

467
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:52,503
and let me expand my horizon?

468
00:26:52,822 --> 00:26:54,463
Don't you ever think that
you can bribe me

469
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:55,782
with a mere Crimson Flower.

470
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:56,663
I have

471
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,862
a strong determination.

472
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,463
Hurry and distribute
the medicine to them.

473
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:15,223
Okay.

474
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,743
Thank you.

475
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:28,703
Have some water.

476
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:29,622
Hurry.

477
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,582
Slowly, I'll support you.

478
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:48,142
He's a cleanliness freak.

479
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,743
I don't know how
he managed to endure this.

480
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:55,183
I never expected the plague
to be this severe.

481
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:56,822
It's contagious too.

482
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:00,663
We should hurry

483
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:01,663
and help Master out.

484
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:03,903
We lack manpower.

485
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:05,423
I'll count you in.

486
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:09,743
Mother!

487
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:14,142
Don't be scared.
You'll recover in no time.

488
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:27,183
I've arrived.

489
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:28,582
Great timing.

490
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:30,542
Apply the herbs I've distributed

491
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,102
to the patients' wound.

492
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:33,822
It can lessen their pain.

493
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:34,903
By the way,

494
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:36,342
distribute the herbs

495
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:37,183
you brought

496
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,102
to those who are recovering.

497
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:41,302
Give it to me.

498
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:44,822
What are you doing here?

499
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:45,943
Master, why can't I be here

500
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:47,062
when you're here?

501
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,503
I'm here to help you out.

502
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:51,183
Do you know that
this disease is contagious?

503
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,223
Master, although you're powerful,

504
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:55,582
you're still made of flesh.

505
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:56,782
If you aren't afraid,

506
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:58,983
why should I be afraid?

507
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,542
I'm here to treat them.

508
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:01,463
What do you know?

509
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,622
You'll only be a hindrance.

510
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:02,903
I...

511
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,023
If you contract this disease,

512
00:29:06,423 --> 00:29:07,582
your face will be

513
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:09,263
filled with pusses.

514
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,023
How can you get married by then?

515
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,142
Stop right there.

516
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:18,622
Master, since you said

517
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:19,822
I'm a hindrance to you,

518
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:20,943
I should leave

519
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,183
when you tell me to.

520
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:23,183
Come back.

521
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,622
It's done. Go now.

522
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:55,302
Thank you.

523
00:29:56,943 --> 00:29:57,582
Next.

524
00:29:58,223 --> 00:29:58,743
Come.

525
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:01,223
I'm sure you were harsh to her

526
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:01,983
on purpose because you didn't want her

527
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,223
to be infected, right?

528
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:07,223
Actually, that lass isn't too bad.

529
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,663
I do like her.

530
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,142
It's a pity that she's the woman

531
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,142
in the prophecy.

532
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,622
We're here.

533
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,263
Shi Ying, thank you.

534
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:37,302
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

535
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,663
you've rid us of the disease.

536
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:41,822
Words cannot express our gratitude.

537
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,302
It's my duty.
No need to be this courteous.

538
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,542
After receiving your treatment,

539
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:47,622
most patients
have already gotten better.

540
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:49,822
We've prepared some simple dishes
for you two.

541
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,542
Please rest here for the night

542
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,943
and proceed with the treatment tomorrow.

543
00:30:53,223 --> 00:30:53,542
Please.

544
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:54,102
Please.

545
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:56,663
Please.

546
00:30:57,862 --> 00:30:58,663
Come, quick.

547
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:03,423
Come, please have a seat.

548
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,062
Miss, what is this?

549
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:11,703
This is the Fire-manipulating Spell.

550
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:13,822
You're amazing.

551
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:15,983
If so, you should drink up.

552
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:18,142
Miss, the fish soup you made is amazing!

553
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,102
Drink it slowly.

554
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:19,943
Good kid.

555
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:21,663
There's more.

556
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:23,782
I thought you...

557
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:25,703
Chong Ming.

558
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:28,703
You guys must be starving.

559
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,822
I thought you were
returning to the mountain?

560
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,743
I wanted to leave initially.

561
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,943
But most of the villagers are sick.

562
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,423
They can't even cook for themselves.

563
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:49,703
Although I'm not adept
at magic techniques,

564
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:51,983
I'm still good with
fire magic techniques.

565
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:53,463
That's why I was thinking

566
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:56,062
that I should make a fire
and cook for the villagers.

567
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,503
After all, they can only recover

568
00:31:57,703 --> 00:31:59,062
once they have their bellies filled.

569
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:03,023
Master, this is also a chance for you

570
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:05,582
to review my progress.

571
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:24,983
Master.

572
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,862
(He's still the same person he was.)

573
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:29,542
Where are you going?

574
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,142
Chong Ming.

575
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,223
You loved fish soup, right?

576
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:37,663
Here you go.

577
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:38,703
Miss,

578
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:40,423
you're an excellent cook.

579
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:42,023
I've never had

580
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,302
such tasty dishes before.

581
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:45,223
The fish soup is amazing.

582
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,703
This is great.

583
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,302
Master.

584
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:26,382
Master,

585
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:28,423
I was in charge of

586
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:30,423
preparing the food from
the start until the end.

587
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,503
Master, this is for you.

588
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:34,663
There are no cutleries.

589
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,062
And, we're in the wilderness.

590
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:38,943
How could we dine here? It's barbaric.

591
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,183
Master, you're being narrow-minded here.

592
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,062
The Western Huang has boiled mutton

593
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:44,983
and the Eastern Sea has
raw drunken prawn.

594
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:46,703
Since ancient times,

595
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:47,703
people had been cooking meat

596
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,582
by covering them with soil and leaves.

597
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:52,223
They use what they can find and
they don't care about trifle details.

598
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,622
Indulging yourself in food bare-handed

599
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:55,062
when you're hungry is the best.

600
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,302
The flesh is white as snow,
and it's not flaky.

601
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,943
This is so delicious.

602
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,182
Master,

603
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,102
I succeeded in making roasted fish

604
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,903
even though it was
my first time making it.

605
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,343
I'm a genius.

606
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:21,262
Master,

607
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:23,182
why don't you try it?

608
00:34:24,383 --> 00:34:25,383
Try it.

609
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:37,023
What do you think?

610
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:37,943
Is it nice?

611
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:40,622
It's okay.

612
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:45,662
Actually, when I was
still in the Jiuyi Mountain,

613
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:46,943
I'd imagined a scene like this

614
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,863
where we enjoyed great food together.

615
00:34:55,783 --> 00:34:56,783
Just like now,

616
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:59,423
without caring
about the occasion or customs.

617
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,702
We should eat up when we're starving.

618
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:28,863
Thank you.

619
00:35:29,222 --> 00:35:30,182
Thank you, Master.

620
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:34,303
Actually,

621
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,023
I should be thanking you instead.

622
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,823
Master, why are you thanking me?

623
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,463
You've been keeping me company
the entire day.

624
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,182
Master, you were saving lives.

625
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:48,463
As your disciple, of course
I should keep you company.

626
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,582
Actually, Master,

627
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,463
I should be thanking you instead.

628
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:56,863
Master, I knew you told me off

629
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:58,423
because you were afraid

630
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,582
that I might contract the disease.

631
00:36:01,182 --> 00:36:02,622
You did so for my sake.

632
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:05,983
Enough.

633
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:07,343
We should stop thanking each other

634
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:09,662
and finish the fish.

635
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:12,303
We?

636
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:14,503
Master, you're right.

637
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:15,903
We...

638
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:18,863
In the future, we still have to enjoy

639
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:20,983
many delicacies together.

640
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:21,903
Master, if you follow me

641
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:24,062
to the Crimson Clan's territory,

642
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:25,023
I shall bring you

643
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,383
to enjoy all the delicacies there.

644
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:28,463
The beef and mutton we have there

645
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:29,863
are the freshest.

646
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:32,222
Our clan members will make a circle
around a fire

647
00:36:32,383 --> 00:36:34,383
and we'll sing and cook the meat
at the same time.

648
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:37,062
The taste is impeccable.

649
00:36:37,582 --> 00:36:38,783
If there's rain in the desert,

650
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:39,783
after 15 minutes,

651
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:41,262
golden mushrooms

652
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:42,262
will appear

653
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:44,062
in the area.

654
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:45,503
If the mushrooms

655
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,542
aren't harvested within two hours,

656
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:49,023
they'll vanish.

657
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,783
Whenever the rain is gone,

658
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,062
my friends and I

659
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,742
will compete to see

660
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,503
who's the fastest harvester.

661
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:57,102
And,

662
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,983
the wine there

663
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:00,903
is also exceptional.

664
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:02,943
If I must say, I miss

665
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:05,023
the milk tea my mother made the most.

666
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:08,262
However, my mother isn't good at cooking.

667
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:09,142
She'll create a mess

668
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,863
every time she tries to start a fire.

669
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:12,542
She always turns a pot of milk tea

670
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:13,742
into a pot of congee.

671
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:16,943
However, my father and I

672
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,702
will finish the milk tea

673
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:19,943
every time.

674
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:21,262
Master,

675
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:23,262
you must give that a try

676
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:24,943
if you have the chance
to visit my hometown.

677
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,863
I once read this in a book.

678
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,542
The autumn in the Western Huang

679
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,863
is magnificent.

680
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:36,142
The long river, sunset,

681
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:37,463
and smoke in the desert.

682
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,662
I will check it out
if I have the chance.

683
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:45,182
Actually, it's not just
the Western Huang.

684
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:46,943
I want to travel around

685
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:48,303
the entire Yunhuang.

686
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:51,102
I want to check out Jiangnan,

687
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:52,222
which looks like
a scene from a painting.

688
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:54,062
I want to check out the Northern Plains,

689
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:55,863
which is covered by pure, white snow.

690
00:37:57,023 --> 00:38:00,023
It sounds beautiful.

691
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,542
Master,

692
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:02,823
can you bring me along

693
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,262
when you travel in the future?

694
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:07,423
It depends on your performance.

695
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:21,983
How could you
dispose of the fish bones randomly?

696
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:23,943
What if the birds choke

697
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,343
when they consume it by accident?

698
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,943
Master, you were only nice to me

699
00:38:40,142 --> 00:38:41,463
for less than half an hour.

700
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:42,463
After that, you returned to normal.

701
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:44,983
You're still as rigid as always.

702
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:49,303
Today,

703
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:52,062
after reviewing what you've done,

704
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,102
you passed

705
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,383
the fire manipulation basics.

706
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,182
This is bad!

707
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:04,943
This is bad!

708
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,222
