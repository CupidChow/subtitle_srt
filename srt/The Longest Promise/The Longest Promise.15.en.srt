19
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,491
It's her! It's all her fault!

20
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,090
At first, there were only scabs
on my father's face.

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,136
He was still conscious.

22
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,370
But after taking her prescription,

23
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,491
he became like this!

24
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,232
Return my father to me!

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,610
Everyone, please be my judge!

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,691
Uphold justice for me!

27
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,610
- What's going on?
- She's a quack doctor!

28
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,091
Everyone, calm down.

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,050
She's my disciple.

30
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,050
I'm partly responsible
when she commits a mistake.

31
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,971
I shall cure your father.

32
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,011
Tell me everything that had happened.

33
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,890
- Father, father.
- Master, this afternoon,

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,680
I saw that you were busy
treating patients at the square.

35
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,691
The condition of this mister
wasn't that serious.

36
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,416
That's why I gave him a prescription

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,010
that Chong Ming told me on our way here.

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,691
Don't panic.
What herbs have you used?

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,091
I used One-Leaf Fall, Skymallow,

40
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:59,291
Torenia, Stone Ink Lotus, and

41
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,624
Yang Wood.

42
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,896
Which kind of Yang?

43
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,456
Yang as in Yin and Yang.

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,488
I understand now.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
You were wrong about one of the herbs.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,890
You've only heard of its name
without seeing it yourself.

47
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,050
So, it was the wrong herb.

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,450
The "Yang" in my prescription
represents dust.

49
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,531
Although it sounds the same,
it's a completely different herb.

50
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,912
Please get some hot water for me.

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,770
Okay. I'll go! I'll go!

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,320
Using the wrong herbs
can actually poison the patient instead.

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,970
We should leave this to Priest.

54
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,770
- He's so pitiful.
- That's right.

55
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,784
He has to suffer even at this age.

56
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,610
Zhu Yan, have you learned needlework before?

57
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,811
I have.

58
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:19,930
Good.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,232
Later, you can stitch up his wound
with your needlework skill.

60
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,816
Master,

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,288
you're still willing to believe me?

62
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,248
Hurry.

63
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,570
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
we have no way

64
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,184
to repay what we owe you.

65
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,251
The villagers of Jiuyi District

66
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,611
are willing to serve you.

67
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,011
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

68
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,011
Please get up.

69
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,611
- You guys, please get up.
- Please get up.

70
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,210
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

71
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,688
I don't need you guys to repay me.

72
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,896
It's just that I wonder why

73
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,650
the village was struck with this plague
out of the blue.

74
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,290
I wonder if the source has been located?

75
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,330
I've finished my investigation.

76
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,610
It seems like something's wrong
with the water.

77
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,450
The people who first caught the plague

78
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,210
were staying at
the eastern side of the village.

79
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,976
They were consuming water from
the Eastern Creek.

80
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,256
I think that was the case.

81
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,640
Eastern Creek?

82
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:43,690
What about this?

83
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,050
I will write down
the prescriptions in detail.

84
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,288
Village Head, please pass
this prescription to those who need it.

85
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,320
Let's hope that this plague
will be gone soon.

86
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,850
Village Head, please bring me
to the Eastern Creek later.

87
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,460
Yes, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

88
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,240
It's up ahead.

89
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,896
How is it?

90
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,530
Indeed.

91
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,240
Something's wrong with the water.

92
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,660
Let's head forward.

93
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,888
Your Supreme Majesty.

94
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,790
What do you need?

95
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,230
A plague broke out in Jiuyi District.

96
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,790
When I went to treat the villagers,

97
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:32,275
I discovered something strange.

98
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:36,675
The source of the plague

99
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,315
should be the water
from the Eastern Creek.

100
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:41,155
When I checked upstream,

101
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,600
I discovered bubbles in the river.

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,136
The water was tainted.

103
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:48,954
The source of Eastern Creek

104
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,074
may seem like the pool
beside Jiuyi Mountain,

105
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,874
but in reality,

106
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,994
the source is Cangwu Abyss.

107
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:57,994
Judging from the shape of the bubbles,

108
00:07:58,675 --> 00:07:59,395
it seems that spiritual power

109
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:02,275
is stirring up from within the abyss.

110
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,594
Do you still remember

111
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,354
the legend of the trapped
God of Dragon within the abyss

112
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:09,635
and the trapped Ice Clan
outside the wilderness?

113
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,354
Your Supreme Majesty, are you saying

114
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,234
that underneath the Cangwu Abyss

115
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:16,994
lies the God of Dragon?

116
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:20,035
When the God of Dragon awakes,

117
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:22,675
evil shall rise, and the emperor of
the sea will return.

118
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,435
That's what the merfolk
have been waiting for.

119
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,155
The Merfolk marine force
has been stirring up trouble

120
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,915
in secret all these years.

121
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,195
If the God of Dragon has truly awakened,

122
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,795
they will only make things worse.

123
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,555
The world will plunge into chaos too.

124
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,515
Your Supreme Majesty, please permit me

125
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,714
to head to the Cangwu Abyss
and investigate the situation.

126
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:48,915
(If the world is plunged into chaos,)

127
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,635
(it'll be the best opportunity)

128
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:52,315
(for Ying to leave the mountain.)

129
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:55,035
You don't need to go there yet.

130
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:56,954
The God of Dragon's awakening

131
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,594
is just my guess.

132
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,354
It'll be terrible
if we alert them of our presence.

133
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:04,155
Let's wait and observe
the situation for now.

134
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:05,754
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

135
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:54,354
Princesses,

136
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,275
over here, please.

137
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,035
That was amazing.

138
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,234
It's pretty interesting.

139
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,114
Your Highness, please dine here.

140
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:18,994
The two princesses of Zixuan Residence

141
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:20,155
are in the courtyard.

142
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:21,594
Why are Xuelu and I

143
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:22,555
the only ones here?

144
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,035
Were they mistaken?

145
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,155
Enough. Just sit down.

146
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,114
I'm sure Consort Qing

147
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,675
made this arrangement for us.

148
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:32,834
Princess Xuelu, you're right.

149
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,114
I'm the palace servant

150
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,275
of His Highness Shi Yu.

151
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,435
I was transferred here temporarily
to serve you two.

152
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,754
I shall return now.

153
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,195
Your Highness, if you two need anything,

154
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,994
please tell the maidservants
outside the gate.

155
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:52,754
I shall take my leave.

156
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
(Wait for you in the backyard kitchen)

157
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:09,035
Xuelu,

158
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:10,874
I want to take a walk

159
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:11,954
by myself.

160
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:15,474
Go ahead.

161
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:23,675
Someone.

162
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:24,555
Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,954
Please tell Consort Qing

164
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:31,435
that Bai Xuelu needs
to seek an audience with her.

165
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:32,594
It concerns Jiuyi Mountain.

166
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:33,994
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:36,795
In my opinion, these snacks

168
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:37,754
are the best.

169
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:38,395
Try it.

170
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,635
The imperial kitchen does
live up to its name.

171
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,195
I know it's good when I smell it.

172
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:46,435
Try this too.

173
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,074
I haven't finished the last snack.

174
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:50,795
I can't finish them.

175
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,074
That won't do.

176
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:53,395
You spent one month in Jiuyi Mountain.

177
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,474
You've lost a lot of weight.

178
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:55,714
You should eat up.

179
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:57,994
If you keep telling me to eat,

180
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:58,834
I'll turn

181
00:11:58,994 --> 00:11:59,954
into a snowball.

182
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:03,635
It's better if you gain some weight.

183
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,954
I'll still like you even if you turn

184
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:06,754
into a snowball.

185
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:08,874
Your Highness, you should eat up too.

186
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:21,114
Xueying,

187
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:25,834
I never expected Mother
to put you two on the spot

188
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:26,635
during the banquet too.

189
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,114
I'm really sorry about that.

190
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,234
It doesn't matter.

191
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:35,074
Your Highness, I'm happy

192
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,114
as long as

193
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,515
I get to see you.

194
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,714
However, even if you did leave
Jiuyi Mountain,

195
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:44,275
it's still difficult for me
to meet up with you.

196
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:50,555
That's fine.

197
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,435
At least I have this with me.

198
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,200
(My promise to Xueying
deeply rooted within)

199
00:12:59,315 --> 00:12:59,635
You actually

200
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:00,675
carved feathers for it.

201
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,195
I was thinking that I should
finish it as soon as possible.

202
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:05,954
By then,

203
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,395
I can stay by your side forever,

204
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,915
Your Highness.

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,280
(Qingyun Palace)

206
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:31,874
Princess Xuelu?

207
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:34,195
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:36,315
I have something important

209
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,675
to discuss with Consort Qing.

210
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:44,994
(What's so important)

211
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,435
(that she needs to see Consort Qing?)

212
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,275
(Could it be...)

213
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,315
Greetings, Consort Qing.

214
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,035
Why did you request

215
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,714
an audience with me?

216
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:02,555
What are you laughing at?

217
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:04,354
Could it be

218
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,435
that you're here to make a deal

219
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:07,354
with me?

220
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:08,874
I dare not do so.

221
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,155
Your Highness, I did everything

222
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:14,474
to share your burdens with you.

223
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,555
However, the mountain was treacherous.

224
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,635
Consort Qing, you're
a benevolent person.

225
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,754
I'm sure you can understand my feelings.

226
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,354
Don't worry.

227
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,035
I always dispense

228
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:27,315
rewards and punishments impartially.

229
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,155
Since you were running errands for me,

230
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,354
naturally, I would reward you.

231
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,074
However,

232
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:33,954
as for the reward you'll get,

233
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:35,474
it depends on

234
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,795
the news you've obtained for me.

235
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:41,635
Thank you, Your Highness.

236
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,354
Your Highness, everything you desire

237
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:51,994
is here.

238
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,555
What do you mean by this?

239
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,195
The priest in Jiuyi Mountain

240
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,594
resembles a noble,

241
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:15,114
and he's extremely powerful.

242
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,035
However, no one knew about his past.

243
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:19,435
When I was studying in Jiuyi Mountain,

244
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,474
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
summoned me several times

245
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,195
and encouraged me

246
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,474
to take the position of
the first disciple.

247
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:27,035
For that purpose,

248
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,834
he taught me about
the essentials of magic techniques.

249
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,874
High Priest even told me something

250
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:34,594
I didn't understand.

251
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,515
He aided me to be the first disciple

252
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,315
all because my surname was Bai.

253
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,555
If so,

254
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,834
why didn't you become
the first disciple?

255
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,234
It's because

256
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:45,635
I didn't intend to stay in the mountain.

257
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,234
Your Highness,
I wanted to stay with you.

258
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,675
Your Highness, I went

259
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:50,355
to Jiuyi Mountain

260
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:51,875
and focus solely on your task.

261
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,355
That's why I lost to Zhu Yan,

262
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:56,234
the princess of the Crimson Clan

263
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:56,794
on purpose.

264
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,514
If It weren't for
my strong determination,

265
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:02,714
I'm afraid I would've joined
the priest and his ranks,

266
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,155
given his excellent persuading skills.

267
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:06,714
Is he that powerful?

268
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,195
Yes, Your Highness.

269
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,675
Even General Qing Gang

270
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,034
has admiration

271
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,514
for him.

272
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:19,595
What else do you know?

273
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:21,714
Your Highness, please don't worry.

274
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,554
I will tell you

275
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:26,595
everything I know

276
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:28,195
without keeping any secrets.

277
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,915
Your Highness, I just hope

278
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:32,474
that you can keep your promise.

279
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:39,355
Someone.

280
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:41,115
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,034
Go to the kitchen

282
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,754
and tell Yu to come out.

283
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,875
Doesn't he know
what time it is right now?

284
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,075
How dare he still flirts
with Bai Xueying

285
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:49,554
inside the kitchen?

286
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,274
Go now.

287
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:52,554
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,115
Xuelu,

289
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,115
this is the first reward

290
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,514
I'm giving to you.

291
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:03,994
If you continue

292
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,954
to do as you're told,

293
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,355
don't worry.

294
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,355
I'll definitely give you everything

295
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,675
I've promised.

296
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:16,915
Thank you, Your Highness.

297
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:18,554
Go now.

298
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:27,554
Someone.

299
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:29,195
Prepare a carriage for me.

300
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:29,875
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:37,195
Xuelu.

302
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:48,875
General Qing,

303
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,155
you're being physically intimate

304
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,115
with me even though I'm not married yet.

305
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:52,314
Aren't you afraid

306
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:53,355
that people might gossip about you?

307
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,714
What exactly did you

308
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:56,034
tell Consort Qing?

309
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,714
I saw her ordering her servants

310
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:58,915
to prepare a carriage.

311
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:01,915
I just told her

312
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,075
about what I saw in the mountain,

313
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:04,835
especially the story

314
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,034
of that mysterious priest.

315
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,274
I told Her Highness the truth.

316
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,754
Since I couldn't be the first disciple,

317
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:14,915
my only bargaining chip

318
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,234
was the priest's unknown past.

319
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:16,915
Naturally,

320
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:19,115
I will utilize it to the fullest.

321
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,635
General Qing,

322
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:23,474
this is what I always do.

323
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,075
I'm only concerned about my interest.

324
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,835
I thought you witnessed it yourself
long ago?

325
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:28,835
No.

326
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:30,835
Xuelu,

327
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:33,714
that's not who you truly are.

328
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:36,395
I was touched by your words

329
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:37,395
that night.

330
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:40,474
I've been thinking for some time
after I went back.

331
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,514
If you wish to be successful,

332
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:44,754
entering the palace

333
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,314
isn't the only path you can take.

334
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:47,274
General Qing,

335
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:48,474
I think

336
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:49,395
you misunderstood

337
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,395
our relationship.

338
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:53,355
You should

339
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:54,234
be concerned about yourself.

340
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:55,994
Consort Qing already knew

341
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:57,595
that you'd deceived her.

342
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,514
I wonder how she'll deal with you?

343
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,115
General Qing,

344
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:03,435
under Her Highness's order,

345
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:05,675
you're to return to the territory
of the Azure Clan

346
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:07,714
and kneel in front
of the ancestral hall as punishment.

347
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,115
Yes, Your Highness.

348
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:17,314
Princess Xuelu,

349
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,554
I won't give up on you.

350
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,835
(I know you're sincere toward me.)

351
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,754
(But I'm sorry.)

352
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:33,915
(In this world,)

353
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,034
(I'm caught between)

354
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:36,355
(the conflict between)

355
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:38,115
(High Priest of Grand Preceptor)

356
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,034
(and Consort Qing.)

357
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,155
(Between Shi Ying and Shi Yu,)

358
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,514
(the one who inherits the throne)

359
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,635
(will be my future partner.)

360
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:48,554
(If that's the case,)

361
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:49,915
(General Qing, you can only)

362
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,554
(blame yourself)

363
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:52,835
(for falling for the wrong person.)

364
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,794
After I got back from Jiuyi Mountain,

365
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:00,075
I realized that my sister

366
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,675
was pretty pitiful too.

367
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,155
It's my first time disagreeing with you.

368
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:05,994
I think your sister

369
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:06,675
is...

370
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:17,195
Your Highness Shi Yu,

371
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:18,234
pardon me for this.

372
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,314
Stop right there.

373
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:31,155
I can walk by myself.

374
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:44,915
This is an oral edict from Consort Qing.

375
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:46,514
Although Princess Bai Xueying

376
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:47,714
is not betrothed yet,

377
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,714
her conduct is disorderly.

378
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,635
She is to be detained within her room,

379
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:52,355
never to leave the residence,

380
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:54,034
and never to write

381
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,355
to His Highness Shi Yu.

382
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,675
According to Bai Xuelu,

383
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,355
I can confirm

384
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,635
that the priest of Jiuyi Mountain

385
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,155
is that darned Shi Ying.

386
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,195
We have no time to waste.

387
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:12,075
Brother,

388
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,075
please send out the elite clan members

389
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:13,994
to head to Jiuyi Mountain

390
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,714
and silence him

391
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:17,794
before he becomes a pest.

392
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:21,195
He's actually still alive?

393
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:24,675
My Lord,

394
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:26,314
the envoy sent by the sage has arrived.

395
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:32,274
My Lord.

396
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,754
Consort Qing.

397
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:35,435
What do you need?

398
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:38,155
My Lord, the sage knows

399
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:39,714
(Wu Gu, one of Ten Sorcerers of Ice Clan)
that you're troubled by the fact

400
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:40,554
that Shi Ying is still alive.

401
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:42,794
That's why he sent me here.

402
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:44,435
The sage says

403
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,915
that everything is under his control.

404
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,915
My Lord, Consort Qing,

405
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:50,435
please calm down

406
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,395
and don't act recklessly.

407
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,754
But now, Shi Ying
has taken the sole female

408
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:56,474
of the Crimson Clan as his disciple.

409
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:58,195
Disciples from other tribes

410
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:59,595
were impressed by his abilities

411
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,274
and personality.

412
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:03,514
Even Qing Gang was deceived.

413
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,034
If, one day,

414
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,115
Shi Ying does want to retake the throne,

415
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:09,314
Shi Yu

416
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,155
will be no match for him.

417
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:12,794
This is our best opportunity

418
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:14,115
to strike.

419
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:15,435
Don't tell me we need

420
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:16,635
to keep a pest like him alive?

421
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:17,875
My Lord, the sage requested you

422
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:19,595
and Consort Qing to calm down.

423
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,514
He's more eager than you two

424
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,595
to witness

425
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:24,994
the Crown Prince's death.

426
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,280
(From Qing Gang: Consort Qing
has already known about your past.)

427
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:39,754
(Priest of Grand Preceptor,
Consort Qing has already)

428
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:40,714
(known about your past.)

429
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:41,794
(I'm afraid she would attempt
to kill you.)

430
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:43,875
(Please be careful.)

431
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:47,635
So,

432
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,314
you received a gift from Bai Xuelu

433
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:50,514
and a letter from Qing Gang.

434
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,554
Seems like you didn't become

435
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,714
their master in vain.

436
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:57,794
By the way,

437
00:22:58,314 --> 00:22:59,514
what did he write in the letter?

438
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:01,435
It said

439
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,514
that Consort Qing might try to harm me.

440
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:04,115
If so...

441
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,835
If so, why are you being
so nonchalant about it?

442
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,474
There's no need for me to panic

443
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,915
since it will happen eventually.

444
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:19,994
You're so distracted by your thoughts

445
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,115
every day.

446
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:23,314
Are you trying to give

447
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:24,994
His Highness Shi Yu to me?

448
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:26,714
Xuelu,

449
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:28,195
don't spout nonsense.

450
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:32,314
If you don't want that to happen,

451
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,994
you should eat well and recover faster.

452
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,794
You can fight for the empress's throne

453
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,034
with me once you've recovered.

454
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:43,514
Greetings, My Lord.

455
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:48,794
Father.

456
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,954
Father, since you're here to visit her,

457
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:53,234
I shall make a move first.

458
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:02,994
Why didn't she eat?

459
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:05,675
All of you may leave.

460
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:07,754
Yes, My Lord.

461
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,395
Xueying, how's your body coping?

462
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,954
I hired a physician

463
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:18,994
to examine you.

464
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,474
I'm not sick.

465
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,234
I don't need a physician.

466
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:56,794
I said it already.

467
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,395
I don't need a physician.

468
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,754
Are you sure about that?

469
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:07,155
Your Highness!

470
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,355
Your Highness Shi Yu,

471
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:19,675
it's been tough on you
for the past few days.

472
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:23,314
Your Highness must've suffered too.

473
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:26,635
Have a seat.

474
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,355
Your Highness, you should return.

475
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:37,635
If Consort Qing finds out

476
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:38,435
that you're outside,

477
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:39,794
she'll definitely punish you again.

478
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:41,994
Mother only said you weren't allowed
to leave the residence.

479
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,635
She didn't say that
I couldn't visit you.

480
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:45,195
Even if she finds out,

481
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:46,314
I'm not doing anything wrong.

482
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,915
But Your Highness, you should
still be careful.

483
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:50,754
I know.

484
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:52,835
I've already come up with an idea.

485
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:54,994
Since your father has agreed to my plan,

486
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,714
I can put on a disguise
before I visit you.

487
00:25:58,274 --> 00:25:59,234
This time, I'm a physician.

488
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,554
Next time, I can be a servant.

489
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:02,754
After that, I can even be a guard.

490
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:03,915
I'm sure it'll be fun.

491
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:05,994
I think you should

492
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:07,274
eat more to replenish your strength.

493
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:37,994
Your Highness.

494
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:39,994
You're back.

495
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:41,514
How was he?

496
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,635
According to my men,

497
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,714
General Qing was spared

498
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,794
after kneeling in front
of the ancestral hall for some days.

499
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,314
The Azure Clan still
needs General Qing Gang

500
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,034
to lead their soldiers.

501
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:53,595
Naturally, they don't
dare to punish him severely.

502
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:55,034
General Qing even dispatched his men
to deliver

503
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:56,554
a set of strategies to you,
Your Highness.

504
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,760
(Tactical Strategy)

505
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:06,554
A set of strategies? I won't read that.

506
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:31,635
Higher.

507
00:27:58,474 --> 00:27:58,994
My pear!

508
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,440
♪The sky is clear, and spring is over♪

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,080

Yeah. This is me.

518
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:12,155
I look like this?

519
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:14,034
You don't like it?

520
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,314
Give it to me. I'll make another pair.

521
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:18,714
I like it.

00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:20,480

(Tactical Strategy)

526
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:45,954
Zhu Yan,

527
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:48,115
come here.

528
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:50,155
Yes, Master.

529
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:08,554
Master, please enjoy your meal.

530
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,075
Wait.

531
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,034
Join me.

532
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:24,474
You mean me?

533
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:27,754
Do you see anyone else?

534
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,234
I won't stand on ceremony then.

535
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,960
(Two years later)

536
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:49,195
Don't talk.

537
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,635
Master, I know what you're going to say.

538
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,675
Although

539
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,675
you could use the magic techniques
of all Six Clans,

540
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,035
you didn't master their essence.

541
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:12,115
The technique of passing through walls
and burrowing underground

542
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,675
came from the Dark Clan.

543
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:16,354
Those adept at such techniques
can travel at the speed of light

544
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:17,555
while

545
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,394
you were as slow as a turtle.

546
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:20,995
Holding one's breath underwater,

547
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:22,115
harnessing fire from the palm,

548
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:23,635
and turning rocks into gold

549
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,515
are just elementary magic techniques.

550
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:27,314
Although you know how to cast them,

551
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,434
you're not familiar enough with them.

552
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:31,075
You can only cast them

553
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:32,434
at the very last second.

554
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:35,955
You need to brush up on your skills.

555
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,394
As for the transformation spell,

556
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:40,675
you wanted to transform into
a fierce beast

557
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:41,714
and scare the wolves away.

558
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,555
In the end, you transformed into
a goat instead.

559
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:47,075
If it wasn't a practice,

560
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:49,995
I'm afraid the wolves would've
devoured you.

561
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:57,035
Master, did you think

562
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,834
I resembled you?

563
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:02,914
What I wanted to say was,

564
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,995
you tried to cast
the transformation spell

565
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:06,675
and fight against the wolves

566
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,714
instead of escaping
by burrowing underground

567
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:09,434
when you were surrounded by wolves.

568
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:11,635
I applaud your bravery.

569
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:16,354
Although I was reckless,

570
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:17,434
luckily,

571
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,754
you acknowledged my bravery.

572
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:21,314
As a teacher,

573
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:23,874
I can't judge you by your results.

574
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,234
Of course I need to know

575
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,434
the cons of your success

576
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:27,955
and the pros of your failures.

577
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:29,075
However,

578
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:30,475
judging by your skills,

579
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,834
it's too early for you
to try out the transformation spell.

580
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,675
Even if you cast it forcefully,

581
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,195
it'll only end up

582
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,675
a mess

583
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:39,314
and you'll put yourself

584
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,075
in danger instead.

585
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:43,754
You must never do it again.

586
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:51,155
Master, you do know me the best.

587
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:53,475
I will write to Extreme Wind City

588
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:55,075
and show off to them.

589
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:56,635
Stop right there.

590
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,274
I don't think

591
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:01,274
it's necessary to write to them
for this.

592
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:02,314
I'm afraid

593
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:04,075
I'll be a fierce devil

594
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:05,515
in the letter

595
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:07,635
you will write to them, right?

596
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:16,035
Master, since when did you start

597
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:18,354
to care about other people's opinions?

598
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:30,834
Stop messing around.

599
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:35,314
Stop messing around.

600
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,434
Magical artifacts and rare treasures
are stored in this hall.

601
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:44,914
If you like them,

602
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,434
you may choose one of them

603
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,595
as your first artifact.

604
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,195
You cannot wield this unless

605
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:24,955
you have the power of a priest.

606
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:26,115
I think

607
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,314
you should put it back.

608
00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:31,394
Does it have a name then?

609
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:32,714
It's new.

610
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:33,995
It doesn't have a name for now.

611
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:35,794
Master,

612
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:37,555
why don't you name it now?

613
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,075
I'll retrieve it

614
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,155
once I'm finished with my training.

615
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:45,874
This artifact can summon tidal waves

616
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:47,394
and it's shaped like a crescent.

617
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,635
I'll name it Tidebringer.

618
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,515
It represents the crescent moon

619
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:54,115
that summons the tide.

620
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:06,874
(Master,)

621
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:08,595
(you need to name the others too.)

622
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:18,075
Master,

623
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:19,555
what about this?

624
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:22,914
This?

625
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,115
And

626
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:26,874
this?

627
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:27,675
Stop your nonsense.

628
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:30,434
There are tens of thousands
of artifacts here.

629
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:31,955
How can I name them all?

630
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,354
Just choose the one you like.

631
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,195
Tens of thousands of them?

632
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,115
I need to pick one carefully then.

633
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,234
This is it.

634
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:52,874
You actually...

635
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:55,354
You actually chose this?

636
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:58,314
That's right.

637
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:00,995
Master, please name it.
