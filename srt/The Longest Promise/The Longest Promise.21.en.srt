00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:58,117
(To: Shi Ying)
He said

20
00:01:58,397 --> 00:01:59,156
he hopes Princess

21
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:01,076
can enjoy the worldly pleasures

22
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:03,997
and stop thinking
about what happened in the mountains.

23
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,005
(Great couple)

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,647
(To: Shi Ying)

25
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:27,436
Yan'er,

26
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,156
Qing Gang is exceptionally talented.

27
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:31,316
Although

28
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,916
you don't have romantic feelings
for each other now,

29
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:34,837
your relationship will naturally improve

30
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,117
if you spend more time together.

31
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:38,476
Yan'er,

32
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:40,436
even Jiuyi Mountain
has sent a congratulatory gift.

33
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,957
It proves that
your master recognizes Qing Gang.

34
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:43,916
That's right.

35
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,476
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,

36
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,716
allow me to take my leave.

37
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:51,916
Divine envoy,

38
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:53,237
- this way, please.
- This way.

39
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,277
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,

40
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:23,036
something bad has happened.

41
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:24,196
Princess took a horse

42
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,636
and left the residence.

43
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:26,636
What?

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,020
(Extreme Wind City)

45
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:11,997
Yuan,

46
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:13,316
don't follow me.

47
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:14,916
I want to be alone.

48
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,276
You knew Kongsang's swordsmanship?

49
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,396
And you're very skilled at it.

50
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:27,917
Who taught you?

51
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,477
If you come back with me,

52
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:33,316
I'll answer all of your questions.

53
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:37,076
Princess,

54
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,037
your Keeper Yuan is here.

55
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,276
You can tell me anything.

56
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:44,797
Didn't you want to leave too?

57
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,276
Are you leaving me too?

58
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,516
No.

59
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:53,956
I'll always stay by your side.

60
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:58,717
But

61
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,037
why did Master do that?

62
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,717
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
is a man of the Dao,

63
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,396
while you're destined

64
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:08,037
to experience worldly affairs,

65
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:08,836
including birth, aging, illness,
and death,

66
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:10,196
as well as marriage.

67
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,157
The marriage alliance between Azure Clan
and Crimson Clan is dictated by parents

68
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:13,836
and matchmakers.

69
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,396
Since the Priest of Grand Preceptor
can't stop it,

70
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:17,756
he can only offer his best wishes.

71
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:21,396
But

72
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:22,436
he can at least refrain

73
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:23,876
from writing any wedding blessings.

74
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,117
I didn't think he would do that.

75
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:28,717
I thought

76
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:30,357
he knew me.

77
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,076
Yuan, no matter what,

78
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,636
I'll definitely not marry Qing Gang.

79
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,636
I know

80
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,956
if I return now,

81
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,037
Father and Mother

82
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,436
will force me to comply.

83
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:44,396
Do you have any idea

84
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,836
where I can escape
from this trouble temporarily?

85
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,316
If you really don't want to go back,

86
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:50,557
I do have a place

87
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,157
where you can stay for several days.

88
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:53,396
Until you and His Lordship

89
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:54,436
have calmed down,

90
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,117
we can discuss things thoroughly.

91
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:19,516
How lovely.

92
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,636
Madam, have some water.

93
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,237
Thank you, miss.

94
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:42,196
Madam,

95
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,756
you've been living here
for a long time, haven't you?

96
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:48,436
It's been over two hundred years.

97
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,037
As you can see,

98
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:54,316
all of us here

99
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,917
are useless people
who can't make a living.

100
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,037
We're displaced from home.

101
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,396
We could only starve to death.

102
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:07,677
If it weren't for the kind person
who took us in,

103
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,756
we would have starved to death.

104
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:16,756
(It's been over two hundred years.)

105
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:19,316
(Yuan has always been cautious)

106
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:21,157
(and lived a stable life.)

107
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,597
(I didn't expect
he would go against Father)

108
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,677
(for the first time for me.)

109
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,477
(I wonder if he'll face any punishment.)

110
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:30,436
(Yuan has been gone for so long)

111
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,276
(and hasn't returned.)

112
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,836
(I wonder if something has happened.)

113
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:41,396
Keeper Yuan,

114
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:42,876
you've been at the Crimson Residence

115
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,276
for over two hundred years, right?

116
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:46,717
That's several times longer

117
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,677
than my lifespan.

118
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,436
No one knows the rules

119
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:51,477
in the royal residence better than you!

120
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,396
You even revised

121
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,636
most of them personally.

122
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,396
When others broke the rules,

123
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,756
you were the one to discipline
and regulate them.

124
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:03,316
I truly never imagined

125
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,276
that in the end,

126
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:07,917
it would be you who broke the rules!

127
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,037
Have you forgotten

128
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,677
what a grave offense it is

129
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,597
to secretly harbor a princess?

130
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,076
I admit my wrongdoing.

131
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,876
But Princess is unwilling to proceed
with this marriage.

132
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:20,717
She hopes Your Lordship won't force her.

133
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:21,516
You...

134
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,396
With her picking and choosing
for so long,

135
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,756
her mother and I can't find

136
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,077
a more suitable candidate
than Qing Gang.

137
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,396
Do you really want to watch Yan'er

138
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:37,916
spend her remaining years in loneliness?

139
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,437
Don't rely on your status,

140
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,396
thinking you can go against your master.

141
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:46,036
Even if you've watched me grow up,

142
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:47,876
I can still punish you severely

143
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:51,156
if you don't disclose her whereabouts.

144
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:54,676
Your Lordship, please rest assured.

145
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:56,916
Princess is safe with me.

146
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,396
But until she willingly returns home,

147
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,396
I won't reveal her whereabouts.

148
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,156
I'm willing to accept

149
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,796
any punishment you give.

150
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:08,237
All right.

151
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:10,117
All right!

152
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:11,477
Someone!

153
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:13,357
Yes, Your Lordship.

154
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,036
Whip him forty times!

155
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:15,916
- Yes, Your Lordship!
- Yes, Your Lordship!

156
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,396
Yuan, you're finally back.

157
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:35,357
Princess.

158
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:38,237
Yuan!

159
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,276
How did you get injured like this?

160
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:46,117
Did Father send someone to punish you?

161
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,477
It's just some minor injuries.

162
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,237
Don't worry about it.

163
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,676
You must not blame His Lordship.

164
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,477
He's only anxious

165
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,756
because you didn't return.

166
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:03,957
It's my fault for implicating you.

167
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:11,197
You didn't cause me any trouble before.

168
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:12,636
But if you let tears

169
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,156
fall on my wounds now,

170
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,237
that would truly cause me pain.

171
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,916
Have you heard of rubbing salt
on a wound?

172
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:22,756
Yuan,

173
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,077
I'm not good at this.

174
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:27,437
If it hurts you,

175
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:28,556
please tell me.

176
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,036
It's all right.Thank you.

177
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:39,357
Yuan,

178
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,437
you promised you'll tell me

179
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,156
how you know swordsmanship.

180
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,237
Can you tell me now?

181
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:48,556
She taught me

182
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:50,997
swordsmanship.

183
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:53,237
She?

184
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:55,317
Was she your lover,

185
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:56,437
the one you mentioned to me

186
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,516
before?

187
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,717
So she was also your master.

188
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:08,597
Yuan, you've found a good master.

189
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,796
Actually, your master is doing it
for your sake.

190
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:15,597
You can't spend your whole life
cultivating on Jiuyi Mountain.

191
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,597
But he promised me before.

192
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,636
Deep down, you know

193
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,317
your parents wouldn't allow that.

194
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,357
If you are willing,

195
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,796
Qing Gang is not a bad choice.

196
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:41,276
I think

197
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,516
your master thinks the same too.

198
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,556
Actually, I know it in my heart.

199
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:55,396
If we talk about marriage,

200
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,117
Qing Gang is my best choice.

201
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:01,437
But if you were my master,

202
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:02,837
what would you do?

203
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,197
Would you do what he did?

204
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:05,676
Would you send seemingly polite

205
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:07,717
but actually distant wedding wishes?

206
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,317
No, you wouldn't.

207
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,117
You would come
to Extreme Wind City to find me,

208
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,317
persuade me and help me to understand.

209
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,597
If I really don't want to,

210
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:19,837
you would also find a way

211
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:21,636
to help me escape this marriage.

212
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:23,597
Maybe everyone
has different personalities,

213
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,916
and their ways of behaving also vary.

214
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:30,516
No.

215
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:33,837
It's because I hold

216
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:34,837
a different position in your hearts.

217
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:37,997
I used to think

218
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,197
that the relationship
between my master and me

219
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,556
was as close as ours,

220
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,197
where we could talk about anything.

221
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,197
But in Master's heart,

222
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:50,876
I'll always be an outsider.

223
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,957
Once I leave the sect,

224
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:56,396
I'll have no connection
with him anymore,

225
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:57,796
like strangers.

226
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,516
Actually, I have already figured it out.

227
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,276
I won't have any more illusions.

228
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,036
I wish my master a breakthrough

229
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,117
in Jiuyi Mountain as soon as possible.

230
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,357
It's good if you can think this way.

231
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,036
At least, it'll bring some relief
to your heart.

232
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:17,756
Yuan,

233
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,796
besides my father and mother,

234
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,837
you're the closest person to me

235
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,156
in this world.

236
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,916
I can only accompany you

237
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:40,396
and be your listener.

238
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,237
But your parents are genuinely
concerned about you.

239
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:46,636
Why don't you go

240
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:47,597
and have a talk with His Lordship

241
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:49,357
and calmly

242
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,837
express your thoughts?

243
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:01,796
Crimson King has arrived!

244
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,117
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

245
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,396
Special Envoy,
it must be a rough journey.

246
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:18,556
Thank you for your hard work.

247
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,636
The military funds are here.

248
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,117
Please check it, Your Lordship.

249
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:27,756
Open them.

250
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,717
Your Lordship, this...

251
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:34,477
- What is...
- This...

252
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:47,197
Special Envoy,

253
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:49,357
is there some kind of mistakes?

254
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,597
Why are these chests empty?

255
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,717
The marriage alliance
between Azure and Crimson

256
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,796
has not been completed yet.

257
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:56,597
Of course,

258
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,077
there are no military funds
in the chests.

259
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:01,636
You sat there all day

260
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:02,957
feigning ignorance.

261
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,597
Are you making a fool of us?

262
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:05,876
My fellow soldiers

263
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,197
don't have a grain of rice to cook!

264
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,756
You're forcing us to revolt.

265
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:10,676
Am I right?

266
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:11,197
- That's right?
- Yes.

267
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:11,957
How dare you.

268
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:14,717
Are you threatening Jialan?

269
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,396
Enough!

270
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:22,997
Chi Song.

271
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:25,317
Yes, Your Lordship.

272
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:26,636
Return home.

273
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,516
Ask my wife to quickly send
the stored grain from the residence

274
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,276
to the military camp
to provide urgent relief.

275
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:31,837
Hurry.

276
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:32,717
Your Lordship,

277
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,916
Her Ladyship has already instructed us

278
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:35,997
to send the grain from home

279
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:37,036
to the military camp.

280
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,477
There are no more food reserves.

281
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:47,636
Special Envoy,

282
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:50,636
the stability of the military
is a major issue.

283
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:52,997
I ask that you

284
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,516
and Consort Qing release
the military funds as soon as possible.

285
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,597
Special Envoy,
take it as a favor I ask of you.

286
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:04,636
I've already said it.

287
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:06,717
If the marriage is not completed,

288
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:08,876
there will be no funds.

289
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:13,477
A military that can't even win a battle.

290
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:19,556
This flag is a total disgrace.

291
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:21,437
You...

292
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:24,916
You...

293
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,796
What are you trying to do?

294
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,357
Are you rebelling?

295
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,516
What are you doing?

296
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,036
Stop it this instant!

297
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:30,916
Your Lordship,

298
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,997
they're pushing us to our death!

299
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,276
This is a crime

300
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:38,077
that'll get the whole clan executed!

301
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,597
The whole clan will be executed?

302
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,437
Even if that happens,
we'll drag someone with us!

303
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:45,516
Stop it!

304
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:49,477
- Yan'er?
- Father.

305
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:52,317
Why didn't you tell me

306
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,036
that you bear such a heavy burden?

307
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:57,997
It's merely a marriage alliance
between the Azure and Crimson Clans.

308
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,237
Tell your master

309
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:01,756
that I accept it.

310
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:02,916
Yan'er!

311
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:16,756
Your Highness, this is...

312
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,237
Open and see it.

313
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,276
This hairpin

314
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:29,957
is specially made

315
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:31,836
according to the silver hairpin

316
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,157
given to me

317
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,356
when His Majesty made me a consort.

318
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:35,997
Do you like it?

319
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:38,076
Your Highness,

320
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,036
this hairpin is indeed delicate
and exquisite.

321
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:42,677
You're a clever person.

322
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:45,116
You should know what's on my mind.

323
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,076
Actually,

324
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,877
it doesn't matter

325
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:51,477
if it's the primary
or secondary consort.

326
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,197
What do you think?

327
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:56,556
My only wish

328
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:58,276
is to serve you.

329
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,477
I don't have other thoughts.

330
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,717
I also don't care
about primary or secondary consort.

331
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:04,637
Your Highness,

332
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,756
General Qing Gang has arrived.

333
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,076
Since Your Highness
has other engagements,

334
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:12,917
I shall take my leave.

335
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:13,836
You can stay.

336
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:15,197
Let him come in.

337
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,197
Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:24,596
Greetings, Your Highness.

339
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,356
I already know

340
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:30,957
about Zhu Yan refusing the marriage.

341
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,197
But you don't have to worry,
General Qing Gang.

342
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:34,957
Crimson King

343
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:36,756
will comply sooner or later.

344
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:37,717
Your Highness,

345
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,717
I came

346
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,397
to ask that you retract the edict.

347
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:45,877
I'm not willing to marry
the Princess of Crimson Clan.

348
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:47,756
I thought

349
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,316
you get along with Zhu Yan.

350
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,076
Why aren't you willing to marry her?

351
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,556
I do have a good relationship
with Princess Zhu Yan.

352
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,717
But it's not a romantic one.

353
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:58,477
She's not the one I love.

354
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:03,796
I'm willing to fight for the Azure Clan.

355
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,116
But when it comes to marriage,

356
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,957
I only want to be with the one I love

357
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,276
and grow old together with her.

358
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,997
Xuelu, did you hear that?

359
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,276
General Qing Gang

360
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,717
has someone he loves.

361
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,397
Then I would like to know

362
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:34,197
who's the woman you love.

363
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,076
My feelings were not reciprocated.

364
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,397
The person I love

365
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,437
has no feelings for me.

366
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,316
She remains firm

367
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:54,917
in her aspirations.

368
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:58,316
I can't change

369
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,157
her mind.

370
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:05,677
I only hope she can fulfill her wishes.

371
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,677
But I'm unwilling to give up feelings.

372
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,197
I'm willing to remain unmarried for life,

373
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,796
lonely until old age.

374
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:20,437
How dare you!

375
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:22,516
What are you saying?

376
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:24,316
Aren't you afraid

377
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:25,316
that I'll strip you of your position

378
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,596
as the Shadow Warrior General?

379
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,516
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

380
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:32,197
You...

381
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,197
Your Highness, don't be upset.

382
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,356
Don't let this matter

383
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,157
affect your health.

384
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:40,917
General Qing,

385
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,036
you're truly foolish.

386
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,157
I've heard that many young talents

387
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:47,596
in the Six Ministries

388
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:48,477
are envious of your position

389
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:50,197
as the Shadow Warrior General.

390
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,637
It's because of your bravery
and martial arts skills,

391
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,796
the loyalty of the Shadow Warriors,

392
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:56,836
and the protection of Consort Qing

393
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:58,237
and the Azure Clan

394
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,717
that they haven't found a chance
to seize the opportunity.

395
00:21:02,197 --> 00:21:02,917
But now,

396
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,877
because of your momentary hesitation,
you're giving up everything.

397
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:08,316
Won't it give
those ambitious individuals

398
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:10,637
in the Six Ministries a chance?

399
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:13,157
By then,

400
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,796
you'll deeply regret it.

401
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:19,556
However,

402
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,516
please don't blame Qing Gang,
Your Highness.

403
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:23,637
In my humble opinion,

404
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,157
General Qing can tell
between right and wrong

405
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:27,397
and is a reasonable person.

406
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,957
But that Princess Zhu Yan
of Extreme Wind City

407
00:21:32,316 --> 00:21:33,356
has always been arrogant

408
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:34,356
and contemptuous of others.

409
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:36,036
She's someone hard to deal with.

410
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,237
She was the one
who refused this marriage.

411
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:41,637
So she got General Qing Gang

412
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:42,796
to cover for her.

413
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,237
This matter has nothing to do
with Princess Zhu Yan.

414
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:46,276
I was the one...

415
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,556
The Special Envoy requests an audience.

416
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:54,677
Greetings, Your Highness.

417
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,516
I have an urgent matter to report.

418
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:59,076
What is it?

419
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,397
What?

420
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:08,076
Zhu Yan has accepted
the marriage proposal.

421
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:44,851
(Desirable marriage and great couple)

422
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:51,637
I did what you want.

423
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:55,316
Now,

424
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:57,957
I'm marrying Qing Gang.

425
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:39,197
All right.

426
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,836
Everything is finally over.

427
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,197
Wishing Tree,

428
00:24:58,356 --> 00:24:59,116
what happened to you?

429
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:10,076
What's going on?

430
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:12,596
Why can't I go in anymore?

431
00:25:14,437 --> 00:25:15,036
Yes.

432
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:17,477
Without the support
of the High Priest's power,

433
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,516
Yan'er can no longer enter the barrier

434
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:22,836
nor see me.

435
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,036
Why won't you let me in?

436
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:35,677
Yan'er,

437
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:37,836
you're still as foolish.

438
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:38,997
Wishing Tree!

439
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:40,917
Stop wasting your efforts.

440
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:44,997
Just great.

441
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,596
Master sent me his wedding wishes.

442
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:49,677
Now this place

443
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:51,237
won't even let me in anymore.

444
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:53,997
Master.

445
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,596
Master!

446
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:02,796
I'm getting married.

447
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:08,157
Can you hear me?

448
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:09,756
Your only disciple

449
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:10,917
is marrying someone.

450
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,997
You can never see me anymore.

451
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:23,437
I know that.

452
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:25,637
Once you leave,

453
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:28,116
you'll never come back anymore.

454
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,316
Master,

455
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:35,516
why won't you let me in?

456
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:40,677
All right, then.

457
00:26:42,197 --> 00:26:44,116
Since you sent me your wedding wishes,

458
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:48,836
why don't you come
and attend the wedding reception?

459
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:51,397
I'll send you the wedding invitation.

460
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,877
I'll invite you! I'll just invite you!

461
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:57,596
Master.

462
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:05,637
Master.

463
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:08,997
Master,

464
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:11,197
do you really want me
to marry someone else?

465
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:12,477
Do you really

466
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,036
not want to see me again?

467
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:15,756
Do you really

468
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:20,516
not care about me one bit?

469
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,356
Master.

470
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:28,917
In your heart,

471
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,397
I'll always be an outsider.

472
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:48,756
How could I possibly...

473
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:51,917
You're the person I care about the most

474
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:53,477
in this mortal world.

475
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:55,477
But...

476
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:59,556
But I can't keep you by my side.

477
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,596
It'll only bring trouble to you

478
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,356
and your people.

479
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:06,677
But Master,

480
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,157
I truly worry about you.

481
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:13,957
When you were the Crown Prince,

482
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,036
you were all alone.

483
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:21,197
When you're
the Priest of Grand Preceptor now,

484
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,836
you're still alone.

485
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,596
No matter what happens,

486
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,197
you can only face it alone.

487
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,197
Master.

488
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:49,997
From now on,

489
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,437
I can no longer stay by your side.

490
00:28:57,437 --> 00:28:58,796
When you're alone,

491
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:06,036
remember to smile often, be happy.

492
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:10,397
I ask the same of you.

493
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,997
Please don't worry

494
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:17,516
about your master who always hurt you.

495
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,237

Ying,

530
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:48,877
I managed to find out some information.

531
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:50,717
The Ice Clan people

532
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:51,677
are very elusive and mysterious
in their actions.

533
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:53,197
If they disguise themselves
as Kongsang people,

534
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:53,796
it would be difficult to identify them.

535
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:54,596
The birds

536
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:55,957
have only seen their traces

537
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:57,516
near Xifeng County, Songzhou,

538
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:58,677
and nearby Riyue Lake in Western Huang.

539
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,756
Songzhou is the territory
of the Azure Clan

540
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,076
and is the closest port

541
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:02,997
to the northern border.

542
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,477
It should be the place
where the Ice Clan will land.

543
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:07,076
I'll ask the High Priest

544
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,997
to send a letter to Jialan
to strengthen its defenses,

545
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:10,637
to prevent more Ice Clan people

546
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:11,796
from infiltrating Kongsang.

547
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:14,197
But the one

548
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,116
we're looking for shouldn't be there.

549
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:19,356
Let's go.

550
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,596
We will set off for Xifeng County
right away.

551
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:23,556
In my opinion,

552
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:24,677
why don't

553
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,637
we first investigate the Western Huang

554
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:29,036
and pass through the Extreme Wind City,
which is on the way to Riyue Lake?

555
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:31,637
While at it,
we can also check on Yan'er...

556
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,157
I mean, children often go missing

557
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,157
nearby Riyue Lake.

558
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:35,796
You should be able to distinguish

559
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:38,076
what matters more.

560
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:41,237
Then we'll go around Extreme Wind City.

561
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:42,997
Don't interfere in her life.

562
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,477
Well, it all comes down to where I fly
when the time comes.

563
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,756
Princess,

564
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:02,316
for you to agree
to the marriage alliance

565
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,237
means you've grown up.

566
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,836
Actually, it's not that you need me.

567
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:09,397
It was me who's still worried about you.

568
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,516
Seeing that you've found

569
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,236
a good husband

570
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,036
and knowing that you're truly happy.

571
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:15,516
It is considered accountable

572
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:16,997
to both others and myself.

573
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:18,797
It isn't like that, Yuan.

574
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,277
You've done so much for me.

575
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:23,757
I wish

576
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:25,636
to do something for you too.

577
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:46,636
Princess,

578
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,196
what are you doing?

579
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:53,036
Yuan,

580
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:53,997
it has been many years

581
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:55,797
since you last met the person you loved.

582
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:57,076
I previously learned

583
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,516
the technique of Paper Crane Seeker.

584
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,957
As long as you tell me her name,

585
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:00,917
the paper crane

586
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:01,676
can find her whereabouts.

587
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,397
She was with me
during my most painful times.

588
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,236
Only she understood my worries.

589
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:07,676
She accompanied me

590
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:08,716
through the toughest moments.

591
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:10,837
I do think of her every day.

592
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,076
But she was a Kongsang woman

593
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:14,716
who passed away many years ago.

594
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:17,676
I'm sorry, Yuan.

595
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:19,957
I've brought up
your painful memories again.

596
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:23,196
It has been two hundred years.

597
00:35:24,357 --> 00:35:25,357
I've bid farewell to too many people.

598
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:27,516
I have long grown indifferent
to parting in life and death.

599
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,716
Thank you for concerning about me.

600
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,516
How about you teach me

601
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,477
the technique transforming paper cranes?

602
00:35:39,397 --> 00:35:40,397
After we Merfolk pass away,

603
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:42,357
our souls will return to the Biluo Sea.

604
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:44,357
I want to transform some paper cranes

605
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:45,636
and let them fly to the Biluo Sea

606
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,357
to find my old acquaintances.

607
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:49,277
It would be some kind of comfort, I guess.

608
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:50,716
All right.

609
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,516
I hope Yuan's acquaintances
can rest in peace.

610
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:24,837
(Yao Yi,)

611
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:27,196
(did you see the paper cranes
in the sky?)

612
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:29,076
(We had agreed to meet)

613
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:29,957
(in the next life.)

614
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,277
(But it's only been two hundred years,)

615
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,076
(and I'm constantly thinking
about someone else.)

616
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:37,277
(Forgive me.)

617
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,397
(What should I do)

618
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,757
(to make Yuan feel better?)

619
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,516
Oh, Yuan.

620
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:49,116
You always carry this thing with you.

621
00:36:50,036 --> 00:36:50,957
Is it

622
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:53,196
something she gave you too?

623
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:56,196
Yes.

624
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,636
This is my most precious possession.

625
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:47,397
(Perhaps)

626
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,317
(only by letting him meet)

627
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:50,437
(the one he loves in his heart)

628
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:52,837
(can he find comfort.)

629
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:13,837
"Yesterday's thoughts

630
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:15,397
are realized today.

631
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:16,877
The previous owner of this object

632
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:18,676
returns to the world."

633
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:20,757
Transform!

634
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,997
How come there's no change at all?

635
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:31,917
I forgot.

636
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:33,437
This illusion can only be seen by Yuan,

637
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:34,556
no one else.

638
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:37,076
I hope Yuan can feel some comfort

639
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,556
after seeing this girl.

640
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:45,757
Where did I drop it?

641
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:52,676
Yuan.

642
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:18,277
You are...

643
00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:23,877
I've returned.

644
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:26,556
You...

645
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:29,156
Yuan.

646
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:31,556
I have truly returned.

647
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:46,997
It can't be...

648
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:49,676
It can't be you.

649
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:54,196
Am I dreaming?

650
00:39:59,236 --> 00:39:59,957
I saw the paper crane

651
00:40:00,036 --> 00:40:00,917
you wrote for me.

652
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:03,036
So I came back to find you.

653
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,317
(Don't tell me it was the pearl)

654
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:08,116
(that brought Yao Yi back.)

655
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:15,236
Yuan,

656
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:20,076
why do you look worried?

657
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:24,437
Tell me.

658
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,676
Let me share the burden with you.

659
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:34,477
Yao Yi.

660
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,196
(It seems the spell really worked.)

661
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:10,477
Even in dreams,

662
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,596
are you not willing

663
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,797
to let me see your face again?

664
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:22,556
Even so,

665
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,636
I would rather never wake up.

666
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:44,156
Chi Yuan!

667
00:42:44,636 --> 00:42:45,596
What an outrageous behavior!

668
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:46,277
- That's right.
- What is this?

669
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,116
What are you doing?

670
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:48,556
Father!

671
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:49,596
I...

672
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:02,957
Princess?

673
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:04,036
Yuan.

674
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,277
How dare you dishonor the Princess!

675
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:08,997
Father,

676
00:43:09,196 --> 00:43:10,156
it's not Yuan's fault.

677
00:43:10,437 --> 00:43:11,397
It was my fault alone!
