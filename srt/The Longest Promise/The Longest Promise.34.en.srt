19
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:56,825
Master,

20
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,506
as long as I'm around,

21
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,585
I won't let you kill Yuan!

22
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:01,626
Zhu Yan!

23
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,465
Did you even listen to me?

24
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,346
I did!

25
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,305
Then why are you still
defending him?

26
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:07,626
Get out of the way!

27
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:09,386
Because...

28
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:10,585
Because...

29
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,266
Because I like Yuan.

30
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:29,426
What did you say?

31
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:30,905
Don't spout nonsense.

32
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,065
I'm not spouting nonsense.

33
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,106
Master,

34
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:36,426
back then,

35
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,345
I felt extremely guilty

36
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:39,905
about the Crown Prince's passing.

37
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,025
Yuan was the one who told me

38
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:46,025
about the existence of
the Time-reversing Spell.

39
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,866
When you finally acknowledged me

40
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,946
and took me as your student,

41
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,266
Yuan was the only one

42
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,185
who was willing to share my joy with me.

43
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:56,706
When you chased me
out of Jiuyi Mountain,

44
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,025
Yuan was the one who stood by my side

45
00:02:58,065 --> 00:02:59,426
during my lowest moment.

46
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:01,226
Without Yuan,

47
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,146
I would've given up long ago.

48
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:06,146
I would never come to this mountain,

49
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,386
encounter you,

50
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:10,465
or get to where I am

51
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:11,666
today.

52
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:20,345
Yan'er, you don't need to
deceive your master

53
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,065
in order to save me.

54
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,305
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

55
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,666
the person Yan'er truly loves is...

56
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:24,426
It's Yuan!

57
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:27,185
My talent is limited.

58
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,426
I know I can't compare myself
to you, Master.

59
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,345
I'll only

60
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:32,426
drag you down

61
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,546
and cause you to be hurt.

62
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:37,266
It was Yuan.

63
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,065
Yuan told me this.

64
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,266
Even if I could never

65
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,386
catch up to you,

66
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:46,266
he was willing

67
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,706
to stay by my side.

68
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:50,905
Master, if you don't believe me,

69
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,785
you can ask around
in the Extreme Wind City.

70
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,106
Everyone knows

71
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,386
that the Azure Clan canceled
their marriage

72
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,146
because they saw me
having a heart-to-heart conversation

73
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,826
in the garden with Yuan.

74
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:07,025
So,

75
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,905
it was my wishful thinking all along.

76
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:14,666
Yan'er.

77
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:15,426
Master,

78
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,145
this was my personal matter.

79
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,546
I shouldn't have told you that.

80
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,145
However, I had no choice
due to the circumstances.

81
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,986
Master, I just hope that
you can let Yuan go.

82
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:33,505
Yan'er.

83
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:38,466
From now on,

84
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,065
Yuan and I will lead a reclusive life.

85
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,305
We won't let anyone
take advantage of us again.

86
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:55,145
Yan'er, stop it.

87
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,346
It's already too late.

88
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,586
The Evil Star has already appeared.

89
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:03,026
I have to eliminate

90
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,866
Zhi Yuan, the Sea Emperor,

91
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:06,185
even if

92
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,705
he's the person you love.

93
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:54,825
Yuan!

94
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:24,705
(Sprawling Roots?)

95
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,505
(Yan'er actually mastered)

96
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,705
(Sprawling Roots for his sake?)

97
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:31,026
Zhu Yan,

98
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:32,385
your Sprawling Roots

99
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,586
cannot guard against
my Celestial Assault.

100
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:34,666
Get out of the way!

101
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:36,426
Master, we'll know

102
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,426
when you give it a try.

103
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:40,745
I won't show you any mercy!

104
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:41,906
Fine.

105
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:44,786
If so, I shall perish together

106
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:46,666
with Yuan.

107
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,145
Fine.

108
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:31,825
You said

109
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,545
you wanted to perish together with him?

110
00:08:57,826 --> 00:08:58,385
Yan'er.

111
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,306
Thank the heavens.

112
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:03,466
You're finally awake.

113
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:04,425
You had me for a second there.

114
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:05,785
Here.

115
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:07,625
Where's Yan'er?

116
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:12,866
Yan'er.

117
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,066
How's Yan'er doing?

118
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:22,826
When I arrived at the secret tunnel,

119
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:24,226
she was already lying on the ground.

120
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:25,986
You were also

121
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,025
physically drained.

122
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,265
You used your last ounce of energy

123
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,106
to tell me to send her back.

124
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,505
Naturally, I did so.

125
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,706
What about the Sea Emperor?

126
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,066
Their marine force
was fierce and brave indeed.

127
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:44,905
They protected the Sea Emperor

128
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,385
and broke through Qing Gang's

129
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:47,505
and Bai Fenglin's encirclement by force.

130
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,425
Almost most of them
were killed in battle.

131
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,346
But I have something to ask you.

132
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,586
What exactly happened on that day?

133
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:56,466
The Sea Emperor was clearly

134
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:57,466
no match for you.

135
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,145
How did he manage to escape

136
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,745
from you

137
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,106
and hurt you?

138
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:09,946
I was hurt

139
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,986
because Celestial Assault backfired.

140
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,186
Celestial Assault?

141
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:18,665
Are you saying

142
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:20,346
that your Celestial Assault

143
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,425
hit you instead?

144
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:25,866
Why did you take it back?

145
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,346
Could it be Zhu Yan?

146
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,866
So, Zhi Yuan is the one

147
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,545
Yan likes

148
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:40,505
all along.

149
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,545
She even protected him with her life.

150
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,226
What did you say?

151
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:49,145
Fine.

152
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,145
If so, I shall perish together

153
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,066
with Yuan.

154
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,625
So,

155
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:01,466
it was all my wishful thinking.

156
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:02,785
That's impossible!

157
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,106
They have an age gap
of over 200 years old.

158
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:06,625
Moreover, that Merfolk

159
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,025
was already transformed to a man

160
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,265
for Chizhu Feili.

161
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,346
How could Zhu Yan

162
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,425
fall for him?

163
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:13,986
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

164
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,066
You don't need reasons

165
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,106
to have feelings for someone.

166
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:20,505
Just like the fact that
I can't stop myself

167
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,145
from liking Zhu Yan even if I know

168
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:25,186
that the person she likes is Zhi Yuan.

169
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,505
I was just thinking

170
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,385
that I would surely eliminate
the Sea Emperor once and for all.

171
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,066
But if I do so,

172
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:37,466
how can I face

173
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,186
Yan'er after that?

174
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:42,346
You should stop worrying about her.

175
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:42,986
You should think about

176
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:43,905
how to recover from your injury.

177
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,106
Although your life is
no longer in danger,

178
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,186
you were seriously injured.

179
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:49,586
And,

180
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,306
you used your essence qi
when we were at

181
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,785
the border of Western Huang.

182
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:53,905
It'll take at least

183
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,226
five months for you to fully recover.

184
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,106
Why don't we

185
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,745
request High Priest of Grand Preceptor
to impart some essence qi to you?

186
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:01,665
No.

187
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,706
You mustn't let him know

188
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:05,706
that I used my essence qi.

189
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:07,226
But why?

190
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:10,385
Is there something

191
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,905
that I cannot know?

192
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:14,785
We were talking about...

193
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,586
It's about our private affairs.

194
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,346
Your Supreme Majesty, please forgive us.

195
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,306
How's your injury looking?

196
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:27,946
My essence qi protected my body.

197
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:28,946
Naturally,

198
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:30,545
I've almost recovered from my injury.

199
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,226
You're much more powerful

200
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,346
than the Sea Emperor.

201
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,106
Why were you seriously injured?

202
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,665
That Merfolk was sly and cunning.

203
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,466
In addition, I wasn't familiar

204
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:44,186
with the secret tunnel's layout.

205
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:45,505
That's why

206
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,106
I fell for their trick

207
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,905
and let them escape.

208
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,505
Your Supreme Majesty, don't worry.

209
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,226
They won't be as lucky

210
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,226
if I encounter them again.

211
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,106
The best-laid plans of mice and men
often go awry.

212
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,665
You should rest and recuperate first.

213
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,265
Since you were protected by
your essence qi,

214
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,106
you should recover in a few days.

215
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:09,665
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

216
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:11,745
Chong Ming.

217
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,946
I will make sure no one knows about

218
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:15,586
Ying's injury.

219
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:17,306
Ying will rest and recuperate

220
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:18,745
for a few days.

221
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,466
Just tell the others that
he's on a retreat.

222
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:22,545
Okay.

223
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:25,306
Ying,

224
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:26,785
I have some spiritual medicine

225
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,706
that can assist you
in recovering from your injury.

226
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,505
It's good for your body.

227
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,226
I'll let Chong Ming to retrieve it
together with me.

228
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:54,066
Ying was obviously injured

229
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,025
by Celestial Assault.

230
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:01,986
How did Celestial Assault
backfire on him?

231
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:03,826
The secret tunnel was dark.

232
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:04,826
It was difficult to travel.

233
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,346
He said he recalled Celestial Assault
as he didn't want

234
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:08,905
to hurt the innocent.

235
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,186
That's why the Merfolk
managed to escape.

236
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:11,946
Hurt the innocent?

237
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,106
So, was there anyone else

238
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:15,625
in the secret tunnel

239
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:16,785
besides Ying and the Sea Emperor?

240
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:20,265
I think so...

241
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:20,785
Answer me!

242
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,505
It's Zhu Yan!

243
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:25,706
That dumb lass,

244
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,226
she barged inside and battled
the Sea Emperor together

245
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,826
with Shi Ying
as she was worried about him.

246
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,466
But Shi Ying was worried that
he might damage her.

247
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,186
That's why he recalled

248
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,265
Celestial Assault.

249
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,106
She's a jinx indeed.

250
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,625
Back then, I thought she was useful.

251
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:45,586
I only allowed her to stay by
Ying's side after placing

252
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:48,785
the Heart-crushing Curse on her
in secret.

253
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:50,466
Once Zhu Yan

254
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,466
intends to kill Ying,

255
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,025
the curse will activate,
and she will die.

256
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,265
So, Your Supreme Majesty, you knew

257
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,986
that Zhu Yan was Shi Ying's
harbinger of doom all along?

258
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,265
There's nothing on Jiuyi Mountain

259
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:03,306
that I

260
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,986
do not know.

261
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,545
If so, why did you tell me

262
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,665
that Shi Ying's curse

263
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:10,745
was over?

264
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,505
Your Supreme Majesty,
why did you lie to me?

265
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:16,905
Don't tell me...

266
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:18,866
Without her,

267
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,186
Ying will never

268
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,226
return to the worldly world.

269
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:23,545
Now,

270
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,226
my goal has been achieved.

271
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,665
Now, Ying has worldly desires.

272
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:30,905
He will stop his cultivation
to ascend priesthood.

273
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,505
If Zhu Yan doesn't know
what's good for her

274
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,226
and still pesters Ying

275
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:36,665
in the future,

276
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:37,826
I will have no choice

277
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:39,306
but to act.

278
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,066
I will eliminate her.

279
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:45,385
Ying's body is more important.

280
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,586
Take good care of him.

281
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,306
I will get some spiritual medicine
for him

282
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,265
to assist him with his recovery.

283
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,106
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

284
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:04,785
So, you heard everything?

285
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:09,586
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,186
I would never

287
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:12,186
try to bring you and Zhu Yan together

288
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:13,226
had I known that it was all part of

289
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,025
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor's plan.

290
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:16,866
It's my fault

291
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,466
for fanning the flames.

292
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,226
That's why you were hurt
both physically and mentally.

293
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,346
It has nothing to do with you.

294
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:24,745
It'll still happen without you.

295
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:26,706
It's just a matter of time.

296
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:31,306
Now,

297
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,826
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
intends to get rid of Zhu Yan.

298
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,466
What do you plan to do?

299
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,250
(Crimson Residence)

300
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,145
Yan'er is awake.

301
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,106
Yan'er!

302
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:55,586
Yan'er!

303
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:56,145
Father.

304
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:56,466
Yan'er!

305
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:57,425
Mother.

306
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,066
Father.

307
00:16:59,545 --> 00:16:59,946
Yan'er,

308
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,226
how do you feel?

309
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:03,425
What are you guys doing here?

310
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,026
You were in a coma for several days.

311
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,026
I guess you became muddle-headed.

312
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,665
What do you mean by that?

313
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,145
This is our home.

314
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:13,786
That's right.

315
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:14,945
Yan'er,

316
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,346
Chong Ming sent you here a few days ago.

317
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:19,746
He said you fainted because you worked
too hard on your cultivation.

318
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:21,625
What were you cultivating?

319
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:22,985
You're not allowed to do so anymore.

320
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:23,705
That's right.

321
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,385
(So, I survived)

322
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:27,066
(Master's Celestial Assault?)

323
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,866
(Could it be that Master spared me?)

324
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:31,546
(What about Yuan?)

325
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:32,665
Father,

326
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:33,786
Mother.

327
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:35,826
How's the Sea Emperor doing?

328
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:36,826
Look at you.

329
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:38,625
I was telling you

330
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,266
not to worry about it.

331
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:41,586
But you're worrying about it again.

332
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,586
You're a girl.

333
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:44,826
You should just stay safe.

334
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:45,985
Your master

335
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:46,985
and the two generals
Qing and Bai

336
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,546
will deal with the war.

337
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:49,425
Don't tell me

338
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:50,786
you're doubting your master's ability?

339
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:51,546
That's right.

340
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:52,425
However, he was careless

341
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,625
to let the Sea Emperor escape this time.

342
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,425
What?

343
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,266
The Sea Emperor isn't dead?

344
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,106
(Master did spare him.)

345
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,866
(But that means he recalled
Celestial Assault.)

346
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:07,546
If so, Master is...

347
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,425
Don't move around.

348
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:09,266
Lie down.

349
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:11,826
The Priest of Grand Preceptor is fine.

350
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,026
He's on a retreat right now.

351
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,225
Once he's done,

352
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,945
he will deal with everything.

353
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:18,266
He will kill the Sea Emperor

354
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:19,665
and annihilate his marine force.

355
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,026
His Majesty already issued
an imperial edict.

356
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:23,306
Enough.

357
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:24,306
Our daughter just woke up.

358
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:25,826
Don't feed her with so much information.

359
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:26,945
Let her rest.

360
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:27,826
Okay.

361
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:28,985
Rest well.

362
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,026
I'll stop talking.

363
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:30,826
I'll go and check on

364
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:31,705
your medicine.

365
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:32,066
By the way,

366
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:32,665
don't interrupt

367
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:33,586
your master for now.

368
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,225
Just go already.

369
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:34,905
Okay.

370
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,705
All of us should leave.

371
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:37,866
Let Yan'er rest here.

372
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:44,786
It's because I like Yuan.

373
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,306
(I actually said that I liked Yuan)

374
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,185
(in front of Master.)

375
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,465
(How could I say that?)

376
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,625
(I told him such a huge lie.)

377
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,346
(And, I disrupted Master's plan.)

378
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,145
(I'm sure he's very angry.)

379
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:05,465
(I'm sure he doesn't want
to see me again.)

380
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:08,385
(Master is definitely
seriously injured.)

381
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:10,945
(But I have no way)

382
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:11,826
(to face him now.)

383
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,185
She's here.

384
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:53,705
Your Supreme Majesty,

385
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,506
let me explain myself to Zhu Yan.

386
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,145
I no longer want her

387
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,625
to appear in front of me again.

388
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:06,026
But what about your injury?

389
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:09,106
Ying,

390
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,546
if Zhu Yan keeps pestering you,

391
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,866
I can act on your behalf.

392
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:28,866
Master.

393
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,465
Why did you come here
in the middle of the night?

394
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,066
Master,

395
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:44,945
it's all my fault.

396
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,866
I have no way to face you.

397
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:49,746
Are you okay?

398
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,346
Get up first. We can talk after that.

399
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:03,385
You must be happy that he didn't die

400
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:05,546
from my Celestial Assault.

401
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,905
Master, thank you for not killing him.

402
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:12,346
But Master,

403
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,506
you spared him back then.

404
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:16,026
Did you get yourself hurt

405
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,106
because of that?

406
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,225
You think you two

407
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:22,346
can injure me?

408
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:23,786
I'm glad to hear that.

409
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:27,026
Actually,

410
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,266
I had no choice but to say so

411
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,546
due to the circumstances.

412
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:34,225
I know

413
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:35,786
that His Majesty has issued an edict

414
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:37,506
for you to kill the Sea Emperor.

415
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,866
You had no choice too.

416
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:42,385
But Master, you stopped your plan

417
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:43,985
because of me.

418
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:45,185
That's not it.

419
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,066
I hope you can go back

420
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,945
and train harder.

421
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:53,346
Only then,

422
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:54,746
you'll be able to go up against me

423
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:56,665
when I try to kill him again

424
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,985
in the future.

425
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:01,346
Master.

426
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,346
I didn't kill you guys last time

427
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,586
because you saved me

428
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:07,665
in Cangwu Abyss once.

429
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:10,266
I don't want to become an evil mentor

430
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:11,625
who kills his student.

431
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,145
However, that won't happen again.

432
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:17,225
It's because

433
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:18,665
I'm severing my ties with you

434
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,026
as your mentor.

435
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,106
From now on,

436
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,506
it's ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

437
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:30,385
Master,

438
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,185
you must be joking with me.

439
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:35,826
Why would you kick me out?

440
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:37,826
Master!

441
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,506
From now on,

442
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,225
I, Shi Ying,

443
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:44,465
don't have a treacherous student

444
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,905
who disregards her nation.

445
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:10,425
Master?

446
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:12,826
Master!

447
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:17,586
Do not call me that again.

448
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:19,586
From now on,

449
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,106
I'm not your master.

450
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:25,266
Go back.

451
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:27,786
Master!

452
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:30,826
Please return the Jade Bone to me!

453
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,106
Please don't

454
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,145
chase me out!

455
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:34,905
Scram!

456
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,346
Master!

457
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:42,066
Master!

458
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,346
Master!

459
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,026
Master!

460
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,266
Don't tell me you're abandoning me?

461
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,185
Open the door!

462
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:56,665
Master!

463
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,185
Master, don't do this!

464
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:05,385
Shi Ying!

465
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,905
Master, I'm begging you!

466
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:12,665
Where's His Supreme Majesty?

467
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,786
He left after he saw you retrieving

468
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:15,586
the Jade Bone.

469
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:18,826
Why did you resort to that?

470
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,106
Master!

471
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,665
She will never leave my side

472
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,866
if I don't do this.

473
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:27,506
His Supreme Majesty

474
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,425
won't let her off too.

475
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:31,266
And,

476
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,266
I will definitely kill the Sea Emperor.

477
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:36,185
Instead of letting her

478
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,425
suffer and despair in the future,

479
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:41,185
I would rather she hates me now.

480
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:45,145
Master!

481
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:46,985
It's raining.

482
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:49,346
I know.

483
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,225
But she's kneeling outside.

484
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,826
I'll tell her to leave.

485
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:58,625
Just let her kneel.

486
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,786
She'll leave my side naturally

487
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,066
after she gives up.

488
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:07,066

Priest of Grand Preceptor,
you don't take food with heavy flavor.

508
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,185
I'm sure this peach juice

509
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,026
will be to your liking.

510
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,225
Princess Zhu Yan is
still kneeling outside.

511
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,586
Why don't I send her back first?

512
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,106
As the only daughter of
the Crimson King,

513
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,225
she's kneeling in front of
the residence of Bai Family.

514
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:02,665
If news of this gets out,

515
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,985
our reputation will be ruined.

516
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:07,385
Suit yourself.

517
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:38,586
Priest of Grand Preceptor
is a man of his word.

518
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:40,185
Do you think he'll change his mind

519
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,145
just because

520
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,266
you knelt under the rain
for the entire night?

521
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:45,866
You don't understand

522
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:46,905
your master at all.

523
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:47,786
(Yes.)

524
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,625
(She's right.)

525
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:52,066
(Master chased me out)

526
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:53,786
(because)

527
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:55,586
(the conflict between
the Kongsang people and Merfolk Clan)

528
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,546
(cannot be resolved.)

529
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:59,425
(Master will forgive me)

530
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,225
(as long as he sees that
Yuan can bring peace)

531
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,546
(to both clans.)

532
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:03,705
(That's right.)

533
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:05,866
(I should look for Yuan.)

534
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:15,905
Someone.

535
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:16,546
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:18,066
Get her a cup of ginger tea.

537
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:20,625
Get her a set of my clothing.

538
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:29,185
You want to leave like this?

539
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:31,306
Do you want people to think badly
of your master?

540
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,026
I'll send you back to
the Crimson Residence first.

541
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,346
Don't feel burdened.

542
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:40,746
I'm doing this for
the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

543
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,665
I want him to know
how gentle and generous I am.

544
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:46,625
Thank you.

545
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,185
Send the ingredients I've selected

546
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:56,346
to the kitchen.

547
00:30:57,385 --> 00:30:57,826
Remember,

548
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:00,026
the soup needs to
be stewed for a long time.

549
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,066
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

550
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,826
Princess, the things you sent to him

551
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:05,705
will be returned untouched

552
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:06,506
every time.

553
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:08,985
Even so, are you still
willing to continue?

554
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,826
It doesn't matter
if he takes them or not.

555
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:13,346
I just want him to know

556
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:15,306
that I never gave up.

557
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:16,945
I want others to know

558
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:17,985
that I'm the best partner for him.

559
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:19,746
You didn't give up, huh?

560
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:24,346
So, you were lying to me

561
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:26,625
back then.

562
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:33,266
You guys may leave first.

563
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,425
I need to speak
to General Qing in private.

564
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:37,145
Yes.

565
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,266
General Qing,

566
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,425
can't I have the privilege
to regret my words?

567
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:00,746
I lost

568
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,866
an important document.

569
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:04,506
Did you take it?

570
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,026
You came to my room all of a sudden

571
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:11,665
and told me all of that.

572
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,225
I'm sure Bai Fenglin told you to do so

573
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,586
in order to steal that document from me.

574
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:19,985
The person

575
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:21,266
who was relaying our intel
to the Merfolk marine force in secret

576
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:23,905
was actually your elder brother.

577
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:27,106
General Qing,

578
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,746
you don't have any evidence.

579
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,066
You mustn't frame him.

580
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:32,665
Xuelu,

581
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,225
if you admit it right now,

582
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,306
I can still save you

583
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,266
from your elder brother.

584
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,106
I didn't do it.

585
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:51,945
If that's the case,

586
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,586
I'll tell you this.

587
00:32:58,465 --> 00:32:59,985
The document you took

588
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,106
was just a copy.

589
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:06,945
The document your brother wrote

590
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:07,945
is still in my hand.

591
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,905
Once the Priest of Grand Preceptor
comes out of his retreat,

592
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:14,225
I will hand
the original document to him.

593
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:14,905
Don't do it.

594
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:28,385
I knew it was you guys.

595
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:37,826
This is?

596
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:40,185
When you returned my scarf to me

597
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,066
on Jiuyi Mountain,

598
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:45,746
there was a piece of leaf

599
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:46,866
inside.

600
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:11,186
This Leaf of Love,

601
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,146
it trapped me here until now.

602
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,585
It was a sweet experience for me.

603
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:29,226
However, I, Qing Gang,

604
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:30,266
have a bottom line.

605
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:32,186
You used my feelings for you

606
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:32,945
to manipulate me time and time again.

607
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:33,905
I don't blame you for that.

608
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,425
I did so willingly.

609
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,025
Because

610
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,065
it was between you and me.

611
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,226
However, since you've chosen

612
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:49,585
to help a traitor of Kongsang,

613
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:53,826
that means I was wrong about you.

614
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:00,786
From today onward,

615
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,706
I can no longer keep you company.

616
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:07,505
Don't do it.

617
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,226
Please return

618
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:19,985
my jade pendant to me.

619
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:22,266
Who cares about your jade pendant?

620
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:23,545
I threw it away long ago.

621
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:36,626
Princess Xuelu,

622
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,425
no matter what reason,

623
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:43,545
treason

624
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,945
is a heinous crime.

625
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:37,186
If a Merfolk
uses Dream Creation excessively,

626
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:38,985
they will fall into a deep slumber.

627
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,065
I never expected Ruyi

628
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,186
to wake up.

629
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:44,306
Maybe your master

630
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,545
is the only person
who can achieve such a feat

631
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,226
in Kongsang.

632
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:52,746
So, Master saved Ruyi?

633
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:54,306
Yan'er,

634
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,025
you shouldn't have

635
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:57,266
gotten yourself involved.

636
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,226
You lied to your master

637
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:00,985
and said that you loved me
in order to save me.

638
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:04,105
You knew your master was...

639
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,866
This is not the time for this.

640
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,346
I had no choice back then.

641
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,346
Now, I have no way to face Master again.

642
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:16,306
I came here today

643
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,025
to ask you about your plans.

644
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:20,266
I went to find you a few days ago.

645
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:22,186
Initially, I wanted to
bid farewell to you.

646
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:23,626
However,

647
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:24,425
you were in a coma.

648
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:26,706
Bid farewell to me?

649
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,226
Judging from the current circumstances,

650
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:31,746
bringing the Merfolk back to Biluo Sea

651
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,025
is my best choice.

652
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,146
That's right.

653
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:39,226
That's the best choice.

654
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:43,105
This way, the war will die down.

655
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:45,105
Master won't be able to capture you.

656
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:47,465
You won't be killed

657
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,025
because of your identity
as the Sea Emperor.

658
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:53,945
And, Master won't be

659
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,146
put on the spot

660
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,025
because of me again.

661
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:01,306
Yuan,

662
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,626
are you leaving too?

663
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:06,585
Naturally.

664
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:08,266
I'm the Sea Emperor.

665
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:11,746
Okay.

666
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,346
I support your decision.

667
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,706
Thank you for the support.

668
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:17,706
However, please only
support me mentally.

669
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:19,306
Yan'er,

670
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,186
you have to

671
00:38:21,226 --> 00:38:22,465
stay out of this.

672
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:40,146
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
you ended your retreat already?

673
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:42,985
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

674
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:45,666
The Sea Emperor hasn't been captured.

675
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:47,425
We should act as quickly as possible.

676
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:49,786
The Sea Emperor managed to escape

677
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:51,385
due to my negligence.

678
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:53,306
Generals,

679
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:54,266
it must've been tough.

680
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,105
It was tough on General Qing.

681
00:38:58,346 --> 00:38:59,266
He slew over ten

682
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:00,826
of the marine force's elite troops.

683
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:01,545
And, he almost

684
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:02,746
snatched the Sea Emperor

685
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:03,905
from their hands.

686
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:07,626
This is my duty.

687
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:09,626
General Bai, you don't need

688
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:10,746
to offer such unnecessary kindness.

689
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:14,666
Lately, I heard

690
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,505
that the Merfolk had ceased their fight

691
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:18,425
as they prepare to retreat to the sea.

692
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:20,065
You guys

693
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:22,266
have destroyed plenty of such entrances.

694
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,945
I had dealings with the Merfolk
for many years.

695
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,826
They have to use the sea entrances

696
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:28,266
for them to return

697
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,626
to Biluo Sea.

698
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,105
If they don't do so,

699
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,826
they'll get lost

700
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:35,025
in the deep sea

701
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:36,545
even if they're adept at swimming.

702
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:39,226
That's why I interrogated

703
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:40,505
the prisoners we captured.

704
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:42,706
Because of that, I found out about

705
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:44,186
the sea entrances.

706
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,346
Thus, General Qing and I destroyed them

707
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,065
to cut off their escape route.

708
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:52,266
There's no need to
exterminate the Merfolk.

709
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,226
Allow them to leave

710
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:55,945
if they wish to return to Biluo Sea.

711
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,786
We just need to keep an eye
on the Sea Emperor.

712
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,465
He's the main culprit here.

713
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:05,786
But His Majesty's order was for us

714
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:07,905
to exterminate all of them.

715
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,746
A prairie fire cannot
burn all the weeds,

716
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,186
they grow again when
the spring breeze blows.

717
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,585
If we capture the Sea Emperor early,

718
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,465
the Merfolk won't have a leader
to lead them.

719
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:21,505
They won't achieve anything.

720
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:24,425
General Qing, you're right.

721
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:30,666
Priest of Grand Preceptor,
if you can draw

722
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:31,866
a portrait of the Sea Emperor,

723
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:33,826
I can send my men

724
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,306
to post wanted posters of him.

725
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:36,985
This way,

726
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:38,905
I believe it'll be much more

727
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:39,706
convenient for us.

728
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,905
If we can capture the Sea Emperor

729
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,266
with just a portrait,

730
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:44,505
what makes him

731
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,266
any different from the normal soldiers

732
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,905
he commands?

733
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:49,945
These spots

734
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,146
might be sea entrances.

735
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:53,945
Generals, please send your men

736
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:55,465
to investigate them.

737
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,706
The Sea Emperor will surely
attempt to escape

738
00:40:57,945 --> 00:40:59,306
using one of these entrances.

739
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,425
According to my understanding of him,

740
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:04,826
the Sea Emperor won't leave

741
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,346
before all Merfolk

742
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:07,985
retreat to Biluo Sea.

743
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:10,505
We just need to capture him alive.

744
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:11,746
So,

745
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:12,866
we don't need to

746
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,105
harm the innocent Merfolk.

747
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,826
We don't need to destroy
the sea entrances too.

748
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:19,706
Generals,

749
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:21,306
do you guys have anything else to say?

750
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:23,545
General Qing,

751
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:25,465
I think my cousin's plan

752
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,866
is already clear enough.

753
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:27,545
Why don't we

754
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,666
execute it immediately?

755
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,346
General Bai,

756
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:00,905
you're worried that
I might report to him

757
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:02,425
that you're relaying intel
to the Merfolk, right?

758
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,666
General Qing,
no need to trouble yourself.

759
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:08,945
I will confess and apologize

760
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:11,226
to Priest of Grand Preceptor
when the time is right.

761
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:13,866
General Bai, you're just
finding an excuse

762
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:15,626
to stall time, right?

763
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:16,746
That's not true.

764
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:19,866
I didn't intend to commit treason

765
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:22,346
by doing so.

766
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:23,786
I just wanted

767
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:24,905
to stall the war

768
00:42:25,866 --> 00:42:27,385
so that I could render more merit.

769
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:29,866
But now, the situation is clear.

770
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:32,505
The Merfolk are
retreating to Biluo Sea.

771
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:35,226
It's no longer necessary
for me to do so.

772
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:36,666
Don't worry.

773
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:38,465
I made preparations for it long ago.

774
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:41,786
The day we return from the battle

775
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:43,626
will be the day

776
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:45,186
I confess my crime.

777
00:42:57,065 --> 00:42:57,945
Did you persuade him?

778
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:00,826
It was just an act to stall time.

779
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,465
If he insists on reporting me,

780
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,266
I have no choice but to get rid of him.

781
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,626
Qing Gang is a military commander.

782
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:11,985
And, the war between the two clans
will break out soon.

783
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:13,866
It's nothing out of the ordinary

784
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:16,226
if he dies on the battlefield.

785
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:17,945
Brother,

786
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,425
we've already committed
too many mistakes.

787
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:22,025
If we keep this up,

788
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:23,025
I'm afraid

789
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,186
the consequences will be irreversible.

790
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:27,985
What nonsense are you saying?

791
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:29,985
Since it has come to this,

792
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:31,626
we have no way to back down now.

793
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:33,465
I've committed treason,

794
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,266
which is a heinous crime.

795
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:37,626
If I lose my foothold now,

796
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:39,585
the White Clan

797
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,706
will never rise to glory again.

798
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:42,186
But we can't just...

799
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:42,786
But what?

800
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:44,666
Don't tell me

801
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:45,786
you're taking pity on that brat?

802
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:48,266
Let me warn you.

803
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:50,146
You're a member of the Bai Family.

804
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:52,146
You better don't side with outsiders.

805
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,226
If not, not only will you
not be able to save him,

806
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,065
but you will also

807
00:43:57,306 --> 00:43:58,545
be sacrificed instead.

808
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,320
(Xinghaiyun Pleasure House)

809
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:28,425
Lord Yuan.

810
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:30,945
How did it go?

811
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:32,866
The elderly, weak, women, and children

812
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:34,545
have retreated according to our plan.

813
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,666
Bai Fenglin's Valorous Cavalry

814
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:38,306
is still pursuing us.

815
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:41,425
However, it appears as if
Qing Gang's Shadow Warriors

816
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:42,905
are letting us leave.

817
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:45,545
If so, we should do all we can

818
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:47,465
to retreat from Qing Gang's territory.

819
00:44:48,346 --> 00:44:48,826
Understood.

820
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:50,626
But my lord,

821
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:52,545
the sea entrances to Biluo Sea

822
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:53,905
are limited.

823
00:44:54,786 --> 00:44:56,186
And, Qing Gang might be willing

824
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,025
to spare innocent Merfolk,

825
00:44:58,545 --> 00:44:59,666
but he might not

826
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:00,706
spare us.

827
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,786
In addition,

828
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,545
the security in the city

829
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:05,385
is getting tighter.

830
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:06,866
I'm afraid

831
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,425
the Kongsang people will locate

832
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,746
all of our sea entrances

833
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:10,666
before we could retreat in time.

834
00:45:19,706 --> 00:45:21,505
If the Sea Emperor must be dead
for the issue to be resolved,

835
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,385
I will die on his behalf.
