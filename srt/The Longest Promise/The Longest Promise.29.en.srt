Yuan!

20
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:13,533
Yuan!

21
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:15,853
I was worried about you.

22
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:17,892
You had me worried.

23
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:19,892
Everyone is talking
about how you were punished

24
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:20,573
for speaking up for your master.

25
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:21,932
Are you all right?

26
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,332
I'm fine.

27
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,052
I've always wanted to speak up

28
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:25,973
for him.

29
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,212
It was satisfying.

30
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,452
The punishment was nothing.

31
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:33,413
Yuan,

32
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:34,772
my master told me

33
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:36,413
that you are the Sea Emperor.

34
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:38,253
Is that true?

35
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:40,293
Yes.

36
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:42,573
I am the Sea Emperor.

37
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,093
That's great!

38
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:45,813
Great?

39
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,373
I have the utmost faith
in your character.

40
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:49,732
If you're the Sea Emperor,

41
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:51,172
what's there to worry about

42
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:52,573
when it comes to the Evil Star?

43
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:54,052
Yuan,

44
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:56,013
my master is staying

45
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,732
at Empress Bai Yan's old residence
in the east of the city.

46
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,413
You should talk to him.

47
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:00,732
I'm sure that together,

48
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,413
you two will clear up
any misunderstandings.

49
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:04,813
I understand,

50
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:07,093
but…

51
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:09,853
I know you've only
just returned to the clan.

52
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,533
Even if you are the Sea Emperor,

53
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:12,652
it will take some effort

54
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,013
to get

55
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:14,732
the Merfolk marine force

56
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,373
to listen to you.

57
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,133
But you and my master

58
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,172
are the ones

59
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,052
I respect and trust the most

60
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,212
in this world.

61
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:23,093
I don't want to see the two of you

62
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,133
fight each other to the death.

63
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:26,093
Moreover,

64
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,732
only the two of you

65
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:28,533
can stop the war now.

66
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:29,813
Right?

67
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:32,612
Yuan,

68
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:34,932
please don't give up so easily,

69
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,172
all right?

70
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:38,492
All right.

71
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:40,932
I'll see your master.

72
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:43,332
Yuan,

73
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:44,253
if there's anything else

74
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,172
you need my help with,

75
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:46,293
just name it.

76
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,373
There is a favor

77
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:52,693
I'd like to ask of you.

78
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:09,652
It's Su Mo.

79
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:12,813
You know him?

80
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:14,533
I met him and his mother

81
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,332
in the Huotu Tribe.

82
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,452
Where's his mother?

83
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:20,733
Mother!

84
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:22,972
Don't die…

85
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:24,852
Mother!

86
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:37,772
Your mother didn't leave.

87
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:39,733
She is here.

88
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:43,813
200 years ago,

89
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,253
I helped Lady Yu escape

90
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:47,332
from the Merfolk marine force.

91
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:48,772
Later,

92
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,852
I ran into her in Western Huang.

93
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,013
I didn't realize that you met

94
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,412
Lady Yu and her son.

95
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:56,452
Unfortunately…

96
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,693
If I had been there in time,

97
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:02,412
Lady Yu might not have died.

98
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:04,253
You don't have to blame yourself.

99
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,852
The murderers are those

100
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,452
who started the war

101
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,452
for their own selfish reasons.

102
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,733
Su Mo looks very ill.

103
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:18,373
Yes.

104
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:20,733
He's been running a fever.

105
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,892
He needs spiritual powers
to protect his heart.

106
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:24,972
I am a Merfolk.

107
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,332
I cannot practice Kongsang techniques,

108
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,972
nor do I have any spiritual powers.

109
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,693
I can only turn to you.

110
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,173
Mother…

111
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:03,292
His fever has gone down a lot.

112
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,013
His breathing is calm too.

113
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:06,493
That's good.

114
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:10,772
Yuan,

115
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:13,373
you'll be busy

116
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,253
with the truce.

117
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,253
It's inconvenient to keep a sick child

118
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,253
with you.

119
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:20,652
Why not

120
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,332
let me

121
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:23,772
look after Su Mo?

122
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:28,972
Thank you,

123
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:30,532
Princess.

124
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,292
I will be troubling you.

125
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:35,613
When have I been one

126
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,412
to shy away from trouble?

127
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,253
That makes us sound so distant.

128
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:42,412
You've gone as far

129
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,852
as to call me princess again.

130
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,292
Is there anything else, Yuan?

131
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,173
Princess,

132
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:54,933
this is a grave matter.

133
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,573
Please do not mention this to anyone,

134
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,212
including His Lordship, Her Ladyship,

135
00:06:59,613 --> 00:06:59,972
and…

136
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:02,813
And your master.

137
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,573
Do not bring up Su Mo's past.

138
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,013
Do not even mention me.

139
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:07,652
My identity is sensitive.

140
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:09,852
I cannot cause any more trouble

141
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,133
for the Crimson Residence.

142
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,253
Please get up.

143
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:16,772
All right.

144
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,733
I'll tell them

145
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,733
I picked up Su Mo

146
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:21,772
on the streets today.

147
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,613
When you have sorted things out
with my master,

148
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,772
and I've healed Su Mo,

149
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,892
when everything settles,

150
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,452
we'll return
to Extreme Wind City together.

151
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:53,613
Is it really wise

152
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:54,772
to leave Su Mo in the care

153
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:56,532
of a Kongsang person?

154
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,373
If he stays with us,

155
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,253
the elders will find out in no time.

156
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,652
Besides, we cannot do anything

157
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,652
about his condition of dragon's blood.

158
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:07,613
But Yan'er

159
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,652
can ease his pain.

160
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,613
Perhaps one day,

161
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,493
when the Priest of Grand Preceptor

162
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,332
learns of Su Mo's identity,

163
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:16,892
he will spare him

164
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,693
because of Yan'er.

165
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:20,332
Yan'er is the destined one

166
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:21,173
of the Dragon Blood Jade.

167
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,332
Now, you and I have been forced

168
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:25,573
to leave Su Mo

169
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,652
in her hands.

170
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,212
Maybe this is fate.

171
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:33,733
Ruyi,

172
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,253
we need someone to change

173
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,172
Yunhuang.

174
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,412
Not the Emperor of Kongsang,

175
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,692
not the elders,

176
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,093
but him.

177
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,493
It's the Sea Emperor

178
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:44,532
we have been waiting for 7,000 years.

179
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:46,692
Su Mo is

180
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,453
the hope of the Merfolk Clan.

181
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:49,812
He will grow up

182
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,412
to be

183
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:52,532
a great and proud Merfolk.

184
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:54,613
But if the elders find out

185
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:55,292
that the Sea Emperor is

186
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,373
still a child,

187
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,892
they will use him
for their selfish whims.

188
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,652
The pain we suffered

189
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:03,853
and the mistakes that were made

190
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:05,572
must not happen

191
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,093
to him.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,320
(Crimson Residence)

193
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:31,253
You're finally awake.

194
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:36,772
Are you hungry?

195
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,333
Do you want to eat?

196
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,532
I've asked them
to prepare some porridge for you.

197
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:44,572
Would you like sweet

198
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:45,812
or savory porridge?

199
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,172
What's the matter?

200
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:51,733
Don't you recognize me?

201
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:55,932
Yufei,

202
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,093
go and see if the porridge is ready.

203
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:05,532
Su Mo,

204
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,532
it was your Uncle Yuan

205
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,133
who asked me to take care of you.

206
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:12,973
But you cannot mention him

207
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:14,892
to anyone here.

208
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:16,932
You have to tell them I found you

209
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:17,772
on the streets.

210
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:20,652
Do you understand?

211
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,333
I don't care about Uncle Yuan!

212
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,493
He's a liar!

213
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,772
You're a liar too!

214
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,812
You can't say that about Yuan.

215
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:30,932
I couldn't meet up with you guys

216
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:32,932
because I was held back by something.

217
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:34,613
But after that,

218
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:36,172
I searched all over the mountain
with my men.

219
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,213
But you were nowhere to be found.

220
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,772
I don't believe you!

221
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:41,532
Su Mo!

222
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:42,412
Su Mo!

223
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:44,772
Su Mo!

224
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,013
I'll kill all of you!

225
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,652
All of you are bad people!

226
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:48,292
Su Mo!

227
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:49,373
I'll kill all of you!

228
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:49,973
Calm down!

229
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:50,973
I'll kill you!

230
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:52,973
Calm down!

231
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:54,853
Listen to me.

232
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:55,772
Su Mo,

233
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,892
you're not completely cured yet,

234
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:59,613
nor bestowed with
any identifications.

235
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:00,973
Do you know

236
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:01,892
how chaotic it is out there?

237
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,853
Even if I let you go,

238
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,213
you could die

239
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,613
out there!

240
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,892
I don't need you to care even if I die!

241
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,892
I didn't get to the Bamian Peak in time.

242
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,532
I failed you

243
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,013
and your mother.

244
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:19,613
You can blame me

245
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,093
and hit me.

246
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:25,613
But your mother

247
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:26,572
didn't die to protect you

248
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:29,133
for you

249
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,613
to do this right now.

250
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:32,853
Do you understand?

251
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:36,973
Princess,

252
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,013
Princess Xueying is here to see you.

253
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:44,133
Granny,

254
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:45,493
Yufei,

255
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,613
look after him.

256
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:51,652
Try to satisfy

257
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,133
his demands.

258
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:55,932
Yes, Princess.

259
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:56,892
Yes.

260
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:10,532
Princess!

261
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:11,733
Princess!

262
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:13,892
It's terrible!

263
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,613
The Merfolk boy ran off!

264
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:17,572
What happened?

265
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:18,692
It's all my fault.

266
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,052
I brought up

267
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:20,892
his mother

268
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,572
and angered him.

269
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,853
I immediately sent people
to go after him,

270
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:26,093
but

271
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,853
the Valorous Cavalry happened to be

272
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,532
capturing the Merfolk
all over the city right now.

273
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,973
They claimed
he was part of the Merfolk marine force

274
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:32,812
and took him.

275
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,333
The Valorous Cavalry?

276
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,093
The Valorous Cavalry is
under my brother's command.

277
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,692
My brother just returned
from the front lines

278
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,453
to Ye City.

279
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,973
Bai Fenglin, Governor of Ye City.

280
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:45,532
My brother has always
despised the Merfolk.

281
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,373
If the child falls into his hands,

282
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:48,412
he will surely suffer.

283
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,532
I'm going to get Su Mo back.

284
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:51,853
- Princess!
- I…

285
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:53,572
I'll go with you.

286
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,213
My brother might spare him

287
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:56,733
for my sake.

288
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,373
Don't worry.

289
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,572
No matter what,

290
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:00,572
I am the princess of the Crimson Clan.

291
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:01,772
Bai Fenglin

292
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,213
wouldn't dare to do anything to me.

293
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:27,932
Princess Zhu Yan of the Crimson Clan

294
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:29,292
greets General Bai.

295
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,493
(Bai Fenglin, White Clan of Kongsang)
Princess Zhu Yan.

296
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,530
Why did you stop me?

297
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,052
That Merfolk boy is
a member of my residence.

298
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,932
He is not one of the Merfolk marine forces.

299
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,572
There must be a misunderstanding.

300
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,572
I have business to attend to.

301
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,052
I shan't get down from my steed.

302
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,532
This must be the boy you mentioned.

303
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,013
Su Mo!

304
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:52,613
Wait.

305
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,052
Princess Zhu Yan,

306
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:58,052
you said this boy was
a slave of the Crimson Residence.

307
00:13:58,772 --> 00:13:59,932
Do you have
a slave contract to prove that?

308
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:02,292
He is a free boy.

309
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:03,613
He did not sell himself.

310
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,493
So he is not a slave
of the Crimson Residence.

311
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,493
Then, how you vouch for him

312
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,013
that he is not a member
of the Merfolk marine force

313
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,013
or a descendant?

314
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,292
He is like a brother to me.

315
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,772
How could he be part
of the Merfolk marine force?

316
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:20,093
Please have mercy on him, General Bai.

317
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,333
Lady Zhu Yan,

318
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,052
are you saying that you,

319
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,172
the Princess of the Crimson Clan,

320
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:27,013
adopted this Merfolk boy

321
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:27,613
as your brother?

322
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,733
Since you claim that this boy is

323
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:31,932
a descendant
of the Merfolk marine force,

324
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,333
do you have any proof?

325
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,213
As you can see, Princess,

326
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:37,133
I'm busy with military affairs.

327
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,013
If you want proof,

328
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:40,733
come back in ten days.

329
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,892
If I can't show any proof by then,

330
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,013
I will return him to you

331
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:45,213
in one piece.

332
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,453
But so far,

333
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,453
no Merfolk has ever been able

334
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,373
to hide anything from me.

335
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:53,532
Bai Cheng,

336
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,892
take these Merfolks back.

337
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:06,692
They're fighting.

338
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,493
General! General!

339
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:26,572
Young Master.

340
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,710
(Bai Yan's Old Residence, Ye City)

341
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:30,932
Sixth Aunt.

342
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:32,493
Young Master.

343
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,973
You still have a residence in Ye City?

344
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,733
This residence

345
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,373
is under my mother's name.

346
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:43,133
Sixth Aunt

347
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:44,853
used to be my mother's maid.

348
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,013
After my mother joined the harem,

349
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:48,453
she stayed behind

350
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:49,853
and took care of this place.

351
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:51,853
My mother used to bring me here

352
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:52,772
to get away from the heat.

353
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:54,853
Sixth Uncle and Sixth Aunt

354
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,453
watched me grow up.

355
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,052
Then, after what happened…

356
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:05,892
Thanks to them staying behind

357
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:07,133
to look after this residence,

358
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,412
this place isn't overgrown with weeds.

359
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,013
It was such a shock

360
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,133
when we heard about what had happened

361
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:17,133
to Young Lady and Young Master.

362
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,292
When we heard that Young Lady
was seriously ill,

363
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:22,932
we tried to visit her at the palace,

364
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,412
but we couldn't get through to her.

365
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:28,692
Thank goodness

366
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:31,453
our Young Master has finally returned.

367
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:33,172
That's right.

368
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,292
Young Master,

369
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,613
now that you're back,

370
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:36,292
I'll have them

371
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,213
clean up the courtyard

372
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:37,932
at once.

373
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:38,652
No rush.

374
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:39,892
I saw

375
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,652
red lotus flowers

376
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,133
among the grass in the front yard.

377
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,733
That's an excellent herb

378
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:44,532
for beauty.

379
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:45,812
Take me to it.

380
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:46,812
You can tidy up the yard

381
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:47,692
after I've collected

382
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:48,812
all the red lotus flowers.

383
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:50,093
All right.

384
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:51,213
Please come with me.

385
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:52,052
All right.

386
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:54,572
Young Master,

387
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:56,692
I'll make you some tea.

388
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,453
Thank you, Sixth Aunt.

389
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:18,013
Young Master,

390
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:20,292
a Merfolk is asking to see you.

391
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:21,572
Let him in.

392
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:22,693
Yes.

393
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:29,693
Thank you, Sixth Aunt.

394
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:40,253
Young Master, the guest is here.

395
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,532
I've kept you waiting,
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

396
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:44,733
Have a seat.

397
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:46,532
Sixth Aunt,

398
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,612
was this tea prepared

399
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,213
with the water I brought?

400
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,213
Yes.

401
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,332
This water is tranquil, pure,

402
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,013
and refreshing.

403
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:09,973
It must have been collected
in the third month of autumn.

404
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:11,572
It is devoid
of the bitterness of plants and trees,

405
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:12,893
with only the sweetness
of the pearl fish.

406
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:15,893
It must be water from the Li River,
the headwaters of Ge Mountain.

407
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:17,973
Rumor has it that
the Sea Emperor is knowledgeable

408
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,572
of the five lakes and four seas

409
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,213
as well as
the twenty-four measures of water.

410
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:23,532
You are really something.

411
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,013
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
tried to test me with this water.

412
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,933
How could I not answer?

413
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,612
His favorite tea is

414
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:30,852
Yunwuqing,

415
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,933
and to prepare this tea,

416
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,413
you need water from the Li River,
the headwaters of Ge Mountain.

417
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,893
It must be water collected
in the third month of autumn as well,

418
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,052
so that the water is devoid
of the bitterness from plants and trees,

419
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,772
and carry only the sweetness
of the pearl fish.

420
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,013
With the Sea Emperor's intelligence,

421
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,572
you must know what I mean to ask you.

422
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:53,733
What the Priest of Grand Preceptor fears

423
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,213
must be the prophecy.

424
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:57,612
You fear
that the Sea Kingdom will one day

425
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:58,693
destroy Kongsang.

426
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:01,013
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

427
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:02,893
The Evil Star is merely

428
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,173
a star in the sky.

429
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,733
It brings neither fortune nor calamity.

430
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,493
The decline of Kongsang today was

431
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,173
definitely not caused by a single star.

432
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:12,693
Tell me why,

433
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:13,933
then.

434
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,052
In ancient times,

435
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:17,493
the various gods
displayed their prowess.

436
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:18,693
Kongsang,

437
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:19,653
the Merfolk Clan,

438
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:20,413
and the Ice Clan

439
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:21,612
coexisted in harmony.

440
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,092
The stars shone brightly.

441
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:25,453
It was only then

442
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,253
that prominent figures
such as Emperor Xingzun and Bai Wei

443
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,173
came to be.

444
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,693
However, later on,
Kongsang became dominant,

445
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33,092
while the other clans
gradually declined.

446
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:34,693
7,000 years later,

447
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,332
the people indulged in pleasure,

448
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,173
and Yunhuang regressed
instead of progressing.

449
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,292
A state that was a far cry
from its former glory.

450
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:40,973
That is what led

451
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,173
to the existence of Emperor Beimian,

452
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:43,693
a man who indulges in beauty

453
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,733
and neglects state affairs.

454
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:46,973
Lies and deceit.

455
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:49,253
Are you not afraid that I'll kill you?

456
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:50,453
No.

457
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:52,653
I have three reasons.

458
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:53,893
Firstly,

459
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,893
given your character,

460
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:58,332
there is no need
to hide anything from close ones.

461
00:19:59,332 --> 00:19:59,933
Secondly,

462
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,532
if you do not even have

463
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,132
the capacity to hear the truth,

464
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:06,253
then how could you possibly
plan to change the state of Yunhuang?

465
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:10,852
Well said.

466
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:12,453
Tell me, then.

467
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,493
What will be
the future state of Yunhuang?

468
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:16,132
Revive the cooperation

469
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,532
between the Merfolk and Kongsang.

470
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:19,933
Embrace the diversities
and mutually benefit from one another.

471
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:21,933
We will surely return

472
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,493
Yunhuang to its former glory, then.

473
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,253
When that time comes,

474
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:27,092
the farmers will plow their fields,

475
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,812
the weavers will have their loom,

476
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:30,572
the dwellers will have their huts,

477
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,332
the young and old will be sheltered.

478
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,532
The people will be educated,

479
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,253
no one will be afraid to speak out,

480
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:37,852
all will make the best use
of their talents,

481
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,292
and we will inherit the past
and bring forth the new.

482
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,852
The stability of the nation
will be everlasting as the sun,

483
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,812
and the prosperity of the nation
will be as radiant as the stars.

484
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:48,772
Do you mean that
from the bottom of your heart,

485
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,493
Sea Emperor?

486
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:53,973
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

487
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:56,733
my clan worships the God of Dragon.

488
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,132
The God of Dragon excels
in rain and water,

489
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:01,812
not combat or battle.

490
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:03,292
My clan does not

491
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:04,572
favor battles.

492
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:06,973
The God of Dragon chose me

493
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,413
for my compassion,

494
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:11,893
not for my ability to fight.

495
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:13,933
I believe

496
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:14,733
you share the same thought.

497
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,213
Why would you let me live otherwise?

498
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:18,213
All right.

499
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,933
If this is your vision,

500
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,013
then let us make a pact.

501
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,173
Let us promise

502
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:27,812
that the Merfolk and Kongsang
will withdraw their forces within a month.

503
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,653
I will do my best.

504
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:32,693
Do your best?

505
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,372
The Merfolk marine force
may be complicated,

506
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,413
but you

507
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:37,612
are still

508
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,173
the Sea Emperor
they have waited 7,000 years for.

509
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:40,893
The Merfolk

510
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:42,812
will naturally obey you.

511
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:44,612
What can't you do

512
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:45,973
if you set your mind

513
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,052
to it?

514
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:50,132
Unless…

515
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:52,612
You are not the Sea Emperor.

516
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,453
You jest, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

517
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,812
I will make good on my word.

518
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,332
All right.

519
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,973
I will trust you once more.

520
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:09,612
When did you first realize

521
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:11,453
you were the Sea Emperor?

522
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:13,413
I was once the Lord Left Envoy
of the Merfolk marine force.

523
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:14,733
200 years ago,

524
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:16,612
I was severely wounded in battle.

525
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,052
So I went into hiding in Western Huang.

526
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:22,092
Recently, I sensed the God of Dragon,

527
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:24,092
and the Evil Star rose.

528
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,933
Thus, I returned to the Merfolk marine force.

529
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:28,933
What kind of injury

530
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:30,772
would require 200 years to recover from?

531
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:34,052
One of the heart.

532
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:38,173
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

533
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,372
I'll tell you that story

534
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:43,013
after I successfully

535
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,372
withdraw the Merfolk marine force.

536
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,092
Deal.

537
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:48,653
Oh, right.

538
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,772
You mentioned three reasons,

539
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,693
but you only stated two reasons

540
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:54,092
why I would not kill you.

541
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:56,372
The third reason…

542
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,292
Well, if you killed me,

543
00:22:58,852 --> 00:22:59,893
you would lose an acquaintance

544
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,612
to discuss
the art and appreciation of tea.

545
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:12,132
Young Master,

546
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,933
you've finally returned.

547
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:15,772
Why not stay for dinner?

548
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:17,772
I made Ciba cake
with red bean paste filling.

549
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,693
It was your favorite
when you were a child.

550
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:20,812
Thank you, Sixth Aunt.

551
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:24,332
You should stay

552
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,973
for dinner too.

553
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,852
Perhaps we can find more

554
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,332
mutual interests.

555
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:31,453
That's right.

556
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,733
Stay for the reception dinner

557
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:34,893
to welcome our Young Master home.

558
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:37,052
The more, the merrier, after all.

559
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:38,332
All right.

560
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,332
I shall accept your hospitality.

561
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:53,052
Ying,

562
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:54,973
these red lotus flowers

563
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:55,653
are truly…

564
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:58,493
He…

565
00:23:59,812 --> 00:23:59,973
He…

566
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:00,852
He is the Sea Emperor.

567
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,092
You two…

568
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,132
Have cleared our misunderstanding.

569
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:04,292
Then, I…

570
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:04,933
Keep your mouth shut

571
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,132
and sit down for dinner.

572
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:13,132
I'm surprised.

573
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,532
In the time
I went to get some red lotus flowers,

574
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:16,772
the fisherman

575
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,772
had become friends with the fish.

576
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:25,052
But I still don't trust him.

577
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:27,253
Don't let him deceive you.

578
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:29,812
Lord Chong Ming,

579
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:31,453
did you save a Merfolk

580
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:33,173
by the banks of Qingshui River

581
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,413
400 years ago?

582
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:36,973
Stop right there.

583
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:38,132
Do not try that with me.

584
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,013
I was born a charitable soul.

585
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,052
I've saved a lot of people.

586
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:43,453
That man

587
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,132
was a wandering physician
of the Merfolk Clan,

588
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,253
and the spiritual medicine

589
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:47,572
you gave him

590
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:48,973
has become a must-have

591
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:49,933
for the Merfolk healers.

592
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:51,332
We use it to apply to wounds.

593
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,933
We call it the Chongming Ointment.

594
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,973
In fact, for over 7,000 years,

595
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,493
we've been consuming and using
the same items

596
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:05,052
as the Kongsang people.

597
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:06,372
The Kongsang people

598
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,812
cannot live without us, either.

599
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,092
It's only been a month
since the war started,

600
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:11,933
the Merfolk has suffered heavy losses,

601
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:13,532
and Ye City is no longer

602
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,132
as prosperous as it once was.

603
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:18,092
So the truce is not an excuse

604
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,332
for us

605
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,693
to buy time,

606
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:22,933
but heaven's will.

607
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:39,812
(Let's go!)

608
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:41,733
The little ducky can't catch up.

609
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,173
What do we do?

610
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:44,973
Hurry, hurry!

611
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:46,493
Hurry, hurry!

612
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:47,572
Hurry and catch up!

613
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,612
Hurry!

614
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:50,173
It got it!

615
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:51,013
Did it get the food again?

616
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,173
Yes!

617
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:52,973
Mother,

618
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,532
my ducky got the food again!

619
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:14,812
Did your mother plant

620
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:16,052
the lotuses in this pond

621
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:16,852
before she died?

622
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:19,812
My mother's life

623
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,052
was just like the lotus in this pond.

624
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,213
Born out of the mud,
but unsullied and untainted.

625
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:26,372
Seeing the purity of the lotus,

626
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,052
one knows
the untainted nature of the mind.

627
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,372
Your mother transcended this world.

628
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:31,693
Her soul

629
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:34,013
must be free in the other world,

630
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,253
unbound by the worldly matters
of her past life.

631
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:37,653
That said,

632
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:39,453
I am admittedly surprised

633
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,092
by your attitude toward the Merfolk.

634
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,013
What do you think

635
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:44,092
I should have done?

636
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:45,933
Your true identity has long been spread

637
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:47,933
across Yunhuang.

638
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,092
What I say today
will not be overstepping lines.

639
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:52,733
Given your past,

640
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:54,052
it would have been within valid reason

641
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,453
for you to use this opportunity

642
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:56,893
to wipe out the Merfolk Clan

643
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,292
to seek revenge
for the injustices done to you.

644
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:00,372
I never would have expected you

645
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:03,173
to propose a truce,
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

646
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:04,812
I am human too.

647
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:07,812
I would not be able to face my mother

648
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:09,812
if I said I did not resent Qiushui.

649
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:11,372
But…

650
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:12,973
But you fearlessly fought Diba

651
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:14,693
at Guwei City,

652
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:16,052
and showed mercy

653
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,772
to the Merfolk marine force
at Extreme Wind City.

654
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,173
That's how I knew

655
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,173
that you could never bring yourself

656
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,292
to take the lives of millions

657
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:22,893
for revenge.

658
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,292
A man like you is worth

659
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:27,532
befriending.

660
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:30,213
Back then,

661
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,013
you were a high-ranking Left Envoy.

662
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,653
Yet, you were able to give up everything
and went into seclusion.

663
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:37,812
You were able to heal your wounds
with only time.

664
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:40,453
You're a man
of great passion and character.

665
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,213
You would rather find yourself displaced

666
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,493
than abandon your responsibility
to your people.

667
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:47,572
You are a worthy friend as well.

668
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:07,173
Farewell,

669
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:08,933
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

670
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:15,132
Who are you?

671
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:16,933
Your Majesty.

672
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:22,572
I'm here to see the Sea Emperor.

673
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,092
All of you, come in.

674
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:30,332
Slowly.

675
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:32,933
Careful.

676
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:33,612
Here.

677
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:36,453
All right.

678
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:41,372
Your Majesty,

679
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,292
the Valorous Cavalry is
arresting Merfolk all over the city.

680
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:45,893
The residents that agreed

681
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,693
to take us in kicked us out

682
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,413
for fear

683
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:49,852
of being implicated.

684
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:52,572
They have nowhere to go now.

685
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:54,812
That's right…

686
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,532
There's nowhere for us to go…

687
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:00,292
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

688
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:02,173
the war is raging,

689
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,253
and the world is in turmoil.

690
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,532
These blind Merfolk are unable

691
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:06,772
to protect themselves.

692
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:08,693
I've been looking everywhere

693
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:09,893
for a place for them to stay.

694
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:12,572
Please do not be offended.

695
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:14,092
I will take them away now.

696
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:16,893
These Merfolk are old

697
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:18,052
and blind.

698
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:19,413
They have difficulty moving as well.

699
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:21,173
Why not

700
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:23,213
let them stay here?

701
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,372
This is my mother's old residence.

702
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:28,292
The Valorous Cavalry

703
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,292
would not dare
to behave recklessly here.

704
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:31,132
Thank you.

705
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:32,213
Thank you

706
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:34,013
for taking us in.

707
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,013
Thank you.

708
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,493
Please get up.

709
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:38,572
Thank you.

710
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:39,693
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

711
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,372
I will never forget the kindness

712
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:43,693
you showed the Merfolk.

713
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,173
I only hope that our two clans

714
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:50,292
may cease this war soon

715
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,812
so that these unfortunate people

716
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,213
may live out their lives in peace.

717
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:57,413
Sixth Uncle, Sixth Aunt,

718
00:29:57,893 --> 00:29:58,733
please take care

719
00:29:59,052 --> 00:29:59,812
of them.

720
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:01,893
Yes, Young Master.

721
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,852
Madam, please follow me.

722
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:08,372
Here.

723
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:09,092
Come.

724
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:09,933
Madam.

725
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,612
Perhaps

726
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:13,973
we could have been friends

727
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,332
if

728
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:18,933
we were not on opposing sides.

729
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:21,812
This is where

730
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:23,013
you will be staying.

731
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:25,132
All of you will get to stay here.

732
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:26,052
Ruyi,

733
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:28,332
why did you bring them

734
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:28,852
here?

735
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:32,253
I told you,

736
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,693
we were evicted.

737
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:35,812
We had nowhere to go.

738
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:36,612
No.

739
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:38,453
You wanted to use

740
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:39,413
Shi Ying's sympathy.

741
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,413
You wanted to clear his doubts
about my character.

742
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:43,372
You are using the lives of our people

743
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:44,733
to protect my safety.

744
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,372
I'm not.

745
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:50,973
I know you're worried about me.

746
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:53,213
But I don't want you to become

747
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:54,132
like Elder Jian,

748
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:55,332
disregarding the lives of others

749
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,852
for his own selfish purposes.

750
00:30:57,933 --> 00:30:58,772
It is not only the Merfolk

751
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,693
that is in an abyss of peril.

752
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:02,653
When you take a wrong step

753
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:03,812
for your own selfishness,

754
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,052
you're one step closer

755
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,132
to the path of no return.

756
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,292
That is why, as your brother,

757
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:11,132
I must stop you at the first sign.

758
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,213
I understand, Yuan.

759
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:21,933
I was unable to find the Sea Emperor.

760
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:23,413
What about you?

761
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:26,612
By the time we arrived,

762
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,372
there were no longer
any signs of the Sea Emperor.

763
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:29,812
I sensed that the Sea Emperor

764
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:31,292
was close by that day.

765
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:33,292
But all of a sudden,
the Kongsang Army appeared.

766
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,132
By the time I took care of them,

767
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:36,933
I had lost the Sea Emperor.

768
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:39,612
If you hadn't started a war

769
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,933
with the Kongsang Army,

770
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:43,653
I would've brought
the Sea Emperor back safely

771
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,292
to us now.

772
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:46,772
That was an accident, Your Lordship.

773
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:48,852
We cannot call a truce

774
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:50,772
after coming this far.

775
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:51,933
Right?

776
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:52,653
Yes.

777
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,493
That's right.

778
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:55,612
That's what we need to do.

779
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:57,893
The Evil Star has been dimming.

780
00:31:58,413 --> 00:31:59,812
I suspect it was the war

781
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,493
that had displaced the Sea Emperor.

782
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,372
The odds are against us.

783
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:03,772
Continuing to fight in this situation

784
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,693
will only put the Sea Emperor in danger

785
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,612
and jeopardize
the great cause of the Sea Kingdom.

786
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:09,013
That's right.

787
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:10,973
We should decide our next move

788
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:11,812
after the return of the Sea Emperor.

789
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:13,052
This…

790
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,253
The Sea Emperor cares about his people.

791
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,173
He would never let the Merfolk

792
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:21,572
make unnecessary sacrifices.

793
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:23,213
You,

794
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:24,092
you,

795
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:24,893
and all of you.

796
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:26,013
Didn't your children lose their lives

797
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:27,493
because of this war?

798
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:32,332
We say that the Sea Emperor
remembers the dead,

799
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:34,372
but he has never even met them.

800
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:35,973
How could he remember them?

801
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:38,653
He has a point.

802
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,013
But we've already lost

803
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:41,852
so many soldiers.

804
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:43,653
Are we going

805
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:44,852
to give up the cities
we fought so hard for

806
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:46,453
just like that?

807
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:48,812
The Sea Emperor is the chosen one.

808
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,893
He will surely lead
the Sea Kingdom to glory.

809
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:53,292
Why must you insist on going to war

810
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:54,213
in such a hurry, Elder Jian?

811
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:57,132
What if the Sea Emperor is a child?

812
00:32:58,693 --> 00:32:59,413
I see you wish

813
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:00,453
the Sea Emperor is a child.

814
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:02,493
That way, you could control him

815
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:03,653
and rule over the Merfolk,
is that right?

816
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:07,532
Xi,

817
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,052
order the troops to withdraw.

818
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:10,092
Yes.

819
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:11,213
Wait.

820
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:13,532
Your Lordship,

821
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:16,292
if we withdraw now

822
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:19,413
and the Kongsang Army
continues the pursuit,

823
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:21,612
will you take responsibility
for what happens?

824
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:22,572
I promise.

825
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,253
As long as we withdraw our troops,

826
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:27,213
the two clans will cease this battle.

827
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,173
Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain.

828
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:38,852
I did not summon you.

829
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:40,893
Why are you here?

830
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:43,772
Your Majesty,

831
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:45,612
recently, the Evil Star has reappeared,

832
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:46,852
and our fate is uncertain.

833
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,973
As the Immortal Official
of Jiuyi Mountain,

834
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,812
I've been investigating this matter,

835
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,413
and recently there has been progress.

836
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,612
It's a matter of great importance,

837
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,653
so I've come here
to report to Your Majesty.

838
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:00,493
Tell me what progress

839
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,052
has been made.

840
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:03,413
I have found

841
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,213
the Sea Emperor.

842
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:11,933
The Sea Emperor has been found?

843
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:15,413
Is that true?

844
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:16,692
Yes.

845
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:18,373
I have also made an agreement
with the Sea Emperor

846
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,813
to have Kongsang
and the Merfolk marine force

847
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:21,853
withdraw their respective forces

848
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:23,212
and cease fire within a month.

849
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:26,732
Therefore, I ask that Your Majesty

850
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:29,373
withdraw all the Kongsang troops.

851
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:31,692
You are something, indeed,
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

852
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:34,092
A cease-fire is a serious matter.

853
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:35,212
How dare you make that decision

854
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:36,532
with the Merfolk by yourself!

855
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,052
What do the rest of you

856
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,092
think?

857
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:45,893
Your Majesty,

858
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,893
the stakes are high for this battle.

859
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:51,532
The Priest of Grand Preceptor is unaware

860
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:52,572
of the situation on the front line,

861
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:54,612
but he discussed making peace
with the Merfolk in private.

862
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:55,973
I believe

863
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:58,132
the Priest of Grand Preceptor is trying

864
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:00,092
to claim all the credit

865
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:01,692
for ceasing the rebellion himself.

866
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,453
Please look into it, Your Majesty.

867
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:05,773
I may not have participated in the war,

868
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,813
but I am well aware that the people
are the foundation of a nation,

869
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,373
and the stability of the foundation
ensures the peace of the nation.

870
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:11,572
Countless civilians

871
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:12,813
have lost their homes in this war.

872
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:15,092
Is the suffering of the people

873
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,293
just a bargaining chip for merit

874
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,732
in your eyes?

875
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:19,453
You…

876
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:22,532
The Merfolk marine force of the Sea Kingdom is

877
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:24,973
nothing to fear.

878
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:28,532
Your Majesty,

879
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,732
currently, the army led by Shi Yu is

880
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:33,373
advancing swiftly.

881
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:34,373
We have received
frequent victorious reports.

882
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:37,212
Even if minor sacrifices are made,

883
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:38,092
I do not see

884
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,132
any need

885
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:41,453
to withdraw our troops

886
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:42,612
while Kongsang

887
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:44,052
has the upper hand.

888
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:47,013
Rather than us having the upper hand

889
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,413
with the victorious reports,

890
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,052
it is better to say that we are merely
injuring a thousand enemy soldiers

891
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:52,252
while losing eight hundred of ours.

892
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,973
The Kongsang Army is only able

893
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:56,132
to seize the upper hand

894
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,293
by having an advantage in numbers.

895
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:00,052
But the Merfolk marine force is determined

896
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:00,853
to fight to the death.

897
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:04,132
The battle will not end any time soon.

898
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:05,532
The casualties on both sides

899
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:07,132
will only increase.

900
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:08,933
Even so,

901
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:11,612
the casualties are necessary.

902
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:15,252
The Merfolk are not one of us.

903
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,092
The Sea Kingdom has perished
for thousands of years,

904
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,732
but they refuse to give up.

905
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,933
This time,

906
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:26,092
we must eliminate them all,
without mercy!

907
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:27,732
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

908
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:29,052
The war must not be stopped!

909
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,732
Kill the Merfolk!

910
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:33,293
Kill the Merfolk!

911
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:37,773
As an outsider,
the Priest of Grand Preceptor

912
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:40,052
has repeatedly interfered
with political matters.

913
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:43,252
Now, he has even overstepped his place

914
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,652
and agreed to negotiate peace
in Your Majesty's stead.

915
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,933
I ask you, Priest of Grand Preceptor,

916
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:49,293
who are you

917
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:51,212
to make this decision for His Majesty?

918
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:54,732
What are your intentions?

919
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:56,373
Your Majesty,

920
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,773
it's true that I have a personal agenda.

921
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,692
But my concern is only for the fear

922
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,453
of another party

923
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:04,652
taking advantage

924
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,212
of this feud.

925
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:09,132
The Kongsang Army
and the Merfolk marine forces

926
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:10,172
are fighting,

927
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,212
but this has given
the Ice Clan in the north

928
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:13,132
an opportunity to take advantage of us.

929
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,413
Furthermore,

930
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:17,092
someone in the court has had

931
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,092
a lot of dealings with the Ice Clan.

932
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,493
You failed to answer my question,

933
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,973
so you brought up the Ice Clan

934
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:27,013
to muddy the waters.

935
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:29,572
Fortunately, His Majesty is wise

936
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:31,813
and will not be deceived by you.

937
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,652
The Azure King is right, Your Majesty.

938
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:38,572
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
has disrespected Your Majesty

939
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,413
and smeared the courtiers.

940
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:43,252
He must be punished, Your Majesty.

941
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,773
Please punish him, Your Majesty.

942
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,773
Please punish him, Your Majesty.

943
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:50,373
Please punish him, Your Majesty…

944
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:51,172
I have proof.

945
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:57,652
Insolence!

946
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:59,293
Are you revolting?

947
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:00,293
Protect His Majesty!

948
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:03,293
This is the proof.

949
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:05,813
Bring it to me.

950
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:24,893
You mustn't, Your Majesty!

951
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:29,052
This blade may look ordinary,

952
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,212
but it is a weapon of the Ice Clan.

953
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,933
It is made of Dark Cold Iron,

954
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,252
and it is deadly.

955
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:37,612
The Ice Clan has no problem wielding it

956
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:39,413
because they have already adapted

957
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:40,732
to the extreme cold.

958
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:43,493
If a Kongsang person touches it,

959
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,052
the cold will invade their body.

960
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:46,893
In the long run,

961
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:48,212
their hearts and veins will weaken,

962
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:50,293
and they will eventually die of illness.

963
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,413
Where did you get this?

964
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:56,013
I found this

965
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:58,252
in General Qing's camp in Ye City.

966
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:00,933
Many of the soldiers in the camp

967
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:02,612
had used this weapon.

968
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,092
It's because of the use of this weapon

969
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,052
that our troops

970
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:07,532
have been suffering from cold

971
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:08,973
since the beginning of the war.

972
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:11,572
The Azure King is so eager to win

973
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:14,212
that he resorts to using such a weapon.

974
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,973
All the victorious reports

975
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,413
of our advancement

976
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:19,893
were built

977
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:21,293
on exposing our troops

978
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,413
to such dangers.

979
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:24,652
To think such a matter happened…

980
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:27,293
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

981
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:28,933
I had instructed General Qing

982
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:30,652
to change the weapons

983
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:31,692
before I left the camp.

984
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:35,013
Azure King,

985
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:37,572
what do you have to say for yourself?

986
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:39,333
Your Majesty,

987
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,212
I am innocent.

988
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:43,532
Up until now,
the Pries of Grand Preceptor

989
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:44,893
has only been spouting nonsense
without proof.

990
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,453
Even if the Azure Army

991
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:48,612
prohibits the use of this weapon,

992
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:49,973
who can prove that it is a weapon

993
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,973
of the Ice Clan?

994
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:00,132
You were so certain

995
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,132
that no one here had ever seen
an Ice Clan weapon.

996
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:04,333
That is why you dared to act so boldly.

997
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,652
But you forget, Azure King,

998
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:08,252
I was attacked

999
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,692
at Jiuyi Mountain,

1000
00:40:10,252 --> 00:40:12,293
and the culprit was of the Ice Clan.

1001
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,013
This is the weapon they left behind.

1002
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:17,572
I have always stayed in Jiuyi Mountain.

1003
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,692
All the Immortal Officials can attest.

1004
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:22,572
Your Majesty can send someone

1005
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,773
to check if it's the same material.

1006
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:27,532
We do not have such iron in Kongsang.

1007
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:39,652
Qing Dongfang,

1008
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:43,692
dare you still argue?

1009
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:45,652
A large number of Ice Clan weapons

1010
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,572
have made their way
into the Kongsang Army.

1011
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,973
Dare you to say
you were not aware of this?

1012
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:55,212
I know

1013
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:57,172
my fault.

1014
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,293
But I only knew that this weapon

1015
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:01,013
would make it easier to kill the enemy,

1016
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,732
I didn't realize
the severity of this matter.

1017
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:06,212
I was careless.

1018
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,612
We have never traded with the Ice Clan.

1019
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:09,933
So where did these weapons

1020
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:10,933
come from?

1021
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:12,132
Your Majesty,

1022
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:13,612
I will

1023
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:15,052
investigate the person
who purchased these weapons

1024
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:15,813
and get to the bottom of this.

1025
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:18,132
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

1026
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:19,732
The Azure King

1027
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,293
oversees all of the military's finances.

1028
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:23,453
How can you push all of the blame

1029
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:24,572
onto your subordinates?

1030
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:25,692
Your Majesty,

1031
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:28,252
conspiring with the Ice Clan is
a serious offense.

1032
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,773
Your Majesty must investigate
this matter thoroughly.

1033
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,493
Please investigate
this matter thoroughly, Your Majesty.

1034
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:35,773
I believe

1035
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,092
it is unnecessary
to get to the bottom of this matter.

1036
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:39,773
As Your Majesty

1037
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,572
once said to me,

1038
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,652
"One leaf is enough
to tell the arrival of fall.

1039
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,413
One guilty is enough
to caution ten thousand."

1040
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,532
Since the Azure King

1041
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:50,813
has given up the buyer,

1042
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,453
then punishing that person will suffice

1043
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,333
to serve as a warning to others.

1044
00:41:58,212 --> 00:41:58,773
Azure King,

1045
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,813
shouldn't you thank
the Priest of Grand Preceptor

1046
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,132
for pleading grace on your behalf?

1047
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:08,652
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

1048
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:10,612
You need not thank me.

1049
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:13,052
All this is due

1050
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:14,212
to Your Majesty's benevolence.

1051
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:16,013
I know that Your Majesty

1052
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,252
would not take out your anger
on the Azure King,

1053
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:19,933
just as Your Majesty

1054
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,453
has always been compassionate

1055
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:22,132
to the innocent
who were caught in the war.

1056
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:25,013
The situation was urgent,

1057
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,612
so I took the liberty

1058
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:28,893
of negotiating peace

1059
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:31,132
with the Sea Emperor

1060
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:32,333
without your permission.

1061
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,692
However,

1062
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,132
whether the agreement proceeds

1063
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:36,933
is at Your Majesty's discretion.

1064
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:40,212
Since you've said that,

1065
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:41,212
how can I

1066
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:43,453
refuse?

1067
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:45,893
Pass on my decree.

1068
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:46,893
Withdraw

1069
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:48,212
all Kongsang troops

1070
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:49,692
at once.

1071
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:52,532
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

1072
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:54,052
tell me,

1073
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:58,092
who should be put
in charge of this matter?

1074
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:02,172
Crown Prince Shi Yu has been
stationed in the army

1075
00:43:02,773 --> 00:43:03,732
since the start of the war.

1076
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:05,453
He is familiar

1077
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:06,652
with the ongoings in the military.

1078
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,413
I strongly recommend him.

1079
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:13,532
Granted.

1080
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:21,493
Your Highness,

1081
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,413
a letter for you.

1082
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:24,493
Xueying must have known about the truce

1083
00:43:24,493 --> 00:43:24,933
and wrote to me.

1084
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,120
(Yu, for Azure Clan's glory, you can't
cease the war with the Merfolk.)

1085
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,880
(Soldier's from Azure Clan
will assist you. From Mother)

1086
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:39,212
Your Highness?

1087
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:47,813
Your Highness?

1088
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:51,773
Is something the matter,

1089
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:52,532
Your Highness?

1090
00:43:58,612 --> 00:43:59,052
No.

1091
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,212
The war between the two clans will cease.
It will be a great achievement.

1092
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:03,132
The withdrawal of our troops

1093
00:44:03,532 --> 00:44:04,493
will proceed as we planned.

1094
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,493
There's no time to lose.

1095
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:15,333
You…

1096
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:16,532
Who are you people?

1097
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:17,773
What… What do you want?

1098
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:18,493
Someone!

1099
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:19,052
Someone, come quickly!

1100
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:19,853
Calm down.

1101
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,813
I am the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain.

1102
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:24,493
I have some questions for you.

1103
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:27,893
I…

1104
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:28,652
I don't know anything.

1105
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:30,373
Will you still keep his secret for him

1106
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:32,333
now that it has come to this?

1107
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,252
Do you really think

1108
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,132
he will protect your mother

1109
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:37,453
and children?

1110
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:45,333
I've sent your son to Jiuyi Mountain.

1111
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:47,413
He is now an outsider.

1112
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,612
He will not be implicated.

1113
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:52,732
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor,

1114
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:54,572
for protecting my family's bloodline.

1115
00:44:57,092 --> 00:44:58,132
You are an innocent man.

1116
00:44:58,853 --> 00:44:59,652
The soldiers of Kongsang

1117
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:01,092
are innocent too.

1118
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:02,293
I do not want

1119
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:04,013
any more innocent lives to die in vain,

1120
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:05,413
so

1121
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:07,532
I must uncover the truth.

1122
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,212
I'm willing to tell you

1123
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:12,973
everything I know.

1124
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,020
♪How fateful was our encounter♪

1125
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,320
♪How tragic, destined by fate's decree♪

1126
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,650
♪How fragile,
