19
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,850
Greetings, Lord Left Envoy.

20
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,010
Ruyi,

21
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,250
I order you to disguise yourselves
and take Sumo away

22
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,690
by land tonight

23
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,889
and go to the God of Dragon
in Cangwu Abyss

24
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,250
to heal his wounds.

25
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:33,169
I can't run away

26
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,410
in the face of approaching enemies.

27
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,570
This is an order.

28
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,209
Then.

29
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,010
You can have someone else

30
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,130
send Sumo away.

31
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,609
It doesn't have to be me.

32
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,329
It's strange.

33
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,130
The thought of being separated

34
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,449
from you makes me very sad.

35
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,729
But

36
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,410
we've only just met.

37
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,810
Ruyi,

38
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,649
this child

39
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,329
is important to the Merfolk.

40
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,370
You protecting him and raising him

41
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,090
will mean much more
than you staying here,

42
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,489
do you understand?

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,810
I understand.

44
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,010
I will not let you down.

45
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:32,530
Your Lordship,

46
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,570
have we ever met before?

47
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,810
No.

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,010
Please take care, Your Lordship.

49
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,169
Sumo and I will be waiting for you

50
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,810
at the Cangwu Abyss.

51
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,570
All right.

52
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,370
(May the rest of your life)

53
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,609
(be restful and content.)

54
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,320
(War is rife, and our clans have suffered.)
Many Merfolk were able to escape

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,409
(I ask that we meet for a duel)
owing to the mercy

56
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,490
(to resolve this crisis. From: Yuan)
of the Priest and General Qing.

57
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:26,769
But I am worried

58
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,849
that doing so goes against

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,690
His Majesty's orders.

60
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,130
What if the unwanted grow again

61
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,209
when the breeze blows?

62
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,889
They will not return.

63
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,969
Tomorrow will be the end.

64
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,490
This is a letter of challenge
from the Sea Emperor.

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,409
He has challenged me to a duel
at the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House tomorrow.

66
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,649
There are only two other

67
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,529
sea entrances in Ye City.

68
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,170
The Xinghaiyun Pleasure House
and the Zhaoyun Crossing.

69
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,170
Tomorrow, I will head
to the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

70
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,490
You will go to find the sea entrance
in Zhaoyun Crossing.

71
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,849
If you encounter the Sea Emperor,

72
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,849
seize him with all your might.

73
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,649
If you do not see him,

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,570
then let the Merfolk go.

75
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:14,769
- Yes.
- Yes.

76
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,050
Are you really going to go alone?

77
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,570
I'm still not convinced about this.

78
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,250
I know Zhi Yuan's intention.

79
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,490
He wants to trade his life

80
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,409
for the safety of his people.

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,130
I will grant his wish.

82
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,769
Chong Ming,

83
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,089
tomorrow, you will observe the city

84
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,089
from a high place, just in case.

85
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,490
The Sea Emperor
might be a man of his word,

86
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,889
but I worry that there might still be

87
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,130
undeterred marine force

88
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,449
causing trouble.

89
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,010
All right. Leave it to me.

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,570
But your injury.

91
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,930
I will have no issue

92
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,930
slaying the Sea Emperor.

93
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,010
Tomorrow,

94
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,649
we will all evacuate Ye City

95
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,529
and return to Biluo Sea.

96
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:17,529
Danger will surely abound tomorrow.

97
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,089
What is your plan?

98
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,409
I will lure Shi Ying

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,810
to the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

100
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,570
The rest of the Merfolk
will evacuate via the Zhaoyun Crossing.

101
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,010
All right.

102
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,889
I'll go with you
to the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

103
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,490
Zhaoyun Crossing matters more to me.

104
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,570
Yan'er,

105
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,209
if you truly want to help me,

106
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,849
then go there

107
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:39,849
and help my people.

108
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,050
They need you more.

109
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,529
Before the last person enters the water,

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,529
I will use the conch
to give you a signal.

111
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,250
But

112
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,690
you'll be going up against
my master alone.

113
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:51,969
Don't worry.

114
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:53,769
I'm only going to lure him away.

115
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,769
I'll meet up with you right after.

116
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,010
All right.

117
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,449
Be careful.

118
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,409
I'll be waiting for you.

119
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,010
If my master gets
to the Zhaoyun Crossing,

120
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,130
I will hold him off for you.

121
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,250
Yuan,

122
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,690
do you remember that it was you

123
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,409
who brought me here for the first time?

124
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,810
I do.

125
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,289
You came to pay your respects
to the Crown Prince.

126
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,610
Why is it

127
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,649
that every time I come here,

128
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,089
I have to say goodbye

129
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,329
to someone close to me?

130
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,010
Before, it was the Crown Prince,

131
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,409
now, it's you.

132
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,690
It's my fault

133
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,010
for not being able to keep both of you.

134
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:11,930
This is improper of me.

135
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,050
How can I shed tears

136
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,649
on the eve of the battle?

137
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,570
I shouldn't upset your mind.

138
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,810
Yuan,

139
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,130
we will meet again.

140
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,730
When all of this is over,

141
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:32,569
you can come back

142
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,450
and visit me sometime.

143
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,970
Or maybe
when my powers are strong enough

144
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,689
to part the sea,

145
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,850
I might become the first Kongsang person

146
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,210
to visit the homeland of the Merfolk.

147
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,450
When that time comes,

148
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,649
I'll come and see you and Sumo.

149
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:52,330
Thank you

150
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,649
for all you've done for me.

151
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,809
Thank you

152
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,010
for letting us meet.

153
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:05,370
Take care,

154
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:07,769
Yan'er.

155
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,716
(Zhaoyun Crossing, Ye City)

156
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,330
Hurry!

157
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,610
Quickly!

158
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:01,450
Hurry!

159
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,210
Hurry!

160
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,010
Hurry!

161
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,889
Hurry!

162
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,090
Hurry!

163
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,289
Elder Jian.

164
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,490
No.

165
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:16,649
No.

166
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,090
Elder Jian is dead.

167
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:21,490
Who are you?

168
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,809
(I'll transform myself into a Merfolk)

169
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,289
(to deceive them.)

170
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,490
(I only know a handful)

171
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:30,889
(of the Merfolk authorities.)

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,210
(Who should I become?)

173
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:33,730
(I've got it.)

174
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,049
I'm not Elder Jian,

175
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:54,769
but I'm here to help.

176
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,889
If you trust Zhi Yuan,

177
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,569
you can trust me.

178
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,490
Continue the evacuation.

179
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,649
I'll shield you.

180
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,250
From now on,

181
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,929
I am your Sea Emperor.

182
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:11,409
Withdraw!

183
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:13,090
Quickly!

184
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,450
Yes.

185
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:14,689
- Hurry!
- Move!

186
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,769
- Hurry!
- Go!

187
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:16,569
Evacuate!

188
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:17,289
Hurry!

189
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,049
- Keep up!
- Quickly!

190
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,250
The battle is fierce.

191
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,689
I wonder if the Sea Emperor

192
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,130
is actually in this chaos.

193
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,169
Why don't we just eliminate all of them?

194
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:48,929
General Bai,

195
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,049
we agreed we'd capture the leader first.

196
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:53,409
The Sea Emperor

197
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,569
will not abandon his people.

198
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,490
Let's go to the front and take a look.

199
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,769
I'll stall them.

200
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,490
I'll leave this to you.

201
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,889
May we know who you are?

202
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,049
Thank you for everything

203
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,289
you are doing for us.

204
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,090
Not for you,

205
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,529
not for us,

206
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,169
but for all of us.

207
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,409
When you return to the Biluo Sea,

208
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,850
rest and recuperate.

209
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,649
I believe

210
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,689
that the two clans
will be reunited in the future.

211
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,090
We will meet again.

212
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:32,689
Evacuate!

213
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:34,010
Hurry!

214
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:34,529
Withdraw!

215
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:36,490
Quickly! Hurry!

216
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,610
I am the Sea Emperor.

217
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,689
All of you, come at me!

218
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,049
Is this man the Sea Emperor?

219
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,689
He didn't go
to the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

220
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,289
We'll know

221
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,490
after we capture him.

222
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,529
Surrender yourself, Sea Emperor!

223
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,929
Take me hostage.

224
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:47,970
All of you, get back!

225
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:51,090
Or I'll kill your commander!

226
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:54,929
Let Qing Gang go!

227
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,730
State

228
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:12,809
your demands.

229
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:15,929
Let my marine force go,

230
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,490
and I will go with you.

231
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,090
The Merfolk no longer wish to fight.

232
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,330
Why must you insist on killing us?

233
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:25,409
All right.

234
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:27,370
Deal.

235
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,569
The Sea Emperor

236
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:00,130
is most heinous!

237
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,289
He has taken General Qing as hostage

238
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,450
to force me to withdraw the troops.

239
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,289
He is delusional.

240
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,169
General Qing has said

241
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,889
he would rather sacrifice himself

242
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,569
than let the Merfolk go.

243
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:12,970
He will die for his nation

244
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,929
and have no regrets.

245
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,929
Archers!

246
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,529
Shoot the Sea Emperor

247
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,130
and kill the Merfolk!

248
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,850
Stop!

249
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,370
Let him go.

250
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:42,610
Bai Xuelu?

251
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:46,689
This is the best opportunity

252
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,090
to get rid of Qing Gang.

253
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,330
If he exposes us,

254
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,970
then you'll never become the Empress.

255
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,130
If you don't let them go,

256
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,610
I'll reveal your secrets right now.

257
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,450
What did you say?

258
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,049
Three.

259
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,210
Don't let your emotions...

260
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,649
Two.

261
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,330
Qing Gang changed his mind!

262
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,169
Let my people go!

263
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,049
Fine.

264
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:18,370
Let them go!

265
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,049
(It's done.)

266
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,610
(But)

267
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,409
(why hasn't Yuan come back yet?)

268
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,769
I allowed you to take me hostage

269
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,370
to let your people go.

270
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,929
But I cannot

271
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,049
let the Sea Emperor go!

272
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,450
You're not a Merfolk.

273
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,170
This is a fire technique
of the Jiuyi Mountain.

274
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,450
It's me.

275
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,450
Zhu Yan?

276
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,049
How can it be you?

277
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,410
The Sea Emperor is fighting my master

278
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,129
at the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

279
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,650
By his request,

280
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,010
I came to help the Merfolk escape.

281
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:25,690
Qing Gang,

282
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,690
you and I share the same thought.

283
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:29,849
When the battle is over,

284
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,369
I will turn myself in.

285
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,650
After him!

286
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,930
You tried to get rid of me as well

287
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,890
when the Sea Emperor
held me hostage, didn't you?

288
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,210
We must settle

289
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,769
this score.

290
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,769
The Sea Emperor escaped!

291
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:07,329
This is all your fault!

292
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:16,809
This is an order
from the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

293
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,049
The Sea Emperor has reached
the Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

294
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,410
Both of you are to guard Ye City

295
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,609
and prevent any remnants from escaping.

296
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,529
Even if I lose today's battle,

297
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:54,250
I lose with honor.

298
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:55,730
Even if I were to die,
I die with no regrets.

299
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,329
All right.

300
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,890
I will grant your wish.

301
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,569
Master, stop!

302
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,289
The Merfolk marine force
have returned to the Biluo Sea.

303
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,569
Yuan didn't lie!

304
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,730
He does want to end this war!

305
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:11,690
Master!

306
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,170
Master!

307
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,129
Zhi Yuan.

308
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:16,529
Stop!

309
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,129
I know your character.

310
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,250
But for the sake of Kongsang.

311
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:22,730
No!

312
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,450
Master!

313
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:25,930
Don't do it, Master!

314
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,410
Master!

315
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,329
Master!

316
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,490
I am the one who should thank you.

317
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,529
For the sake of the Merfolk,

318
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,769
do it.

319
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,769
Master. Don't do it!

320
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,930
Don't do it, Master.

321
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:51,930
Take care of her for me.

322
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:52,769
Master.

323
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:54,730
In this life, you and I were enemies.

324
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,329
If there is to be a next life,

325
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,769
I hope we can be friends.

326
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,970
No.

327
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,250
Very well.

328
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,329
No, Master!

329
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,490
Master!

330
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,170
Master!

331
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,609
Master!

332
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:48,450
Yuan!

333
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,049
Yuan.

334
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,329
Yuan.

335
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,170
Yuan.

336
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,450
No.

337
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,529
Yuan.

338
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,129
Yuan.

339
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,490
Yuan.

340
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,569
Yuan!

341
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:33,289
Yuan!

342
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,450
Yuan.

343
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,490
Yuan!

344
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:39,609
Yuan.

345
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,410
Yuan.

346
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,970
Don't die, Yuan! Yuan.

347
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,010
Yuan?

348
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:48,329
Yuan!

349
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,329
Yuan.

350
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,490
Yuan.

351
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,849
Yuan! Yuan.

352
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:56,609
Don't go!

353
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,129
Yuan.

354
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,849
Yuan.

355
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:03,890
The Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan,

356
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,809
leader of the rebels,

357
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,490
has been executed.

358
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,010
The Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan,

359
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,609
leader of the rebels,

360
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:26,410
has been executed.

361
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,769
The Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan,

362
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:30,369
leader of the rebels,

363
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,210
has been executed.

364
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:34,650
The Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan,

365
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,369
leader of the rebels,

366
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,049
has been executed.

367
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,129
The Sea Emperor is dead.

368
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,210
Ying has accomplished a feat

369
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,769
that will be remembered
throughout the ages.

370
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,049
The sword is dead.

371
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:07,170
Its owner is dead.

372
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:10,250
The sword is dead.

373
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,369
Its owner is dead.

374
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,769
Send another message.

375
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,369
The war between Kongsang
and the Merfolk

376
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,329
ends

377
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:22,289
today.

378
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,930
Why did you kill my Yuan?

379
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,890
Why?

380
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,849
I told you

381
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,250
the Merfolk marine force

382
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,769
will destroy Kongsang in 70 years.

383
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,250
How do you know
if the prophecy will come true?

384
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:39,890
Yuan already ordered the Merfolk

385
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,010
to retreat back to the Biluo Sea.

386
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,809
Why would you rather believe
the prophecy

387
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,930
than me?

388
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,690
The prophecy will come true.

389
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:59,529
Yuan is dead

390
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:03,410
all because of some prophecy.

391
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,049
You killed my Yuan.

392
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,410
You did it!

393
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,769
You killed my Yuan!

394
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,690
It was you.

395
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,170
You killed him!

396
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:33,690
You killed him.

397
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,890
You killed my Yuan!

398
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,289
So

399
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,410
you're going to avenge him?

400
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,529
You're mocking me again.

401
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,250
I am not as skilled as you.

402
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,089
I can't avenge him!

403
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,170
But I hate you!

404
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,250
I hate you!

405
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:02,930
I never want

406
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:07,650
to see you again.

407
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:19,289
Do you love him that much?

408
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,089
I thought you could read minds.

409
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,529
Master... Master!

410
00:27:58,769 --> 00:27:59,609
Master!

411
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,650
Master.

412
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:06,730
Blood.

413
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:07,730
Blood.

414
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,650
Blood.

415
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,289
Yan'er.

416
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,769
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,089
I killed the man you loved.

418
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:17,849
I'll use my life to make up for it.

419
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,450
No.

420
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:21,970
No, Master.

421
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,890
No.

422
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,170
Yan'er.

423
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:34,809
The Jade Bone.

424
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:44,289
The Jade Bone will keep you safe.

425
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,010
Will you be sad

426
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,049
if I die?

427
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,650
More than when that man

428
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,690
died?

429
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,170
No.

430
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,010
It's not like that.

431
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,250
That's not true, Master.

432
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,529
Master,

433
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:10,129
that's not what I meant.

434
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:14,849
This isn't how
it was supposed to be, Master.

435
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,730
The one I love...

436
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:21,010
The one I love

437
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,329
is you, Master.

438
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,289
Master!

439
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:29,569
Master!

440
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,890
Why didn't you read my minds?

441
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:39,849
I have loved you

442
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,970
since you were the Crown Prince.

443
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,010
But I didn't dare to tell you.

444
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,210
Master.

445
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,089
Master.

446
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,250
Master.

447
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,690
You are the one I love.

448
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,930
I love you.

449
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:19,970
It's the backlash
of the Heart-Crushing Curse.

450
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,170
Master.

451
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,410
Master.

452
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:34,329
Wake up.

453
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,609
Master.

454
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,369
Ying!

455
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,609
High Priest of Grand Preceptor!

456
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:45,049
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

Ying!

458
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,690
Please save him!

Ying!

460
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:51,289
Please save my master.

461
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,010
Please save him.

462
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:55,450
Ying!

463
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,890
Was I too late?

464
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,490
Why did the Heart-Crushing Curse fail?

465
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,210
Master.

466
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,089
You killed Ying!

467
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,769
Yes.

468
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,250
I killed him.

469
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,529
He went so far for you.

470
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,450
Master.

471
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,609
Ying,

472
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,809
how could you have been so foolish?

473
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,529
How could such a foolish being exist?

474
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,849
How could you use your own life

475
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,210
to break her Heart-Crushing Curse?

476
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,289
What curse?

477
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,170
Ying died for you.

478
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,049
Today,

479
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:47,089
you will join him in the other world.

to gain Shi Ying's trust

502
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,290
and acquired this opportunity for us.

Now,

504
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:48,930
both Shi Ying and Zhi Yuan are dead.

505
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,370
The world will descend into chaos.

506
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,569
Houtu has finally reappeared
in the mortal realm.

you are brilliant-minded indeed.

We congratulate you
for achieving your wish.

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,450
My Lord, what is our next step?

511
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:05,970
The Heavenly Divine Ring.

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,930
- to obtain the Heavenly Divine Ring.
- to obtain the Heavenly Divine Ring.

515
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,209
Your cousin, Shi Ying, eliminated
the Kongsang Dynasty's greatest threat!

516
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,850
His achievements are immeasurable!

517
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:21,209
No one can compare to him!

518
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,810
After this battle,

519
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,930
Shi Ying will surely return
to imperial court.

520
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:30,810
Fenglin,

521
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,649
you must

522
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,770
serve him well

523
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:35,770
and restore the name of the White Clan.

524
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:39,169
Xuelu,

525
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,370
you will be a benevolent empress.

526
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:42,890
The day he recovers and returns

527
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,569
from Jiuyi Mountain

528
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,689
will be the day

529
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,770
the White Clan rises again!

530
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,169
I am guilty.

531
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,209
I'm afraid the first thing he will do
once he returns to Jialan

532
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,729
will not be to reward the White Clan

533
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,970
but to prosecute me for my faults.

534
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:06,290
Fenglin,

535
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,450
what do you mean?

536
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,169
I was too eager to make a mark,

537
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,209
and I despised the Merfolk so much

538
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,649
that I delivered false information

539
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:18,249
to the marine force

540
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,049
just to lure them into a trap

541
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:21,649
and capture all of them.

542
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:24,689
But Qing Gang intercepted it

543
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:28,010
before my plan succeeded.

544
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,209
He had always meant

545
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,609
to compete for merit against me.

546
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,490
So he would not listen
to my reasoning at all

547
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,330
and insisted on reporting me to Shi Ying

548
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,410
for conspiring with the enemy.

549
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,609
I cannot defend myself.

550
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,850
Bai Fenglin,

551
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,609
it was you

552
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,529
who conspired with the marine force

553
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,010
for your personal gain.

554
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,330
You even coerced me
into stealing the military report.

555
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:49,970
But here you are,

556
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,049
trying to twist the facts.

557
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,490
What do you two have in mind?

558
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,410
Father,

559
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,490
Bai Fenglin made a mistake,

560
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,890
and I am his accomplice.

561
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,209
I will accept the punishment.

562
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,169
I will confess everything

563
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,010
to the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

564
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:14,290
Nonsense!

565
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:15,649
Xuelu,

566
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,930
have you ever thought

567
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,529
that if you and I
are convicted for this,

568
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:23,249
when Shi Ying returns,

569
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,129
not only will the White Clan
not be rewarded,

570
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:26,970
but we will even

571
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:28,649
become the laughingstock of the court?

572
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,209
What's more,

573
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,649
you don't seem to show

574
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,129
any consideration for our father at all.

575
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:35,129
Father only has three children.

576
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,569
You, me, and Xueying.

577
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,129
Now, Xueying has eloped with Shi Yu,

578
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:40,290
and we have lost all news of her.

579
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,689
If your reputation is tarnished as well,

580
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,770
then are we going
to hand over the position of Empress

581
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,010
to another branch of the White Clan

582
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,850
when Shi Ying is crowned the emperor?

583
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,450
Xuelu,

584
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,410
you'll leave
for Jiuyi Mountain tomorrow.

585
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,169
Not to report your brother's crimes

586
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,569
but to win Shi Ying over

587
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,890
when he is at his weakest

588
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,049
and secure your place as his empress.

589
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,810
Embarrassed, are you?

590
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:18,129
This is no big deal.

591
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,810
Back then,

592
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,209
your mother seduced me too.

593
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:24,689
I wouldn't have
even spared her a glance otherwise,

594
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,569
with her background.

595
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,890
You might want to use

596
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:32,649
some of your mother's techniques

597
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,810
to ensure that title is yours.

598
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,529
I won't mind.

599
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,410
A splendid idea, Father.

600
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,410
We will kill two birds with one stone.

601
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:45,810
Firstly,

602
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,249
this will ensure
that Xuelu becomes the Empress.

603
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:49,649
Secondly,

604
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:51,450
once Shi Ying

605
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,529
becomes the son-in-law
of the Bai Family,

606
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:55,649
he won't hold
such petty mistakes over me.

607
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,209
I refuse.

608
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,770
You refuse?

609
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,129
Do you not want
to bring your mother's tablet

610
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,410
back to the family?

611
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,010
If my mother knew about this,

612
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:12,850
she wouldn't let me

613
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,129
betray myself and go against my will.

614
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,450
She traded her body

615
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,089
for a life of luxury for you.

616
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,129
If I hadn't taken you in,

617
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,529
you would've ended up just like her.

618
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:29,010
Now is your time

619
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,249
to repay the White Clan.

620
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,529
I will give you another chance.

621
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,370
Will you marry Shi Ying or not?

622
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,089
She will not.

623
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:50,129
My sister's marriage
is a matter of the White Clan.

624
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:51,689
It has nothing to do with you.

625
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,049
Of course, it does.

626
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,609
Xuelu and I

627
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:58,729
have promised ourselves to each other.

628
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,689
What a heroic rescue!

629
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,810
You say that you and my sister
are in love.

630
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:08,410
Do you have proof?

631
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,850
Xuelu,

632
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:15,330
I gave you
my family's heirloom jade pendant.

633
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,970
I know you always carry it with you.

634
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,410

658
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,609
Qing Gang has trespassed
on my residence

659
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:28,330
and taken Princess Bai Xuelu hostage.

660
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,649
Kill him!

661
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,089
The Moon Blade is
the ultimate treasure of the White Clan.

662
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,810
It belongs to the wielder
with the strongest magic power.

663
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,249
Does that mean Princess Xuelu

664
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:17,410
has surpassed Bai Fenglin

665
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,370
and become the strongest
of the White Clan?

666
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:06,770
Why didn't you tell me

667
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,609
you had reached

668
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,529
such a high level of mastery?

669
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:10,689
Why?

670
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,010
The same reason why I didn't tell you

671
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,729
General Qing and I

672
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,010
had gotten together.

673
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:19,490
You don't deserve to know.

674
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:29,609
(White King's Residence)

675
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,490
Xuelu,

676
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:52,330
your magic technique

677
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,770
has surpassed Bai Fenglin's.

678
00:44:57,689 --> 00:44:58,290
I never stopped training

679
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:00,770
after leaving the mountain.

680
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:03,609
But I was too focused

681
00:45:04,249 --> 00:45:06,410
on trying to please others.

682
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,010
Until I saw you

683
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,290
in danger today.

684
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,770
That's when I realized

685
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,169
I had such tremendous power within me.

686
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,930
So, after this, we...

687
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,330
We?

688
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:45,930
Xuelu,

689
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,049
give me more time.

690
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:50,649
Your father and brother

691
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,249
will not let you go just like that.

692
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,689
I must go to Jiuyi Mountain

693
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,569
and explain everything
to the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

694
00:45:58,249 --> 00:45:59,410
I'll come with you.

695
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,089
Ying,

696
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,609
it is all my fault.

697
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:37,290
I shouldn't have let you
give up priesthood.

698
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,089
I shouldn't have used Zhu Yan

699
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,609
to sway you from your path.

700
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:45,290
I was so conceited

701
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,010
that I thought
I had everything under control.

702
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:49,209
I thought I could defy
the will of heaven

703
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:53,810
and change the prophecy.

704
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,890
If I had known this would happen,

705
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:59,129
I would've made you stay in the mountain

706
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:02,049
and remain a noble priest.

707
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,049
I shouldn't have let you out

708
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,649
to suffer in this mundane world.

709
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,049
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

710
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,290
please allow me to go inside

711
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:31,129
and pay my final respects to my master.

712
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,623
(Cultivating Hall)

713
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:37,529
It was Zhu Yan who hurt Shi Ying.

714
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,129
Why did the Heart-Crushing Curse
not activate?

715
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:45,290
Ying

716
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,970
held Zhu Yan's sword

717
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,330
and plunged it into his chest.

718
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,770
He took his own life.

719
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,370
I shouldn't have taken any chances.

720
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:58,649
I should've known

721
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,490
that the prophecy

722
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,529
always comes true.

723
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,209
She is still kneeling outside.

724
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:15,450
Let her in.

725
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,129
Lord Chong Ming.

726
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:38,169
His death blames on you.

727
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,729
I will never forgive you.

728
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,129
Go inside.

729
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,890
Master.

730
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,569
Zhu Yan,

731
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,330
Shi Ying did this because of you.

732
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:41,290
I know.

733
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,249
You know?

734
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:46,129
Did you know that he was destined

735
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:47,129
to die by your hands

736
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,930
the first time you two met
on Jiuyi Mountain?

737
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:53,490
What?

738
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,850
Today,

739
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,729
I will tell you everything.

740
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:10,890
Back then,

741
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:14,249
I had Ying fake his death

742
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:15,850
and took him away from Jialan.

743
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,370
But because of your prayer,

744
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:21,089
you became the one doomed to kill him.

745
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,890
If he met you

746
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,850
before he turned 18,

747
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,490
he would die by your hand,

748
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:29,209
according to the prophecy.

749
00:50:30,649 --> 00:50:31,970
So I instructed him

750
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,890
to seclude himself
within the Emperor Valley.

751
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,890
That he should not meet any woman

752
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,569
before he turned 18.

753
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,970
Jiuyi Mountain

754
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:43,129
had no female disciples back then.

755
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,290
I thought I had prepared for everything.

756
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:49,450
But the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
overlooked you.

757
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,609
We didn't know you would barge
into the Emperor Valley.

758
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:21,169
Why don't I have
any recollection of this?

759
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:22,729
Back then,

760
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,330
he should've killed you.

761
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:28,370
But in a moment of weakness,

762
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,249
he hid you
from the High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

763
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,089
He only used magic

764
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,129
to erase your memories.

765
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:34,609
Later,

766
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,249
you saved him by accident.

767
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:38,290
But it proved

768
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,770
that you were the cursed lady.

769
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,290
You consoled him
over his mother's death.

770
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,850
It made it even harder
for him to bring himself to kill you.

771
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,569
So he only made you leave.

772
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,529
After that.

773
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:48,970
After that,

774
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,609
he tried to make me leave the mountain.

775
00:51:52,729 --> 00:51:54,410
He only did it to protect me.

776
00:51:57,609 --> 00:51:58,330
But

777
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:01,370
if he knew that I would hurt him,

778
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:04,290
why did he accept me as his disciple?

779
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,649
Was it also

780
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,410
to hide my identity

781
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,290
from the High Priest of Grand Preceptor?

782
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,370
To protect me?

783
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:18,569
You spent a lot of time
with him in the mountains.

784
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,850
He grew fond of you.

785
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,450
That's impossible!

786
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,609
How could he have feelings for me?

787
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:28,450
After the incident at the Cangwu Abyss,

788
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,529
he became certain of his feelings.

789
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:32,450
Can't you see everything

790
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:33,609
that he has done for you?

791
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:38,609
(This is an ancient divine artifact)

792
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,209
(passed down by Empress Bai Wei.)

793
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,330
(It is also your graduation gift.)

794
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:48,970
(I'll carry you up the mountain.)

795
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:56,729
Hold on tight,

796
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:58,930
or you'll fall.

797
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:07,169
(One life, one destiny, one pair.)

798
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,930
Never lose, never forget,
never be separated each other.

799
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,689
Yan'er,

800
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,370
I plan

801
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,649
to give up priesthood

802
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,089
after the troops are withdrawn

803
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,729
and leave my post.

804
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:23,569
Master likes me.

805
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,330
So

806
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:28,970
he planed to leave priesthood

807
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,129
for my sake.

808
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,569
He planed to come back
to the mortal world to be with you.

809
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,049
He loved you deeply,

810
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,890
but you let him down
time and time again.

811
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,649
You even told him yourself

812
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:43,209
that you love that Merfolk.

813
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:47,970
Yan'er.

814
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,049
Yan'er.

815
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,169
Yan'er.

816
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:51,249
Yan'er.

817
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,609
Yan'er.

818
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:56,330
The Jade Bone is not only a sacred relic

819
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,209
left behind by Empress Bai Wei.

820
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,649
It is also the token
given by the emperors of Kongsang

821
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:04,209
to their empresses.

822
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,129
The Jade Bone.

823
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,569
The Jade Bone will keep you safe.

824
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:27,209
Why didn't you tell me?

825
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,330
I've loved you

826
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,290
from the first moment I saw you.

827
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:00,930
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

828
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,330
is there a way

829
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,930
to return the dead to the living?

830
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:11,810
I remember asking you this back then.

831
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:14,810
You said there was not.

832
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,129
I'll ask you one last time.

833
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,770
Is there really no such thing?

834
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,970
Be it a miraculous elixir,

835
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,689
heaven-defying technique,

836
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,850
or a blasphemous forbidden spell,

837
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:29,649
even if there's only

838
00:55:29,649 --> 00:55:30,850
a one in ten thousand chance,

839
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:32,569
I am willing to pay any price

840
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,089
to bring my master back.

841
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,970
Ying's soul has been
shattered into pieces.

842
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,649
Even if I use every power I have,

843
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,810
I can only extend his life
for seven days.

844
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,114
He is currently neither alive nor dead.

845
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,771
He is in the liminal state
between death and rebirth.

846
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,249
Then...

847
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,450
What will happen after that?

848
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,609
If we cannot restore his soul

849
00:56:05,249 --> 00:56:06,689
within seven days,

850
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,089
the pieces of his soul

851
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:12,049
will vanish,

852
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:15,410
reaching the end of his life,

853
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,249
and returning to dust.

854
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,850
I can do it.

855
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,970
Please tell me how.

856
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:27,569
There is a forbidden technique

857
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,129
that allows one to defy fate
and change one's destiny.

858
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:32,089
But no one

859
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,169
has ever succeeded.

860
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:34,930
It requires the caster

861
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,049
to establish a spiritual connection

862
00:56:37,649 --> 00:56:39,729
with the deceased

863
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:41,970
and retrieve his soul

864
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,410
from heaven and earth.

865
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,569
Within three days,

866
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:48,689
using oneself as the cauldron,

867
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,249
they must refine and solidify his soul

868
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,249
in order to bring him back to life.

869
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:56,970
Make any mistake,

870
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,689
and all will be in vain.

871
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:02,209
I can do it.

872
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:04,569
This spell

873
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,770
takes a huge toll on the caster.

874
00:57:08,169 --> 00:57:10,089
You must sacrifice half of your life.

875
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:12,970
I've calculated your remaining lifespan.

876
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,490
You have 54 years left.

877
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:17,810
That means whether you succeed or not,

878
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:21,729
you only have 27 years to live.

879
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,649
Are you certain?

880
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,410
I am willing to try

881
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,649
even if it costs my life.

882
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:35,410
All right.

883
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:39,649
Come with me.

884
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:47,569
Master,

885
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:52,089
trust me.

886
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:55,290
We will meet again,

887
00:57:57,529 --> 00:57:58,810
no matter where we are.

888
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:19,569
This book contains

889
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,689
the most profound
magic techniques of Yunhuang.

890
00:58:22,529 --> 00:58:23,529
It also records the forbidden technique

891
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,689
we're searching for.

892
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:28,554
(Blood Curse)

893
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:30,850
How can this be?

894
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:33,569
Isn't this the notebook

895
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:35,049
my master gave me?

896
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,049
Except mine

897
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:38,930
has a lot of his annotations.

898
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,089
You said Ying

899
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:42,010
made a copy for you?

900
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,689
Where is it?

901
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,410
Zhu Yan,

902
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:49,609
only the final page of this book

903
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,209
contains the forbidden technique we seek.

904
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,410
The Star Revival Blood Oath.

905
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,890
The Star Revival Blood Oath.

906
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:14,370
He tore out that page.

907
00:59:19,711 --> 00:59:20,934
(Blood Curse)

908
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:23,010
It seems that he tore out that page

909
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:25,089
from this book too.

910
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,290
He knew this day would come.

911
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:32,890
To think he came this far for you.

912
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,049
That fool.

913
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,689
I've lived for more than 10,000 years,

914
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:40,169
and I've never met one more foolish.

915
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:42,930
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

916
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,569
is there any other way?

917
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,410
I'll do anything

918
00:59:47,729 --> 00:59:49,049
to save him.

919
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,169
Even if it takes a life for a life.

920
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,049
Ying has torn up

921
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:58,089
the record of the Star Revival Blood Oath.

922
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,649
There is nothing else I can do

923
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,089
to let him open his eyes again.

924
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:08,729
No.

925
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:12,330
I refuse to believe this.

926
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:26,970
Zhu Yan.

927
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:31,330
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

928
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:33,450
there must be another way.

929
01:00:37,129 --> 01:00:37,689
Your Supreme Majesty.

930
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,169
Please connect my master and me

931
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,689
through a spiritual barrier.

932
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:43,209
Since his soul still remains,

933
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:46,049
and the trace of Gong Shang
has rekindled.

934
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:48,729
I may be able to find

935
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,689
the page of the Star Revival Blood Oath

936
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,450
in his spiritual barrier.

937
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,049
You're right.

938
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,649
Within the spiritual barrier exists

939
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,370
the memories of one's past,

940
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:00,410
and you've been inside

941
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:02,129
your master's spiritual barrier before.

942
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,049
So

943
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:06,169
that wasn't a dream.

944
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:08,370
You had a spiritual connection,

945
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,290
and he was in love with you.

946
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:12,249
That is how you were able
to enter his spiritual barrier.

947
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,689
Zhu Yan,

948
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,529
there is nothing else I can do.

949
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:19,649
It is up to you now.

950
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,330
I'll try.

951
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,089
They are divided by life and death.

952
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:26,810
No living has ever been able

953
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,810
to enter the spiritual barrier
of the deceased

954
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,770
and communicate with them.

955
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,609
I will not give up,

956
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:35,810
even if there is only a glimmer of hope.

957
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,689
(I must warn you.)

958
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,810
(The spiritual barrier)

959
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,010
(will not last long.)

960
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,089
(You must find)

961
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,410
(the Star Revival Blood Oath
as soon as possible once inside.)

962
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:51,890
(But remember this.)

963
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:54,729
(You must not touch anything inside.)

964
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,490
(If you leave)

965
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,689
(even the slightest trace behind,)

966
01:01:58,169 --> 01:01:59,209
(it will cause)

967
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,930
(the most horrifying damage to you.)

968
01:02:10,249 --> 01:02:10,970
What do I do?

969
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,609
I've already wasted a day.

970
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,370
I made it.

971
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:47,327
(Cultivating Hall)

972
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:02,970
Master!

973
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,770
He cannot see me in his memories.

974
01:03:27,169 --> 01:03:28,330
Master.

975
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,729
Who made

976
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,770
this horrendous wreath?

977
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:46,370
Her again?

978
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:51,529
Why did you choose hers?

979
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,770
You have always been particular
about cleanliness.

980
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,850
This grass wreath is untidy.

981
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,890
In the past, you'd have thrown it away.

982
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,330
It is ugly.

983
01:03:59,049 --> 01:03:59,970
I'll fix it for her.

984
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:01,410
Why did you choose it, then?

985
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,010
I said a lot of hurtful things

986
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,410
to break Zhu Yan's heart.

987
01:04:08,049 --> 01:04:09,169
Other people would have been

988
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,609
devastated and disheartened,

989
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:13,089
but Zhu Yan never changed her heart.

990
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,689
I want to give her some encouragement.

991
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:19,450
Don't tell me you've been swayed by her

992
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,930
because of the Magpie Branch.

993
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,249
Don't forget

994
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,249
that she is the cursed lady.

995
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,810
I don't care about that.

996
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:27,930
Life and death are determined by heaven.

997
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:29,089
I do not let myself dwell on it.

998
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,410
Besides,

999
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,810
she will not remain
in the mountain for long.

1000
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,729
She doesn't have what it takes.

1001
01:04:36,169 --> 01:04:36,649
No.

1002
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,930
I'm asking you what you think.

1003
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,010
Of course, I won't keep her.

1004
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,049
If she knew

1005
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,729
that her beloved Crown Prince

1006
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,010
was...

1007
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:47,850
was such a disappointment,

1008
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:50,290
she would be devastated.

He cannot see me.

1019
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:47,370
You do see me as an outsider, Master.

1020
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,010
You won't teach me your greatest skills.

1021
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:52,410
So?

1022
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:56,049
I can do as I please
since I'm more powerful.

1023
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:57,209
You.

1024
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:02,169
You.

1025
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:24,729
No!

1026
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:48,770
What do I do?

1027
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:50,330
Where should I go?

1028
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:55,330
The Hall of Books. Yes.

1029
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:56,330
I must return

1030
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,569
to the day he wrote me that notebook.

1031
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,169
That's my only chance.

1032
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,553
(The Star Revival Blood Oath)

1033
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,249
(The Star Revival Blood Oath)

1034
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:42,970
(contains the power of heaven and earth)

1035
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:43,810
(that transcends life and death.)

1036
01:09:44,409 --> 01:09:46,169
(Its laws are closely connected)

1037
01:09:46,369 --> 01:09:47,610
(to the movement of the stars.)

1038
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,770
(But no one has been able
to figure it out)

1039
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:50,930
(for millions of years.)

1040
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,449
(You will have to comprehend
the mysteries within it by yourself.)

1041
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:58,329
(I will set up an array
at Starry Lake for you.)

1042
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,650
(Find all of Shi Ying's soul pieces)

1043
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:02,770
(within heaven and earth,)

1044
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,449
(and you will complete)

1045
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:05,850
(the first step to his revival.)

1046
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,930
(Will Zhu Yan be able to handle it?)

1047
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,289
(She has been corrupted by the energy
from the realm in-between,)

1048
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,570
(but she refuses to let me expel it.)

1049
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:17,930
(The damage to her is severe.)

1050
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,409
(She will gradually lose
her five senses.)

1051
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:21,890
(It is irreversible.)

1052
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:23,449
(Is there any other way, then?)

1053
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,650
(She is the only one)

1054
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:26,970
(who can save Shi Ying.)

1055
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,690
(She has to sacrifice herself.)

1056
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,730
Master.

1057
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,049
I will save you.

1058
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:09,289
Try this.

1059
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:11,650
You eat it.

1060
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:13,530
You should eat more.

1061
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:15,650
What would you like to order?

1062
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,890
The two of you are a perfect match.

1063
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:19,890
Your husband is so thoughtful.

1064
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:21,449
You are a lucky woman.

1065
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:22,810
No.

1066
01:11:23,129 --> 01:11:24,289
We didn't perform the three bows.

1067
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:26,770
Well, you ought to try harder, young hero.

1068
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,610
You shouldn't let someone else

1069
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,890
take such a quiet and gentle girl from you.

1070
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,650
May your words be a blessing.

1071
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:35,570
I hope to marry her soon too.

1072
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,690
Who said I was going to marry you?

1073
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:47,810
Your soup.

1074
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:50,209
Enjoy.

1075
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:51,089
Thank you.

1076
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,249
Thank you.

1077
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:01,169
I know you were forced
to say yes that day.

1078
01:12:02,129 --> 01:12:04,129
But everyone in Ye City knows

1079
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,770
that you and I have eloped now.

1080
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:11,049
Xuelu,

1081
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:13,850
I will never let you down.

1082
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:43,890
Xuelu, watch out!

1083
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:25,010
How dare you touch my man!

1084
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:29,249
Oh my god.

1085
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:29,930
Let's go.

1086
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:33,650
Are you all right?

1087
01:14:37,449 --> 01:14:37,970
Miss.

1088
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:41,209
No. You are
a good fighter, young heroine.

1089
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,369
You are a lucky man, young hero.

1090
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:51,850
Xuelu,

1091
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:52,730
you.

1092
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:01,650
You looked completely different

1093
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,089
when you were fighting
and when you were eating.

1094
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:06,610
It's as if you're a different person.

1095
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,610
You scared me.

1096
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,730
Which one do you prefer, then?

1097
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,650
The gentle one or the fierce one?

1098
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,610
I like them all,

1099
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:25,089
as long as it's you.

1100
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:55,930
No one can help her.

1101
01:15:58,169 --> 01:15:59,570
But she hasn't had any rest
in three days!

1102
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,329
At this rate,

1103
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:03,049
not only will she not be able
to save Shi Ying,

1104
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,329
but she'll die too!

1105
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:11,930
What do I do?

1106
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,449
If I fail to save my master's soul today,

1107
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,329
I'll never get another chance.

1108
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:38,249
Mirror image.

1109
01:16:40,169 --> 01:16:41,489
I drew it the wrong way.

1110
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:45,089
(Now,)

1111
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,409
(I must enter the water with my mind)

1112
01:16:48,049 --> 01:16:49,930
(to activate the Star Revival Blood Oath.)

1113
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:27,970
That's right.

1114
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:29,890
The blood symbol I inscribed

1115
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,129
at the crossroads of Yin and Yang.

1116
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:34,129
It is reversed in the mortal world.

1117
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,249
One becomes two.

1118
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:48,970
Two become three.

1119
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:52,010
Three become infinity.

1120
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:55,329
Reverse the universe.

1121
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:57,770
Disperse!

1122
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,209
(Master,)

1123
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,610
(I am running out of qi!)

1124
01:18:44,129 --> 01:18:44,730
(Yan'er,)

1125
01:18:45,249 --> 01:18:47,850
(you are stronger than you think.)

1126
01:18:48,089 --> 01:18:49,930
(Remember. As long as you're willing,)

1127
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:51,369
(you can make it,)

1128
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:52,690
(and you can always do it.)

1129
01:19:55,369 --> 01:19:56,730
(The pain she is enduring now)

1130
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:58,209
(is as if she is being pierced
by a thousand arrows)

1131
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,970
(and her body engulfed in flames.)

1132
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:02,129
(Shi Ying might actually return to us!)

1133
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:04,390
(When that happens, they...)

1134
01:20:05,129 --> 01:20:07,369
If Ying wakes up,

1135
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,850
I will not force him

1136
01:20:10,089 --> 01:20:10,930
to leave priesthood again.

1137
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,129
Nor will I force him to return to Jialan

1138
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:15,289
to succeed the throne.

1139
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,010
Let him be

1140
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,850
an immortal official free from
the mundane desires of the world.

1141
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:21,810
Let him embrace
the ways of heaven and earth

1142
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:23,530
and benefit countless lives
in the world.

1143
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:26,610
Just as he vowed

1144
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:27,970
when he became
the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

1145
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:29,810
Maybe then

1146
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,570
he can live a long life.

1147
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,049
Master,

1148
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:24,329
you're back.

1149
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:58,249
Master.

1150
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:00,930
I'm coming to see you.

1151
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:03,690
Zhu Yan!

1152
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,449
Don't force yourself.

1153
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:10,570
I'll carry you up the mountain.

1154
01:22:12,129 --> 01:22:13,489
Don't waste your breath.

1155
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:15,650
Save your energy for when you see him.

1156
01:22:18,129 --> 01:22:19,209
Did I do it?

1157
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:21,329
I think you did.

1158
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,570
Zhu Yan,

1159
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:25,930
this is the Star Revival Blood Oath

1160
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:27,129
that transcends life and death.

1161
01:22:28,129 --> 01:22:29,089
No one has ever been able
to make it happen

1162
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:31,650
in millions of years.

1163
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:39,489
Master.

1164
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,810
Master.

1165
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:35,850
Ying.

1166
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:36,930
Ying!

1167
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:38,610
Your Supreme Majesty!

1168
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,690
Master!

1169
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:58,570
The next three days

1170
01:23:59,449 --> 01:24:00,610
are crucial for Ying.

1171
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:02,289
If he survives,

1172
01:24:03,089 --> 01:24:06,169
he will be reborn.

1173
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,010
Ying went through
the ordeal of life and death.

1174
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:12,329
I have come to realize

1175
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,209
that all worldly attachments are futile.

1176
01:24:16,409 --> 01:24:17,530
I only hope

1177
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,249
that once he wakes up,

1178
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,530
he will live a long and peaceful life.

1179
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:25,690
But he and his mother

1180
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:27,369
have been wronged for decades.

1181
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:29,530
Even if Ying

1182
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:31,650
is willing to leave the past behind,

1183
01:24:32,049 --> 01:24:32,970
I will not let his name

1184
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,890
continue to be sullied.

1185
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:40,409
A few days ago, word came from Jialan

1186
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:43,530
that Emperor Beimian was terminally ill.

1187
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:46,169
I am going to see it for myself

1188
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,010
and try to save Beimian

1189
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:50,650
so that their names may be restored

1190
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:52,010
and the injustice
made known to the world.

1191
01:24:53,329 --> 01:24:54,650
Go with ease, Your Supreme Majesty.

1192
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:58,369
I'll make sure
nothing goes wrong this time.

1193
01:24:59,049 --> 01:25:00,530
You are the cursed lady for him.

1194
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:04,249
There is something you need to know.

1195
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,810
Before Ying's soul is fully restored,

1196
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,930
he will only have the memories

1197
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:11,810
before he met you.

1198
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,409
Before he met me?

1199
01:25:23,249 --> 01:25:24,129
That means

1200
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,690
in these three days,

1201
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,930
he will think

1202
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,209
he is the Crown Prince
before the banquet.

1203
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:32,369
So

1204
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,650
both of you must cooperate with him,

1205
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:36,409
or else

1206
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,810
his memories will be
confused and disordered,

1207
01:25:39,209 --> 01:25:40,369
and his soul flame
will be distinguished.

1208
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:44,249
It is that bad?

1209
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:45,730
Especially you.

1210
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,770
You mustn't let him remember

1211
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:50,289
anything about you.

1212
01:25:51,049 --> 01:25:51,850
You are

1213
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:53,409
the last person

1214
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:54,690
who should stay by his side.

1215
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:56,089
But you carry

1216
01:25:56,169 --> 01:25:57,409
his soul flame within you.

1217
01:25:58,089 --> 01:25:59,650
You cannot stay away from him.

1218
01:26:05,049 --> 01:26:05,610
Get up.

1219
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:07,409
I have words to tell you in private.

1220
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:22,850
Do you remember what I said?

1221
01:26:26,089 --> 01:26:28,730
I have no qualms about your plan.

1222
01:26:30,409 --> 01:26:31,089
But

1223
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:35,249
I worry Master will not be convinced.

1224
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:36,089
That matters not.

1225
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,089
I will write him a letter.

1226
01:26:38,209 --> 01:26:38,970
Give it to him,

1227
01:26:39,249 --> 01:26:40,010
and he will believe it.

1228
01:26:40,169 --> 01:26:41,449
In his memories,

1229
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:44,890
I am his uncle.

1230
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:53,970
Zhu Yan,

1231
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,930
what do you plan to do

1232
01:26:58,049 --> 01:26:59,289
after Ying's soul is stabilized?

1233
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:02,730
Rest assured, Your Supreme Majesty.

1234
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,850
I will leave him.

1235
01:27:12,369 --> 01:27:13,289
I will never

1236
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:15,690
see him again.
