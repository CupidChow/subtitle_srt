00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Could it be that she's your...

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,879
Who am I to him?

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,719
Kill her quickly!

22
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,759
So, you weren't after my life.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,759
Watch out!

24
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,639
Seek High Priest of Grand Preceptor!

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,199
Hurry!

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,599
Okay!

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Lord!

28
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,560
You can talk?

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,479
Doesn't that mean

30
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,199
he has heard everything I said just now?

31
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,639
Be careful!

32
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
It's Xueying's dance dress!

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,479
It's Xueying's dance dress!

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
It's Xueying's dance dress!

35
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,759
Reinforcements are here! Retreat!

36
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,800
Why are you still here?

37
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,759
I...

38
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,680
I still have questions for you.

39
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Lord Immortal Official.

40
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,000
Where am I?

41
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,920
(What a nice smell.)

42
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
It's the smell of Snowy Rosa.

43
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,879
Lord Immortal Official...

44
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Where did he go?

45
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,360
Your Supreme Majesty,

46
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,600
the assailants have left.

47
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,839
You still have to

48
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,519
take your medicine, right?

49
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,680
It's an Ice Clan magic technique.

50
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,519
Search the area.

51
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,519
See if any of them are still here.

52
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:22,959
Yes.

53
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
So, you're here.

54
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Lord Immortal Official,

55
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
hurry and bring me out!

56
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,720
Don't tell me

57
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
you're just an illusion?

58
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,920
We were lucky that you were here today.

59
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,519
We were able to prevent a calamity.

60
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,959
If it's anyone else,

61
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm sure no one can stand its power.

62
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
The Ice Clan has never gotten a chance

63
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,040
to step into Kongsang

64
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
ever since they were banished.

65
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,279
Why did they suddenly

66
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,160
invade the Emperor Valley today?

67
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,279
If they're seeking for treasures,

68
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,639
the only treasure here

69
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,680
will be the legendary Ring of Houtu.

70
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
It is odd.

71
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,039
Although Heavenly Divine Ring

72
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,720
has the power to destroy the world

73
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,720
and the Ring of Houtu
has the power to protect Kongsang,

74
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,120
only the chosen ones

75
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,080
can wield them.

76
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,000
They're useless to both of us,

77
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,559
not to mention the Ice Clan.

78
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,519
If they invaded us

79
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,279
in order to acquire the Ring of Houtu,

80
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,320
it wouldn't make any sense.

81
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,559
Even though I've been
in the Emperor Valley for many years,

82
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
I still haven't found out

83
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
where exactly the Ring of Houtu is.

84
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,799
I have no idea.

85
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,519
Could it be that the Ice Clan

86
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,559
knows where it is?

87
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,080
But at least one thing

88
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,200
is confirmed.

89
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,200
Not many people know about

90
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,320
the period when Jiuyi Mountain
is unguarded.

91
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,519
The Ice Clan can never figure that out

92
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,919
by themselves.

93
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
Your Supreme Majesty, according to you,

94
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,440
there must be an important figure
in Kongsang

95
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,600
who's acting as their spy.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,159
The State of Kongsang has prospered

97
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,399
for over 7,000 years.

98
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,080
The Menghua Dynasty may seem
peaceful and prosperous,

99
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,159
in reality, it's rotten to the core.

100
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,759
The Six Ministries

101
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,120
fight for power and wealth.

102
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,720
Even if one of them

103
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
is colluding with the Ice Clan,

104
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,000
I wouldn't be surprised about it.

105
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,600
We must keep this a secret.

106
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,559
Do not let anyone else find out.

107
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,399
I know.

108
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,759
It's an illusion. This must be it.

109
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
Someone new has arrived at the valley.

110
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
It's not the Ice Clan.

111
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
Have you met anyone else?

112
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,320
No.

113
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
You have your reasons

114
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,919
for trapping me here.

115
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,639
I'll just wait here.

116
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,279
(For some reason,)

117
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,360
(you feel endearing to me)

118
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,679
(even though it's our first encounter.)

119
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Both you and he

120
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,000
have the same widow's peak.

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,960
What's the matter?

122
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,080
Ying,

123
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,080
do you still remember
the tale of calamity

124
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,159
five years ago?

125
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
Your Supreme Majesty,
if you're suspicious of me,

126
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,679
you can do an investigation.

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,879
Many people have joined

128
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,159
the ministries lately.

129
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,360
There's an overabundance of women
within the Six Ministries.

130
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,799
I'm being paranoid

131
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,720
for your sake.

132
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:53,759
Your Supreme Majesty,

133
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,879
I detect no signs of
the Ice Clan nearby.

134
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,519
We've already expanded
our scope of search.

135
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,360
Search thoroughly.

136
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,000
Do not let anyone get away.

137
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,879
Yes, sir.

138
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,279
Eyelashes.

139
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,279
Why do they look

140
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,159
just like Crown Prince's eyelashes?

141
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,240
How are you moving?

142
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,679
Aren't you an illusion?

143
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,519
Just now...

144
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,399
-What you saw just now
-Just now...

145
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,000
was just an illusion.

146
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,639
The person you touched
was just an illusion too.

147
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Actually,

148
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,840
I just wanted to ask

149
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
that how did you do that?

150
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,159
How did you hide me away

151
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,039
in an instant?

152
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,879
You don't need to know.

153
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,240
However,

154
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,039
how did you know

155
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,279
that I touched you?

156
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Enough.

157
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,639
Do not mention that again.

158
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,080
No way.

159
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,200
I need to explain myself

160
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,039
to you.

161
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm not

162
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
a casual girl.

163
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,159
It's all because

164
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,240
that illusion

165
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,799
looked just like you.

166
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
I couldn't tell the difference.

167
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,519
I...

168
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Anyway,

169
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,519
I wouldn't dare to do so

170
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,080
if it was the real one.

171
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
Enough. Stop it already.

172
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,960
Anyway, no matter what I say

173
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:38,919
or do,

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,039
I'm sure you can see through them.

175
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,519
You're amazing indeed.

176
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,759
I have a question.

177
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,240
Since this plant

178
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
can revive withered plants,

179
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,120
can it revive the dead too?

180
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,919
It's the same for you

181
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,159
no matter if I tell you or not.

182
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,639
It's because what happened today

183
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,799
will be just a dream to you.

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
No!

185
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,799
Lord, don't tell me

186
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,080
you're going to erase my memories?

187
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,399
Why are you hiding your forehead?

188
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,480
Do you think I need to cast
a spell on your forehead

189
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,399
to erase your memories?

190
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,159
Where is it then?

191
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
It's your forehead.

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,679
What?

193
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,759
You lied to me!

194
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
(It's been tough on you.)

195
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,919
Are you done with just

196
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,519
erasing her memories?

197
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,240
Don't forget,

198
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,519
she's destined to bring calamity to you.

199
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,320
She's just a girl who wandered

200
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,000
into the valley by accident.

201
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,879
What?

202
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,120
By accident?

203
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,120
Did you forget about the prophecy?

204
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,159
You and I have been living in seclusion

205
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
within the valley for eons.

206
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,120
But now, everything is ruined.

207
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,080
Not everything.

208
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,039
Before I was 18,

209
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
every girl I met

210
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,360
was destined to bring calamity to me.

211
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,720
She's a reckless person.

212
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,000
We're merely strangers.

213
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,440
And, she would never do anything

214
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,639
that was related to me.

215
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,759
It's impossible for us
to encounter each other in the future.

216
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,840
So,

217
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,200
don't you worry.

218
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:47,919
I've spent

219
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,840
a long time with you.

220
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You've never been visibly moved.

221
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,320
But you broke the rule
right after encountering her.

222
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,039
I'm sure she's...

223
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,759
Don't spout nonsense.

224
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,039
You have gone soft.

225
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
(Initially, it would've worked out)

226
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,320
(if the puppet died on your behalf.)

227
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,000
However, the convergence
of three coincidences

228
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
has become a calamity for you.

229
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
If you meet this girl

230
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,720
before you become 18,

231
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,919
you'll die in her hands in the future.

232
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
You have to be wary of her.

233
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,240
When we head to the Emperor Valley

234
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,840
to steal the Ring of Houtu,

235
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,080
the place wasn't unguarded,
unlike what you'd said.

236
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,080
We encountered
tough adversaries instead.

237
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,200
We returned empty-handed.

238
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,960
Tough adversaries?

239
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,919
He lived at the bottom of
the Emperor Valley.

240
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,440
He's a youth that has
tremendous magical power

241
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,919
even before reaching 20 years old.

242
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,279
His cultivation

243
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,799
might even be stronger than
the Four Grand Marshals.

244
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,679
There was a girl too.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
However, the girl

246
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,360
seems ordinary.

247
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,320
It seemed like she wandered
into the valley by accident.

248
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,279
Who will she be?

249
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,879
Azure King, I'm here to tell you

250
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,759
that you need to verify your source

251
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,480
before you deliver the news to us.

252
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,400
This is my negligence.

253
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,000
However, I promise you

254
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,240
that I'll definitely verify
my sources in the future.

255
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm just curious

256
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,839
as to why the sage sent you

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,599
to steal the Ring of Houtu.

258
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,240
What is he

259
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,039
up to?

260
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
Laymen like you need not fret upon

261
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,519
the motives of our sage.

262
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,640
This will not affect

263
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,240
your profits in any way.

264
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,559
Please stop asking questions.

265
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,319
Check that place out.

266
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,319
Who's there?

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
Your Lordship, please spare us!

268
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,000
There's a bunch of

269
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,799
unknown crooks on the Mountain.

270
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
We've repelled them.

271
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
We're here to search for

272
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,319
those who have gotten away.

273
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
Your Lordship, have you seen or heard

274
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,880
anything suspicious?

275
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,200
No.

276
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,839
All right.

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
If so, we will stop interrupting you,
Your Lordship.

278
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
Don't worry.

279
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,400
Since I'm joining hands

280
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,400
with the sage,

281
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,119
I'll watch his back.

282
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,039
I won't let expose your location.

283
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,200
Pardon me,

284
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,759
but I don't see the need

285
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,359
for you to join hands
with our Ice Clan.

286
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't need to second-guess me.

287
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm joining hands with
another strong faction

288
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,640
just in case anything happens.

289
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,440
Young Lady, you're awake.

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,920
What's with my getup?

291
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,920
Did I fall asleep?

292
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,559
Yufei,

293
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,039
what happened yesterday?

294
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Young Lady, you're actually
asking me that?

295
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,680
You drugged me

296
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,319
and went somewhere

297
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,519
last night.

298
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,480
I feel so giddy.

299
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,559
My hands...

300
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,720
Shouldn't I be

301
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,720
at the Emperor Valley last night?

302
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,079
Princess, it's not worth it
for you to risk your life

303
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,960
for some firefly powder.

304
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,559
The firefly powder is just an excuse.

305
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,799
The Star Gazer

306
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,160
is mine now.

307
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,079
The legendary Ring of Houtu

308
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,279
was hidden within the Emperor Valley.

309
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,359
However, no one knows where it's.

310
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,759
If I can find it,

311
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,559
I'll be able to ascend

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,359
the throne of the empress for sure.

313
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:06,688
(Pavilion of Books, Jiuyi Mountain)

314
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,720
(The name list of all noble ladies
in Kongsang)

315
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,079
(is kept within this library.)

316
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,559
(We'll know if the princess of)

317
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,480
(the Crimson Clan is
a harbinger of doom)

318
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,599
(by checking her background.)

319
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,359
(Zhu Yan of the Crimson Clan,)

320
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,839
(born on the third year,
Month of the Cicada, on the 7th.)

321
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,359
(Luckily, she's not it.)

322
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,319
(I was being paranoid.)

323
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,880
Shiying!

324
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:57,880
Shiying!

325
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,720
Shiying!

326
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,000
This is great.

327
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,319
I've checked the Elixir Book.

328
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,920
The princess of the Crimson Clan
was born in the Month of Yang.

329
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,599
She's not

330
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,839
your harbinger of doom.

331
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,480
I know that.

332
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,119
Is that all?

333
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,079
That can't be.

334
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,400
You've escaped

335
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,559
a calamity, you know?

336
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,240
Don't you think you should
celebrate the occasion?

337
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,519
Look at you.

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,240
You spend your time at the bottom
of the valley all day long.

339
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,519
On your left face, it says "boring".

340
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,680
On your right, it says "uninteresting".

341
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,400
On your forehead, it says "zombie".

342
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,880
After thinking about it,

343
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,559
although that young girl

344
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,839
was pretty rude and reckless,

345
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,799
she was good with jokes.

346
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,920
Since she's not

347
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,480
your harbinger of doom,

348
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,920
why don't I capture her

349
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,319
so that she can tell you jokes?

350
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,960
I just pray for divine justice

351
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,119
and powerful skills,

352
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,839
so that I could uphold justice
for my mother

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,440
when I grow up and return

354
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,640
to Jialan.

355
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,319
How am I boring?

356
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:51,759
Stop talking about

357
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,359
those ridiculous stuff.

358
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,519
You're just too stubborn to admit it.

359
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,440
Back then,

360
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,759
when Emperor Xingzun saw Bai Wei,

361
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,200
his expression

362
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,440
was just like yours

363
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,720
when you saw that young girl...

364
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,319
Please return to the valley entrance

365
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,319
and stay devoted to your post.

366
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,559
A stranger has entered the valley.

367
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,400
However, it's not a martial artist.

368
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,119
Don't tell me
it's that young girl again?

369
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Ying.

370
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,039
Since you don't want to see her again,

371
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,720
I shall...

372
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,759
Up to you.

373
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,400
Ring of Houtu, please bless me

374
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,400
so that I can fulfill my wish soon.

375
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,400
I want my mother

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
to rest in peace in the underworld.

377
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,920
This girl

378
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,880
is not as interesting as the last one.

379
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,599
However,

380
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,440
she's fair and young too.

381
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,359
Why don't I

382
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,440
gobble her up?

383
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,160
Chong Ming,

384
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
don't do so.

385
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,920
She should be my cousin.

386
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,519
She's not the one in the prophecy.

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,279
You don't need to kill her.

388
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
Everyone says that the Emperor Valley
is a treacherous place.

389
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,319
But now, all these princesses

390
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
are visiting us in turn.

391
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,240
It's as if I serve no function

392
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,279
as the guardian bird.

393
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:41,839
So,

394
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,039
are you going to erase her memories

395
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,880
and let her go?

396
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,400
I've never received news about Mother

397
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,720
ever since I left the palace.

398
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,279
I guess this Princess of the White Clan

399
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,359
should know about my mother's condition.

400
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,559
Chong Ming, I wish to ask her about it.

401
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,759
Since you're the princess
of the White Clan,

402
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,400
have you seen Madam Bai Yan lately?

403
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,759
She was trapped

404
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,000
within Kunyuan Palace.

405
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,559
His Majesty has forbidden anyone

406
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,759
to visit her within five years.

407
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:26,839
If so...

408
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,359
If so,

409
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
do you know how she's been doing lately?

410
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,519
It's been some time
since I last saw her.

411
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
I do not know how she's doing.

412
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,400
Really?

413
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,319
I heard that it was

414
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,240
tough for her.

415
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,440
The palace servants do not
send her food from time to time.

416
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,559
Even when she's sick,

417
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,480
there's no extra blanket for her to use.

418
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,599
That's nonsense.

419
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,119
Mother is the empress of the nation.

420
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,839
Why would His Majesty do this to her?

421
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,960
This is...

422
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,039
Chong Ming, send her back.

423
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,440
I'll look for High Priest
of Grand Preceptor.

424
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,519
I cannot let my mother

425
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,920
suffer like that.

426
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:29,488
(Zuowang Palace, Jiuyi Mountain)

427
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,359
Your Supreme Majesty!

428
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,400
Your Supreme Majesty!

429
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,920
Your Supreme Majesty!

430
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,839
I don't care. I'm heading to Jialan.

431
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,400
Ying,

432
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,119
where are you going?

433
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,480
Your Supreme Majesty,

434
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,839
do you know the kind of life

435
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
my mother is leading right now?

436
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,839
Ying,

437
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,440
you don't need to go.

438
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,839
I just came back from Jialan.

439
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,920
Your mother...

440
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,599
She has already passed away.

441
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,880
Your Supreme Majesty,

442
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,680
you must be kidding me.

443
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,839
Why would Mother suddenly...

444
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,880
She committed suicide
by swallowing charcoals.

445
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,000
She committed suicide?

446
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,160
That's impossible!

447
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,640
That's impossible!

448
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,119
That's impossible! What are you saying?

449
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,000
That's impossible!

450
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,039
What happened?

451
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,440
Ying.

452
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,200
What happened?

453
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,119
Listen to me.

454
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,400
When I was there,

455
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,480
she could no longer speak.

456
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,559
She told me to pass this letter

457
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,960
to you.

458
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,400
(Mother,)

459
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
(I miss you very much.)

460
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,200
(I will definitely bring you back)

461
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,519
(when I'm 18 years old.)

462
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,480
Your dinner is here.

463
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Leave it over there.

464
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,319
Your Majesty,

465
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,359
what's wrong with your voice?

466
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,160
It's...

467
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
It's nothing.

468
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
Ying sent me this.

469
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
The Bell of Cleansing.

470
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,160
You actually mastered a powerful skill

471
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,400
like that

472
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,039
within five years of training
in Jiuyi Mountain?

473
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,119
You didn't disappoint me indeed.

474
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,519
But Ying,

475
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,640
you should

476
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,960
stop being concerned about me.

477
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,319
It's too risky.

478
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,240
They'll trace you down

479
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,920
and find out that you're still alive.

480
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,720
I want you to stay safe.

481
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,759
But my life

482
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,720
is the biggest threat

483
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,200
to yours.

484
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
(Consort Qing,)

485
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,599
(it seems like)

486
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,759
(the Empress has recovered her voice.)

487
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,240
Is that so?

488
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,200
I wonder who treated her?

489
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,319
I need to find out

490
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,599
and tell the Emperor.

491
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,039
(Ying,)

492
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
(I did everything)

493
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,000
(so that you could live peacefully)

494
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,839
(in Jiuyi Mountain.)

495
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
(I don't need you to avenge me.)

496
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,839
(It's because there's no one)

497
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
(for me to hate.)

498
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,519
(Ying, it's not worth it
for you to hate them too.)

499
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,559
(You're born a noble.)

500
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960
(Do not be consumed by
your temporary emotions)

501
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,759
(and bring yourself to ruins.)

502
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,000
(When you master everything
in the future,)

503
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,759
(you can protect all living beings
with your power.)

504
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,319
(That's my wish as well.)

505
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:04,720
Ying,

506
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,359
you must avenge her.

507
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,839
It's all because of me.

508
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,400
So, I was the cause

509
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,880
of my mother's demise.

510
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,519
No.

511
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,839
Ying,

512
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,160
it's not your fault.

513
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,119
It's the fault of those people

514
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:21,880
who landed you and your mother

515
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,799
in such a plight.

516
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,400
No.

517
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
It's me.

518
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,519
It's all my fault.

519
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,559
It's all my fault.

520
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,119
It's all my fault.

521
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,440
Ying.

522
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,200
It's all my fault.

523
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,559
Go to hell.

524
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,759
It's all my fault.

525
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,640
Go to hell.

526
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,119
Go to hell.

527
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
It's all my fault.

528
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,240
It's all my fault.

529
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,119
You're actually powerful enough

530
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,680
to move the celestial phenomena

531
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
with your thoughts?

532
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,480
Go to hell.

533
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,480
It's all my fault.

534
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
It's all my fault.

535
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,759
Ying,

536
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,400
calm down.

537
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Calm down.

538
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,759
It's all my fault.

539
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,880
Control your state of mind.

540
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,920
The rich and powerful figures
within the Six Ministries

541
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,200
have hidden many martial arts experts
in the mountain.

542
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,160
If you cannot control

543
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,039
your state of mind

544
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,559
and they find out that
you faked your death,

545
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,680
all of your mother's effort

546
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,160
will be in vain.

547
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,319
Mother!

548
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,119
Mother!

549
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,359
Mother!

550
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,079
Mother!

551
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,799
Ying.

552
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,480
If I can exchange my life

553
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,359
for Bai Yan's,

554
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,359
I will do so without hesitating.

555
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,839
This is her own choice.

556
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,400
From now on,

557
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,599
only you and I are left.

558
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,960
Our servant said you ran off
somewhere last night.

559
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,000
They found you unconscious
in the courtyard.

560
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,680
Tell me.

561
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,680
What did you do last night?

562
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,640
I just wanted to take a walk
before sleeping.

563
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,759
But I got absent-minded

564
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,279
and I didn't know where I went.

565
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,559
I didn't know why
I fell unconscious too.

566
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,079
I don't remember

567
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,119
what happened last night.

568
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,079
As the princess of the White Clan,

569
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,839
how could you

570
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,799
act so recklessly?

571
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,200
If Azure King hears about this,

572
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,319
he'll use this as his excuse

573
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,079
to cancel the wedding with you again.

574
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,039
Father, if that's how
you think about me,

575
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,880
I have no need to defend myself.

576
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,519
When Prince Shi Yu

577
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,720
are observing the ceremony
from the mountains,

578
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
please allow me

579
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,000
to do what I do best

580
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,000
and approach him

581
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
so that I can reduce your burden.

582
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,200
You!

583
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,960
Your Lordship,

584
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,680
this is an emergency carrier pigeon
from Jialan.

585
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,119
All of you may leave.

586
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:17,839
Yes, Your Lordship.

587
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,680
Father, what's on your mind?

588
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm willing to share
your burden with you.

589
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,240
Bai Yan is gone.

590
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,759
It's said that she committed suicide
by swallowing charcoals.

591
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,680
I think she couldn't endure
the suffering in Cold Palace.

592
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,759
But His Majesty didn't hold a funeral
or send her body into the mausoleum.

593
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,920
When did Aunt Bai Yan pass away?

594
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,160
Last night, at the hour of Zi.

595
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,000
(Maybe aunt's death)

596
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,359
(was somehow related to my behaviors.)

597
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,519
I understand now.

598
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
It was at the hour of Zi when I became

599
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,160
absent-minded

600
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,200
and fell unconscious.

601
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,480
I guess I predicted

602
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,720
aunt's death.

603
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Right before it happened,

604
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,640
I always spent time with her
in the palace.

605
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,480
She always praised me
for being intelligent

606
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,239
and that I would lead a prosperous life.

607
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
She said I had the look of an Empress.

608
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,079
And, I actually sensed that
she was going to pass away.

609
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,519
I guess

610
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,199
this must be fate.

611
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,960
(Although Xuelu came
from a poor background,)

612
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,599
(she's much better at scheming)

613
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,639
(than Xueying.)

614
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,199
(Maybe she could)

615
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,679
(become the Crown Princess.)

616
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
Xuelu, get up.

617
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,559
Someone.

618
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,159
Yes, Your Lordship.

619
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,159
Tell the kitchen to prepare
some bird's nest soup

620
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
for Princess Xuelu.

621
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,320
Yes, Your Lordship.

622
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,400
Father...

623
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,199
I am heading
to the Chamber of Council now.

624
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,320
Xuelu, it's been tough on you.

625
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,800
Have some bird's nest soup.

626
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,480
The selection of the next Empress

627
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,360
is directly related

628
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,599
to the survival of the White Clan.

629
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,199
Xueying's personality

630
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,079
is too soft.

631
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,400
Xuelu,

632
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,360
in my opinion,

633
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,440
you're my best candidate.

634
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,400
Father, thank you for
regarding me highly.

635
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,320
Ying,

636
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
get up.

637
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm sure your mother

638
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,000
doesn't want to see you

639
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,039
in this dejected state.

640
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,920
It's all because I tried to be witty.

641
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,360
I sent Mother the Bell of Cleansing.

642
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,559
That's how she died.

643
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,239
It's all my fault.

644
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,079
You better sober up.

645
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,960
Your mother wrote that in the letter

646
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,440
because she wanted you to be safe.

647
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,039
But as her son,

648
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,199
you should know what you can do

649
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,239
for your mother, who died

650
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,119
a wrongful death.

651
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,239
You better listen closely.

652
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,400
When you become 18

653
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,360
and the prophecy is over,

654
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,320
you may leave the valley.

655
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,400
By then,

656
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,039
I shall confer you the title
of Priest of Grand Preceptor.

657
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,719
Over time,

658
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,760
when your cultivation

659
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,400
has reached its peak,

660
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,280
you may remove your clergyman outfit,

661
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,599
return to Jialan,
and take back your throne.

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,440
You have to make sure

663
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,440
the culprits of your mother's death

664
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,480
suffer the humiliation

665
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,639
she did,

666
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,800
and take back everything

667
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,559
she has lost.

668
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,800
You hear me?

669
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,639
Take everything back?

670
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,760
Mother died because of me.

671
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
It's all my fault.

672
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,760
Mother died because of me.

673
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,639
What gives me the right to do so?

674
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,360
What gives me the right to do so?

675
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,199
What gives me the right to do so?

676
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,760
What gives me the right to do so?

677
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,760
(Judging from Ying's mental state,)

678
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,559
(it seems like we can
only take it slowly.)

679
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,400
Ying,

680
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
in an hour,

681
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,800
the Six Clans will hold a discussion
in the hall

682
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,920
to decide

683
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,199
how to handle your mother's body.

684
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,320
You should join it.

685
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,880
I've received

686
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,079
the donation of you all.

687
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,280
Now, I will read out

688
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,440
the allotment of empresses
from previous dynasties.

689
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:56,960
For Emperor Xingzun,

690
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:01,079
3,000 goats, 3,000 cows,

691
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,440
3,000 oriental pearls,

692
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,400
600kg of lapis lazuli,

693
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,639
6,000 liters of rose wine,

694
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,400
10 dan of millennium tea leaves,

695
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,400
and 1,000 night lanterns.

696
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,679
For the late empress,
Bai Yan deserves...

697
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,000
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

698
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,039
did I hear wrongly?

699
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,039
Why does Bai Yan deserve

700
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,599
what an empress deserves?

701
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,239
Although Bai Yan was
removed from her post,

702
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,159
her name was still

703
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,920
included in the Book of Elixir.

704
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,719
She will be revered by the future
generations, just like the others.

705
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,320
It's not unreasonable

706
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,280
for her to be included.

707
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
I beg to differ.

708
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,199
Bai Yan swallowed charcoals
and committed suicide

709
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,440
for fear of punishment.

710
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,079
His Majesty only buried her

711
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,199
in a random corner in Jialan

712
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,840
instead of the Emperor Valley.

713
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,760
It's obvious that His Majesty

714
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,480
doesn't want to acknowledge her
as his empress.

715
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,719
We only worship virtuous figures

716
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,519
during our rites.

717
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,000
Even the Emperor Valley

718
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,119
has no place for Bai Yan.

719
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,159
How could we include her

720
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,440
in the funeral rites?

721
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,239
Guys, what do you think?

722
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,440
Azure King, you have a point.

723
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,559
Since she's a sinner

724
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,400
who's detested by His Majesty,

725
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:26,320
we mustn't treat her with such respect.

726
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,960
White King,

727
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,840
what about you?

728
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,760
She's a sinner.

729
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,360
Naturally, she doesn't deserve it.

730
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,760
But this...

731
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,159
Enough.

732
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,960
Only priests and clergymen

733
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,679
are located in Jiuyi Mountain.

734
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,079
It's common for them

735
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,039
to be ignorant about the changes
in the court.

736
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,
you can follow our ancestral rules

737
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
and remove her name.

738
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,519
Divine servant,

739
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
get me a brush.

740
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,519
You may leave.

741
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,239
Continue.

742
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,400
For Emperor Yunqi,

743
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,679
1,000 goats, 1,000 cows,

744
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,599
600kg of lapis lazuli,

745
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,599
6000 liters of rose wine,

746
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,360
and 100 night lanterns.

747
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,360
(Ying,)

748
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,519
(today I show you)

749
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,920
(how cruel this world is.)

750
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,039
(You will understand)

751
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
(my intention sooner or later.)

752
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,880
Crown Prince, stop.

753
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,880
(As the saying goes,
spare the rod, spoil the child.)

754
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,760
(It's all because the Empress
was too conceited.)

755
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,719
(Even the Emperor Valley)

756
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,639
(has no place for Bai Yan.)

757
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,239
(How could we include her)

758
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,440
(in the funeral rites?)

759
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:13,920
(I just want you to stay safe.)

760
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,800
(But my life)

761
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:16,960
(is the biggest threat)

762
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,440
(to yours.)

763
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,320
You told me to protect
all living beings.

764
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,159
But are you seeing this?

765
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:34,679
This unlawful world

766
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
and these heartless scums

767
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,079
don't deserve

768
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,679
your pity and forgiveness.

769
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,199
I will avenge you!

770
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,519
Shi Ying!

771
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,760
Shi Ying, what's the matter?

772
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,400
Scram!
