19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,119
Now,

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
the entire marine force in Western Huang

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,839
could be looking for you.

22
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,039
But you've lost your power.

23
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,599
What if you run into enemies?

24
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:05,839
Chong Ming can keep me safe.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,120
Watch out, Master!

26
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,639
Yan'er!

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,400
Master!

28
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,639
Leave me!

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Run now, Master!

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Run!

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
Master, run!

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Master!

33
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,799
Master, watch out!

34
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Let me go!

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Master!

36
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,079
The odds are in my favor.

37
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,680
Master!

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,240
Dragon slayer.

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,039
You've lost your power?

40
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,160
Master.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,199
Master, forget about me.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Heed my advice.

43
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,120
Surrender and stand down.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,680
The net is a prized item of the Merfolk.

45
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:11,919
This is the Impairing Net.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,919
It was forged using
the millennial dark iron

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,720
from the ocean bed.

48
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,160
The more one struggles,

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
the tighter it becomes,

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
making whoever ensnared
suffer more pain!

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,079
Get him!

52
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,479
Master!

53
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,639
Yan'er.

54
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,359
Let me go!

55
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:51,880
Go!

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,799
Master!

57
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,360
Shi Ying.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,120
What...

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Where is Zhu Yan?

60
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,839
The marine force took her.

61
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,199
Those people

62
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,440
used a Merfolk item to escape.

63
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,680
I must rescue her.

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,240
Shi Ying!

65
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,199
Are you going to use your essence qi

66
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,159
to repel the evil energy

67
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,839
to regain your power?

68
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,000
You must not do that!

69
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:32,880
The essence qi

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
is the root of your attainment.

71
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,719
If you disrupt it recklessly,

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,399
you could become deranged.

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,079
Shi Ying.

74
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:38,920
Shi Ying.

75
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,079
Extreme Wind City is not far from here.

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,719
Let's ask the Crimson King
for reinforcements.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,639
We can't wait.

78
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,240
But...

79
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,440
Did you succeed?

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,759
We lost many of our soldiers.

81
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,600
And only caught
the dragon slayer's disciple.

82
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:30,759
Xiong!

83
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,519
Xiong!

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,079
Xiong!

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,040
You wasted the Impairing Net

86
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,639
and Dragon's Stroke

87
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,839
only to apprehend

88
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,000
a little girl?

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Worthless fools!

90
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,560
Elder, please calm down.

91
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,680
This woman is very powerful.

92
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,480
She is the dragon slayer's disciple.

93
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,719
She is the Princess of the Crimson Clan.

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,839
Cursed marine force!

95
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
I won't let you use me
as leverage against my father!

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Elder!

97
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,040
Dragon Blood Jade!

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
It's the Dragon Blood Jade!

99
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,279
Whoever carries it

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,480
can't be harmed by the Merfolk.

101
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,680
Dragon Blood Jade
is the prized gem of our clan.

102
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,600
It's priceless.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,719
Why does the Kongsang princess

104
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,519
have this?

105
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,159
Where did you get this?

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
I get it now.

107
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:04,759
That person

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,040
has been hiding
in the Crimson Residence.

109
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,240
I bet he gave you

110
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,680
Dragon Blood Jade.

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
Since you mean so much to him,

112
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,159
I shall put you to good use.

113
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,600
Who is this?

114
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,800
What do you want?

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,279
Send the word.

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
Keep an eye on this woman.

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,560
Yes.

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,279
(The reaction)

119
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,240
(is getting stronger.)

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,519
(Could it be)

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,519
(the Sea Emperor is nearby?)

122
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,399
This is only a dream.

123
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,360
Is Yan'er connected

124
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,920
to the Sea Emperor?

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,600
Let's go.

126
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,240
Go!

127
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,399
Aren't they Lady Yu and Sumo?

128
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,159
Why are they in this

129
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,919
sorry state?

130
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,880
Could it be that

131
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,159
one of them is the Sea Emperor?

132
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,639
Was the child I saw in my dream

133
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,200
actually Sumo?

134
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,240
Lord Zhi.

135
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,320
It really was you.

136
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,080
(That child is
probably the Sea Emperor.)

137
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,960
My lord.

138
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,039
Elder Jian ordered me to pick you up.

139
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,320
I won't repeat what I said.

140
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,480
You misunderstood.

141
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,840
Elder Jian

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,399
wants to know

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,679
if you want to see
the Princess of the Crimson Clan.

144
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,200
What did you say?

145
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,679
Yan'er!

146
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,399
Lord Zhi, halt.

147
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
The Merfolk's prized Impairing Net

148
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,480
is impenetrable.

149
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,679
If you make any sudden movement,

150
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll chant the spell

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
and suffocate her.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,639
Bad news!

153
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
Elder Jian, the dragon slayer is here.

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,360
How dare he?

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Perhaps he wishes
to see his disciple killed?

156
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,799
Elder Jian!

157
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Don't you know

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,519
all the divine items
came from the Zhi family?

159
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,159
The name and spell

160
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,080
of this item

161
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,600
were designed by my father.

162
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,519
Where is she now?

163
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,080
Is this the so-called dragon slayer?

164
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:58,799
Brothers,

165
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,439
take his life.

166
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,759
Avenge our people

167
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,000
and bring glory to the Sea Kingdom!

168
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Kill him!

169
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,639
Kill him!

170
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,120
Kill him!

171
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,639
Dragon slayer!

172
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,679
I doubt

173
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,759
you'll make it in time to save her.

174
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,720
Very well.

175
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,439
You asked for this.

176
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,799
Hold up!

177
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,320
It's you.

178
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,000
She's the one you came for.

179
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,000
Hand her over.

180
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
Master.

181
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,439
(Fate is cruel to us all.)

182
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
(The marine force
is waging a war on Kongsang.)

183
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,480
(At this point,)

184
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
(how can I tell Yan'er)

185
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,480
(our fate in the past life?)

186
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,559
(I'd only put her in a tough position.)

187
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,200
Keep her safe.

188
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,360
You know her?

189
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,600
I've known her

190
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,159
far longer than you do.

191
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,919
Lord Zhi!

192
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,360
With a swing of his sword,

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,759
he can raze this place to the ground.

194
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,799
He was showing mercy.

195
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,000
But you almost got yourselves killed!

196
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,720
His essence qi hasn't dissipated.

197
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,919
Had I not blocked it,

198
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,759
you would've died

199
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,320
as soon as you charged at him.

200
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Let's run!

201
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,480
What is this place?

202
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,639
Yan'er.

203
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,840
You're awake.

204
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,759
Yan'er.

205
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,639
Master?

206
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,559
Did you save me?

207
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,559
Yan'er, are you alright?

208
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,600
I am.

209
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,919
Master.

210
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,759
How did you regain your power

211
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,480
so quickly?

212
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,840
Did you use your essence qi?

213
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,159
I wouldn't be foolish enough

214
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,039
to use it for you.

215
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,759
I merely took some Red Fruits.

216
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,240
(Shi Ying was throwing up blood.)

217
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,039
(He's clearly used his essence qi.)

218
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,240
(But he doesn't want Yan'er to know.)

219
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,799
(Shi Ying really cares about Yan'er.)

220
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,080
(Yan'er only cares about him.)

221
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,559
(I was too late)

222
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,320
(in this lifetime.)

223
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,039
I didn't save you.

224
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,759
It was him.

225
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
He said he knew you.

226
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Yuan?

227
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,439
Why are you here too?

228
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,880
You are reunited with the Priest.

229
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
You must have a lot to tell him.

230
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,279
It's alright.

231
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,039
Master.

232
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,279
This is the man

233
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,039
I mentioned to you.

234
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,480
Keeper Yuan.

235
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,799
Yuan.

236
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,159
Thank you.

237
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,480
So,

238
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,759
you're the keeper

239
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,039
Yan'er often mentions.

240
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,279
She talks about you a lot too.

241
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,439
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
has peerless might.

242
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,159
So why was she in danger

243
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,279
in the first place?

244
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
The marine force was cunning.

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,960
They caught us off guard.

246
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,840
But I didn't think

247
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,399
the keeper of the Crimson Residence

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,880
would be the leader of the marine force.

249
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,679
They addressed you as Lord Zhi.

250
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,240
Master.

251
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,320
Hear me out.

252
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,000
Yuan...

253
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,480
I was banished
from the Crimson Clan long ago.

254
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,039
I severed my ties
with my old acquaintances.

255
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
My actions have nothing to do

256
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,720
with the Crimson Clan.

257
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,480
However,

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,239
you play an important role
in the marine force.

259
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,999
Those people attempted to take my life

260
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,760
and took Yan'er hostage.

261
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,840
They even started
a war in Western Huang.

262
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,560
Do you

263
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,560
know nothing about these?

264
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,560
Master.

265
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,080
The mastermind

266
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,080
was someone else.

267
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,239
It was Elder Jian.

268
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,719
I even heard him

269
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,639
blackmailing Yuan with my life.

270
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,999
Yuan

271
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,679
had returned
to the marine force not long ago.

272
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,120
He was looking

273
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:31,919
for his younger sister.

274
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,280
He's not colluding with the enemies.

275
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,320
You have wits and bravery about you.

276
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,840
You are an honorable ally.

277
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
You are indeed unlike the other

278
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,280
enemy soldiers.

279
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,080
However,

280
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,360
we fought Diba together.

281
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,080
You know the details of that day.

282
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,999
Soldiers of the marine force

283
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
branded me the dragon slayer.

284
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,999
Besides,

285
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,120
your sister is also in the marine force.

286
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,959
Your family has a deep connection

287
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:03,999
with the marine force.

288
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,239
So why did you spend so many years

289
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,040
lurking in the Crimson Residence?

290
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,760
The marine force marched prepared

291
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,479
to lay siege to Extreme Wind City.

292
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,080
Why do they know the lay of the place

293
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,439
so well?

294
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,239
It's the horn of the Crimson Clan.

295
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:22,600
My father's army

296
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,639
will be here soon.

297
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,399
I must leave.

298
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,199
I will give you

299
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,679
the answer you seek another time.

300
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,679
Wait.

301
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,439
If your conscience is clear,

302
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,439
lead the marine force into surrendering.

303
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,040
Return to Extreme Wind City with us.

304
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,280
Explain everything.

305
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,239
I will order a retreat from the city,

306
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,679
and promise they won't attack again.

307
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,880
The marine force plagues
every corner of the land.

308
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Letting you go is too big of a risk.

309
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,439
It's a rule in the marine force

310
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,159
for captives to take their own lives.

311
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,520
You know the soldiers

312
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,479
are only taking orders.

313
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
You could have killed them

314
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,159
if you wanted them dead.

315
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:55,800
Am I right?

316
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,719
Had they put up a fight,

317
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,280
there would've been
more casualties on both sides.

318
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,239
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

319
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:01,760
I know you are

320
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,080
not a heartless person.

321
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,439
If you don't want

322
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,600
unnecessary bloodshed,

323
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,479
please let us go.

324
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,760
Master.

325
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,520
I know you have your doubts.

326
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,159
But I believe in Yuan.

327
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,999
He will never go back on his promise.

328
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,439
Yuan.

329
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,479
When the time is right,

330
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,560
you will give us an explanation.

331
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,199
Don't make us wait too long.

332
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,360
Okay?

333
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,600
I won't let your trust be in vain.

334
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:33,880
Very well.

335
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,399
You may go.

336
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,040
But remember,

337
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,439
you owe both of us

338
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,439
a real explanation.

339
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,239
There's another thing.

340
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,239
It's personal.

341
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,199
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

342
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,439
I leave Yan'er in your care.

343
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,080
But what happened today

344
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,080
must never come to pass again.

345
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,520
Who are you

346
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,040
to leave her in my care?

347
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Yan'er is my disciple.

348
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,239
I will not put her in harm's way.

349
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,999
Remember your promise.

350
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,959
If you fail to keep her safe,

351
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
and put her in danger again,

352
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,560
I'll be her guardian.

353
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:36,120
Master.

354
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,639
You trust Yuan, don't you?

355
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,679
Otherwise, there would be no way

356
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,280
I could convince you to let him go.

357
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,840
Master.

358
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,999
Do not

359
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,399
tell my father and others

360
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,479
that Yuan is the leader

361
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,840
of the marine force.

362
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,439
You care a lot about him.

363
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,159
Are you glad

364
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,040
that I let him go?

365
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Of course not.

366
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,959
I'm happy because

367
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,360
you are willing to trust

368
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,159
the person I trust.

369
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,639
Quick!

370
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,080
Yan'er!

371
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,080
Yan'er!

372
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:49,959
Yan'er!

373
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:50,800
Father!

374
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,080
Yan'er!

375
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:52,719
Father!

376
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,080
Father.

377
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,360
Yan'er, are you...

378
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:58,840
Are you hurt?

379
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,159
No.

380
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm glad to hear that.

381
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,800
Take them down!

382
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,520
Stop!

383
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,679
The Crimson Clan's army is here!

384
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,639
Fall back now!

385
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,479
We want to fight them!

386
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,679
What are you doing?

387
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,360
We'd rather die

388
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,760
than retreat.

389
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,639
This fight

390
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,999
shall be part of
the Sea Kingdom's glorious history!

391
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,360
Fight till the end! Never back down!

392
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,919
Fight till the end! Never back down!

393
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,360
Fight till the end! Never back down!

394
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,999
You broke free from the Impairing Net.

395
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,620
(Ruyi, Merfolk)

396
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,439
You're not the only one
who can deactivate it.

397
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,880
Ruyi...

398
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,520
Let's go.

399
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:35,560
This is strange.

400
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,520
The marine force was fighting

401
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,800
for their lives
and had no fear for death.

402
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
But they are retreating now.

403
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:46,520
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

404
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,800
Have you met their leader?

405
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,479
The army arrived as soon as

406
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,880
I'd rescued Yan'er.

407
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,080
I've never seen their leader.

408
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:58,999
Yan'er.

409
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,760
You must have suffered a lot.

410
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,880
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

411
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,840
Thanks to your protection and caring,

412
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,560
my daughter was able to escape

413
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,840
from the Huotu Tribe
and the marine force.

414
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:15,600
Your kindness for her

415
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,199
shall be forever remembered
by the Crimson Clan.

416
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,320
Despite my divine duty,

417
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,399
I have constantly intervened

418
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:25,560
with matters of Western Huang.

419
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,560
I did so because I had no choice.

420
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:29,959
You need not thank me.

421
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,080
Now that Yan'er is safe and sound,

422
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
I should be on my way.

423
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,560
Come.

424
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,120
You disrupted your essence qi.

425
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,439
Shouldn't you rest for a little longer?

426
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,560
It's alright.

427
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,040
By the way,

428
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
you scolded me for letting him go,

429
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:12,999
so why did you do the same this time?

430
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,399
The first time,

431
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,040
we didn't know who he was.

432
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:19,719
But now,

433
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,639
we've learned his real identity.

434
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,439
We must

435
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,040
verify it at Jialan White Tower.

436
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,760
If he really is the Sea Emperor,

437
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,320
we will meet again soon.

438
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,880
If he is

439
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,479
who I expect him to be,

440
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,679
him being the Sea Emperor

441
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,280
might be a blessing

442
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,360
for Kongsang.

443
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,199
Who would've thought?

444
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,719
So he was the keeper

445
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,399
Zhu Yan often mentioned?

446
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:48,520
But Keeper Yuan

447
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,639
seems very young,

448
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,600
probably around your age.

449
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,880
Shi Ying.

450
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,360
You should work harder

451
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
before Yan'er

452
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,520
is stolen from you.

453
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,120
You call pointless sacrifices

454
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,159
dedication to the nation?

455
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,959
Since we couldn't

456
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,800
kill the dragon slayer
to bolster our morale,

457
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:27,560
we have to

458
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,159
prove Shi Ying's cruelty.

459
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,999
He killed Lady Qiushui
when he was young.

460
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,520
In Guwei City, he committed

461
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,120
heinous crimes against the Merfolk.

462
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,320
In Xia City,

463
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,199
he killed a large number of soldiers.

464
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,080
And to rescue his disciple,

465
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,360
he razed our base to the ground.

466
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,040
The Merfolk are living in fear.

467
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:53,840
Today,

468
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,800
we must stand united.

469
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,479
Present tribute if we must.

470
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,280
Charge if we must.

471
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,679
You've lost your mind!

472
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:03,600
Ruyi.

473
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:05,840
Are you taking his side?

474
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,280
I don't know

475
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,880
every detail of the Elder's plan,

476
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,360
but you left without a word.

477
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
Over the past 200 years,

478
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,719
Elder Jian has been our leader.

479
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,320
I'd rather trust his decision

480
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,159
than someone who showed up

481
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:20,919
out of nowhere.

482
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:22,999
When did you

483
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,080
become so irrational?

484
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,800
We hadn't met in 200 years.

485
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,880
Is lecturing all you have to say to me?

486
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,520
When you left,

487
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,999
I was tortured

488
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,159
after the Kongsang people captured me.

489
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,600
It was Elder Jian who rescued me.

490
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,439
You were gone for 200 years.

491
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,520
Elder Jian gave me
a new purpose and duty.

492
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:45,439
By the way,

493
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,199
I've spent more time with Elder Jian

494
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,439
than with you,

495
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,360
my brother.

496
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,760
I didn't know you were alive.

497
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,080
Even when you knew,  you chose to

498
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,479
stay with that Princess of Kongsang!

499
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,280
At 5 o'clock, seven days from now,

500
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,719
the Sea Emperor will show up

501
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,639
near this location.

502
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,479
If groups of Merfolk show up,

503
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,199
how can we tell which of them

504
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,080
is the Sea Emperor?

505
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,520
The Emperor Star

506
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,999
will show a glimpse
of fate to the people.

507
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,159
And that glimpse into fate

508
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,479
is the mark of the Sea Emperor.

509
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:01,560
I got it.

510
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,600
The time you calculated

511
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,080
with this orrery

512
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,600
is when the Sea Emperor's

513
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:07,320
identity is revealed.

514
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,120
Predicting his location

515
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,479
isn't within my power.

516
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,479
Fate is guiding the people

517
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,639
through my hand.

518
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,239
This is the only chance we have.

519
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,399
If we miss it,

520
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,439
we can't make further predictions.

521
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,800
If this is our chance
to identify the Sea Emperor,

522
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,080
there will be signs of anomalies.

523
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,159
At that time,
the Evil Star will shine bright.

524
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,800
The dragon's mark will be shown.

525
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,360
I get it now.

526
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,999
Whoever carries the dragon's mark
is the Sea Emperor.

527
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
When you left this place,

528
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,840
you were but a little kid.

529
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,639
Returning to your home
after so many years

530
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,679
might be sentimental for you.

531
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,239
Ying.

532
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,679
Do you recall the time

533
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,520
you lived here?

534
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,399
After my mother passed away,

535
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,679
the last attachment I had for this place

536
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,560
was gone.

537
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,399
Jialan doesn't belong to me.

538
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,159
I don't belong in Jialan.

539
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,919
Let's go.

540
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,800
Ruyi.

541
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,239
How have you been over the years?

542
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,239
How is the man who let you transform?

543
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,999
He's dead.

544
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:53,439
And you?

545
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,959
Was it the princess

546
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,679
from the Crimson Clan

547
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,840
that Elder Jian captured?

548
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:01,919
It's not her.

549
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,080
If she wasn't the one,

550
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,600
why would you risk your life for her?

551
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,919
Don't you know our kind

552
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
can only have one love in their life?

553
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:13,800
The person

554
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,560
who swore an oath with me

555
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,520
was gone 200 years ago.

556
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
You and I are the same.

557
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,439
No.

558
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,280
You fell in love
with someone from Kongsang.

559
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,280
I fell in love

560
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,199
with someone Kongsang killed.

561
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,719
You were a keeper

562
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,840
for a Kongsang family
for over 200 years.

563
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,080
But over these years, I've been waiting

564
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,360
for the Sea Emperor's return

565
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,880
so I can have my revenge.

566
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:45,919
Ruyi.

567
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,639
Why are you in a hurry to go to Ye City?

568
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,439
Are you on a mission?

569
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,880
Over the years,
I've done things I'm proud of

570
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,840
and things I'm ashamed of.

571
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,600
I need not report

572
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,639
every detail to Lord Left Envoy.

573
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,080
If there is nothing else,

574
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,120
please go.

575
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:07,880
The approaching abyss

576
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
and treacherous ice.

577
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,639
I failed to take care of you.

578
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,600
Zhi Yuan.

579
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,999
Zhi Bing.

580
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,800
Your name came from the adage,

581
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,999
"The approaching abyss
[* "Yuan" means abyss in Chinese]

582
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,479
and treacherous ice."
[* "Bing" means ice in Chinese]

583
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,199
Such is the predicament

584
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,239
the Merfolk are in.

585
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,919
I hope that when you grow up,

586
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,280
you can take on
the duty of the Zhi family.

587
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,159
Make our people great again.

588
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,239
Do you

589
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,959
understand?

590
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,679
Yes, Father.

591
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,320
Yes, Father.

592
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,239
I don't like war!

593
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:08,520
I don't want to become a boy.

594
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,520
I don't want to be called "Zhi Bing"!

595
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,600
What name do you want?

596
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
I want to be called "Ruyi."
[* "Ruyi" means free from worries in Chinese]

597
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,959
It has a nice ring to it.

598
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,020
(A Life Free From Worries)

599
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:25,719
Very well.

600
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:26,600
You have my word.

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,040
I will keep you safe

602
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,679
and free from worries.

603
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:29,919
When Father is gone,

604
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,959
that's your name.

605
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,280
But don't let

606
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,360
Father know about it.

607
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:34,880
Ruyi.

608
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,280
It's much better than "Zhi Bing."

609
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,320
Thanks, Brother.

610
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,120
When you grow up,

611
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:40,080
you will be the most beautiful

612
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,120
among the Merfolk.

613
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,040
Hush.

614
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,239
My sister,

615
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,800
you've become the world's

616
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,800
greatest beauty.

617
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,760
Sorry.

618
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,040
I know no explanations

619
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,600
are enough to make amends.

620
00:33:59,399 --> 00:33:59,880
I am sorry.

621
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,639
As I said,

622
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,160
let's leave the past in the past.

623
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,240
Are you free from worries now?

624
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,760
In the past,

625
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,999
you hated war.

626
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,160
We went to war

627
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,919
to rebuild our nation,

628
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,160
to save our people.

629
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
A brief moment of pain

630
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,280
means nothing to me.

631
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,959
Elder Jian deceived you.

632
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,840
War is not the only way

633
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:29,760
to rebuild our nation.

634
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,559
The Priest of Grand Preceptor

635
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,160
isn't the villain they say he is.

636
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,479
The Principle Sorcerer

637
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,439
turned the Merfolk into puppets.

638
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,240
They wanted to kill me.

639
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,479
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
killed them to save me.

640
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,959
I know the marine force

641
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,640
has its own problem to deal with.

642
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,119
But I'd rather trust

643
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,919
our own people

644
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:51,880
than a man from Kongsang.

645
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,559
I'm not asking you

646
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,519
to betray your clan.

647
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,999
The Merfolk will have our own future.

648
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,680
The Sea Emperor is our hope.

649
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,519
If we can rebuild

650
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:02,999
with fewer sacrifices,

651
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,999
what will you do?

652
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,079
Judging by the tone,

653
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,640
do you have a plan in mind?

654
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,039
Do you remember the Blood Orb?

655
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,640
It will be difficult
to locate the Sea Emperor in Ye City.

656
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,399
We must locate him

657
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,240
before he enters Ye City.

658
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,720
What is your brilliant plan?

659
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,559
There is a small town here.

660
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,039
Any who enters Ye City

661
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,280
will stop by the place.

662
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,039
We enter the city

663
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,479
and split up to search
while carrying the Blood Orbs.

664
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,919
If the orbs glow blue,

665
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
the Sea Emperor is nearby.

666
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,280
Then, signal me.

667
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,479
I'll verify it.

668
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,599
Do you remember the Blood Orb?

669
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,039
My blood

670
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,919
can sense the power of the Sea Emperor.

671
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,760
It's the same with
the Blood Orb made by my blood.

672
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,880
I'll give Elder Jian and his men

673
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,119
the Blood Orbs

674
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,760
so they can help with the search.

675
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,160
But I will find the Sea Emperor

676
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,119
before they do.

677
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,599
When I find the Sea Emperor on my own,

678
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll signal you.

679
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,479
We'll decide on
the next course of action.

680
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,399
Will you join me?

681
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:49,880
Indeed.

682
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,519
Father told us when we were little.

683
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,119
Blood of men from the Zhi family

684
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,039
has this unique trait.

685
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,599
We'll follow Lord Zhi's plan.

686
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,039
You shall lead the search.

687
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,479
The marine force

688
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,079
will only search for the Sea Emperor.

689
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,680
Do not stir up any trouble.

690
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
Yes!

691
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:16,599
Take a break.

692
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:17,999
I have some food with me.

693
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,720
Let the kid have it.

694
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,079
Thank you.

695
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,959
It's a trying time.

696
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,519
They are with the marine force.

697
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,479
Seize them!

698
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,640
We are refugees!

699
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
We're not soldiers!

700
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,479
You are if I say so.

701
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,959
Every Merfolk works
for the marine force.

702
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,999
Each Merfolk head
will get you two golds!

703
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,800
Kill them all!

704
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,559
- Run!
- Slay them!

705
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,519
Stop right there!

706
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,399
Stop running!

707
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,320
Take their Jade Tears.

708
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,240
But we have the order from Lord Zhi.

709
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,280
Elder Jian plays along

710
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
to find the Sea Emperor.

711
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,320
He's busy with the search,

712
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:08,800
why would he know

713
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,519
about this slaughter?

714
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,320
Quick, do it now!

715
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,160
No!

716
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:34,959
Mother...

717
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,240
We lost the Jade Tear.

718
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,519
But we have the boy with us.

719
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,559
The Sea Emperor shows himself.

720
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,399
But where is this anguish

721
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,079
coming from?

722
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,119
Could it be

723
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
the Sea Emperor is in danger?

724
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,599
Dragon's mark!

725
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,640
Only the Sea Emperor has that!

726
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,200
Sea Emperor?

727
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,119
Is he the Sea Emperor?

728
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,240
We have to bring him back

729
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,240
to Elder Jian!

730
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,360
Stop!

731
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,320
Stop!

732
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:38,559
Stop!

733
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,720
Stop!

734
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,919
The marine force is coming!

735
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,880
Help!

736
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,519
Stop!

737
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,880
I'll let you fight.

738
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,320
All of you should die.

739
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,200
I hate all of you!

740
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,599
Sumo really is the Sea Emperor.

741
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,559
Little boy?

742
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,360
Little boy?

743
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,200
You're not going anywhere.

744
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,959
The Evil Star is shining bright.

745
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,559
The Sea Emperor's identity
has been revealed.

746
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,800
It's south of here.

747
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:00,840
