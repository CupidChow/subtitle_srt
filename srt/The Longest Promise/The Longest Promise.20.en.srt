19
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:06,113
Young Lady, are you awake?

20
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:07,753
Her Highness is waiting for you.

21
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:09,473
All right.

22
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,234
Tell Mother

23
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:13,434
I will be there soon.

24
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,033
Yes, Young Lady.

25
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,234
Probably she's going
to persuade me again.

26
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,394
(This is it. I was blindfolded.)

27
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:51,554
(Because I was inside my own spiritual.)

28
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:52,954
(Naturally, I wasn't able)

29
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,193
(to drive her away
with spiritual power.)

30
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:55,913
(But)

31
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,193
(how did she intrude there?)

32
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,114
What's wrong with you?

33
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,633
I know you're diligent.

34
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,753
But you look somewhat gaunter now.

35
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:13,593
Did you stay up all night yesterday?

36
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:17,073
I'll go and get you some snacks.

37
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,353
Is it because the residual power
of Gong Shang still left?

38
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:28,434
Plus, our spiritual powers
are mutually connected.

39
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:29,913
So she accidentally intruded there?

40
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,554
However, given her current ability,

41
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,633
she shouldn't be able to achieve that.

42
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:41,994
Have you reflected

43
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,114
on your mistake last time?

44
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,073
I failed my task last time.

45
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:48,874
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

46
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,473
General Qing, you're not young.

47
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:54,793
You should

48
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:56,434
decide on marriage now, right?

49
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,674
Elders of the Azure Clan and I

50
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,874
are very concerned about you.

51
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:03,674
Recently, the Crimson King

52
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:04,994
has been seeking a marriage alliance

53
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:06,473
for his only daughter, Princess Zhu Yan.

54
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,473
Princess Zhu Yan

55
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:10,593
is a lady of your age

56
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,954
and after your heart.

57
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,274
You should propose marriage to her.

58
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:16,554
Your Highness.

59
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,874
Why did you bring this up
out of a sudden?

60
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,313
Both of you are of marriageable age.

61
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,713
Is there any problem with that?

62
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:24,994
Besides,

63
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:26,953
you've failed your task.

64
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,713
This time, you must make amends for it.

65
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,234
I hope that you won't let

66
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,994
the Azure King and me down again.

67
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:37,114
I heard that you were close

68
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:39,474
with Princess Zhu Yan

69
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:41,474
when you were in Jiuyi Mountain.

70
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:42,874
Why?

71
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,073
Do you loathe her?

72
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,594
It's not that.

73
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:48,513
But Princess Zhu Yan and I...

74
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,354
Though the Crimson Residence is located
at the Western Huang

75
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:51,713
and lacks in strength,

76
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,354
however, Princess Zhu Yan

77
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,513
is the sole trueborn
of the Crimson King.

78
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:00,153
She will ascend to the throne one day.

79
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,153
Both of you are of similar rank.

80
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:03,753
She can barely be considered

81
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,193
a compatible spouse with the Azure Clan.

82
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,633
The marriage alliance
between the two clans

83
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:10,354
is deemed a good thing

84
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,674
for the Azure Clan too.

85
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,753
Princess, General Qing is here.

86
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,153
General Qing, it's been a while.

87
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,273
What brings you here today?

88
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:47,633
Consort Qing just arranged
marriage for me

89
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,753
with Zhu Yan.

90
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:53,234
Congrats.

91
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:54,794
Congrats?

92
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:57,874
I heard that you're marrying

93
00:05:57,914 --> 00:05:58,874
Prince Shi Yu soon too.

94
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:00,914
Yes.

95
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,513
Are you here to offer
your blessings too?

96
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:04,594
No.

97
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:06,594
I came here to ask you.

98
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,354
Do you truly accept
the marriage arrangement?

99
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:15,234
Even I know that Prince Shi Yu

100
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:16,874
likes Princess Xueying,

101
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:18,833
who's your little sister.

102
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:20,073
So what?

103
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,153
None of the noble descendants

104
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,434
have a say in their marriage.

105
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,674
Zhu Yan and you're going to engage too.

106
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,994
Is it because you like her?

107
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:36,874
General Qing, you like me.

108
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,554
Don't you?

109
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:39,753
You know that?

110
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,234
I've known it all along.

111
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,234
Be that as it may, you should be aware

112
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,434
that for people
who come from a humble origin like us,

113
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,193
love isn't something we should ask for.

114
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:50,753
I don't seek love but interest.

115
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,234
As long as the marriage

116
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,513
can get me closer to my goal,

117
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:54,554
I will do it.

118
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,753
So, I advise you

119
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,594
to think the same way too.

120
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:58,874
Marrying Zhu Yan

121
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,994
is a good thing for you, General Qing.

122
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,953
You come from a side branch
of the Azure Clan

123
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:07,234
and come this far
because of your own desperate effort.

124
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,193
Zhu Yan is the only daughter
of the Crimson King.

125
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,594
With her assistance,

126
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,474
perhaps you might aspire to the throne

127
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,073
of the Azure King in the future.

128
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:18,874
I don't want to listen to this

129
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:20,234
and I don't care about them.

130
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,034
I'm here to ask you...

131
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:23,914
Hold it back.

132
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,114
You should know my answer.

133
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,073
Point taken.

134
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,234
I shouldn't have asked.

135
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,713
Please take care of yourself.

136
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,313
I shall take my leave.

137
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,354
(If there's a next life,)

138
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,474
(we're not born in the noble clans,)

139
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,193
(perhaps we can be together)

140
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:16,234
(and enjoy our lives leisurely.)

141
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:17,953
(And maybe...)

142
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,513
Greetings, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:39,234
Be at ease.

144
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,234
Your Majesty.

145
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,194
I have an important matter

146
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:46,714
to discuss with you.

147
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:50,194
Do you?

148
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:52,874
Is it a discussion

149
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:56,594
or you've already made the decision?

150
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:58,714
I dare not.

151
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:00,793
But I notice

152
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,753
that the state affairs
have been keeping you busy.

153
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:04,834
Hence, I'd like

154
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:07,433
to share your worries

155
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,994
about family matters.

156
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:13,033
Yu has come of age.

157
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,033
It's time to arrange a marriage for him.

158
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:16,753
Hence, I've chosen

159
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,393
Bai Xuelu, the Princess of the White Clan.

160
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:22,114
I wonder if you're satisfied
with this choice.

161
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:23,714
Of course.

162
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:25,673
Go.

163
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,393
Bring the Princess
of the White Clan here.

164
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:29,474
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,033
Bai Xuelu,
the Princess of the White Clan,

166
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,234
is indeed a beautiful and virtuous lady.

167
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,033
I believe

168
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,354
you will approve of her

169
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,513
after meeting her.

170
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:47,913
Your Majesty,

171
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,793
two princesses of
the White Clan are here.

172
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,874
- Greetings, Your Majesty, Consort Qing.
- Greetings, Your Majesty, Consort Qing.

173
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:05,153
Your mother suggested you
take a consort.

174
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,474
You may choose your principal wife

175
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,273
between them.

176
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:18,314
Why?

177
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:19,553
Why are you hesitating?

178
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,874
Choose the lady you like.

179
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:26,753
Choose one out of two.

180
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:28,354
How hard can it be?

181
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:33,393
Father.

182
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,474
Are you sure I can choose myself?

183
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,234
If you don't,

184
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,994
your mother will step in.

185
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:41,753
I'll choose.

186
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:47,834
Father.

187
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,673
I choose Bai Xueying to be my consort.

188
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,074
Please grant my wish.

189
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:56,513
Good. Very good.

190
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,074
I've heard

191
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,994
that both of you are on intimate terms

192
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,753
and you met a lot in secret.

193
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,074
Those rumors seem to be true.

194
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,474
This is marvelous.

195
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,513
I will grant your wish.

196
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,273
Thank you, Father.

197
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:13,393
Thank you, Your Majesty.

198
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:14,834
Get up.

199
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:22,714
Yu.

200
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,954
Life is short.

201
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:28,594
You shouldn't refrain from yourself

202
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,594
and devote yourself all

203
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,553
to being with your loved one.

204
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:36,393
Failing that,

205
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,673
you may end up

206
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:41,033
like a living dead.

207
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:44,994
I was born into a cold imperial family.

208
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,673
I wasn't given a chance
to stay with my beloved one.

209
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:52,994
How pathetic.

210
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:55,153
Fortunately,

211
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:57,834
you're luckier than me

212
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,834
as you can be with your loved one.

213
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,594
Do cherish her well

214
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,153
and don't let her down.

215
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:06,433
Yes, Father.

216
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:10,393
Brilliant, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,033
I didn't know

218
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,273
there was such a story behind this.

219
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,994
I almost shoved the wrong pair together.

220
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:20,393
You may leave.

221
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:21,874
Yes.

222
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:30,553
Qing Yun.

223
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:32,513
Stay here.

224
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:38,994
Your Majesty,

225
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:40,834
what's the matter?

226
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,633
I think there's something

227
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:47,834
you haven't told me.

228
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:49,994
If you don't,

229
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:53,153
I'll let it pass.

230
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,714
Now that Yu has chosen his wife.

231
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,633
I implore you

232
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,153
to appoint him as the Crown Prince.

233
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,433
I can have someone issue a decree

234
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:06,354
to confer the title
of Crown Prince on Shi Yu now.

235
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:07,714
However,

236
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,314
after this,

237
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,793
you should stop harassing
the person in Jiuyi Mountain.

238
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:12,513
Understood?

239
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:19,194
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

240
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,474
You're wise.

241
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,114
Xueying, you're finally back.

242
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,194
I've cooked
a precious bird's nest for you.

243
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:11,673
Come on.

244
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,314
I've heard about it.

245
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:14,553
Good job.

246
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,114
Though it's just an engagement

247
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,354
and the wedding
is still a few days away,

248
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,513
His Majesty is a word of his man.

249
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:23,314
You shall wait for the decree
of your conferment.

250
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:27,994
I carefully picked
this precious delicacy

251
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,753
and cooked it for two hours.

252
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:31,433
This is such great news.

253
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:33,513
I suppose Father

254
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:34,433
has a lot to say with Xueying.

255
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,994
I shall take my leave first.

256
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:37,994
Congratulations, Xueying.

257
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:47,714
Xueying.

258
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:48,753
Come on and have a taste.

259
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:49,834
This is your favorite bird's nest broth.

260
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:51,354
Come on, Xueying. Have a taste.

261
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:11,433
Princess.

262
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:15,114
Are you laughing out of frustration?

263
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:16,594
Of course not.

264
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,874
Do you believe in destiny?

265
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:22,994
I'm predestined

266
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,553
to be the Empress of Kongsang.

267
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:26,673
But

268
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,714
His Majesty has already

269
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,633
appointed Princess Xueying

270
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,393
as Prince Shi Yu's consort.

271
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,793
That day, Priest managed to escape

272
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,553
the dragnet cast by Consort Qing.

273
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,194
I knew

274
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,234
he's of immeasurable prowess

275
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,273
that beyond our expectations.

276
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:45,074
However, when Consort Qing

277
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,433
presented Shi Yu,

278
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,834
who's an easier path before,

279
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:49,513
I couldn't bear
to leave the initial choice behind,

280
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:51,033
but I had to.

281
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:54,194
But the current situation
is right up my alley.

282
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,673
Prince Shi Yu

283
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:58,633
was appointed as the Crown Prince.

284
00:15:59,273 --> 00:15:59,913
So what?

285
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:01,673
He's merely a good-for-nothing

286
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,033
who failed to escape a marriage.

287
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:04,834
He won't achieve anything big

288
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,753
despite the conferment.

289
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:09,828
(Ying)

290
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,714
I no longer have to hesitate.

291
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,273
This must be the guidance from heaven.

292
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,074
Shi Ying

293
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:21,273
is my only path.

294
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:25,844
(Ying)

295
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:48,793
Young Lady.

296
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:51,594
Didn't you say

297
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:53,153
that your Master
is the former Crown Prince?

298
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,393
Now that His Majesty
has appointed a new Crown Prince.

299
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,114
It should be bad news.

300
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,594
Why do you look happy instead?

301
00:16:59,314 --> 00:16:59,954
My master never cares

302
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:00,994
about the position of the Crown Prince.

303
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,753
He's happier

304
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:05,153
if no one brings up the past ever again.

305
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,913
Concerning the latest conferment,

306
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,874
no one will bother him with that again.

307
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,554
And Master

308
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:13,393
won't be worried
if I'll be dragged into trouble.

309
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,193
Maybe...

310
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,034
Forget it. You don't have
to know about this.

311
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:21,554
Princess.

312
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,354
Her Highness is urging you
to have dinner.

313
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:24,594
All right.

314
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:29,794
Oh, Yufei,

315
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:30,754
have you received any letters

316
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:31,874
from Jiuyi Mountain?

317
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:33,514
No.

318
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:34,913
Young Lady.

319
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:36,114
It's only been just over a month

320
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,473
since you returned home.

321
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:38,874
You've already sent thirty batches

322
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,314
of our local specialties over.

323
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,913
Yet there's been no replies
from Jiuyi Mountain.

324
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,554
Do you think

325
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,594
it's because...

326
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:47,874
What?

327
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:50,114
Because Priest

328
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,514
doesn't like the gifts you sent?

329
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:52,993
It's impossible.

330
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:55,074
Master

331
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:56,673
hasn't replied to me

332
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,633
because he's in trouble now

333
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,354
and he doesn't want me to get involved.

334
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:04,074
As of now,

335
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,913
a new Crown Prince is designated,

336
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:08,754
probably he won't have any worries.

337
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,433
Maybe

338
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:11,233
he's already

339
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,314
on his way to Extreme Wind City.

340
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,633
I might be able to see him

341
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,314
tomorrow or the day after.

342
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:25,993
Wishing Tree.

343
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,034
I'm here again.

344
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:36,594
Why is there a barrier here?

345
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,193
Why is it blocking me?

346
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:41,713
Let me in.

347
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,074
(Why are you stopping me?)

348
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,794
(Let me in.)

349
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,193
(Let me in.)

350
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,514
What's going on now?

351
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,754
Why can't I enter this fantastical realm?

352
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:10,633
Young Lady.

353
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:12,554
Young Lady.

354
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,473
Something bad has happened.

355
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:16,074
Young Lady, wake up.

356
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,193
Someone came for a marriage proposal.
It's the Azure Clan.

357
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,114
Marriage proposal?

358
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:24,993
What are you talking about?

359
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:28,874
What? Marriage proposal?

360
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:30,314
Yes, Young Lady.

361
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,314
Please put them inside.

362
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,673
Come on, follow me.

363
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,153
Come this way. Hurry.

364
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,034
General Qing.

365
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:39,433
Greetings, my lord.

366
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:40,514
Greetings, my lady.

367
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,074
Please drink some tea, General Qing.

368
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,633
Thank you, my lady.

369
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:49,673
Qing Gang.

370
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:52,834
Why are you here?

371
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:56,754
Princess Zhu Yan.

372
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:58,713
It's been a long while.

373
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,913
Yan'er, speak gently.

374
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,233
Behave yourself.

375
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:02,953
Don't embarrass yourself.

376
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:03,393
I...

377
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,874
I apologize, General Qing.

378
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,993
We've overly pampered Zhu Yan at home.

379
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:10,554
But don't worry.

380
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,713
Before she gets married,

381
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,953
we'll teach her etiquette.

382
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:15,514
Getting married?

383
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,274
Please don't be.

384
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:18,794
Princess Zhu Yan and I

385
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:19,594
had already known each other

386
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:20,594
when we were in Jiuyi Mountain.

387
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:21,993
We're close.

388
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,354
There's no need to be so courteous.

389
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:25,274
True.

390
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:26,874
It's good

391
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,473
that you've become acquainted.

392
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:29,594
It'll be more comfortable for you

393
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,794
to get along in the future.

394
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:31,473
That's right.

395
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,314
Since you haven't been meeting
each other for some time,

396
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,274
you should spend some time alone
to catch up.

397
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:38,554
Exactly.

398
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,193
The weather is good today.

399
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:41,554
Yan'er.

400
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:42,754
Take General Qing

401
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,193
to the garden for a walk.

402
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,274
Yan'er, come on.

403
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:47,193
Hurry.

404
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:48,074
We...

405
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,433
The nature of this marriage

406
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,393
is that Consort Qing intends
to win the Crimson Clan to her side

407
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,193
by sacrificing your happiness

408
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:02,794
as well as mine.

409
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:05,754
How could you accept
this without a squeak?

410
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:08,633
As the kin of the Azure Clan,

411
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:09,874
I shouldn't defy

412
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:11,953
the order of the clan chief.

413
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:13,874
Have you ever thought

414
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:14,913
that your obedience

415
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,193
is actually harming yourself

416
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:17,433
and me too?

417
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:19,314
We're buddies.

418
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,274
It's absurd
that we're about to get married now.

419
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:23,314
As long as you disagree,

420
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:24,993
I can return to report to duty.

421
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,673
But I'm afraid

422
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,754
the Consort Qing will have other plans.

423
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,554
Consort Qing is hard to deal with.

424
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,514
But instead of worrying about this,

425
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:34,193
shouldn't you be concerned

426
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:34,874
about your negligent decision

427
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,433
will leave you with regrets
in your life?

428
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:39,233
I do hate Bai Xuelu.

429
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:40,514
And she's not a good match for you.

430
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,554
But you like her.

431
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:43,794
If you like her,

432
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:44,953
how could you give up on her easily?

433
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:48,913
Don't mention her.

434
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:50,713
What?

435
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:53,554
Did she reject you?

436
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,153
So, you turn to me

437
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,393
after you become disheartened?

438
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,594
Well, I promise you.

439
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:00,673
I'll marry you.

440
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:02,913
Good. Come on.

441
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:04,514
Look at me.

442
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,433
Can you imagine

443
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,913
that we're going to live together
for a lifetime?

444
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:13,514
You can't, right?

445
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:15,433
Me neither.

446
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:17,034
That's why I say,

447
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:20,874
life is never going in the way we want.

448
00:23:21,673 --> 00:23:23,153
When we confront pressure,

449
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:24,713
we should bravely fight against it

450
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:25,953
for our loved ones.

451
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,874
Otherwise, it's all in vain.

452
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,554
Qing Gang, you're a dignified man,

453
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:33,993
yet you're not as good
as a woman like me.

454
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:37,314
You're right.

455
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,153
Thank you for enlightening me.

456
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:40,913
I'll return now

457
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:42,314
and tell Consort Qing

458
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:44,633
I can't obey this order.

459
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,554
That's right.

460
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:49,433
But the thing can be more complicated

461
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,233
than what you imagine.

462
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:51,874
If the marriage alliance fails,

463
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,114
I'm afraid Consort Qing

464
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,314
won't give up easily.

465
00:23:58,874 --> 00:23:59,633
I can handle it.

466
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,314
(In time,)

467
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,354
(this strange huge tree will wither,)

468
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,633
(and then my spiritual barrier)

469
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,354
(may return to peace.)

470
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:24,433
Wishing Tree.

471
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,633
You look like Master.

472
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:30,354
When he's deep in thought,

473
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,473
he always frowns.

474
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:37,953
Master.

475
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:42,713
(What's going on now?)

476
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:43,433
Master.

477
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,074
(Last time,
the residual power of Gong Shang)

478
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:45,874
(has depleted,)

479
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,153
(and I completely expelled her)

480
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,193
(from my spiritual barrier.)

481
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:51,754
(How could she come in again?)

482
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,274
I didn't have a chance
to take a closer look at you.

483
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,514
You're a dead ringer for him.

484
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:15,314
Your eyes are moving.

485
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,554
Wishing Tree, thank you.

486
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,713
I've seen the Illusionary Master again.

487
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:27,633
Wishing Tree.

488
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:29,713
Why did you wither

489
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,794
just after a few days we met?

490
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,114
Your branches have fallen off.

491
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,514
(How did she manage to come in here?)

492
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,354
Illusion.

493
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,314
I'll see you as my Master.

494
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:53,754
Here, give me your hand.

495
00:25:59,514 --> 00:25:59,874
You

496
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:01,754
promised me

497
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:02,913
you would come to see me.

498
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:04,393
But you never show up.

499
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:05,993
Do you want to break your promise?

500
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:09,393
Now tell me what many spankings
you deserve.

501
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,114
Well.

502
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,153
You can hit me

503
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,594
three times.

504
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:20,754
All right?

505
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:24,354
If so, as your teacher...

506
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,953
As your disciple,
I'll hit you three times.

507
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,393
You must remember this well.

508
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,153
This is so fun.

509
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,274
I'm going to do things

510
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,473
that I wouldn't dare to do to Master

511
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:47,274
on the Illusionary Master.

512
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:03,554
Illusionary Master.

513
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:05,834
My master never laughs happily.

514
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,874
Can you laugh?

515
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,274
Master?

516
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:35,314
You're not an illusion?

517
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:36,874
You're Master.

518
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:39,354
Are you him?

519
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:49,433
It's an illusion.

520
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,074
I know you're an illusion.

521
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:54,594
That's great.

522
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:55,554
I thought you were him.

523
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,633
Master will never laugh like this.

524
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:14,034
Do you know?

525
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:16,794
I like the illusion

526
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:18,314
in this fantastical realm.

527
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:22,834
I can feel the warmth

528
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,233
and heartbeats.

529
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,034
Sadly,

530
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:31,314
you're just an illusion.

531
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:36,874
My master

532
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:40,514
will never allow me to hug him.

533
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,153
Illusionary Master.

534
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:55,074
Can you sit with me for a while?

535
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,193
Will you?

536
00:28:59,114 --> 00:28:59,594
Come with me.

537
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:09,514
Please seat.

538
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:19,993
Illusionary Master.

539
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:21,834
Do you know?

540
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,274
My parents are forcing me
to marry someone.

541
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,433
They asked me

542
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,594
what kind of man I wanted to marry.

543
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:37,633
What kind of man do I want to marry?

544
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,314
I first saw Crown Prince

545
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:42,114
when I was little.

546
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:44,754
And I thought

547
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,874
he's the guy with the most dashing look.

548
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:51,514
Afterward, I met with Master

549
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,074
and I thought

550
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,514
he's a clear moon in the sky

551
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,233
and an immortal shrouded in light.

552
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,433
And these two perfect men

553
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,114
turn out to be the same one.

554
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,554
Well,

555
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,114
after meeting such a man
who lacks nothing in the flesh,

556
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:08,913
naturally,

557
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:12,274
I'll have high expectations, right?

558
00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:28,554
Tell me.

559
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:32,673
Can anyone be compared to my Master?

560
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,713
Wishing Tree,

561
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:15,354
you're blooming with red flowers too.

562
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:19,233
There are two colors
of flowers at the same time.

563
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:20,953
That's beautiful.

564
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,193
Wishing Tree,

565
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,673
please keep blooming

566
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,673
until the day my master
comes to fetch me.

567
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:28,594
No.

568
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:31,074
You must bloom until the day

569
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,233
my master and I grow old.

570
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:34,354
All right?

571
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:43,874
This is beautiful.

572
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,390
♪Time flows by for a single glance♪

573
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,150

♪Can't give up my deep feelings♪

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,090

(Shi Ying.)

586
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:40,034
(You shouldn't let her)

587
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:41,953
(to enter your spiritual barrier again.)

588
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,090
♪Keeping true hearts untouched♪

589
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,570
♪Waiting for the next life to unfold♪

590

Ying.

591
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:16,673
Regarding the Ice Clan's assassins

592
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:17,633
at the Nvluo Creek,

593
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,433
my bird has brought back some clues.

594
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:21,913
Among the three Sorcerers

595
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,114
turned up that day,

596
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,074
the sturdy one with two blades

597
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:27,114
didn't die under the Celestial Assault.

598
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,074
Instead, he went back to Jialan
to report to Consort Qing.

599
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:30,633
But I've lost his trail again.

600
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:32,913
The survivor

601
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,874
should be the chief
of the Ten Sorcerers, Wu Xian.

602
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:35,673
The Ten Sorcerers

603
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:37,673
are led by Wu Xian.

604
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:39,314
If Wu Xian doesn't die,

605
00:33:39,874 --> 00:33:41,314
the nine can resurrect

606
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:42,794
even though they die.

607
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:45,274
I can't believe

608
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,713
he managed to survive
the Celestial Assault.

609
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:48,633
This is indeed suspicious.

610
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:51,233
Ice Clan launched an attack
on the Emperor's Valley

611
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,993
and Nvluo Creek,

612
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,713
I believe the Azure Clan
is behind these too.

613
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,274
But I have no idea

614
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,633
what kind of deal they have made.

615
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:02,993
Azure Clan provided Ice Clan

616
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,074
with convenience into the Kongsang.

617
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:07,074
While Ice Clan helps Azure Clan

618
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,834
to eliminate the major threat, that's you.

619
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:10,874
If the Ice Clan

620
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,393
intended to kill me,

621
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:14,794
they could send out the Ten Sorcerers

622
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:17,593
and both Zhu Yan and I
wouldn't stand a chance to survive.

623
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:20,473
But they didn't seem to kill you.

624
00:34:21,553 --> 00:34:22,714
What exactly do they want?

625
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:24,754
This matter is serious.

626
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:26,754
I must get to the bottom of it.

627
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,194
Especially the identity of the Sage

628
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:30,634
Wu Xian mentioned that day.

629
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:32,874
We must look up this clue.

630
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:38,234
But where should we start with?

631
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:40,073
Jiuyi District.

632
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,513
This is a place

633
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,073
the Ice Clan can't avoid

634
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:44,194
when they enter the Emperor's Valley

635
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:45,473
and Nvluo Creek.

636
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:48,513
I guess the people in the district
must have seen them.

637
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,794
It seems that Wu Xian left these

638
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,113
when he fled in a hurry.

639
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:01,794
This is the map

640
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:02,714
around Jiuyi Mountain

641
00:35:02,953 --> 00:35:03,953
and Nvluo Creek

642
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:05,874
as well as the solution to the maze

643
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:06,714
outside the Emperor's Valley.

644
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:10,433
Could it be that there's a turncoat
in the mountain from the Ice Clan?

645
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:14,154
This map contains many details

646
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:17,593
that an ordinary cultivator
of Jiuyi Mountain wouldn't know.

647
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:18,953
You're right.

648
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:20,314
I don't even know

649
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:22,073
about this shortcut.

650
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:25,194
Is it the High Priest...

651
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:26,714
Don't be absurd.

652
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:29,393
Why not?

653
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,794
I've been perching on Jiuyi Mountain

654
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:31,913
for thousands of years

655
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:33,953
and I've been to every corner of it.

656
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:36,073
But I didn't know about this shortcut
and the person did,

657
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:39,154
unless this map is left by someone
who has deep connections

658
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:40,993
with Jiuyi Mountain in the ancient past.

659
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:43,433
No.

660
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:45,113
This scroll looks new.

661
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:45,953
Don't tell me the person
who created this scroll

662
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:46,874
has lived longer than me

663
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:48,674
and this person has a pair
of exceptionally keen eyes.

664
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:50,834
Isn't that the immortal?

665
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,754
The one who gave Wu Xian this

666
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:55,714
might be the Sage.

667
00:35:57,194 --> 00:35:57,714
Chong Ming.

668
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,433
Rally all the birds

669
00:35:59,754 --> 00:36:00,593
to search around the realm

670
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:01,913
for the whereabouts of Ten Sorcerers.

671
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:03,674
We must find the Sage

672
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:04,993
as soon as possible.

673
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:06,553
All right.

674
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:27,953
Your Supreme Majesty,

675
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:29,553
Chong Ming and I

676
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:31,953
have discovered some clues

677
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,354
about the whereabouts of the Ice Clan
in Jiuyi District.

678
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:41,314
I suspect

679
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:43,033
that the person who knows

680
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,354
all secret realms

681
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:46,553
is the Sage behind the Ice Clan.

682
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:49,553
What do you say, Your Supreme Majesty?

683
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:52,113
Unless

684
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,393
there are some mythical creatures

685
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:55,754
who've been living
for thousands of years

686
00:36:55,993 --> 00:36:56,874
like Chong Ming

687
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,194
and has joined the Ice Clan.

688
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:01,993
Now that the trickiest and
the most sinister Chaos

689
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:03,993
in the mountain has been subdued by you

690
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,194
and it won't be able to rise again
in a hundred years.

691
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:10,113
This matter remains mysterious.

692
00:37:10,593 --> 00:37:11,593
You should keep investigating.

693
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:13,513
Yes.

694
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:15,754
There's one more thing.

695
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:20,154
Consort Qing has ordered Qing Gang

696
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,194
to propose marriage to Zhu Yan.

697
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:26,154
If you think this is inappropriate,

698
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:27,314
I can stop their marriage

699
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:29,674
with an excuse,

700
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,473
saying that their star signs
are in disharmony

701
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:32,874
and might bring harm
to the two clans' fate.

702
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:34,593
What do you think?

703
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,033
I have no interest in worldly matters.

704
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,874
The union among the six clans

705
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:41,033
don't concern me.

706
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,194
Now that Zhu Yan has left,

707
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:44,874
I'm not concerned about

708
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,794
who's she going to marry.

709
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:49,993
But you

710
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:53,274
look more concerned about this.

711
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,073
Do I?

712
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:09,314
This is the spiritual power I extracted
from my barrier

713
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:10,513
during cultivation.

714
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,314
As expected, it belongs to you.

715
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,433
I've been curious about

716
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,553
how Zhu Yan managed to intrude

717
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:18,754
into my barrier several times.

718
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:20,354
So, it was you

719
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:21,754
who enhanced the residual connection
of Gong Shang

720
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,033
with your spiritual power.

721
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:28,274
Why did you do so, Your Supreme Majesty?

722
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:32,634
Yes.

723
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:36,754
It was me.

724
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,953
Because both you and Zhu Yan

725
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,274
were being alone together

726
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,194
and were willing
to risk yourselves for each other.

727
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:48,033
That's why I became suspicious of you

728
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,674
and wanted to test
your faith in cultivation.

729
00:38:51,354 --> 00:38:52,354
Zhu Yan and I

730
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:53,874
are disciple and mentor.

731
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:55,513
Your Supreme Majesty,

732
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,234
please don't presume.

733
00:38:57,593 --> 00:38:58,513
But what are you afraid of?

734
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:00,714
If you have no feelings for Zhu Yan,

735
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:02,234
why are you afraid

736
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:03,314
of meeting her in the dream?

737
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,194
The reason why I asked Zhu Yan to leave

738
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:09,073
because I want to cut ties with her.

739
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,274
If you insist on doubting us,

740
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:14,874
I'll erase all memory
and spiritual power

741
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:17,194
that are related to her.

742
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:18,674
I'll cut ties with the past

743
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,834
and start my cultivation anew.

744
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,634
Stop.

745
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,553
I'll withdraw my spiritual power.

746
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:40,314
From now on,

747
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:43,593
she won't intrude

748
00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:44,274
on the barrier again.

749
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:48,194
If you still hear her voice,

750
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,274
you may drive her out.

751
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:52,314
Yes.

752
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:54,754
I shall take my leave.

753
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:08,993
Priest is so resolute.

754
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:10,794
If so, your plan...

755
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:13,953
His suppressed emotions

756
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,473
might explode one day

757
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,714
and jolt him into worldly desires.

758
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:21,194
And all of the occurrences

759
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:23,513
will be beneficial to his cultivation.

760
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:25,433
Didn't you realize something?

761
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:26,913
He's able to bring the spiritual power

762
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:27,794
out of the barrier.

763
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:29,433
He has made a lot of progress
in such a short time.

764
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,993
The light leaking through cracks

765
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:37,593
is the most precious one.

766
00:41:09,913 --> 00:41:10,433
(Great couple)
Ying.

767
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:12,754
What are you writing early
in the morning?

768
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:20,154
Desirable marriage?

769
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:21,834
Great couple.

770
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,194
Don't you think you're too cruel?

771
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:25,393
You know that she's not willing

772
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:26,634
to marry Qing Gang.

773
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:28,913
She's opposed to marriage

774
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,234
because she still thinks of coming back
to Jiuyi Mountain.

775
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:33,993
But if she have any connection with me,

776
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:35,354
both she and the Crimson Residence

777
00:41:35,674 --> 00:41:37,393
will be dragged into trouble.

778
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,953
This wedding congratulatory letter

779
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,754
is meant to severe her thoughts

780
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:42,913
and urge her to move on.

781
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:43,913
But

782
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:45,553
don't you really

783
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,754
want to see Zhu Yan again?

784
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,120
(Desirable marriage)

785
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:56,433
Detachment in the mountain

786
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,953
while attachment in the mortal world.

787
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:01,433
Qing Gang is an upright man.

788
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:03,033
As her master,

789
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:05,113
I'm reassured

790
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:06,874
that she can marry Qing Gang.

791
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:17,234
Greetings, my lord, my lady.

792
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:20,593
It must be a tired journey
to travel from afar.

793
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:26,194
Princess.

794
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:28,234
Where's my master?

795
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:30,553
Did he send you over?

796
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:32,834
Are there any letters for me?

797
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:35,354
Did he say

798
00:42:35,393 --> 00:42:36,513
when he will come to pay a visit?

799
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,314
Princess.

800
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:40,314
Upon knowing your marriage

801
00:42:40,754 --> 00:42:42,354
with General Qing,

802
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:44,473
Priest sent me over

803
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,513
to deliver congratulatory gifts
and a letter

804
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:49,234
to celebrate your union

805
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:50,274
with General Qing

806
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:51,593
and wish you all the best.

807
00:42:57,354 --> 00:42:57,993
He...

808
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:00,874
Did he wish me good?

809
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:02,154
Yes.

810
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:09,234
These are his congratulatory gifts
and a letter.

811
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,513
Please have a look.

812
00:43:17,574 --> 00:43:20,683
(Desirable marriage and great couple)

813
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,274
How can this be?

814
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,754
He knows that I have
no feelings for Qing Gang.

815
00:43:31,473 --> 00:43:32,154
Why...

816
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:33,953
Why did he congratulate me?

817
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:35,834
Yan'er.

818
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:37,874
Keep your manner in check
before the divine envoy.

819
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:40,033
Are you sure

820
00:43:40,314 --> 00:43:41,354
this is directly from him

821
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:43,073
and not from someone

822
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:44,714
who acts on his behalf?

823
00:43:45,513 --> 00:43:46,634
Priest wanted me

824
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,834
to relay a message to you.

825
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:51,634
Tell me quickly.

826
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:53,154
Priest said,

827
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:54,674
"I dedicate myself to cultivation,

828
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,154
leaving worldly matters behind.

829
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:57,473
Ice and fire are incompatible.

830
00:43:58,073 --> 00:43:59,113
Please don't dwell on the past."

831
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:01,033
What...

832
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:04,473
What does that mean?

833
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:06,953
(To: Shi Ying)
He hopes

834
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:09,794
you can embrace the joys of mortal life

835
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:12,714
and forget about what has happened
in the mountain.
