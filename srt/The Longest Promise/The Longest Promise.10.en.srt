19
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,514
I, Zhu Yan,

20
00:01:58,874 --> 00:01:59,555
am not someone

21
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:00,635
you can summon

22
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:02,555
however you want.

23
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:04,954
You little brat...

24
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,116
Your Supreme Majesty.

25
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:29,555
Where did he hide me?

26
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:49,075
You'll be teaching
this batch of disciples.

27
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,075
If you've tasked me with that,

28
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,754
Your Supreme Majesty,

29
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,594
please don't interfere with my teaching.

30
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:55,874
Most importantly,

31
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,835
you can't harm any of them.

32
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:03,555
I'll listen to you.

33
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,235
This is such a strange place.

34
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:11,874
How did the Priest

35
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,075
hide me inside here?

36
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,835
I feel like

37
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,235
he has hidden me here like this before.

38
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:19,874
But I can't remember anything

39
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:20,795
about that.

40
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,555
I sense something in this hall.

41
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,194
I wonder who casts a spell.

42
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:51,115
Perhaps

43
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,555
it's the cicadas or ants in the mountain

44
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:53,795
who engage in cultivation.

45
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,634
Perhaps it's Chong Ming's food.

46
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,594
Your Supreme Majesty,

47
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:16,235
if there's nothing else,

48
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,475
I will proceed with my cultivation.

49
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:27,675
It turns out

50
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,074
I'm inside his sleeve.

51
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:31,795
Ying.

52
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,555
I was too cautious

53
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,475
and caused you
some misunderstandings.

54
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,715
I hope you don't mind it.

55
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,155
You should choose

56
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,355
your first disciple you like.

57
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:45,874
May I know who you prefer more

58
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:49,954
out of the four of them?

59
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,115
I just met them today

60
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:54,274
and I don't know much about them.

61
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:55,715
I can't decide now.

62
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,754
It's fine. Let's discuss it briefly.

63
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:01,874
Let's start with the princess
of the Western Huang.

64
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:05,715
I did spend a short while

65
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:07,555
with the princess

66
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:08,995
inside the Power of Chaos.

67
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,074
She's daring and righteous.

68
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,434
But deep down,

69
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,834
she's foolish, reckless,
and mischievous.

70
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,235
She might need some time

71
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,355
before she can achieve something.

72
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:23,795
He's insulting me again.

73
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,754
Foolish, reckless, and mischievous.

74
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:28,834
He added "mischievous" this time.

75
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,595
What do you think

76
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:41,595
about Bai Xuelu of the White Clan?

77
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:43,115
Bai Xuelu

78
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:46,595
has a firm determination
inside her delicate look.

79
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,314
She has potential.

80
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:50,995
You have a bad taste.

81
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,035
I will show you

82
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:55,715
what foolish, reckless,

83
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:57,954
and mischievous people do.

84
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,100
(Foolish)

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,420
(Reckless)

86
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,100
(Mischievous)

87
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,394
I thought I was in paradise.

88
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,595
I couldn't help but dance.

89
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:41,314
Let go.

90
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,674
(Foolish, reckless, mischievous)

91
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,754
What have I done wrong

92
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,355
to deserve such comments from you?

93
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:00,355
So, I wrote it down

94
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,595
to remind myself.

95
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,795
You can write so well.

96
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,795
Your handwriting is unique
and has flair.

97
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:09,634
I believe you find them

98
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:10,754
appealing as well.

99
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:14,754
Let me do you a favor.

100
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:24,414
(Foolish, reckless, mischievous)

101
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:25,434
Since you admit

102
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,874
that you're foolish, reckless,
and mischievous

103
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,595
and wrote these

104
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:30,795
by yourself.

105
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,274
Take that as gospel

106
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,595
that spurs you on.

107
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:35,434
Get out.

108
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:47,514
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

109
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:49,355
I know you're generous.

110
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,834
Please remove these characters
on my hand.

111
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:53,834
You should keep them

112
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:55,475
to prove that you're not.

113
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,235
And these characters
will disappear naturally.

114
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,074
I... You...

115
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,074
Are you threatening me to stay?

116
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:02,795
I told you.

117
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,074
You can go down one month later

118
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:06,115
when the lesson ends.

119
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:09,795
You...

120
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,534
(Foolish, reckless, mischievous)

121
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:19,434
(Balsam shade?)

122
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:20,255
(Foolish, reckless, mischievous)

123
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:21,555
(I'm the peerless beau.)

124
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:22,675
(There's no way I'd ask for the shade)

125
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:23,675
(from an underachiever like her.)

126
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:25,634
(No, no.)

127
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,274
I want to remind you

128
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,155
that the characters on your hands

129
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:30,035
won't disappear

130
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:30,995
after one month.

131
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:31,514
If you can't meet the requirement

132
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:32,435
raised by the Priest,

133
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:33,554
you're leaving here

134
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,274
with them

135
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:35,115
one month later.

136
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,955
This Priest of Grand Preceptor.

137
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,195
Why did he humiliate me

138
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,595
when he didn't allow me to leave?

139
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,634
Trying to make me feel embarrassed?

140
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:58,595
I won't let you have your way.

141
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,715
Isn't that Princess Zhu Yan?

142
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:04,835
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:06,674
What are you hiding?

144
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:09,995
What's this?

145
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,715
Foolish, reckless, and mischievous.

146
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:15,435
Why did you write that on your hand?

147
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,475
I thought you would
receive some kind of reward

148
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:19,835
from the Priest this morning,

149
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,754
it turns out to be a punishment.

150
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,634
Craving words on faces
is known as the facial tattoo penalty.

151
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,195
What about the tattoos on your hand?

152
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:29,754
Let me see.

153
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,115
These words describe you very fittingly.

154
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:37,514
I have some good soap.

155
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:38,715
I'll send it to you.

156
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:39,995
Why?

157
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,835
You sounded like
this is something embarrassing.

158
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:43,075
We're not allowed

159
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,435
to wear accessories here.

160
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,514
Isn't it unique

161
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:47,595
to have prints on my hand?

162
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:51,274
Who knows if it will
become a fashion tomorrow.

163
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:52,674
You have a unique behavior

164
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:53,754
that stands out from others.

165
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:55,435
Interesting.

166
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,435
I have never seen someone

167
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:58,355
who enjoys

168
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,674
flattering themselves like you do.

169
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,394
It's clearly a punishment,

170
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,835
yet you try to make it sound better.

171
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,754
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

172
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,475
You can seek this punishment

173
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:08,874
from the Priest too

174
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,995
and see if he bothers to guide you.

175
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:12,274
You...

176
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:17,995
I think we shouldn't

177
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:18,835
disturb the Priest.

178
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,075
We shall see him

179
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:22,034
during the lecture.

180
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:43,674
(General Qing, thank you for lending me)

181
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,274
(the scarf the other day
to cover my shoulders.)

182
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:46,674
I've washed it myself

183
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,355
and had someone deliver it

184
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,274
to your room.

185
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:50,874
Deliver the scarf to his room?

186
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,315
(This...)

187
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:24,794
Stop it, please.

188
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:31,634
Yan.

189
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:36,595
Yan.

190
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:38,435
Why haven't you gotten up yet?

191
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,034
You're almost late.

192
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,075
Why is your hair wet?

193
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:45,715
It's already 7 in the morning?

194
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,595
How come the characters are still there?

195
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:48,995
I gave you the soap, right?

196
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,034
Didn't you wash it?

197
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,674
No worries. It's fine.

198
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,115
Maybe we'll expect something fun later.

199
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,235
Well. Hurry up. Let's go now.

200
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,595
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
has arrived.

201
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,100
(Cunsi Hall, Jiuyi Mountain)

202
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,280
(Reckless)

203
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,195
(Foolish)
Greetings, Priest.

204
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:21,315
Greetings, Priest.

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120
(Reckless, Mischievous)

206
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:29,315
I didn't expect that from you.

207
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:30,715
You're so considerate.

208
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,154
We've been partners before,

209
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,315
I will take the punishment with you.

210
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,674
Please take your seat.

211
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,475
(Zhu Yan)
Zhu Yan is late. Deduct one point.

212
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,715
Zhu Yan's not ashamed of her mistake.

213
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:49,115
Deduct another point.

214
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,634
Instead of being shameful,
Zhu Yan's proud of her behavior.

215
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:53,955
Deduct another point.

216
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:56,674
Zhu Yan's current ranking

217
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,315
is the last.

218
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,115
Priest.

219
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:02,995
Why do you mock me like this?

220
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:04,514
Princess Zhu Yan.

221
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:05,995
This artifact

222
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:07,355
is an automatic scoring system.

223
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:08,235
Not even the High Priest

224
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,315
can control it.

225
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,754
Why do you blame the Priest?

226
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,435
Correct. This scoring system

227
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,115
has been widely used in Ye City.

228
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,674
Haven't you seen it before?

229
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:19,235
I forgot that.

230
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:21,315
Princess Zhu Yan comes
from Western Huang,

231
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:24,115
it's a remote place.
So, please don't blame her.

232
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,315
You're right, princesses.

233
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:29,315
The Western Huang is a remote place

234
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,195
and lacks educational supplies.

235
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:33,075
Since the artifact is useful,

236
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,634
do you mind donating this

237
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:35,394
to 180 academies

238
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,475
in the Western Huang?

239
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:38,914
Everyone there will surely appreciate

240
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:40,595
the favor extended
by both White and Dark Clans.

241
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,115
Both Princesses of
the White and Dark Clans

242
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:45,754
help to clear their peer's doubts

243
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,274
and they abide by the rules.

244
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:49,475
They're worthy of being the role model.

245
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,634
As a reward,
I grant each of you one point.

246
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,154
Thank you, Priest.

247
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,235
Magic techniques are a form of art too.

248
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:15,955
So, you should at least

249
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:17,195
have a basic aesthetic taste.

250
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:22,955
(Maybe I'm being paranoid.)

251
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,315
(Shi Ying will never)

252
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,874
(take an interest in Zhu Yan.)

253
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:29,355
Greetings, High Priest.

254
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,554
Greetings, High Priest.

255
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,634
At ease.

256
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:38,995
Priest, please come over.

257
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,514
I have a word with you.

258
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:42,634
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

259
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:48,514
What's the matter, Your Supreme Majesty?

260
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,674
Have you heard of Magpie Branch?

261
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:54,514
Magpie Branch?

262
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:56,595
Are you referring

263
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:58,514
to the long-lost powerful toxic

264
00:14:58,754 --> 00:14:59,995
of the Azure Clan?

265
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:01,435
Exactly.

266
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,794
I received news

267
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,274
that Qing Gang brought

268
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:07,715
the Magpie Branch into the mountain.

269
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,394
It's highly poisonous

270
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:11,995
with no taste or color.

271
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:13,754
No one has ever seen it,

272
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:15,715
except for those who drop dead

273
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:17,554
after seeing it.

274
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,715
This is why

275
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,674
Qing Gang could pass through

276
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,554
the strict search
when entering Jiuyi Mountain.

277
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:26,794
During the assessment in Qianyue Peak,

278
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,315
you blamed me

279
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,394
for ordering the two Grand Marshals

280
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:30,874
to take action against him.

281
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,794
Now that he's already
passed the assessment,

282
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,475
we have no right to disqualify him

283
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:36,674
from attending the lectures.

284
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,835
So, he will stay in Jiuyi Mountain

285
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,034
for the time being.

286
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:43,274
I've observed Qing Gang

287
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,514
and I found that he's kind of single-minded,

288
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,274
however, he's upright.

289
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:49,355
He doesn't seem like someone

290
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,195
who will kill me.

291
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,394
Never judge a book by its cover.

292
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,315
I want to remind you

293
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:57,075
that he's very likely
to make a move against you

294
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:58,674
in the coming month.

295
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:02,475
You ought to keep a close eye on him.

296
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:05,115
Yes.

297
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:07,874
There are four states,

298
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,634
virtuous, saint, supreme, and real.

299
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,514
Those who attain the virtuous state
can distinguish star signs,

300
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:16,075
and comprehend the principles
of Yin and Yang.

301
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:17,634
Those in the saint state

302
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,554
integrate with the harmony
of heaven and earth

303
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,715
and make peace with
the Eight Worldly Sufferings.

304
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,394
As for those in the supreme state,

305
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,554
they can freely roam around the world

306
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,394
and boast extensive perception
throughout the world.

307
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:32,195
Experts in the real state can understand
the changes in heaven and earth,

308
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,835
the laws of Yin and Yang,
and the celestial movement.

309
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:36,235
They can alter the course of the world.

310
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,235
Throughout thousands of years,

311
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:41,595
the expert who attains the real state

312
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:44,955
is only Emperor Xingyun, Lang Gan.

313
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:50,315
Zhu Yan sleeps in class.
Deduct one point.

314
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:51,660
(Zhu Yan)

315
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:53,674
She misses another point.

316
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,995
Princess Zhu Yan, please stand up.

317
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:00,154
Do you think

318
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,955
my lecture is dull and
unbearable to listen to?

319
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:04,314
I...

320
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,354
(If I tell him
I don't understand a word,)

321
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,074
(they're going to mock
that I'm lacking education)

322
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,274
(because I'm from the Western Huang.)

323
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,794
(I can be embarrassed.)

324
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:13,475
(But I can't bring disgrace
to the Western Huang.)

325
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,675
Because I think

326
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,675
these theories are not useful,

327
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:20,794
they're just some rigid teachings.

328
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:22,635
I want to learn

329
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:25,354
more advanced magic techniques.

330
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:27,155
Priest.

331
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:29,635
You want to learn magic techniques?

332
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:30,875
Very good.

333
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:32,514
Tell me

334
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,195
what's the most powerful magic technique

335
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,155
in Jiuyi Mountain?

336
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,354
Does anyone

337
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:44,554
know the answer?

338
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:47,554
Yes, Priest.

339
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:49,995
Celestial Assault is
the ultimate attacking technique

340
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:51,675
in Jiuyi Mountain.

341
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,794
Once the Celestial Assault is launched,
no lives remain.

342
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:55,114
Not even the immortals or demons.

343
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,514
You said Celestial Assault
is an attacking technique.

344
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:58,395
But is the attacking technique

345
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,074
the most powerful technique
in existence?

346
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,514
What will happen

347
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,034
if Celestial Attack

348
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,554
confronts with
the most formidable defense technique?

349
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,594
So, this answer is invalid.

350
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:09,475
Impressive.

351
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,074
Well said, Princess Zhu Yan.

352
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,594
Now tell me,

353
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:15,475
what do you think is
the most formidable defense technique?

354
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,114
Priest.

355
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,074
The ultimate defense technique

356
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:30,754
in Jiuyi Mountain

357
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:31,915
is Sprawling Roots.

358
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:33,794
It can summon the earthly
spiritual power

359
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,314
deep under the ground.

360
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:36,675
The person acts as the center

361
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,354
and stands on the ground

362
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,594
to absorb limitless energy

363
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,915
to resist attacks.

364
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,715
Bravo. Well said.

365
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:47,715
Still, everything she said is theory.

366
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:49,715
What if Celestial Assault confronts

367
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:51,314
with Sprawling Roots?

368
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:52,554
If none of these two techniques
can defeat each other,

369
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:53,995
it means

370
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,274
the strongest magic technique
doesn't exist.

371
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:56,915
So, I'll conclude

372
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:59,155
that question posed by Priest is flawed.

373
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:01,074
She has a point.

374
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,034
The immortal official

375
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:05,554
has given explanation

376
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:06,754
on the question you asked.

377
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,074
But you were sleeping just now.

378
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,514
Experts in the real state can understand
the changes of heaven and earth,

379
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,715
the laws of Yin and Yang.

380
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,915
And the celestial movement.
They can alter the course of the world.

381
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,955
We practitioners are tiny,

382
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:24,274
but we are determined
to shake the world.

383
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,915
Thus, we have to learn
to borrow external forces.

384
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:29,235
Everything in this world

385
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:30,514
is bound by rules.

386
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,475
The only thing that exists
beyond the rules

387
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,274
is the ever-changing nature

388
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:35,554
and the flowing time.

389
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,114
Hence, the ultimate magic technique

390
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:39,955
is to borrow the power
from the intangible time

391
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,034
and that's enough to change
the course of all things.

392
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:43,155
This point

393
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:45,114
has been clearly explained in

394
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,754
"The changes of celestial movement,

395
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:48,995
and they can alter
the course of the world."

396
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,475
You mentioned

397
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,195
we could borrow the power
from intangible time.

398
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:54,354
Does that mean

399
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,435
we can control the time?

400
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:56,875
Meaning to say,

401
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,554
Time-reversing Spell does exist.

402
00:19:59,354 --> 00:19:59,995
But I remember

403
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:02,034
that someone told me there's none.

404
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,235
Everything in this world has a boundary.

405
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:06,354
With the boundary,

406
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:08,034
we are born,

407
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,074
flowers and trees grow,
nature is created,

408
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:11,354
so do all sentient beings

409
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,875
in the world.

410
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,314
Without the boundary,

411
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:15,594
the world

412
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,114
will be chaotic.

413
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,435
Life and death are
the highest boundary of all

414
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,794
that nothing can go beyond its rule.

415
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:23,955
This is stated in black and white

416
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,955
in the magic technique scroll.

417
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,754
Had you listened carefully,

418
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:29,554
you wouldn't have said that.

419
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:31,915
If you can tell me

420
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,395
the gist of magic technique,

421
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:34,675
I can easily acquire that

422
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,114
if I learn it diligently.

423
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:44,354
The immortal official has taught

424
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,114
about the four states of practitioners.

425
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:50,195
In fact, it's the intelligible way

426
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:52,274
to learn the operational principle
of the entire world.

427
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,074
If you don't know about
the way of earth and heaven

428
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:55,074
and the principle of Yin and Yang.

429
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,354
You can't understand it

430
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,314
even if

431
00:20:57,754 --> 00:20:59,114
I tell you the gist directly.

432
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:01,915
I...

433
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:03,955
Zhu Yan.

434
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:05,594
Do you admit your mistake?

435
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:22,794
I won't punish you.

436
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,675
All you do is

437
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,475
copy the introductory chapter
of Yuanxu Scripture

438
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:27,594
for three times.

439
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,915
The introductory chapter is too long.

440
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:35,514
Send it to Cultivating Hall
in three days.

441
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:38,715
How could I finish all these
just in three days?

442
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:41,635
Thank you for reminding me.

443
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,274
You might as well skip your meal

444
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,314
to finish your work.

445
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,100
(Introductory Chapter
of Yuanxu Scripture)

446
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,754
Yan, you should take a break.

447
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,395
You've been copying that for half a day.

448
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,594
You skipped your breakfast earlier

449
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:17,955
and now the lunchtime is over.

450
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:20,235
Priest isn't here.

451
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:24,395
So, just eat something.

452
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,074
Forget it.

453
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:34,514
I can't let that person

454
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:35,274
look down on me.

455
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:39,955
I must finish copying
as soon as possible

456
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:41,635
before I can enjoy the food peacefully.

457
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:46,435
Princess Xueying.

458
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:47,155
General Qing.

459
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:48,395
Princess Zhu Yan.

460
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:50,675
I'd like to have a word

461
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,875
with Princess Zhu Yan.

462
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,235
Princess Xueying,

463
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:54,435
could you leave us, please?

464
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:58,875
Remember to eat.

465
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,155
Princess Zhu Yan.

466
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:07,635
I'd like to ask you a favor.

467
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:10,754
Are you going

468
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:11,395
to Cultivating Hall tomorrow

469
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:12,554
for the Priest?

470
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:15,594
Could you...

471
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:21,875
Could you help me

472
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:22,794
to get a strand of his hair?

473
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,155
In return,

474
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:27,635
I will help you with the copying.

475
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,715
The Priest's hair?

476
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:33,034
It's said that the Priest

477
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:34,034
is a mage prodigy

478
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:35,314
and his hair

479
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:36,675
can help us to improve our skills.

480
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:37,475
So, I...

481
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:40,915
It's fine if you don't want to.

482
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:42,395
Forget what I said.

483
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:45,715
Hold on.

484
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:53,034
Will you help me?

485
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:57,715
If so, I'll do the copying right now.

486
00:23:58,475 --> 00:23:59,475
You don't have to.

487
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,435
Just tell me

488
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,034
what's the meaning of those characters

489
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,274
when put together.

490
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,420
(Introductory Chapter
of Yuanxu Scripture)

491
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,794
Your Supreme Majesty,
Princess Xuelu is here.

492
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,995
Greetings, High Priest.

493
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,875
Bai Xuelu, your performance

494
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:41,074
is excellent lately.

495
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:43,195
Thank you for your compliment.

496
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:45,235
Tell me,

497
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:47,395
what did your father tell you

498
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,635
before

499
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,754
you set out for Jiuyi Mountain?

500
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,155
Yes, High Priest.

501
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:54,834
My father

502
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,675
asked me and my sister to go back
as soon as possible.

503
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,114
If he has said so,

504
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,235
why did you compete

505
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:02,794
for the position of the first disciple?

506
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:04,875
I stay here

507
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,274
because my will is
different from my father's.

508
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,915
I admire the Priest very much

509
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,314
for his virtuous character
and robust abilities.

510
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,875
I'm willing to follow him to cultivate.

511
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:15,195
Very well.

512
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,875
I appreciate your ambition

513
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,354
as a woman.

514
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,675
This bamboo slip is the basic principle

515
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,435
of Jiuyi Mountain's magic techniques.

516
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,155
You may study it.

517
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:30,747
(Jiuyi Yuji Technique Annotation)

518
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:32,274
Thank you, High Priest.

519
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:36,875
If you're grateful to me,

520
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:39,715
keep an eye

521
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,435
on the general from the Azure Clan.

522
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,475
Do you mean Qing Gang?

523
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:46,314
As you command.

524
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:48,155
I'll report to you

525
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,395
on his slightest movement,

526
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:50,114
High Priest.

527
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:52,155
You may leave.

528
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,314
Finally, I've finished the copying.

529
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:34,955
Where's Lord Chong Ming?

530
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:46,794
He went up to the mountain

531
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,395
to search for some fruits

532
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:50,475
to replicate the color
of your balsam shade.

533
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,274
That's easy.

534
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:54,114
Why can't he ask me?

535
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,195
Chong Ming is proud.

536
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,875
True. He's an ancient divine bird.

537
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:04,235
How could he seek advice
from a foolish, reckless,

538
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,074
and mischievous person like me?

539
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,514
What are you doing?

540
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:19,514
Four wrong words
and five phrases are missed.

541
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:21,875
They're related to the circulation
of the microcosmic orbit.

542
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:23,514
You should revise more on this theory.

543
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:24,675
In the Pavilion of Books,

544
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,034
you can borrow

545
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:27,155
the Explanation of 24 Meridians.

546
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,114
I thought you had no expectations of me.

547
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:30,834
Why did you review my work

548
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:32,354
so meticulously?

549
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:33,155
I know

550
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:34,875
why you dozed off during the lecture.

551
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,195
Because you had no master
to teach you these theories

552
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,235
from a young age,

553
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,635
and you have no interest in them either.

554
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,034
You couldn't understand a word
from the immortal official.

555
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:45,794
You fell asleep because of boredom.

556
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,435
I asked you to copy the scriptures

557
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,314
to make up

558
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:50,635
for your lack of knowledge.

559
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,675
And I'll remark on your mistakes

560
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,354
so that you can learn from them.

561
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,435
How did you know I...

562
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,354
As the master,

563
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,195
I know the strengths and flaws
of my disciples.

564
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,475
Including me?

565
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:07,155
Since you're my nominated disciple,

566
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,995
in the coming month,

567
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:10,195
I'll fulfill my duty as your master.

568
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,875
This is my principle.

569
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:13,594
I won't want to disappoint myself.

570
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:15,635
However, it depends on yourself

571
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,995
how you learn.

572
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:33,274
Can you help me get a strand

573
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:34,274
of the Priest's hair?

574
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,354
(I was too focused on listening.)

575
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,754
(Almost forgot about
Qing Gang's request.)

576
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:45,554
Priest, you're serious
in your word and deed.

577
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:47,475
All of us should learn from you.

578
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:48,834
Seeing that you work so hard

579
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:50,155
to correct my stuff.

580
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,715
I think

581
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:52,915
I should do something for you.

582
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,514
Maybe I can give you

583
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,554
a shoulder massage.

584
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:08,395
I get you.

585
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:09,875
You want me to use

586
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:11,395
the jade ruyi.

587
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:12,274
No.

588
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:13,915
Well, you want me to use the jade ruyi

589
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,635
to massage your back.

590
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:16,354
No.

591
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:19,635
I know it, you want me

592
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:20,715
to take the jade ruyi

593
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:22,314
and stand away from you.

594
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,395
So that I can listen to
your guidance clearly.

595
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,514
I said no.

596
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:27,915
Understood.

597
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:29,955
Since you ordered me

598
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:31,354
not to stand away from you,

599
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:33,915
I'll come closer

600
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:35,794
and listen to your guidance.

601
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,274
What are you up to?

602
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,475
Can you bear to see me

603
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:43,915
being foolish, reckless, and mischievous

604
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:47,594
throughout my whole life?

605
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,554
Can't I have a chance

606
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:52,675
to get enlightened
and learn from wise minds?

607
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,074
You're serious

608
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:57,675
about correcting my mistake,

609
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:00,195
I want to do something
to express my gratitude.

610
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:02,995
But you're so guarded against me.

611
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:05,915
Look, the mistakes
you made in this bamboo slip

612
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:07,514
are the same as the last one.

613
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,235
You were just copying the scripture
without truly understanding the meaning.

614
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:11,995
You need to read extensively

615
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:14,074
to compensate for the knowledge
you've missed in the past.

616
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:21,875
Please make a reading list for me.

617
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:34,034
Come with me.

618
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,314
Me? Now?

619
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:39,995
Why?

620
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:41,635
Where are we going?

621
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,435
It's already noon.

622
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,354
Probably you're taking me

623
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:47,594
to eat something delicious.

624
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,195
If you intend to read,

625
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,915
I'll teach you a way to read.

626
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:12,915
Million Books Transmission

627
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:14,834
can speed up

628
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,074
your reading substantially.

629
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:18,274
Million Books Transmission?

630
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:19,675
What's that?

631
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,995
The most basic reading skill.

632
00:31:22,754 --> 00:31:25,034
Kin of the Six Ministries
have already acquired this

633
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:26,635
during the first month of schooling

634
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:28,034
in their own place.

635
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,915
They know that, but I don't.

636
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,675
Well, I'll learn this.

637
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,635
I'm sure I'll get the hang of it

638
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:37,995
when I go down in a month.

639
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,314
Very good.

640
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:42,875
You should master it by nightfall.

641
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:45,715
But

642
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:47,794
it's only six hours left.

643
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:49,594
I'll teach you.

644
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:52,074
Six hours are enough.

645
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:20,955
Receiving information through
the Million Books Transmission

646
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:22,155
only creates confusion

647
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:23,514
in my mind,

648
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:25,274
lest I truly understand them.

649
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,754
Cultivators should improve
their seven sensations and

650
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,875
five aggregates, sensation, perception,
mental activity, and consciousness

651
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,875
beyond ordinary levels.

652
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,235
Million Books Transmission

653
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,794
merely expands your hearing sense.

654
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,074
There are still many things to acquire

655
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:41,915
that go beyond

656
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:42,875
the common perception of mortals.

657
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,314
I see.

658
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,475
Learn

659
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:50,875
according to the method I taught you.

660
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,235
If you can master it

661
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,195
and study up
on the theoretical knowledge,

662
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,794
you can at least not fall asleep

663
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,834
during the lecture.

664
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,875
And when you return to Extreme Wind City

665
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:03,475
one month later,

666
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,475
your trip can be a fruitful one.

667
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:07,635
But if you can't persist,

668
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,955
the exit is over there.

669
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,634
All right, I'll learn.

670
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,275
It's a piece of cake.

671
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:13,875
Great.

672
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:16,194
I haven't been eating

673
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:17,915
a satisfying meal these days.

674
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:19,995
I'm looking forward to my dinner.

675
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:21,955
Priest.

676
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:23,435
What delicious food have you prepared?

677
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:26,435
Sit.

678
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:28,395
Thank you, Priest.

679
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,594
It's bland, though.

680
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:37,074
Priest, are you using this soup

681
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,034
to cook fish?

682
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:41,234
I don't eat meat.

683
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:42,955
If so,

684
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,674
have you prepared other ingredients?

685
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:47,315
There are many wild ginseng and mushroom
in the mountain.

686
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:48,634
Please pardon me,

687
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:49,714
I have no clue

688
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,995
about the new dish you're cooking.

689
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:04,835
Just this?

690
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,594
Rice with tea broth.

691
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,315
I didn't eat much in the morning.

692
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:11,355
This dish

693
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,395
isn't delicious enough.

694
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:18,435
I mean, it won't make me full.

695
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,554
This is the last dinner

696
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,114
served in Jiuyi Mountain.

697
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:25,755
I won't force you

698
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:27,355
to eat this.

699
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:28,835
No, I want to eat.

700
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,594
Otherwise, I won't have anything to eat.

701
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:37,034
Have you mastered
Million Books Transmission?

702
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,674
Your method is indeed

703
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:40,475
incredible.

704
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:42,915
No need to butter up.

705
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,714
What have you gained?

706
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:47,634
I just learned

707
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:49,275
that everything in this world

708
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,034
is maintained

709
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,154
through balance.

710
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:54,955
If we borrow strength from nature,

711
00:36:55,154 --> 00:36:56,795
we must return to it.

712
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,634
If we borrow time,

713
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:00,194
we must return to it too.

714
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,554
The more powerful and trickier
the magic techniques are,

715
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,074
the more damage they return
to the practitioners.

716
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:06,154
If one blindly uses the skills

717
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:07,355
without knowing the theory behind them,

718
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,275
they're very likely to suffer
from the backfire,

719
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:10,755
let alone achieve mastery.

720
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:12,554
There was once a senior practitioner,

721
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:14,315
whose power was about to disperse,

722
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:16,554
forcefully launched Celestial Assault,

723
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,755
which led up to his soul
being diminished into thin air.

724
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,634
A few days ago,

725
00:37:23,795 --> 00:37:25,875
I have offended you in class.

726
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,955
Thank you for enlightening me.

727
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,355
As long as you learn from your mistake.

728
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,074
The magic techniques of Kongsang
are profound and immeasurable.

729
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,154
If you encounter

730
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:39,315
anything you don't know,

731
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,835
you can ask me at any time.

732
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:43,114
Really?

733
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:46,355
As stated in Yunhuang Compendium,

734
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,554
there's a powerful Mind-reading Spell

735
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,835
that can decipher the thoughts
of the Kongsangs.

736
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:54,514
Do you know about this, Priest?

737
00:37:58,674 --> 00:37:59,514
Does that mean

738
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:03,355
he can read my mind too?

739
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:06,275
I know your character.

740
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:07,355
I won't use it on you.

741
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:17,275
Mischievous.

742
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,995
How come some words are missing?

743
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,114
I know you're not inferior to others.

744
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:23,475
And you can be good too.

745
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:25,755
So, I'm willing to enlighten you.

746
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:27,435
Is this a reward

747
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:29,514
for my hard work?

748
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:36,594
No, this is the reward.

749
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:39,514
Wonderful.

750
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,395
I have fish now.

751
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:56,554
This is mine.

752
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,234
Yummy. So yummy.

753
00:38:58,514 --> 00:39:00,114
That's my reward.

754
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,634
Lord Chong Ming.

755
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,955
Since you only like
to eat the fish head,

756
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:08,915
you can give me the fish meat.

757
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:09,714
No.

758
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,514
I can help you to search

759
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:15,234
for the pigments
of the gold balsam shade.

760
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,634
But I took the fish first.

761
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:24,315
Chong Ming.

762
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:24,835
Come on.

763
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:25,634
You can't reach me.

764
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:26,435
You're a divine bird

765
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,634
and you can catch any fish you want.

766
00:39:27,995 --> 00:39:28,395
Come on.

767
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:29,194
Stop right there.

768
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,034
You can't catch me.

769
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:31,074
You can't catch me.

770
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:52,114
(Father said)

771
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:54,034
(our eyes emit blue light)

772
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,594
(when they sense the existence
of the God of Dragon.)

773
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,755
(No wonder I always get giddy recently.)

774
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:02,875
(Does it mean)

775
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:04,674
(that the God of Dragon is around here?)

776
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:06,514
(I came here)

777
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:08,234
(two hundred years ago.)

778
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:10,034
(But I didn't sense anything like now.)

779
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,955
(By any chance,
the God of Dragon awakes soon?)

780
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,700
(Jiuyi Hall, the Emperor Valley)

781
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,580
(Eastern Creek of Jiuyi)

782
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:27,154
Is the place where
the God of Dragon rests

783
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:30,355
around Jiuyi Mountain?

784
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:51,355
Priest.

785
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:55,395
I have a gift for you.

786
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:04,154
Thank you for your tutelage.

787
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,674
This is my gift of being your disciple.

788
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,634
I just learned it from the books.

789
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,395
A stubborn stone can bow.

790
00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:21,475
This is the first step.

791
00:41:22,154 --> 00:41:24,154
You have already bowed to me

792
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:25,514
in the hall last time.

793
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,034
No need to do this again.

794
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:29,194
No, it's different.

795
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,074
Previously, I held grudges against you

796
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,714
and I wasn't convinced.

797
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,674
Today, I must sincerely

798
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,955
perform the bow to you

799
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,674
to show my sincerity.

800
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:39,795
You're just a nominated disciple.

801
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:41,835
You're leaving after one month.

802
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:43,435
Don't be so ceremonious.

803
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:45,275
Like you said

804
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,674
when you were reviewing
the bamboo slips.

805
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,634
"If I'm a Master for a month,

806
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:52,234
I'll fulfill my duty for a month."

807
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:55,995
Likewise, I'm now your disciple
for a month,

808
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:58,154
I shall serve you for a month.

809
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:05,435
Master,

810
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:07,795
allow me

811
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:10,074
to comb your hair.

812
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:12,795
Comb my hair?

813
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,674
Hair-combing is a tradition

814
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,395
in the disciple ceremony.

815
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:17,594
Hadn't you imparted me

816
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:19,875
with the Million Books Transmission,

817
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:21,315
I wouldn't have read about

818
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:23,915
the disciple ceremony and the speech

819
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,594
in the Four Virtues.

820
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:26,795
It's a tradition

821
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:27,915
in the ancient past

822
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,955
and has already been abolished.

823
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:32,835
That's why I must do it

824
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,875
to show my sincerity.

825
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:39,714
Please, master.

826
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,435
You owe me a wish, don't you?

827
00:42:45,674 --> 00:42:46,795
Well,

828
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,234
this is my wish now.
