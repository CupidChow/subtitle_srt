20

(should've been deranged
because of my trap.)

21
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,286
(He can only make up his mind)

22
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,406
(to take revenge
after experiencing this hardship.)

23
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:06,447
(How could he)

24
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,087
(look so calm?)

25
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,286
(Was there)

26
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,486
(anyone in the mountain)

27
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,047
(who helped him get through this?)

28
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:14,686
I just went

29
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,966
to worship your mother.

30
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:23,486
Ying,

31
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:25,766
after your mother died,

32
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,926
her name is not allowed
to be put on the epitaph.

33
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,047
You must seek justice

34
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,926
for her.

35
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:36,167
Your Supreme Majesty,

36
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,246
I've made a huge mistake.

37
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:39,407
And now,

38
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:40,686
I really can't disobey

39
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:41,607
Mother's order again.

40
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,287
I've made up my mind.

41
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,127
To practice magic techniques
wholeheartedly

42
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:48,047
and never enter Jialan again

43
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,646
as Mother wished.

44
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:51,766
Nonsense!

45
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,127
Didn't I already tell you?

46
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,407
That your mother said this
to you back then

47
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,086
was for the sake of your safety.

48
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,926
Shouldn't you

49
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,766
put your mother before everything else?

50
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:05,727
She died for you.

51
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,686
And you should fight for her sake.

52
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:09,766
But Your Supreme Majesty,

53
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,047
if I was controlled by hatred,

54
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,407
that would be the last thing

55
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,926
that my mother wished to see.

56
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:15,966
That would really fall short

57
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,447
of her expectations.

58
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:20,366
I've made up my mind.

59
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,287
Your Supreme Majesty,

60
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,127
please fulfill my wish.

61
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:30,686
Fine.

62
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:33,206
As you always stay
at the bottom of the valley,

63
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,086
you'll tend to chase a dead end.

64
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:36,766
On tomorrow's Grand Ceremony of Worship,

65
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:37,926
Immortal Records Official,

66
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,567
unfortunately, caught a cold.

67
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:40,686
In Jiuyi Mountain,

68
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,926
you're the one
with extravagant literary talent.

69
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,327
I command you

70
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,246
to go to the Water Mirror
of the Pavilion of Books tomorrow

71
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,847
to watch and record this ceremony.

72
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,646
Just consider it as getting
some fresh air outside the valley.

73
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:54,966
You can also

74
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,047
visit that younger brother of yours.

75
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:00,246
You should know

76
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,047
that he'll represent the Emperor

77
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:03,407
to join

78
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,167
this Grand Ceremony of Worship.

79
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:08,327
Yes.

80
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:14,686
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

81
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,806
High Priest of Grand Preceptor...

82
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,486
He asked me to attend
the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

83
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,806
Why don't you just pretend
to be sick and ask for a leave?

84
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:27,607
Did you forget

85
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,647
that the princess of the Crimson Clan is
still on the mountain?

86
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:30,847
I certainly remember it.

87
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,326
But if I don't go,

88
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,207
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
will get suspicious.

89
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,446
I'm afraid it'll be harder
to explain it by then.

90
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,207
There's some distance from the Hall

91
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,006
to the Pavilion of Books.

92
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,207
I won't run into her.

93
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,607
Chong Ming,

94
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:43,806
don't worry.

95
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,967
Since I've decided
not to see her again,

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,446
I won't change my mind.

97
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:49,207
Fine.

98
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,607
Now that her wish has been fulfilled.

99
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:52,806
If you meet her again,

100
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,366
be sure to erase her memories.

101
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,087
Make her forget about you.

102
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:56,686
So that

103
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,607
it can assure your safety.

104
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,446
High Priest of Grand Preceptor

105
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,566
asked you to attend
the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

106
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:05,847
But there are hundreds

107
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,126
of Immortal Officials in Jiuyi Mountain.

108
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,527
He chose you out of all the officials.

109
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,686
Why is that?

110
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:11,727
High Priest of Grand Preceptor
knew that Shi Yu and I share

111
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:12,886
a very deep bond.

112
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,366
Now that we haven't seen each other
for five years.

113
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,686
It's good to be able to see him

114
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,566
from far.

115
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:26,486
Yes.

116
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,886
I don't have the intention
to compete with others,

117
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,167
but if I keep backing down,

118
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,806
how could I face the people

119
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:34,967
who support me?

120
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:38,326
Guys!

121
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:39,806
Guys!

122
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:43,727
Guys!

123
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,047
Guys!

124
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:48,527
Guys!

125
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:50,326
Guys!

126
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:58,087
Put your head back.

127
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,006
Hold your breath in your stomach.

128
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,686
Empty your mind.

129
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,967
Breathe out and breathe in.

130
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,647
Make a sound with your throat.

131
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:11,926
Guys...

132
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:18,647
I can't believe

133
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,407
there's someone like me
in the world.

134
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,686
I...

135
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,407
Sorry.

136
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,727
I was just passing by.

137
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,006
I didn't know there was someone here.

138
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:34,126
It's all right.

139
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,767
I've always been funny.

140
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,167
Even I want to laugh at myself.

141
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,047
But

142
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,727
laughing is better
than pulling a long face.

143
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:40,886
Isn't it?

144
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,207
I've got the same book

145
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:49,446
like this.

146
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:51,647
Really?

147
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:54,607
Actually, I've got to give

148
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,767
a speech tomorrow.

149
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:57,287
I'm not ready yet.

150
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,326
In fact,

151
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:01,486
my father also wishes

152
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,287
that I could look graceful.

153
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:04,566
So he asked someone to find
these kinds

154
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:05,926
of secret books from the market.

155
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,607
Just that the writers
of these secret books,

156
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:09,686
most of them are eloquent,

157
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:10,926
and capable of dealing
with all people.

158
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:13,326
That's why they can't understand
our sorrow.

159
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,006
It's pointless to read them.

160
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:17,366
You're right.

161
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,047
You are not
from the Six Ministries, right?

162
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:26,407
I...

163
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:30,047
I live in the mountain nearby.

164
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:31,607
Well,

165
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:33,207
is your father going to test you

166
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:34,366
in public tomorrow?

167
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:35,926
Something like that.

168
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,207
Can you help me
come up with a plan?

169
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,886
I think

170
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,407
if I were you,

171
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,326
I'd feel better when someone was there

172
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,407
to go through this

173
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,607
with me.

174
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,047
This is a good idea.

175
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:50,926
Then, can you be

176
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:51,647
that person?

177
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:58,806
We are

178
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,366
mere acquaintances.

179
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,847
I'm not that important to you.

180
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:04,607
Don't you also wish

181
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,126
to be brave?

182
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:09,207
We can form an alliance

183
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,167
to encourage each other.

184
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:11,446
We can name

185
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:12,886
this alliance as

186
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:14,566
The Weaklings Alliance.

187
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:17,847
No,

188
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:19,727
that sounds bad.

189
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:21,647
Why don't we call it

190
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,207
The Nightwalkers Alliance?

191
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,207
The Nightwalkers Alliance.

192
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:27,366
I think

193
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,767
I'm like a person walking in the night.

194
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,246
Hoping that I could walk

195
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,886
until dawn.

196
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,527
This is my first time naming something.

197
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,367
Don't make fun of me,

198
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,887
if it sounds bad.

199
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:42,047
No.

200
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,047
This is your progress.

201
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:45,566
Really?

202
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,127
From now on,

203
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,647
we have to become braver.

204
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:57,326
From now on,

205
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,206
we have to become braver.

206
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,047
The recent small goal

207
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,367
that I've got to achieve is

208
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,206
to pass the test tomorrow.

209
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:07,726
The recent small goal

210
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,007
that I've got to achieve is

211
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:11,047
don't get bullied by others.

212
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,326
Does someone bully you?

213
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,287
Actually, it's not the others' arrogance

214
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,086
which can bully me

215
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:24,086
but my

216
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,647
gentle personality.

217
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:27,846
Then, I hope you can be confident

218
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,527
that you will not be bullied.

219
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,367
I also want you to trust yourself

220
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,726
that you can pass the test.

221
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,086
I'll get going.

222
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,367
Let me see you off.

223
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:45,566
It's not necessary.

224
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:47,527
If my father saw me

225
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,287
with an unknown man,

226
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,806
I'm sure he'd be furious.

227
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:07,407
Tomorrow,

228
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,407
you'll see me pass the test.

229
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:14,446
That's great.

230
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,446
Yes, it's beautiful.

231
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,287
She's enchanting.

232
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:29,767
I'm so envious.

233
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:49,247
Good.

234
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,887
Princess Xuelu dances gracefully

235
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:51,647
and looks gorgeous.

236
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,566
She is the best candidate
for Star Gazer.

237
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:54,647
Princess Xuelu deserves

238
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:56,566
to be the Star Gazer.

239
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:57,686
Princess Xuelu is

240
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:59,127
indeed a good dancer.

241
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,846
Since something went wrong with

242
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:02,966
Princess Xueying's dress,

243
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,647
the position of Star Gazer...

244
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,287
Granny.

245
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:08,407
Why is she here?

246
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,407
Sorry, Granny.

247
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:10,726
I'm late.

248
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:15,606
This dress...

249
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,206
The dress is remade.

250
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,047
Fortunately, I got Chong Ming's feather

251
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,326
that my mother left

252
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,407
as a decoration.

253
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:23,527
Granny,

254
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,407
can I be the Star Gazer?

255
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,726
Princess Xueying has been

256
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,086
disqualified due to her mistake

257
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:33,887
but she has amended it.

258
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:37,647
The two princesses are pretty even.

259
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:38,767
Let's do it this way.

260
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:39,606
Later,

261
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,487
we're going to meet Prince Shi Yu.

262
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,167
We'll let Prince Shi Yu

263
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,407
make the decision.

264
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:00,647
(Yuan,)

265
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:02,407
(I received a precious gift)

266
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,167
(at the mountain.)

267
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:04,647
(So you must find me)

268
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:05,966
(a peerless thing)

269
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:06,926
(to repay him.)

270
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,726
(Do not embarrass me.)

271
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:10,887
Keeper Yuan,

272
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,566
just get a good thing

273
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,566
from the residence as a return gift.

274
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:16,887
This is a trivial matter,

275
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,767
but it's very important to the princess.

276
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:20,606
It is the opening of Merfolk's market

277
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,007
that is only held once
in several months.

278
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:23,487
I can take this chance

279
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:24,487
to find a gift for Princess.

280
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,926
Thank you, Keeper Yuan.

281
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:38,768
(To Chi Yuan)

282
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,527
Princess,

283
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:48,287
I'll be sure to find you

284
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,127
a satisfying gift.

285
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,167
(Merfolk's Market)
Come, take a look.

286
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,527
(Merfolk's Market)
Come and take a look.

287
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:30,806
Great.

288
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:32,846
Come and take a look.

289
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,407
Take a look.

290
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,887
We have the conches and seashells
from the deep sea.

291
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:42,206
Come in and take a look.

292
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,846
Fresh conches and seashells.

293
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,527
Come and see.

294
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:58,487
Come, please.

295
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,326
Deep Sea Tridacna Wine Cup.

296
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,287
Millennial Black Coral Screen.

297
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:03,647
Please.

298
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:13,247
Good.

299
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,127
Nice.

300
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:18,887
Very well.

301
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:19,806
Fresh seashells.

302
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:20,846
Come and take a look.

303
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,926
Take a look at this.

304
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,806
Sir.

305
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,127
Come and take a look.

306
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:26,767
What do you think about this?

307
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,007
Come and take a look.

308
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,926
The Black Armor of Dark Clan
is well-renowned.

309
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,647
But it's breakable when it meets

310
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:35,887
our Whalebone Sword.

311
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:37,167
Dark Iron Torch

312
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,606
is personally made by Master.

313
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:40,767
Check it out.

314
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,326
Come and take a look.

315
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,326
Sir,

316
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,047
take a look at our Mermaid Silk.

317
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,326
It's very nice.

318
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:47,206
Madam,

319
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:48,846
do you have a better Mermaid Silk?

320
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:50,247
If you want,

321
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:51,887
I do have a piece

322
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,127
of prime Mermaid Silk.

323
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,647
This is woven with the deep-sea

324
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,367
Mermaid Silk from Biluo Sea.

325
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,007
I've kept it for a dozen years.

326
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:03,647
Look.

327
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,247
It's very precious, especially this kind

328
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,047
of golden silk.

329
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,326
It's comparable to Mingyue Silk.

330
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,206
This Mermaid Silk is
indeed extraordinary.

331
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:10,566
You have good taste.

332
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:14,206
Officer. Officer...

333
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:15,846
Officer.

334
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:19,086
This is outrageous.

335
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:19,726
Look.

336
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,127
Without our protection,

337
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,566
how are you going to do business?

338
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:23,767
Do it in your dream.

339
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:26,606
The marine force is here again.

340
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:27,367
Look.

341
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,487
This is too much.

342
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:30,487
Marine force?

343
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:31,726
Over the years,

344
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,966
the God of Dragon has been lurking
and the Sea Emperor hasn't emerged.

345
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,326
When they run out
of military expenditures,

346
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:36,487
they'll come and ask

347
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,167
for money from their kinsmen.

348
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:39,527
Yes.

349
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,767
This Mermaid Silk is really nice.

350
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:42,446
Officer.

351
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:42,966
What a nice thing.

352
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:43,446
Officer.

353
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,686
You can't do this, Officer.

354
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:45,367
Take it away.

355
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:46,647
Don't do this, Officer.

356
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:47,926
I beg of you.

357
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,606
No, Officer.

358
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,206
This is everything I've got.

359
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:53,647
We take your stuff

360
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,606
to let you contribute
to the Merfolk Clan.

361
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:56,527
Be sensible

362
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:57,487
and get up.

363
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:58,487
I beg of you.

364
00:15:58,647 --> 00:15:59,086
Get lost.

365
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,487
No, Officer.

366
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:04,206
Get out of the way.

367
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:05,767
What are you looking at?

368
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:07,326
Move aside.

369
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:08,606
All of you, move aside.

370
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:09,767
Forget it.

371
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,446
Let's go.

372
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,527
Madam, come, be careful.

373
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,167
Keep this.

374
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,326
These golden pearls

375
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:21,167
should be enough

376
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,566
for that Mermaid Silk.

377
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:24,806
No.

378
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:25,606
That Mermaid Silk

379
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,247
has been stolen by those thieves.

380
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,206
I can't accept your money.

381
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,086
I've seen

382
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:31,287
its luminous glow.

383
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:32,767
And I know it's worth the money.

384
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:33,926
That'll be enough.

385
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,047
I can't take it.

386
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,606
Sir, I can't.

387
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:38,247
(What a shame.)

388
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,527
(I've got to find
another gift for Princess.)

389
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:43,287
Wait, sir.

390
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,527
This is my token of appreciation.

391
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,407
Please take it.

392
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:58,966
Thank you, Madam.

393
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:12,247
Lord.

394
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:13,287
Lord.

395
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,487
You're Lord Left Envoy, aren't you?

396
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:16,806
I am Shi Tou.

397
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,406
You saved me back then.

398
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:20,767
You've got the wrong person.

399
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:22,886
Lord.

400
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,727
I'll never forget your silhouette.

401
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,366
The marine force has changed.

402
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,086
They often

403
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,487
come and disturb us.

404
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:30,166
You can't just let them do this.

405
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,326
I told you.

406
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:36,967
I'm not him.

407
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:40,767
Are you really not him?

408
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:41,886
Dad, are you all right?

409
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:42,447
Ruyi.

410
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,086
Ruyi, why are you here?

411
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,086
He's telling the truth.

412
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,166
He will turn around for sure

413
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,606
when he hears the name of Ruyi.

414
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:54,727
Back then,

415
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,447
he was known as Tearless Lone Star.

416
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,886
When he saw someone bullying
his kinsmen,

417
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,287
he'd execute him right away.

418
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,566
He'd never let him

419
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:04,767
continue to do evil.

420
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,047
Greetings, Your Highness Shi Yu.

421
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,606
(Why is he here?)

422
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,328
(Shi Yu, Prince of Kongsang)

423
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,086
Greetings, Your Highness Shi Yu.

424
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:38,566
Please rise.

425
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,606
Thank you, Your Highness.

426
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,007
As Father is busy with public affairs,

427
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,287
so he sends me here

428
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:46,566
to worship the ancestors
and pray on his behalf.

429
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:49,487
Your Highness,

430
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:50,767
the ceremony is around the corner.

431
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,047
And these two princesses from Bai Family

432
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,207
are even.

433
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:56,166
They're both the top candidates
for the position of Star Gazer.

434
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,086
I dare not to make the decision.

435
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,846
So you're requested
to make the decision.

436
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,527
Princess Xuelu, Princess Xueying.

437
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:13,326
Are both of them

438
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,166
the legitimate princesses
of Bai Family?

439
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:16,207
Your Highness,

440
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,727
Princess Xuelu is not
a legitimate princess.

441
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:19,487
But

442
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,886
she indeed has
remarkable dancing skills.

443
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,047
According to the ancestral system,

444
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,207
the Star Gazer should be

445
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:27,886
held by
Bai Family's legitimate daughter.

446
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,287
Just follow the ancestral system.

447
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,646
Yes.

448
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:43,646
Princess Xuelu,

449
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:45,287
I made this decision

450
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,326
due to the unchangeable
ancestral system.

451
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:48,967
It's not because I'm biased
against your bloodline.

452
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:50,727
You're pretty and brilliant.

453
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,166
I'm sure you'll have another chance.

454
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:54,606
Yes.

455
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:56,447
Thank you, Your Highness.

456
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:11,646
Your Highness,

457
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,527
the three-day fasting is over.

458
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:14,566
The auspicious time has come.

459
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,406
The ritual can start now.

460
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:19,086
His Highness didn't pick you
as the Star Gazer.

461
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,166
But obviously,

462
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:21,326
he's impressed with you.

463
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,047
Rather than obtaining this title,

464
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:24,967
winning the favor of His Highness

465
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,166
is more important.

466
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:50,646
The load that the earth carries

467
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,967
includes everything
in all corners of the world.

468
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,527
It's lighted by the sun and the moon

469
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,247
while the stars circle around it.

470
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,646
Four Seasons includes Spring,
Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

471
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,846
And the orbit of the planet records
the time of year.

472
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:04,487
Everything is created
by the divine spirit.

473
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,967
Only the saint can understand the truth.

474
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,086
Pray.

475
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,886
The prince is requested to give
a speech on behalf of the Emperor.

476
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:52,247
(Shi Ying,)

477
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,326
(I want you to watch)

478
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:56,406
(the reverence that had belonged to you)

479
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,047
(being occupied by Shi Yu.)

480
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:02,487
Hundreds of rivers...

481
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:08,927
Hundreds of rivers...

482
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:24,207
Your younger brother
is way worse than you.

483
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,047
Don't underestimate him.

484
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:27,687
He can do it.

485
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,326
I also want you to trust yourself

486
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:36,527
that you can pass the test.

487
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,527
Hundreds of rivers are like mirrors.

488
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:44,406
The world is bright.

489
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,287
Be devout and watch the night.

490
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:48,126
Be solemn in the court.

491
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,487
Be respectful and act with courtesy.

492
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:50,846
The descendants welcome the Gods

493
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,366
with a dignified appearance.

494
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,007
The sacrificial offerings are prepared.

495
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:57,846
We've sincerely offered up a fast.

496
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,047
We treat our ancestors
with filial respect.

497
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,406
To worship them.

498
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:02,687
To express the sincerity of the Emperor.

499
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:04,007
It's all thanks
to the Emperor's clairvoyant.

500
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,447
He will forever be our role model.

501
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:06,727
Working hard to worship the ancestors.

502
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,007
As you've bestowed grace on us.

503
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:09,487
Thanks for your blessings.

504
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,806
The people are able to live peacefully.

505
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,047
The kingdom is well established.

506
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:13,527
So the country can be stable.

507
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,767
This ritual is
to show our respect to you.

508
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,287
We must enjoy the ceremony.

509
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:17,527
Every worshipper

510
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:19,366
will be blessed.

511
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:23,047
Praying to the immortals,
divines and ancestors.

512
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,366
Please bless Kongsang

513
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:27,727
with prosperity and peace.

514
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:34,646
With prosperity and peace!

515
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:37,247
How did he do?

516
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:38,806
This kid is good, isn't he?

517
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,687
And he's charming.

518
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:42,927
He's no match for you.

519
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,406
Let alone me.

520
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,166
Objectively speaking,

521
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:48,967
no one there is prettier than me.

522
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,086
Of course.

523
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,646
But they

524
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:55,406
are the flip-floppers who used

525
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,126
to accuse and abandon you.

526
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,166
They don't deserve to see

527
00:23:58,326 --> 00:23:59,166
my beautiful face.

528
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:00,527
I won't show up.

529
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:01,247
This is their punishment

530
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,487
for being senseless.

531
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,967
This doesn't trouble me anymore.

532
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:06,007
And you

533
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:08,207
don't have to keep it in mind either.

534
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:10,687
Music.

535
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,126
Start the dance.

536
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:18,767
That...

537
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:19,566
That...

538
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,326
Isn't that my feathers?

539
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:22,846
How dare she use it to make a dress?

540
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,047
She even gave it to someone else.

541
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:30,326
(How could she have
Chong Ming's feathers?)

542
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,447
(Was Ying)

543
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,566
(really hiding someone that day?)

544
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:35,606
(It was Bai Xueying.)

545
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:37,287
(It was also her who helped)

546
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:39,366
(Ying overcome his fear.)

547
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,566
I was too careless.

548
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,126
If the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
notices it,

549
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,806
he'll surely get suspicious.

550
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:47,687
What should I do?

551
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:50,366
Under the circumstances,
this is the only way.

552
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,086
Your spiritual power
hasn't recovered yet.

553
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:57,126
You must act quickly.

554
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:58,366
Or your cover will be blown.

555
00:25:58,886 --> 00:25:59,767
Do you hear me?

556
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:15,886
Zhu Yan.

557
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:19,727
Zhu Yan.

558
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,287
Lord Immortal Official.

559
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:22,566
Why are you here?

560
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,527
Before the dance ends,

561
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:25,007
try to approach the Star Gazer.

562
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:26,007
I...

563
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,846
Don't talk, just do as I told you.

564
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:29,767
I can do it.

565
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:30,806
But why?

566
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:31,927
I don't have time to explain.

567
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:32,846
Go break one

568
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:33,727
of Chong Ming's feathers.

569
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,806
I'll try my best.

570
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:41,406
Right now.

571
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:09,927
Lord Immortal Official.

572
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:18,487
Lord Immortal Official.

573
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,566
Yan, are you all right?

574
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,007
I'm fine.

575
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:16,566
I just sprained my ankle.

576
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:26,886
Xueying,

577
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,846
you danced beautifully just now.

578
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:41,566
Luckily, you came back in time.

579
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:42,606
From my viewpoint,

580
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,727
you don't have to wait until 18.

581
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:44,646
The Princess of Crimson Clan

582
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,806
has immediately brought you the doom.

583
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,086
She is a calamity.

584
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,406
That's not going to happen again.

585
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,287
I hope that the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
won't get suspicious.

586
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,606
Have you ever erased her memory?

587
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:58,566
What she wishes for

588
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,487
is not your feathers.

589
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:02,606
What?

590
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:12,646
Ladies, you've worked hard.

591
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:14,326
Especially the princess of Bai Family.

592
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:20,366
Princess Xuelu.

593
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,646
You're a wonderful dancer.

594
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:25,487
Thank you, Your Highness.

595
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:26,727
I'm really envious of you.

596
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:27,886
Yes.

597
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:28,487
Prince Shi Yu has

598
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:29,287
a real eye for talent.

599
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:30,047
Are you all right?

600
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:06,727
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

601
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:08,287
Princess Xueying,

602
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:10,166
this is

603
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,047
a dazzling dress.

604
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:14,366
I wonder where you got it.

605
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,806
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

606
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,287
it's a dress
that my deceased mother left

607
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:20,806
for me.

608
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:24,767
Chong Ming's feathers are very precious.

609
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:25,646
It's a tribute to the palace.

610
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,326
How did your mother get it?

611
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:30,126
Well...

612
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:31,047
(Yan said)

613
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,247
(I can't tell anyone about it.)

614
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:33,967
I didn't ask her this before.

615
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:35,447
Or

616
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:37,646
did someone who declined
to be identified

617
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:38,727
give it to you?

618
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:40,287
Well,

619
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,126
what do you mean by that?

620
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:43,806
This dress was left for me

621
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:44,687
by my mother.

622
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:47,287
(Chong Ming did have a piece)

623
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,326
(of broken feather
that can't be used as tribute.)

624
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:50,687
(And it ended up in the civil society.)

625
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:53,646
(Did Concubine Bai buy it?)

626
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:56,806
(Did I think too much?)

627
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,207
Please go on.

628
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:05,927
High Priest of Grand Preceptor indeed

629
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:06,967
doesn't want others to know

630
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:08,126
about Immortal Official.

631
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:10,687
I nearly messed it up.

632
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:14,447
It's my fault

633
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,247
for not keeping my promise.

634
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,007
No wonder

635
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:19,846
he was so angry just now.

636
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,447
That he left without saying a word.

637
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:28,366
Put it on both sides.

638
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:29,366
Apply it all.

639
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,646
Yes, right.

640
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:33,047
Yan'er.

641
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,527
It hurts.

642
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:38,247
Didn't I tell you to be gentle?

643
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:39,767
Father.

644
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,247
- What are you doing here?
- Your Lordship.

645
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,646
There's a dispute between two heirs
in Jiuyi Mountain now.

646
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:46,767
The war is becoming imminent.

647
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,646
I'm afraid if we stay here...

648
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:51,487
Are you all right?

649
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:52,927
I'll be gentle.

650
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,126
We won't be spared.

651
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:55,967
Let's just

652
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,487
go home.

653
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:00,207
My foot is injured.

654
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,487
I can't afford to go down the mountain.

655
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:04,886
It's just a little sprain.

656
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:05,927
And you'll be in the carriage.

657
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:07,406
You don't need to walk.

658
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,767
Why can't we leave?

659
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,687
I'm severely

660
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,606
injured.

661
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,886
This is an old injury.

662
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:15,566
I was injured once

663
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:17,247
when I went down the mountain.

664
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:18,406
Right, Yufei?

665
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:20,487
Yes, Your Lordship.

666
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,047
Besides, I've been
busy practicing the dance

667
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,166
in these few days.

668
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:26,687
I've been

669
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,126
exhausted.

670
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,447
Now that my stomach aches a lot.

671
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:32,846
It makes me feel fatigued
and uncomfortable.

672
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,126
If I endure it and go down

673
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,767
the mountain with you,

674
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,287
I'll surely become violently ill.

675
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,287
I understand that your foot hurts,

676
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,646
but you know about my difficulties too.

677
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:44,447
White King is eager
to marry off his daughter.

678
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:45,727
And Azure King is eager
to establish a Crown Prince.

679
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:46,967
Both of them have nearly

680
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,207
fallen out with each other.

681
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,166
If I stay here,

682
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:52,406
they'll make me choose a side.

683
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,767
That would be nice if Mother was here.

684
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,846
She wouldn't leave me

685
00:32:58,366 --> 00:32:59,967
like you do.

686
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:03,287
Fine.

687
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,247
You may rest for one more day.

688
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:06,406
Tomorrow morning,

689
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:07,927
we'll leave.

690
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,606
Walk less.

691
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:27,967
These are gifts for the two princesses
of Bai Family

692
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,527
from Prince Shi Yu.

693
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:31,806
A pair of pearl earrings.

694
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,967
Thank you, Your Highness and Granny.

695
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:39,326
A silk flower.

696
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,727
Thank you, Your Highness and Granny.

697
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:49,927
Cuiliu,

698
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:50,846
let's go.

699
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,287
Where are you going?

700
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,007
I'm going to deliver medicines to Yan.

701
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,247
They said Princess Zhu Yan

702
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:57,687
didn't get any reward.

703
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:58,886
She is indeed a good sister

704
00:33:59,086 --> 00:33:59,727
of Princess Xueying.

705
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:00,207
Cuihe.

706
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,396
(The Emperor Valley)

707
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:23,086
Lord Chong Ming.

708
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,126
I'm here for Lord Immortal Official

709
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:26,086
to apologize.

710
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:28,527
I've been extra careful on my way here.

711
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:30,206
No one will see this.

712
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,286
It was my fault last time.

713
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,766
I shouldn't have given
the feather to someone else.

714
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,847
I nearly got Lord Immortal Official

715
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:42,606
into trouble.

716
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:44,766
But I'm here this time

717
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,527
to apologize to him in person.

718
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:49,246
Please let me see him.

719
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:51,047
(Just as I thought.)

720
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,047
(It's hard to get rid of this lady.)

721
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,007
(I might as well kill her and end this.)

722
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:58,367
Chong Ming.

723
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,407
Lord Immortal Official.

724
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,447
Stop.

725
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:03,566
I've told you

726
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,367
to stop entering the valley.

727
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:05,447
Why are you here?

728
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:07,566
I...

729
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:08,967
I'm here to apologize...

730
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:13,646
I'm here to apologize.

731
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,726
You know

732
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,206
that my foot is injured.

733
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,007
It really hurts.

734
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:24,327
Lord Immortal Official,

735
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,327
please let me finish what I want to say.

736
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,487
For the sake that I came
regardless of the pain I suffer.

737
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,686
You fell to your left side
when you danced.

738
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:35,967
Why is it your right foot
that got hurt?

739
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,166
Actually,

740
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,086
I fake my injury.

741
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,447
But I sincerely want

742
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,487
to apologize.

743
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,847
Because Xueying is my best friend.

744
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,487
I can't watch her being set up

745
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:57,206
and disqualified from taking
the position of the Star Gazer.

746
00:35:57,686 --> 00:35:59,766
That's why I gave her the feather.

747
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:00,887
Sorry.

748
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:03,447
I didn't give enough thought to that.

749
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,286
Fine.

750
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:08,766
Since you've come,

751
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:11,047
let's end this today.

752
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:14,807
What do you wish for?

753
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:15,967
Tell me.

754
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:17,726
I'll fulfill it.

755
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:20,686
My wish...

756
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:23,086
I want you

757
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:24,927
to be my master.

758
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,246
Is there really a magic spell

759
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:30,327
in the world

760
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,367
that can bring
the primordial spirit back together?

761
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:36,887
Are you trying to learn

762
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,047
Primordial Spirit-Gathering Spell?

763
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,527
How did you know that?

764
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:42,927
Did I tell you

765
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:44,086
about that when I first

766
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,206
met you?

767
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:47,566
I'm not a fool, Lord.

768
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:49,606
Besides,
I've learned magic techniques before.

769
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,047
Will you promise me that?

770
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,766
If you want to learn
this magic technique,

771
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,847
it means your understanding
of the magic technique

772
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,166
is shallow and frivolous.

773
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,527
Just like the apprentices
from the Six Ministries.

774
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:01,566
Men learn magic techniques

775
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,527
just for fame.

776
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:05,407
Women learn magic technique

777
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,047
just to keep up appearances

778
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:08,606
and marry a decent man.

779
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:09,686
I won't accept

780
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,086
this kind of disciple.

781
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,726
Just give up.

782
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:14,367
I didn't learn it

783
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:15,407
for fame

784
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:16,927
or to get married.

785
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:18,286
I...

786
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:21,606
I learn it for a person.

787
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,927
I've told you before.

788
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:24,967
It's that deceased

789
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,766
who died a wrongful death.

790
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,206
I'd like to learn this magic

791
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,566
to bring him back to life.

792
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:32,766
But back then,

793
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:33,847
everyone,

794
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:35,367
even High Priest of Grand Preceptor said

795
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:37,086
that there was no such magic
in the world.

796
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:38,686
So I thought

797
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,407
maybe only a hidden master

798
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:43,887
like you would teach me that.

799
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,007
I'd really like to revive him.

800
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:51,807
You want to revive him?

801
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:52,766
Yes.

802
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:54,967
You saved me once before.

803
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,327
So I thought

804
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:57,606
maybe you could bring

805
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:58,766
him back to life.

806
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,286
Lord, I beg of you.

807
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,766
Will you teach me the magic?

808
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:07,166
No.

809
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:12,407
They were right.

810
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:13,766
There's no

811
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:15,726
such magic in the world.

812
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,007
Lord.

813
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:21,646
Are you kidding me?

814
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,166
A word of advice.

815
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:24,166
Don't waste

816
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:25,246
your life

817
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:27,126
on a ridiculous thought.

818
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:30,527
No one is worth that.

819
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:34,807
No.

820
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,286
You don't have a clue.

821
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,447
He's worth it.

822
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,206
I can't grant this wish.

823
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:49,686
Tell me another wish.

824
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:54,166
Nothing else.

825
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:55,927
I don't have another wish.

826
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,927
This is my only wish.

827
00:38:58,807 --> 00:38:59,606
Very well.

828
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,967
Then, I'll give this back to you.

829
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,487
I hope

830
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:05,206
you won't come here again.

831
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,286
Are you sure
there is no such magic?

832
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,246
This time,

833
00:39:29,606 --> 00:39:30,887
I've made a resolute response.

834
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,527
I'm sure she won't come here again.

835
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:34,246
Chong Ming, you...

836
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:35,847
That's so touching.

837
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,967
It breaks my heart to hear that.

838
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:39,766
But as fate would have it.

839
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:41,887
Why must it be her?

840
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,766
(I'll go test her again.)

841
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,566
(If she still doesn't give up,)

842
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,047
(after I kill her,)

843
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,286
(I'll bury her well)

844
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:53,566
(in the soil.)

845
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:07,686
Princess.

846
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:11,407
Liu,

847
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:12,166
send this medicine

848
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,646
to Princess Zhu Yan.

849
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:16,246
I'd like to be alone.

850
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:18,246
But...

851
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:20,566
I can't always show Yan

852
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:22,007
my weak side.

853
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,447
She'll worry about me.

854
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:26,487
Yes.

855
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,007
Xueying.

856
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,007
Your Highness, why do you

857
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:25,166
take me here?

858
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:26,766
Are you mad

859
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,126
because I concealed my identity?

860
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:29,847
Or is it because of what happened today?

861
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,047
Neither.

862
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:34,086
Your Highness,
you've seen a lot of ladies.

863
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,887
It makes sense that you don't know me.

864
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:38,887
How could I not know you?

865
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:40,766
You are Bai Xueying.

866
00:41:41,606 --> 00:41:42,686
Bai is your family name.

867
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,246
Xueying is

868
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:45,807
your first name.

869
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:51,126
I've got something for you.

870
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:03,126
I know it doesn't look nice.

871
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,047
It's normal that you dislike it.

872
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,367
But

873
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:09,047
I made it myself.

874
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,086
Well,

875
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:23,246
today when we were in the Hall,

876
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:24,246
why did you...

877
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:26,047
I did that to protect you.

878
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:29,646
What kind of a reason is this?

879
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,166
Your father wants us
to get married sooner.

880
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:34,927
But my mother and uncle

881
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:35,847
don't want it.

882
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:37,086
If they know

883
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:38,047
we're in a relationship,

884
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:39,726
I dare not imagine...

885
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:43,527
Xueying,

886
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:46,126
we have to
keep our relationship a secret

887
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:47,726
and we can't see each other often.

888
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:50,206
But our oath is kept

889
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:51,807
in our hearts.

890
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:10,380
