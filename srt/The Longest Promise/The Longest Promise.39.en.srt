19
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:01,491
Master.

20
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:07,652
I have left the priesthood.

21
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:09,691
You don't have to
call me "Master" anymore.

22
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,212
Your Highness,

23
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,532
I should go too.

24
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:22,291
I'll go with you.

25
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,891
I left the priesthood

26
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,851
just to be with you.

27
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:27,492
No.

28
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:29,972
No, you can't.

29
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:31,932
Why not?

30
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:39,052
Is it because I killed Zhi Yuan?

31
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,291
No, it's not that.

32
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,291
Yuan already told me.

33
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,372
He didn't blame you

34
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,092
nor did he want me to blame you.

35
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:49,372
I said that

36
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,492
because I wanted you to spare his life.

37
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,291
Your Highness,

38
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,731
I don't know how you feel about me.

39
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,691
I didn't even realize

40
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,851
that my feelings for you had already...

41
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:11,372
So

42
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,411
it was because
of the tribulation prophesy.

43
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,092
I worry

44
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,131
I might do something foolish.

45
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,772
Does it still hurt?

46
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:15,731
Look.

47
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:19,692
I look perfectly fine
in front of you, right?

48
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,532
You may kill me

49
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:23,171
as prophesied.

50
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,291
But you're also the reason

51
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:27,371
I return to the mortal world.

52
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:29,132
Besides,

53
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,811
if I didn't have you in my heart,

54
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:32,452
like a guiding light in the dark,

55
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,171
I would have perished
during the Tribulations of Hell.

56
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,611
Just like when I lost control

57
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:38,532
in the stone chamber.

58
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:40,851
It was also because of you

59
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,532
that I was saved.

60
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:48,452
It shows everything can be changed.

61
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,332
But that was just a guess.

62
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:55,892
It's not the reality.

63
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:09,572
Yan'er,

64
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,452
is this a good enough reason?

65
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,692
Those who are destined for each other

66
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,611
can overcome any obstacles.

67
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:45,731
Yan'er.

68
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:47,772
From now on,

69
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:50,731
you can directly address me by my name.

70
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,731
This person is Wu Xian,
the chief of the Ten Sorcerers.

71
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,012
The Ten Sorcerers

72
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,692
don't refer to ten individuals,

73
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,811
but rather the supreme cultivators

74
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,731
of the Ice Clan led by Wu Xian.

75
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,132
Wu Xian is the chief
of the Ten Sorcerers.

76
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:22,212
If he doesn't die,

77
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:25,532
the Ten Sorcerers
can be established anytime.

78
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,491
Previously,

79
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,452
I thought Wu Xian was dead.

80
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:30,892
The Sage surrendered his life,

81
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,411
foiling the Ice Clan's conspiracy.

82
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,931
But now it seems that Wu Xian

83
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,371
can die and be reborn,

84
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,411
the Sage must still be
in the mortal world,

85
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,491
and his true identity holds
a profound mystery.

86
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:47,972
I was careless.

87
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,132
It seems that the Ice Clan

88
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,931
will surely rise again,

89
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,291
spreading chaos throughout Kongsang.

90
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:55,452
Your Highness,

91
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,572
you may have returned
to the mortal world.

92
00:06:58,012 --> 00:06:59,692
But no matter what happens
in the future,

93
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,092
Jiuyi Mountain

94
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:02,931
is willing to be the sword

95
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:03,931
and shield in your hands.

96
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:06,212
If you have any requests,

97
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:07,692
we shall answer.

98
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,332
Now that I've left the priesthood

99
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:15,652
and experienced
the Tribulations of Hell,

100
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,371
I no longer have any face

101
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:18,892
to trouble all of you

102
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:20,532
and disturb the peace of this mountain.

103
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:22,452
In the remaining years of my life,

104
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,892
I only wish to protect Yunhuang

105
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:26,371
and stay true to my heart.

106
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,092
The road ahead is long.

107
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:32,772
Please take care of yourself,
Your Highness.

108
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:35,811
Respected elders,

109
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:37,772
please take care as well.

110
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:09,731
Then let me help you once again.

111
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:20,692
I'm not a considerate teacher.

112
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:22,452
Cultivating as my disciple

113
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,132
will be hard work.

114
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:25,851
I'm not afraid of hard work.

115
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:27,611
You'll be very lonely.

116
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,171
No, I won't.

117
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,291
The valley was filled
with only the dead in the past,

118
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,371
you'll feel lonely by yourself.

119
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,172
But from now on,

120
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:37,172
I'll always accompany you.

121
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,052
So many things have happened

122
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,692
right in this Cultivating Hall.

123
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,172
You took me as your disciple.

124
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,131
It was the most correct decision

125
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,052
I've made in my life.

126
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,011
It's also the luckiest thing

127
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,131
that has ever happened to me.

128
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,531
Chong Ming,

129
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,212
what are your plans for the future?

130
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:30,651
Are you willing

131
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,212
to join us on our journey?

132
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:34,812
No.

133
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,771
I'm the majestic divine bird

134
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:40,891
of Jiuyi Mountain,

135
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,212
entrusted with the duty
of maintaining peace.

136
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,011
I can't simply leave my post

137
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:45,292
and accompany you down the mountain.

138
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,092
I'm not one irresponsible bird.

139
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:50,972
Zhu Yan,

140
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,531
you're leaving tomorrow, right?

141
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:58,172
After you descend the mountain,

142
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,412
you must take good care of Ying,

143
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:01,412
understand?

144
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,771
Aren't you coming with us?

145
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,851
From the moment I first saw you,

146
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:14,131
I knew you would take Ying away

147
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:15,891
from me.

148
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,212
But as long as he's happy,

149
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:21,812
then my wish is also

150
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:24,771
fulfilled.

151
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,771
What's there to cry about?

152
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:33,491
From now on,

153
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:37,092
if you dare to harm Ying one bit,

154
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:38,052
I'll

155
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,731
fly to Extreme Wind City

156
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,332
and settle scores with you.

157
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:44,812
Do you hear me?

158
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,251
Yes.

159
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,251
You have to take good care
of yourself too.

160
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,052
We'll miss you.

161
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:05,452
What are you saying?

162
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,212
I'll always be your friend.

163
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:09,611
If you need anything,

164
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:11,972
remember to come to me for help.

165
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:17,172
Oh,

166
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:19,812
don't tell Ying

167
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,292
that I cried.

168
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:22,611
It's too embarrassing.

169
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,531
Go down the mountain happily.

170
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,851
Don't tell Ying that I cried.

171
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,292
You're the most beautiful divine bird
I've ever known.

172
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:42,972
We'll miss you.

173
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:50,412
Chong Ming...

174
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:51,251
You've been nagging at us

175
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,212
on the mountain for so long.

176
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,212
I've grown tired

177
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,572
of your icy demeanor

178
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:57,611
after all these years.

179
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:58,851
And

180
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,812
you never listen to advice.

181
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,491
You don't even care
about your own health.

182
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,452
I've become like an old woman,

183
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,052
nagging every day

184
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,332
that I got wrinkles from it.

185
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,131
Hurry and go down the mountain.

186
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:12,251
I've already...

187
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:23,692
There, there.

188
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,131
You're a grown man.

189
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,011
Don't act so fussy.

190
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,611
I'm leaving now.

191
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,572
Don't miss me too much.

192
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:44,812
Shi Ying,

193
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,412
are you really not
taking anything with you?

194
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,011
When I came to Jiuyi Mountain,

195
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,011
I had nothing.

196
00:12:58,131 --> 00:12:59,531
So when I leave Jiuyi Mountain,

197
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,812
I should also leave with empty hands.

198
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:07,332
Jiuyi Mountain

199
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,812
has brought you to me,

200
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:11,851
and we walk together side by side

201
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,172
in the mortal world.

202
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,371
I am already content.

203
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:48,851
After the infiltration of Yin energy,

204
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,251
it should be responded to
within nine days

205
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,812
with spiritual power and artifacts

206
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,452
that correspond to the five elements

207
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,052
to protect the meridians

208
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,412
and preserve the senses.

209
00:13:59,212 --> 00:13:59,731
Yan'er,

210
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,692
the nine-day period has passed.

211
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,452
This method is no longer effective.

212
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:07,812
It's okay.

213
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:10,412
I'm gradually getting used to it.

214
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,731
If one missed the optimal timing,

215
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:22,251
they can only rely on their will and fate.

216
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,251
The desire of the heart

217
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,771
can surpass insurmountable obstacles.

218
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:29,771
Where the will is strongest,

219
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,131
even a withered tree
can bloom in spring.

220
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,052
What does this mean?

221
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:37,812
If I'm not mistaken,

222
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:39,371
it suggests

223
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,731
that the strongest desire in your heart

224
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,011
can break through

225
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:43,651
the barrier of energy
from the realm in-between.

226
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,531
The strongest desire?

227
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,452
It's not the real...

228
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,452
No wonder on that day,

229
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,011
when we were in the forest,

230
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,491
I sensed something.

231
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:07,812
That day with me?

232
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,972
Do you have any other wishes?

233
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:19,771
What I mean is,

234
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,092
perhaps we can use the same method

235
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,771
to help you regain your sense
of taste and touch.

236
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,251
Other than that,

237
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:30,371
it seems there's nothing else.

238
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,212
I'm not saying that I want to...

239
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:37,891
No, that's not it.

240
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:40,371
I'm saying I only want to be with you...

241
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:42,292
No, no.

242
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,052
I'm not saying that I'm thinking...

243
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:46,932
Then what do you want the most?

244
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:49,011
I...

245
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:51,172
Yan'er,

246
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,651
what you desire in your heart

247
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:56,891
is also my heartfelt wish.

248
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:18,692
Yan'er,

249
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:20,771
rest assured.

250
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,332
I'll definitely help you

251
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:24,611
regain your senses.

252
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,371
It's all right.

253
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:33,491
I...

254
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:35,692
What I want the most now

255
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:37,452
is to return to Extreme Wind City

256
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,611
and see my father and my mother.

257
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,572
They must be worried sick.

258
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:43,011
Perhaps,

259
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:43,891
I'll eat a serving

260
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:44,972
of Yanfeng Restaurant's boiled lamb

261
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,731
or smell the wind of Western Huang.

262
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:47,851
That should heal me.

263
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:56,891
Bai Fenglin,

264
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,851
you colluded with the Merfolk

265
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:00,891
and leaked military intelligence.

266
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,572
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

267
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:04,652
I admit my guilt.

268
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,091
Bai Fenglin committed treason
and betrayed the country.

269
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,051
His crime is unforgivable.

270
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:13,091
Throw him into the dungeon
to be executed in autumn.

271
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:14,731
Bai Jing'an shall be stripped
of his royal title

272
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:15,731
and be demoted to a commoner.

273
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:16,652
Bai Xuelu.

274
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:19,692
Your Majesty,

275
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,452
Bai Xuelu is my future bride.

276
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,452
She may be Bai Fenglin's younger sister.

277
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:26,452
But she's not associated with him.

278
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,972
If she's implicated because of her clan,

279
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:31,372
I'm willing to take the punishment
on her behalf.

280
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:35,531
Take the punishment on her behalf?

281
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:40,172
Are you willing to be demoted

282
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:42,452
and imprisoned in her place?

283
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:44,412
Yes.

284
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:51,932
I'm willing to share

285
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:55,132
any punishment sentenced to Xuelu.

286
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,291
Very well.

287
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,652
I shall grant your request.

288
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:03,531
Bai Xuelu,

289
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:06,771
you acted with great righteousness,
not showing favoritism to your clan.

290
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,692
I hereby bestow you
the title of White Queen.

291
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:17,491
I humbly accept your decree.

292
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,251
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

293
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:25,871
I have

294
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:27,852
another request.

295
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,652
Let's hear it.

296
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,692
I would like to retrieve
my mother's memorial tablet

297
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,011
and bring it back
to White King's Residence.

298
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,132
Permission granted.

299
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:43,932
You may rise.

300
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:46,372
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

301
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:53,612
Your Majesty,

302
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,852
as a guilty subject,
I also wish to atone for my sins

303
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,571
and expose the traitors
within our country.

304
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:01,811
It was my foolishness

305
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,852
and eagerness for redemption

306
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:05,091
that led to my tragic mistake.

307
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,811
But there is someone...

308
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:09,291
No,

309
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,331
to be precise, an entire clan

310
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:14,892
that has colluded with the Merfolk

311
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,251
and even sheltered the Sea Emperor

312
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,372
for two hundred years.

313
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:22,452
The Crimson King, Zhu Gaozhao

314
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,531
and Princess Zhu Yan

315
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,932
have committed heinous crimes
deserving of extermination.

316
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,051
During the war,

317
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,132
I extracted the portrait
of the Sea Emperor

318
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,612
from a captive
of the Merfolk marine force.

319
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,291
We sent someone to Extreme Wind City

320
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,331
to confirm his identity.

321
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:36,372
The Sea Emperor

322
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,251
is none other than Zhi Yuan,
the keeper of the Crimson Residence.

323
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:41,011
For two centuries,

324
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:42,612
he has been hiding
within the Crimson Residence,

325
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,692
having a close relationship
with Princess Zhu Yan.

326
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:45,652
This is known to all in Western Huang.

327
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,091
The evidence and witnesses are abundant.

328
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,091
I urge you to thoroughly investigate
the relationship

329
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,331
between the Merfolk marine force
and the Crimson Clan.

330
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,491
We must not foster a threat
within our midst.

331
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,360
(Extreme Wind City)

332
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:12,811
Master, look!

333
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:22,491
Yan'er,

334
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:23,811
look at that.

335
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,331
Yan'er,

336
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,771
you've lost so much weight.

337
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:42,852
Here.

338
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,811
This is your favorite milk pudding.

339
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:47,652
Eat more.

340
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:49,531
Thank you, Mother.

341
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:03,051
It's really delicious.

342
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:04,692
Mother,

343
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,132
you made this, right?

344
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:08,731
Home is still the best.

345
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,091
I really wish

346
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:12,051
I can keep staying by your side

347
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,612
and eat the food you cook.

348
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,531
Silly girl.

349
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,291
Why are you saying such silly things?

350
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:20,091
Don't you want to get married?

351
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:28,452
Your Highness,
please help yourself first.

352
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:32,932
I don't deserve this, Your Highness.

353
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,091
Your Highness,

354
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:40,132
my daughter has been under your care
for so many years.

355
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,372
This time, you even traveled a long way

356
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:42,811
to send her back to Extreme Wind City.

357
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,491
I'll drink this as a respect.

358
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,132
If Your Highness can't handle

359
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,372
the strong liquor of Western Huang,

360
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,731
I'll instruct them

361
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:01,852
to serve tea instead.

362
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:03,051
No need to trouble yourself.

363
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,251
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

364
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:09,172
I'll drink it.

365
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,291
Shi Ying is not good at drinking.

366
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:14,892
Let me drink on his behalf.

367
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,172
Yan'er,

368
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,051
what are you doing?

369
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:23,892
Yan'er,

370
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:24,652
stop messing around.

371
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,412
I apologize on my daughter's behalf.

372
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:29,692
His Highness is a dignified prince.

373
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:31,091
How dare you address him by his name

374
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,612
and even snatch His Highness's drink.

375
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:33,731
That's too presumptuous.

376
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:36,852
Please have a seat, Crimson King.

377
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:38,731
It's my fortune that Yan'er helped me

378
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:39,652
out of a predicament.

379
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:40,771
She was not being presumptuous.

380
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:43,932
Please sit.

381
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,051
Yan'er and I share
the same affection for each other

382
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,251
and have experienced life
and death together.

383
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:49,452
Actually,

384
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:50,692
I've prepared a betrothal gift

385
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,011
according to the customs
of the Crimson Clan.

386
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:09,652
Crimson King.

387
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:10,972
Crimson Consort.

388
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,172
I request that Yan'er
be betrothed to me.

389
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:17,571
I do.

390
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:25,212
Your Highness,

391
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:26,771
Yan'er has been willful

392
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:28,811
because we've spoiled her
too much in the past.

393
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,932
If she has done anything wrong,

394
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,172
please let us know.

395
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:33,731
We'll discipline her strictly

396
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:36,571
and make sure she changes
all her bad habits before getting married.

397
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:37,811
Father.

398
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:39,571
Yan'er is fine just the way she is.

399
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:41,091
No need to change.

400
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:48,452
Yan'er

401
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:50,452
has been opposing

402
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,172
the arranged marriage we set for her.

403
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:55,652
As her mother,

404
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:57,612
I had my suspicions

405
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:59,892
that there must be someone

406
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:02,811
she deeply loves in her heart.

407
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,972
I never expected that person
to be Your Highness.

408
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,212
As parents,

409
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,251
our greatest wish

410
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:25,172
is for our daughter
to be safe and happy.

411
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:29,051
We're willing to entrust Yan'er to you.

412
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:33,132
May you protect her for a lifetime.

413
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,652
I'm willing to be with Yan'er
like the Gong and Shang Stars,

414
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:38,011
unwavering in this love,

415
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:39,412
never apart in this lifetime.

416
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,011
I'm willing to be with Shi Ying
like the Gong and Shang Stars,

417
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,212
unwavering in this love,

418
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,051
never apart

419
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:51,291
in this lifetime.

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,880

You are the prince.

425
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:21,652
Don't we need to get approval

426
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,892
from His Majesty of our marriage?

427
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,091
As long as you agree,

428
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,571
no one can stop us

429
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,372
from being together.

♪When this life reaches its end♪

431
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:35,731
I wonder what our wedding feast

432
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,251
will be like.

433
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:39,972
As long as it's something you like,

434
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:41,771
I'll help you make it happen.

435
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,531
At that time, I want

436
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:46,892
to invite everyone
in Extreme Wind City

437
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:47,932
to come and celebrate.

438
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:49,771
After all,

439
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:50,612
they've watched me grow up.

440
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:52,011
All right.

441
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,132
I'll invite Xueying,

442
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,091
Shi Yu,

443
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:57,132
Qing Gang,

444
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:58,251
and Xuelu.

445
00:25:58,731 --> 00:25:59,811
They probably didn't expect

446
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:02,291
that we would get married before them.

447
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:04,172
It's their fault for being so slow.

448
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:06,331
Yes,

449
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:07,731
it's their fault for being so slow.

450
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,291
We won't wait.

451
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,531
Then I'll also go to Yanfeng Restaurant

452
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:14,811
to discuss creating a menu

453
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,212
that suits you with Master Wu.

454
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,091
It's time for him to bring out
the 20-year-old Nv'erhong wine

455
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:20,412
he has been hiding.

456
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,172
Thank you for saving Sumo, my lord.

457
00:26:31,972 --> 00:26:33,091
Can you tell me

458
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:34,612
when Sumo will awaken?

459
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:37,452
This child

460
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:40,051
is indeed the one
you've been waiting for.

461
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:43,251
However, it's not the time
for his awakening.

462
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:45,932
Once he returns to the Biluo Sea,

463
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,571
I'll also enter a long period of hibernation,

464
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:51,852
to wait for his awakening
seventy years later.

465
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,731
When the Sea Emperor returns,
the God of Dragon awakens.

466
00:26:56,212 --> 00:27:00,172
When the God of Dragon awakens,
Biluo Sea will purge.

467
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:04,251
Unfortunately, it's not the time

468
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,652
for the fate of the Merfolk
to be fulfilled.

469
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:32,412
Yuan,

470
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,011
I've finally found happiness.

471
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:39,331
You'll wish me well,

472
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,011
right?

473
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:49,612
Yuan.

474
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,091
Did you send me your wishes

475
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,491
because you heard my voice?

476
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:09,291
(Why is the Evil Star shining again?)

477
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:11,372
(Could it be that the Sea Emperor
is still alive?)

478
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,612
The Merfolk marine force
may be in disorder.

479
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,051
But you're still the Sea Emperor

480
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,251
they've been waiting
for seven thousand years.

481
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:20,372
The Merfolk

482
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:22,251
will naturally obey you.

483
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:23,892
If you've made up your mind,

484
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:25,372
there's nothing

485
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:26,212
that you can't accomplish.

486
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:29,331
Unless

487
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:31,811
you're not the Sea Emperor at all.

488
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:35,652
Could it be that Zhi Yuan
is not the Sea Emperor?

489
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:37,972
He only schemed

490
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:40,251
to protect the true ruler of the Merfolk.

491
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:48,892
Step back! Step back!

492
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,491
Everyone, clear the way!

493
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:51,811
Drop your weapons!

494
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:00,932
The Crimson Clan

495
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,251
betrayed the grace of the Emperor,

496
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,692
acted rebelliously and recklessly,

497
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:07,051
and colluded with the Merfolk marine force

498
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,011
to hide the Sea Emperor, Zhi Yuan,
within the residence.

499
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:11,452
They are guilty of treason

500
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,452
and committed immeasurable crimes.

501
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:17,051
In the Battle of Zhaoyun Crossing,

502
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:18,932
the traitor Zhu Gaozhao
of the Crimson Clan,

503
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:22,172
together with his daughter Zhu Yan,
conspired against Kongsang

504
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:23,612
and colluded with the Merfolk.

505
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,452
Such intention deserves to be punished.

506
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:28,172
Azure King, Qing Gang

507
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:30,011
will escort the entire members
of Crimson Residence

508
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:32,051
to Jialan into custody
for further investigation.

509
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:34,172
By the order of the Emperor.

510
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:37,372
It's my fault

511
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:38,612
for implicating both of you.

512
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,132
It is true that Zhi Yuan once served

513
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,531
as a keeper in the Crimson Residence.

514
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,011
But no one among our clansmen knew

515
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:46,291
of his identity as the Sea Emperor.

516
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,452
He returned
to the Merfolk marine force only

517
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:49,892
after being expelled
from the Crimson Residence.

518
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,011
During his time in Extreme Wind City,

519
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:54,372
he had no contact with the Merfolk.

520
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:56,731
As for the incident at Zhaoyun Crossing,

521
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:58,132
it was my own decision,

522
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,132
unrelated to the Crimson Clan.

523
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:03,652
If Zhi Yuan is indeed the Sea Emperor,

524
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:05,731
as the Crimson King,
I can't shirk my responsibility.

525
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,652
Zhu Yan was young and naive,

526
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,251
deceived by wicked people.

527
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:10,491
Any blame or punishment

528
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,811
should fall solely on me.

529
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:12,892
Father.

530
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:16,331
What a loving father
and dutiful daughter.

531
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,491
Unfortunately,

532
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:19,612
this is a crime deserving
of the extermination of the entire clans.

533
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,612
The imperial decree clearly states

534
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:25,011
that the entire Crimson Clan

535
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:26,692
must be taken into custody
for investigation.

536
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:28,531
Guards.

537
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:29,771
- Yes.
- Yes.

538
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:30,652
Arrest her!

539
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:32,212
Yan'er.

540
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:32,771
Stop!

541
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:37,011
Your Highness.

542
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:38,811
Your Highness,

543
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,051
why are you here?

544
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:41,612
You have no authority
to pass any verdict

545
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:42,692
on behalf of His Majesty.

546
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,612
During their journey to Jialan,

547
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,612
they should not be harmed.

548
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,412
Of course, Your Highness.

549
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:49,852
Crimson King, Crimson Consort, please rise.

550
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:51,771
Yan'er.

551
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:55,132
Yan'er,

552
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,811
I'll personally explain the truth
to His Majesty.

553
00:30:58,692 --> 00:30:59,372
Wait for me.

554
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,160
(Memerial Tablet of Late Mother, Xizhu)

555
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:33,051
Mother,

556
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:35,612
I've brought you back
to the White Queen's Residence

557
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,051
in a dignified manner.

558
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:40,091
It's all right
if that man doesn't acknowledge you.

559
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,011
From now on,

560
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:44,412
the descendants of the White Clan

561
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:45,892
will all pay their respects to you.

562
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,291
The father and son brought this
upon themselves.

563
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:49,892
Their titles have been stripped off

564
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:52,692
and I have succeeded as the White Queen.

565
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,731
I'll be taking over the army.

566
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,011
Please protect me from heaven.

567
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:09,011
Your Majesty.

568
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:15,612
Ying,

569
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,612
let me take a good look at you.

570
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:20,091
You have finally returned.

571
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,452
I have wronged you

572
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,172
and your mother.

573
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:29,372
Your Majesty,

574
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,091
I have come

575
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:32,932
to discuss the matter

576
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:33,932
of Crimson Residence.

577
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,212
Back then, you wronged me and Mother.

578
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:40,491
Now, please don't make the same mistake

579
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:41,491
with Crimson Residence.

580
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:44,372
I already knew.

581
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:46,771
How could I not know

582
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,331
that the Princess of Crimson Clan
is someone you love?

583
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,051
You were willing to face

584
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,972
the Tribulations of Hell for her.

585
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,771
But the collusion
between Crimson Clan and Sea Emperor

586
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,932
has been widely discussed
both inside and outside the court,

587
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:00,212
and the evidence is overwhelming.

588
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:02,972
I can show leniency because of you.

589
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:06,652
But I can't spare the entire Crimson Clan.

590
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:07,892
Ying,

591
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,212
I promise

592
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:11,011
to spare Zhu Yan's life

593
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:13,331
alone.

594
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,132
Your Majesty,

595
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:16,932
do you think

596
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:18,051
everyone in the world

597
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:19,491
judges right from wrong

598
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:21,491
solely on emotions as you do?

599
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:23,731
If that were the case,

600
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,212
Zhu Yan wouldn't have to
surrender herself.

601
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:28,051
With her current strength,

602
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:31,172
she could easily take
the entire Crimson Residence and flee.

603
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:32,771
Forget about the dungeon,

604
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:34,932
there are only a few
in the entire Yunhuang

605
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:35,892
who can be her match.

606
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:38,291
The Merfolk leader Zhi Yuan,

607
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:39,412
who was present
during the siege of Ye City,

608
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,011
did serve as a keeper

609
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,011
in Crimson Residence.

610
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:45,972
But

611
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,852
he left Crimson Residence

612
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:49,612
before returning to the Merfolk.

613
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,692
Zhi Yuan has been attempting

614
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:53,172
to quell the conflict
between the Kongsang Army

615
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:54,852
and the Merfolk marine force,

616
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:58,652
and he was the one who signed
the ceasefire agreement with me.

617
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:00,932
In the end,

618
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:02,132
he even sacrificed

619
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:05,491
his life for the sake of peace.

620
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:08,732
Ying,

621
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,211
these are only your words.

622
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:13,051
It'll be hard to convince the mass.

623
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,011
Moreover, your relationship with Zhu Yan

624
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,372
is very close.

625
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:26,772
I'm guilty.

626
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,252
But I'm willing to guarantee it
with my life.

627
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:31,292
I'm only asking for a half-month period.

628
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,531
Your Highness, Princess Zhu Yan is here.

629
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:48,091
Yan'er,

630
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:51,211
you have suffered.

631
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:52,531
It's all right.

632
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:54,651
I'll personally explain

633
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:55,491
Yuan being the Sea Emperor

634
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,691
to His Majesty.

635
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:58,691
If he insists on the punishment,

636
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,171
I'll bear it alone.

637
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,812
During the fight
at Xinghaiyun Pleasure House,

638
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:06,651
Zhi Yuan had already made up his mind
to sacrifice himself for a just cause.

639
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,211
While I know he has a noble character,

640
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,892
I had a mission that day.

641
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:13,772
I...

642
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:14,491
I understand.

643
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:18,611
You and Zhi Yuan

644
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:20,011
are the protectors of Kongsang
and the Sea Kingdom.

645
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:21,892
It's your responsibility.

646
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:23,852
At that time,

647
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:26,211
I oversimplified things.

648
00:35:28,812 --> 00:35:29,772
But Zhi Yuan

649
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,372
was not the Sea Emperor at all.

650
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:35,211
Look,

651
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:37,972
the Evil Star has appeared again.

652
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:40,252
And that day,

653
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,772
I mistakenly killed an innocent person.

654
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:46,412
Yuan was not the Sea Emperor?

655
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,171
Someone else is the Sea Emperor?

656
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:54,611
But now, you no longer have any power.

657
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:58,171
I won't go after

658
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:00,412
the Sea Emperor's life anymore.

659
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:03,732
Even one person's life

660
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,091
can be influenced by countless forces.

661
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,852
Let alone the fate of a country.

662
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:11,571
Yan'er,

663
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:13,171
according to the prophecy,

664
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,051
you are the cursed lady for me.

665
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:16,691
But in the end,

666
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:18,691
you also saved me.

667
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:20,611
It shows

668
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:22,932
that everything is within our control.

669
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:25,852
You're right.

670
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,091
Since we were able

671
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:29,732
to change destiny once,

672
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:31,812
then we can change it countless times.

673
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:35,412
With you by my side,

674
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,211
I fear nothing.

675
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,972
I refuse to believe that Kongsang
and the Sea Kingdom

676
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:42,252
cannot coexist peacefully.

677
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:47,932
I'm sure the person Zhi Yuan
sacrificed himself to protect

678
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:49,892
is not an evil person

679
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,691
who will cause bloodshed in Kongsang.

680
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:53,892
Yan'er,

681
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:56,131
I've obtained a half-month time
from His Majesty.

682
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,372
Let's go to Cangwu Abyss

683
00:36:58,452 --> 00:36:59,252
to meet the God of Dragon.

684
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:00,892
Perhaps the God of Dragon

685
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,171
can help us.

686
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:04,372
All right.

687
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:13,972
The two divine rings

688
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,812
are now under my control.

689
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,171
With the combined power
of the dual rings,

690
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:19,571
I'll destroy the world!

691
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:21,892
I can use

692
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:23,252
the power of the world

693
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:25,611
to instantly annihilate

694
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:27,131
the entire Yunhuang.

695
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:28,091
Then

696
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:30,491
I'll lead all of you

697
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,211
to establish a new Yunhuang

698
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:34,211
on this wasteland.

699
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:37,691
My Lord, we pledge our lives
to follow you!

700
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:40,932
In this lifetime,

701
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,171
without regrets or hesitations.

702
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:45,611
May this mountain and sea

703
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:47,972
be boundless.

704
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,051
In this lifetime,

705
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,252
without regrets or hesitations.

706
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:55,571
May this mountain and sea

707
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:56,772
be boundless.

708
00:37:58,332 --> 00:37:59,732
In this lifetime,

709
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:00,892
without regrets or hesitations.

710
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:01,812
My Lord,

711
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,972
has there been a flaw in our plan?

712
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:06,011
Dragon Soul Seal!

713
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,491
This is Dragon Soul Seal!

714
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:08,812
Bai Wei!

715
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,051
Darn you, Bai Wei!

716
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,531
You were worried the rings
will fall into my hands.

717
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:13,892
So you cast a seal

718
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:15,292
on Houtu!

719
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,571
My Lord, what should we do now?

720
00:38:17,651 --> 00:38:18,211
Now,

721
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:20,211
we need the blood of the Sea Emperor

722
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:21,972
to break the Dragon Soul Seal

723
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:24,732
to release its power
to destroy the world.

724
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:27,772
Bai Wei thought
the Sea Emperor was dead.

725
00:38:28,452 --> 00:38:30,691
But she didn't expect
that after seven thousand years,

726
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:33,171
the Sea Emperor would appear
in Kongsang.

727
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:34,531
Look at this.

728
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,651
The Evil Star is telling me

729
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,332
the whereabouts of the Sea Emperor.

730
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:48,571
No one can stop me

731
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:50,292
from destroying Yunhuang!

732
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,491
- Congratulations. My Lord!
- Congratulations. My Lord!

733
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:32,372
God of Dragon,

734
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:34,932
Shi Ying and Zhu Yan of Kongsang
request an audience.

735
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:38,852
How dare you come here again?

736
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,051
Aren't you afraid of death?

737
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:42,211
God of Dragon,

738
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,732
the Evil Star has reappeared
in the night sky.

739
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:46,252
It means the Sea Emperor is not dead

740
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:48,131
and is still within Kongsang's border.

741
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:51,611
Do you think you can threaten me
with the Sea Emperor?

742
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,131
But the Menghua Dynasty

743
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:56,772
will still perish in seventy years.

744
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:58,452
God of Dragon,

745
00:39:59,131 --> 00:39:59,772
we did not come here

746
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,531
to uncover the truth
about the Sea Emperor.

747
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:04,372
The incident of mistakenly
killing Zhi Yuan

748
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:05,531
made me understand

749
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,732
that prophecies are nothing
but hopes in people's hearts.

750
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:11,611
They cannot determine
the fate of a nation.

751
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,571
If the ruler is virtuous and wise,
the country and its people will prosper.

752
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:17,011
No one can shake

753
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,812
the foundation of Kongsang at all.

754
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,252
If the ruler is corrupt and oppressive,

755
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:22,571
the people will suffer.

756
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,211
And even if it's not the Sea Emperor,

757
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:26,412
there will be others
who'll rise in rebellion.

758
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:29,252
Since you didn't come
for the Sea Emperor,

759
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,292
what do you seek?

760
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:36,571
God of Dragon,

761
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:40,252
nothing in this world

762
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:41,732
can escape your eyes.

763
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:43,332
You have long known everything

764
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,691
that Yuan sacrificed for the Merfolk.

765
00:40:47,332 --> 00:40:48,972
Now he is accused

766
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:50,571
of colluding with the Crimson Clan.

767
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:52,531
Neither Yuan

768
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:53,812
nor the Crimson Clan

769
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:55,531
should bear such accusations.

770
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:57,452
We seek the truth from you.

771
00:40:58,892 --> 00:40:59,892
You have actually come

772
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:02,812
to ask me to save the people
of Kongsang.

773
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:07,452
Seven thousand years ago,

774
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:09,011
Empress Bai Wei

775
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:10,491
fought for the sake of the Sea Kingdom

776
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:12,932
and prevented the tragedy
of the Merfolk's destruction.

777
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:14,691
Two hundred years ago,

778
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:17,131
Princess Chizhu Feili advocated
for a ceasefire

779
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:18,211
for someone she loved,

780
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:20,691
bringing peace between the two clans.

781
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,292
Just a month ago,

782
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:24,211
Zhi Yuan and Yan'er

783
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:26,171
risked their lives multiple times

784
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,091
to prevent the massacre of both clans.

785
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,372
The mountains and rivers of Yunhuang
nurture countless lives,

786
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,171
and all things have spirits.

787
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:35,972
For thousands of years,

788
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,571
Kongsang and the Merfolk
have had trade and friendly relations.

789
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,051
There is no distinction between us.

790
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:41,452
Therefore,

791
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:45,892
I implore the God of Dragon
to proclaim to the world

792
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,772
the innocence of Zhi Yuan
and the Crimson Clan.

793
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:54,772
Why don't you

794
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,972
let Zhi Yuan speak up for himself?

795
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,972
Zhi Yuan is not dead yet.

796
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:04,011
How is that possible?

797
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,531
On that day
at Xinghaiyun Pleasure House,

798
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:06,252
I clearly...

799
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,412
Yuan is not dead yet.

800
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:11,211
How is this possible?

801
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:14,491
The Sea Kingdom still needs him.

802
00:42:14,972 --> 00:42:17,932
So I planted the Dragon's Breath

803
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:19,651
in him long ago.

804
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:24,051
Zhi Yuan.

805
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,412
That's why

806
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,211
even though you injured
Zhi Yuan's essence

807
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:38,571
at Xinghaiyun Pleasure House,

808
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:41,412
he did not perish

809
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,812
because of my Dragon's Breath.

810
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:45,611
Instead, he was transported

811
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,292
to a safe place.

812
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:49,051
Where is he now?

813
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:53,452
The one who tied the knot must untie it.

814
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:55,372
It was the people of Kongsang

815
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,972
who caused him
to fall into a deep sleep.

816
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:59,372
It is also you

817
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,571
who can awaken him.

818
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:30,932
Use the techniques I taught you

819
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:32,651
to remove his seal.

820
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:47,412
With my power,

821
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:50,571
summon him back to life.

822
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:00,091
Have I succeeded?

823
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:02,252
Yuan.

824
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:03,611
Yuan.

825
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:12,372
Yao Yi,

826
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:15,852
is this us meeting in heaven?

827
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:16,531
No.

828
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:17,812
Yuan,

829
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:19,372
you're not dead.

830
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:23,571
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

831
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:29,611
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

832
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:32,412
I've long returned to the mortal world.

833
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,051
I'm no longer
the Priest of Grand Preceptor of Jiuyi.

834
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:39,011
Shi Ying.

835
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:40,252
Princess.

836
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:42,571
Congratulations to both of you,

837
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:43,932
for your love
has finally come to fruition.

838
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,372
But Shi Ying,

839
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:47,812
why did you spare me,

840
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:48,611
the Sea Emperor?

841
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,332
It was God of Dragon

842
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:52,571
who planted the Dragon's Breath in you,

843
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:53,932
protecting your soul.

844
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:57,852
And he also informed us that you're here.

845
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:01,051
Moreover, you were never meant to die.

846
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,372
The true Sea Emperor

847
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:04,651
is someone else,

848
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:05,812
isn't it?

849
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,091
Yuan,

850
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:09,691
don't worry.

851
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:11,292
Shi Ying has no intention

852
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,211
of bringing harm to the Sea Emperor.

853
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:15,812
After experiencing life and death,

854
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,051
we have already seen
through the prophecy.

855
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:19,972
Things are in our hands.

856
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:22,651
There is nothing in this world

857
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:24,011
that cannot be reversed.

858
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,892
Are you truly willing
to let go of the Sea Emperor?

859
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:34,732
Trying to escape?

860
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:36,091
Let me kill you,

861
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:37,171
hypocritical Merfolk!

862
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:39,372
Don't harm the child.

863
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,651
So the Sea Emperor

864
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,611
is really the child
you were holding in Ye City?

865
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:52,131
He was unconscious

866
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,011
and lost his mother.

867
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:55,972
Unconscious

868
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,252
and lost his mother?

869
00:46:01,131 --> 00:46:01,852
Sumo?

870
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:03,772
It's Sumo, right?

871
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:07,131
So the child's name is Sumo.

872
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:08,611
Yan'er,

873
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:09,932
think carefully.

874
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:12,932
That child is no ordinary Merfolk.

875
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:27,131
That's right.

876
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:28,972
He can merge

877
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,091
with the Dragon Blood Jade
Yuan gave to me.

878
00:46:31,732 --> 00:46:32,292
Sumo.

879
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:34,812
So Sumo is the Sea Emperor.

880
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:39,011
We need to find Sumo immediately.

881
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:40,651
I believe

882
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:41,852
he has been hiding

883
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:43,292
near the Cangwu Abyss, right?

884
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:44,812
Shi Ying,

885
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:46,772
didn't you say

886
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:47,852
you no longer believe
in the Evil Star thing?

887
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:50,091
I won't harm anyone anymore

888
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:51,292
because of that prophecy.

889
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:53,452
It's just that this child

890
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:55,011
is important to you, Yan'er,

891
00:46:55,892 --> 00:46:57,491
the Merfolk,

892
00:46:57,812 --> 00:46:59,292
and the people of Kongsang.

893
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:01,131
I want to see him return

894
00:47:01,812 --> 00:47:02,691
to the Biluo Sea myself.

895
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,531
You're right.

896
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:06,972
Even if you're willing to spare him,

897
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:08,732
it will inevitably lead
to another bloodbath

898
00:47:09,051 --> 00:47:10,171
if someone with ill intentions
discovers him,

899
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,531
and figures out
the Evil Star has returned,

900
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,412
and the Sea Emperor
is still in Kongsang.

901
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:17,491
So

902
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:18,892
according to the God of Dragon,

903
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:21,651
Yuan needs to do something
for the Merfolk marine force.

904
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:23,691
This matter is related to Sumo.

905
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:27,452
What day is it today?

906
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,211
It's a leap day.

907
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:33,452
We must hurry
to the Huangquan Waterfall.

908
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:34,772
Or else it'll be too late.

909
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:58,412
Ruyi.

910
00:47:58,491 --> 00:47:58,932
Lord Zhi?

911
00:47:59,051 --> 00:47:59,611
Are you all right?

912
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:00,531
Are you here to pick us up?

913
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:03,852
Sumo.

914
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:11,972
Lord Zhi,

915
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:13,531
why did you bring

916
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:14,972
two Kongsang people here?

917
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:21,772
Ruyi,

918
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,812
don't you remember me?

919
00:48:24,372 --> 00:48:25,372
I'm Zhu Yan.

920
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:29,332
Yuan is not just Lord Zhi,

921
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:30,211
but your...

922
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:30,651
Princess,

923
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:32,091
I'll explain everything

924
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,131
to Ruyi slowly in the future.

925
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:35,412
Shi Ying,

926
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:36,852
do you have a way

927
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:37,932
to restore Sumo's consciousness?

928
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,772
He has been put
under the Dream Alteration Spell.

929
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:44,332
That's why he's in this deep sleep.

930
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:46,691
Zhi Yuan, as the descendant

931
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:48,412
of the Dragon Clan,

932
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:49,772
you're able to undo the dream.

933
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:51,892
Meanwhile,

934
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:52,972
Yan'er will protect his heart pulse.

935
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:54,332
Sumo should be able to wake up

936
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:56,211
without any backlash.

937
00:48:57,932 --> 00:48:58,571
That's great.

938
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:00,772
Sumo is finally saved.

939
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:02,412
But

940
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:04,932
he has been under the spell
for too long.

941
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:06,691
And we don't know

942
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:07,932
the specifics of the altered dream.

943
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:09,772
Elder Jian's suggestions to him

944
00:49:09,852 --> 00:49:10,651
are deeply rooted.

945
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:13,571
It may be difficult for us
to completely uproot them.

946
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,292
In the future,
if he suffered another blow,

947
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:16,732
there may be relapses.

948
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:18,452
As long as Sumo can wake up,

949
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:21,011
Ruyi and I will guide

950
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:22,011
and influence him slowly.

951
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:24,332
He'll surely get better.

952
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:25,772
We shouldn't delay any longer.

953
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:26,732
Zhi Yuan,

954
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:28,252
undo the Dream Alteration Spell for him.

955
00:49:29,131 --> 00:49:29,531
Yan'er,

956
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:30,772
remember these hand gestures.

957
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:32,051
All right.

958
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:51,531
I've memorized them.

959
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:26,412
Sumo.

960
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,091
Uncle Yuan.

961
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:44,292
What is this place?

962
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:46,131
Sumo.

963
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:49,651
Sister?

964
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:55,131
Sumo!

965
00:51:58,812 --> 00:51:59,131
No.

966
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,051
You abandoned me.

967
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:03,011
You don't want me anymore.

968
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:04,732
I hate you!

969
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:06,691
I hate you!

970
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:07,611
Sumo.

971
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:08,852
I hate you!

972
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,011
I've been looking for you all along.

973
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:10,651
You abandoned me!

974
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:11,772
I missed you.

975
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:12,651
I hate you!

976
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:14,571
I missed you, Sumo.

977
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:15,892
I hate you.

978
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:16,732
Sumo.

979
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:20,772
I'm sorry, Sumo.

980
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:22,292
I'm sorry.

981
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,651
There, there.

982
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:26,091
It's all right now.

983
00:52:26,412 --> 00:52:27,252
I'm sorry.

984
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:29,171
It's all my fault.

985
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:31,051
I'm sorry.

986
00:52:32,412 --> 00:52:33,372
I'm glad you're okay.

987
00:52:52,812 --> 00:52:53,332
Princess,

988
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,372
they should go home now.

989
00:52:58,651 --> 00:52:59,332
That's great.

990
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:01,292
We can finally return to the Biluo Sea.

991
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:03,332
Only on a leap day

992
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:05,691
can the bloodline of the Sea Emperor
resonate with the God of Dragon,

993
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,972
briefly opening a pathway
to the Biluo Sea.

994
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:10,332
If he doesn't go this time,

995
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:11,972
we'll have to wait
for several more years.

996
00:53:12,252 --> 00:53:12,972
Undue delay may bring troubles.

997
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:17,732
Come on, let's go home.

998
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:22,211
Sumo.

999
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:24,892
Lord Zhi,

1000
00:53:25,892 --> 00:53:26,332
what about you?

1001
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:27,772
Aren't you going home with us?

1002
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:30,772
I have to return to Jialan

1003
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:32,211
to give Kongsang an explanation.

1004
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:33,171
I'll find a way

1005
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,372
to return to the Biluo Sea to see you.

1006
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:35,611
Don't worry about me.

1007
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:38,772
Uncle Yuan,

1008
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:40,571
I'm going now.

1009
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:45,171
Sister.

1010
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:48,772
Sumo.

1011
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:52,531
Promise me

1012
00:53:52,972 --> 00:53:53,852
to listen to Ruyi

1013
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:56,412
and don't be deceived by bad people.

1014
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,892
There are still many good people

1015
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,732
like me in Kongsang.

1016
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:02,932
As long as we are all alive,

1017
00:54:03,051 --> 00:54:04,611
we will meet again someday.

1018
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:07,611
When you grow up,

1019
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:09,292
come find me.

1020
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:11,531
Okay?

1021
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:13,091
It's a promise.

1022
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:15,852
You must live a long life.

1023
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:20,651
Okay.

1024
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:24,812
I want to see you all grown up.

1025
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:27,651
You must also grow up safely.

1026
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:31,252
Let's go.

1027
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:18,772
Yuan!

1028
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:22,372
Yuan!

1029
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:24,812
Yuan!

1030
00:55:28,812 --> 00:55:29,252
Yan'er.

1031
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,292
I am Xuyao.

1032
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:34,691
Xuyao?

1033
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,171
Isn't that one of the ancient Gods?

1034
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:38,651
The God of Destruction,

1035
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,051
opposing the God of Creation.

1036
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:41,571
Why did he

1037
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:42,611
enter Yuan's body?

1038
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:44,972
I sense this aura

1039
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:46,852
somewhere before.

1040
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:49,011
Was it Diba or...

1041
00:55:51,812 --> 00:55:52,772
It's your fault

1042
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:53,852
that I lose the Sea Emperor's blood.

1043
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:54,892
But this descendant

1044
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:56,852
of the Dragon Blood is not bad.

1045
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:59,091
With him around,

1046
00:55:59,852 --> 00:56:01,892
why worry about controlling
the future Sea Emperor?

1047
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:02,972
So you were

1048
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:04,611
the one controlling Xingzun back then.

1049
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:05,932
Why do you need

1050
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:06,691
the Sea Emperor's blood?

1051
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,372
Stop struggling.

1052
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:13,372
You're no match for me.

1053
00:56:13,772 --> 00:56:16,131
You have nothing left in Kongsang

1054
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:19,252
and no attachment to the mortal world.

1055
00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:23,011
Why waste your effort fighting me?

1056
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:24,452
No.

1057
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:27,571
I have someone I care about.

1058
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,571
I won't be defeated by you.

1059
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:36,691
Do you think Zhu Yan

1060
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:38,452
is the reincarnation of Chizhu Feili?

1061
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:39,932
You're dreaming.

1062
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:47,252
Zhi Yuan,

1063
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,452
face your inner desires.

1064
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:54,171
It was Zhu Yan
who caused Yao Yi's death.

1065
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:55,852
She destroyed
Yao Yi's remaining consciousness.

1066
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,651
Let her pay the price.

1067
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:01,412
Turn Zhu Yan into Yao Yi.

1068
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:12,611
As a descendant of the Dragon Blood,

1069
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:14,491
only you can take me

1070
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,491
to the Biluo Sea.

1071
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:20,011
Let's make a deal.

1072
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:22,972
You help me find the Sea Emperor.

1073
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:27,332
Then I'll fulfill your wish.

1074
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:50,372
Yuan.

1075
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:51,332
No!

1076
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:52,852
He's not Zhi Yuan.

1077
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:54,772
Xuyao has taken over his body.

1078
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:09,571
Yao Yi,

1079
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:11,372
come here.

1080
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:12,691
What did you call me?

1081
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:14,131
I'm Zhu Yan,

1082
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:15,171
not Yao Yi.

1083
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,211
From now on,

1084
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,051
you will be my Yao Yi.

1085
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:28,252
Xuyao is skilled

1086
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:29,292
at exploiting the darkest
and most selfish desires

1087
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:30,732
of the original host

1088
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:31,691
for his own benefit.

1089
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:33,651
Back then,

1090
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:34,852
he used Emperor Xingzun's feelings

1091
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:36,292
for Empress Bai Wei.

1092
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,131
And now he's using Zhi Yuan's obsession

1093
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:39,332
with Yao Yi.

1094
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:52,651
Yao Yi,

1095
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:54,651
where do you think
you're going with this man

1096
00:58:55,372 --> 00:58:57,091
after abandoning me?

1097
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:58,932
Can you escape from my grasp?

1098
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:00,812
Why not

1099
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:03,412
experience my newfound power?

1100
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:08,491
Shi Ying!

1101
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:09,691
Shi Ying!

1102
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:11,051
Shi Ying.

1103
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:15,051
Stop it.

1104
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:15,972
Shi Ying.

1105
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:19,772
Let her go.

1106
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:24,171
Shi Ying!

1107
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,372
Stop it.

1108
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:28,812
You can't harm him.

1109
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:30,571
Shi Ying.

1110
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:32,611
Shi Ying.

1111
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:35,171
From now on,

1112
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,131
there is only one king in Yunhuang.

1113
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:39,852
There can only be one person
in your heart,

1114
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:41,252
and that's me.

1115
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:42,571
Shi Ying.

1116
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:43,412
As for him,

1117
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:45,691
he'll be treated

1118
00:59:46,452 --> 00:59:47,571
anyhow I want.

1119
00:59:48,491 --> 00:59:48,892
Shi Ying.

1120
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:50,292
No!

1121
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:52,011
Stop it!

1122
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:53,732
Shi Ying.

1123
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:55,051
How about it, Shi Ying?

1124
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:56,452
Do you admit defeat?

1125
00:59:57,691 --> 00:59:59,812
If you admit now that she is mine,

1126
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:01,571
I can spare your life.

1127
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:02,412
Shi Ying.

1128
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:05,091
No.

1129
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:06,131
Shi Ying.

1130
01:00:06,412 --> 01:00:07,651
The Yao Yi you loved

1131
01:00:08,732 --> 01:00:10,772
died two hundred years ago.

1132
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:12,812
Yan'er isn't her!

1133
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:14,651
Stop it!

1134
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:19,772
No!

1135
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:26,051
Shi Ying.

1136
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:35,892
He's doomed.

1137
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:43,611
No!

1138
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:47,491
Yuan,

1139
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:52,011
I'm willing to become Yao Yi.

1140
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:00,972
From now on,

1141
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:04,051
I'll be your Yao Yi.

1142
01:01:14,732 --> 01:01:15,171
Wu Gu,

1143
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:17,091
prepare the wedding ceremony for us.

1144
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:23,412
Shi Ying!

1145
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:49,892
This waterway

1146
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,131
is filled with
countless hidden currents and passages.

1147
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:55,211
For centuries, countless lost souls

1148
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:57,211
have wandered here,

1149
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,252
never finding their way out,

1150
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:01,852
forever trapped in despair.

1151
01:02:03,812 --> 01:02:04,332
Yao Yi,

1152
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:07,051
no one can find us here.

1153
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,211
We've arrived at our new home.

1154
01:02:34,732 --> 01:02:35,412
(It turns out)

1155
01:02:35,972 --> 01:02:36,772
(my great-great-grandmother)

1156
01:02:36,772 --> 01:02:38,332
(and I look so similar.)

1157
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:41,852
(Her bead coincidentally
recognized me that day.)

1158
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:44,651
(No wonder Yuan was so fixated on)

1159
01:02:44,732 --> 01:02:45,812
(mistaking me for her.)

1160
01:02:46,211 --> 01:02:46,611
Yao Yi,

1161
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:49,252
this is the belated wedding ceremony

1162
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:50,892
I have prepared for you

1163
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:51,812
that's two hundred years late.

1164
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:53,571
What?

1165
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:55,131
Getting married?

1166
01:02:58,011 --> 01:02:58,412
Why?

1167
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:00,611
Are you not happy with it?

1168
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:04,332
Well,

1169
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:07,211
don't you think
it's a little bit too rushed?

1170
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:08,412
Rushed?

1171
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:13,292
You want to be my Yao Yi.

1172
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:15,332
But you think it's too rushed?

1173
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:18,892
At this moment,

1174
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:22,131
are you truly willing to be my Yao Yi?

1175
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:25,732
Yuan.

1176
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:28,372
Of course, I am sincere.

1177
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:32,372
It's just that marriage
is a significant event in life.

1178
01:03:32,972 --> 01:03:34,252
I need to inform my parents.

1179
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:39,691
In the previous life,

1180
01:03:40,372 --> 01:03:41,452
everyone believed

1181
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:42,812
that Merfolk was not suitable to be
with Kongsang people.

1182
01:03:43,932 --> 01:03:44,772
But now,

1183
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:46,611
no one can stop me.

1184
01:03:48,452 --> 01:03:50,252
I won't care about anyone's opinions.

1185
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:52,812
But I'm a girl.

1186
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,131
Naturally, I hope

1187
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,852
the wedding will be lively and festive.

1188
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:13,852
Are you just trying to deceive me,

1189
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,452
using this as an opportunity
to delay and escape,

1190
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:18,211
aren't you?

1191
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:20,332
Let me go.

1192
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:23,211
You're my Yao Yi.

1193
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:24,651
I won't let you go anymore.

1194
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:26,011
- I want to have you now.
- Let me go!

1195
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:26,932
Let me go!

1196
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:27,932
Zhi Yuan, what do you want to do?

1197
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:31,932
You hurt me!

1198
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:34,932
Yao Yi?

1199
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:37,252
Yao Yi,

1200
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:39,852
are you all right?

1201
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:45,852
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1202
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:47,772
I was too eager.

1203
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:53,292
After two hundred years,

1204
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:57,732
we can finally be together.

1205
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:02,812
Yuan,

1206
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:07,091
why don't

1207
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:09,051
you tell me

1208
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:10,852
about your relationship with Yao Yi?

1209
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:14,452
It will help me

1210
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:15,691
to be a better Yao Yi for you.

1211
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:24,452
And then

1212
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:25,972
we can get married.

1213
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:33,252
Okay.

1214
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:37,292
This eyebrow shape

1215
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:39,932
is Yao Yi's favorite.

1216
01:05:50,131 --> 01:05:50,491
Look,

1217
01:05:51,372 --> 01:05:52,332
two of us in the mirror.

1218
01:05:53,412 --> 01:05:54,531
Don't we look perfect together?

1219
01:06:03,812 --> 01:06:04,732
(It's raining so heavily.)

1220
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:06,611
(And Shi Ying is seriously injured.)

1221
01:06:07,252 --> 01:06:08,651
(I have to find a way to escape.)

1222
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:10,011
What are you thinking?

1223
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:12,611
I...

1224
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:15,252
I was just thinking

1225
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:17,091
that after two hundred years,

1226
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:20,372
you still remember

1227
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,211
how to draw this eyebrow shape.

1228
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,932
Your memory is remarkable.

1229
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,852
Of course, I remember

1230
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,571
every detail of Yao Yi.

1231
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:37,852
In the future,

1232
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:40,772
you should remember them all too.

1233
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:05,732
Yuan,

1234
01:07:07,772 --> 01:07:09,491
now you won't even

1235
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,691
let me touch your reverse scale anymore?

1236
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:12,332
Is there no place

1237
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:14,651
for me in your heart anymore?

1238
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:23,732
Yuan.

1239
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:24,932
My head hurts.

1240
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:27,691
Although your feelings for me

1241
01:07:28,372 --> 01:07:29,211
are not as deep as those

1242
01:07:29,332 --> 01:07:29,932
for my great-great-grandmother,

1243
01:07:30,812 --> 01:07:33,412
they are still precious to me.

1244
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:35,171
You're the Keeper Yuan

1245
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:35,932
who watched me grow up.

1246
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:37,611
You accompanied me,

1247
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:38,691
protected me,

1248
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:39,852
and understood me,

1249
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:41,452
like a father and an older brother.

1250
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:43,452
Like a father and an older brother.

1251
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:47,171
Like a father and an older brother.

1252
01:07:48,091 --> 01:07:50,651
Don't you cherish this bond too?

1253
01:07:51,412 --> 01:07:52,091
That's why

1254
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:53,372
when you mistook me

1255
01:07:53,452 --> 01:07:54,531
for Yao Yi's reincarnation,

1256
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:56,011
you didn't say anything

1257
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:58,131
and faced everything alone.

1258
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:03,772
You're equally important to me.

1259
01:08:07,812 --> 01:08:09,011
I want to keep Yan'er safe.

1260
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:20,131
I want Yao Yi to come back.

1261
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:20,732
Yuan.

1262
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:22,251
I want to keep Yan'er safe.

1263
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:22,572
Yuan.

1264
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:23,812
Yuan.

1265
01:08:24,211 --> 01:08:25,371
I want to keep Yan'er safe.

1266
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,251
Yuan.

1267
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:27,972
I'll come back and save you

1268
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:29,772
after I find a solution.

1269
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:33,331
Yuan.

1270
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:34,411
I want to keep Yan'er safe.

1271
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:35,331
I'll come back to rescue you

1272
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:36,572
after I find a way.

1273
01:08:38,652 --> 01:08:39,612
I want Yao Yi to come back!

1274
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:03,932
As expected, it's not that easy.

1275
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:18,612
With my thoughts,

1276
01:09:19,411 --> 01:09:20,371
search for my desire.

1277
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:21,812
Set off.

1278
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:30,091
This is my Ice Clan's
ultimate formation.

1279
01:09:30,612 --> 01:09:31,772
You can't escape.

1280
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:37,612
Yan'er,

1281
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,492
you've been lying to me all along.

1282
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,572
I accidentally fell into

1283
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:44,291
your trap earlier.

1284
01:09:50,572 --> 01:09:51,171
But

1285
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:54,051
how could I bear

1286
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:55,812
to let Yao Yi,
who is about to be in my grasp,

1287
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:57,612
slip away?

1288
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,532
I can't bring myself to tell you.

1289
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:05,451
Everything you do will be in vain.

1290
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,532
Shi Ying has lost all his power

1291
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:10,331
and I gave him a fatal blow.

1292
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:11,892
I'm afraid

1293
01:10:12,612 --> 01:10:14,411
his vital organs are consumed by inner fire,
and nerves and blood vessels are severed.

1294
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:17,972
Just like this.

1295
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:32,211
See that, right?

1296
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:34,812
So what's the use if you found him?

1297
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:39,972
Wu Gu,

1298
01:10:40,892 --> 01:10:41,411
why don't you

1299
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:42,852
go and collect Shi Ying's corpse?

1300
01:10:43,492 --> 01:10:44,852
If he miraculously

1301
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:46,091
survives,

1302
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:49,492
kill that useless person for me.

1303
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:51,091
Yes.

1304
01:10:53,812 --> 01:10:54,291
Yuan,

1305
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,011
when did you become

1306
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:59,251
such a monster?

1307
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:10,812
Now let me tell you

1308
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:13,892
how to become Yao Yi.

1309
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:36,532
Since you refuse to accept my goodwill,

1310
01:12:37,251 --> 01:12:38,772
don't blame me for forcing you.

1311
01:12:46,692 --> 01:12:47,251
How do you feel

1312
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:49,612
about wearing Yao Yi's clothes,

1313
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,131
smelling her favorite fragrance,

1314
01:12:52,532 --> 01:12:54,051
and drinking her favorite wine?

1315
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:55,331
Do you feel like

1316
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:56,331
you're becoming Yao Yi?

1317
01:13:00,051 --> 01:13:00,692
I have lost

1318
01:13:00,892 --> 01:13:01,772
my sense of taste and smell.

1319
01:13:02,652 --> 01:13:03,331
I can't smell the fragrance,

1320
01:13:03,932 --> 01:13:04,892
nor taste the flavor.

1321
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,171
Your efforts are in vain.

1322
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:10,892
The one who loves you is Yao Yi,

1323
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:12,131
not me.

1324
01:13:13,732 --> 01:13:14,532
You forced me to marry you.

1325
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:17,051
You're only marrying a shell
without a soul.

1326
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:18,652
No, no, no.

1327
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:21,211
From now on,

1328
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,972
you will become my Yao Yi.

1329
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:26,772
What are you planning to do?

1330
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:31,051
I want to transform you into Yao Yi.

1331
01:13:32,972 --> 01:13:33,451
You actually want to turn me

1332
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:34,652
into someone else?

1333
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:36,411
Are you insane?

1334
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:39,411
Zhu Yan,

1335
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:40,972
didn't you lose

1336
01:13:40,972 --> 01:13:42,051
your sense of taste and smell?

1337
01:13:42,972 --> 01:13:43,451
Now, by transforming you

1338
01:13:43,612 --> 01:13:44,411
into someone else,

1339
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:46,291
won't your senses come back?

1340
01:13:46,812 --> 01:13:47,331
Then

1341
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:48,732
you can enjoy

1342
01:13:48,932 --> 01:13:51,812
everything in this world with me.

1343
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:11,331
Let go of me.

1344
01:14:12,331 --> 01:14:12,932
I don't want this.

1345
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:15,892
I am Zhu Yan.

1346
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:17,732
I don't want to become anyone else!

1347
01:14:19,131 --> 01:14:21,451
Supreme power, fulfill my wish.

1348
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:23,371
From now on,

1349
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:25,692
you'll forget your identity as Zhu Yan

1350
01:14:26,451 --> 01:14:27,732
and live

1351
01:14:28,852 --> 01:14:29,451
as Yao Yi.

1352
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:48,371
I am Chizhu Feili,
the leader of Extreme Wind City.

1353
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:50,532
You can also call me Yao Yi.

1354
01:14:51,732 --> 01:14:52,011
Good.

1355
01:14:52,772 --> 01:14:54,331
Now that you have accepted me
as your master,

1356
01:14:54,732 --> 01:14:56,251
you should remember my teachings.

1357
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:04,652
Yuan,

1358
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:06,892
have you undergone a transformation?

1359
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:11,852
Wait for my return.

1360
01:15:12,932 --> 01:15:14,091
I will wait for your rebirth.

1361
01:16:58,852 --> 01:16:59,291
Yan'er!

1362
01:17:00,051 --> 01:17:00,932
What did you do to Yan'er?

1363
01:17:01,812 --> 01:17:03,131
You actually regained your power.

1364
01:17:04,051 --> 01:17:05,732
Pushed to the brink of death
and then reborn, huh?

1365
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:07,532
Let Yan'er go!

1366
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:09,251
Yan'er?

1367
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:11,612
Who's Yan'er?

1368
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,171
She has already become my Yao Yi.

1369
01:17:20,371 --> 01:17:21,451
You've come for me.

1370
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,011
Yan'er.

1371
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:28,612
If heaven won't take your life,

1372
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,532
then let me kill you.

1373
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:32,492
That way,

1374
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,011
you won't have to think about anything

1375
01:17:36,011 --> 01:17:37,612
and will forever be my Yao Yi.

1376
01:19:09,732 --> 01:19:10,291
Yan'er.

1377
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:30,532
Yan'er?

1378
01:21:32,532 --> 01:21:33,091
Yan'er,

1379
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:34,892
did I hurt you?

1380
01:21:40,451 --> 01:21:41,091
It's impossible.

1381
01:21:41,972 --> 01:21:42,572
This can't be.

1382
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:43,612
Yan'er!

1383
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:44,411
Impossible.

1384
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:44,812
Yan'er.

1385
01:21:44,812 --> 01:21:45,411
That's impossible.

1386
01:21:45,972 --> 01:21:47,051
I couldn't have hurt Yan'er.

1387
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:47,852
This is impossible.

1388
01:21:48,532 --> 01:21:49,572
I would never harm Yan'er.

1389
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:50,171
Yan'er, are you all right?

1390
01:21:53,211 --> 01:21:53,692
Yuan,

1391
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,532
are you more clear-headed now?

1392
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:00,732
Yan'er,

1393
01:22:00,812 --> 01:22:01,251
I...

1394
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:09,652
Yuan.

1395
01:22:10,131 --> 01:22:11,011
You two, leave now.

1396
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:13,772
Go now!

1397
01:22:49,572 --> 01:22:51,532
Yan'er, are you okay?

1398
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:52,732
I'm fine.

1399
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:56,572
It's just that Xuyao
tried to turn me into Yao Yi.

1400
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:58,411
Luckily, you arrived in time

1401
01:22:58,532 --> 01:22:59,411
and interrupted the spell.

1402
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:04,692
Don't worry.

1403
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:05,852
I'll be fine.

1404
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,251
Look, I look perfectly fine

1405
01:23:07,572 --> 01:23:08,572
in front of you.

1406
01:23:10,011 --> 01:23:11,091
If you feel something's wrong,

1407
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,171
you must let me know.

1408
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:15,852
What about you?

1409
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:19,171
Xuyao said
your organs are consumed by inner fire,

1410
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:20,251
and your nerves
and blood vessels are severed.

1411
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:24,451
That should have happened.

1412
01:23:26,852 --> 01:23:27,451
But

1413
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:29,291
in the face of death,

1414
01:23:29,532 --> 01:23:30,932
I felt the power of your fire crane.

1415
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:32,732
That was how I managed to hold on.

1416
01:23:35,692 --> 01:23:36,732
The heavenly thunder

1417
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:38,451
opened up my meridians

1418
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:40,291
and helped me restore the power

1419
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:41,892
that I had lost.

1420
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,371
But I never expected

1421
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:46,812
Xuyao to completely transform Yuan

1422
01:23:47,131 --> 01:23:48,892
into someone else.

1423
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:51,371
Xuyao now

1424
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:53,291
controls the two divine rings.

1425
01:23:53,692 --> 01:23:54,612
Given time,

1426
01:23:54,852 --> 01:23:56,131
his ability to manipulate people's hearts

1427
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,692
will only grow stronger.

1428
01:23:58,692 --> 01:23:59,411
Eventually,

1429
01:23:59,972 --> 01:24:01,772
he can even command the army

1430
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:02,932
at his will.

1431
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:04,251
Army?

1432
01:24:05,652 --> 01:24:06,171
That's right.

1433
01:24:06,852 --> 01:24:08,011
What's even more terrifying is that

1434
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:10,011
if Xuyao finds the Sea Emperor

1435
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:11,211
through Zhi Yuan,

1436
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:12,251
he can unlock

1437
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:13,331
the seal on the rings

1438
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:14,812
and absorb the power of the world

1439
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,131
to destroy Yunhuang.

1440
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:18,492
So we must not leave the rings

1441
01:24:18,572 --> 01:24:20,492
in Xuyao's hands.

1442
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:23,251
We must find a way to retrieve them.

1443
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:26,291
But Yuan is practically immortal now.

1444
01:24:26,612 --> 01:24:27,732
We can't defeat him.

1445
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:31,652
Besides,

1446
01:24:32,331 --> 01:24:32,932
we don't have

1447
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:34,251
the incantation to control the rings.

1448
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:35,652
So we can't summon them.

1449
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:39,772
Yan'er.

1450
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:41,532
Zhi Yuan's current strength

1451
01:24:41,812 --> 01:24:43,051
won't be able
to withstand Xuyao for long.

1452
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:44,371
So

1453
01:24:44,892 --> 01:24:46,532
we need to leave this place
as soon as possible

1454
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:49,051
and return to Jialan to find a solution.

1455
01:24:51,532 --> 01:24:53,652
This catastrophe
affects the entire world.

1456
01:24:54,331 --> 01:24:55,251
Yunhuang

1457
01:24:55,652 --> 01:24:57,091
will be engulfed in the flames of war.
