00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:58,257
Princess?

20
00:01:58,737 --> 00:01:59,617
Yuan.

21
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:03,457
How dare you humiliate the Princess!

22
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:04,257
Father.

23
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:05,457
Don't blame Yuan.

24
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:06,698
It's all my fault.

25
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:07,298
You!

26
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:08,737
This marriage alliance

27
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,138
is too good for the Crimson Clan.

28
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,177
Sarcastically, your princess

29
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:13,698
has disgraced herself

30
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,497
and fraternized with a Merfolk slave.

31
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:17,578
And that puts paid
to the marriage alliance.

32
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:19,578
Wait, wait.

33
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:20,578
- Please listen to me.
- Shut it.

34
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:22,858
You can insult me but not Yuan.

35
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:24,258
To me,

36
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:25,337
Merfolks are nobler

37
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:26,698
than the arrogant Azure Clan like you.

38
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:30,298
I've heard that
the chief of the Crimson Clan

39
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,818
has been tight with a lowly Merman.

40
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,337
Crimson Queen.

41
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:35,777
Do you want

42
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:36,698
to turn down the proposal

43
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:38,503
from we Dark Clan
for a lowborn Merfolk slave?

44
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:40,617
If you take his life,

45
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:42,057
we, the Dark Clan,

46
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:43,617
may forgive you

47
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,418
and our clans can still make up.

48
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,457
That's right. Kill him.

49
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:48,578
He's right.

50
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:49,457
Kill him.

51
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:50,378
Kill him, Crimson Queen.

52
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,057
The reason

53
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,497
why I rejected your proposal

54
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,217
because I don't want to marry

55
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,138
someone I don't like.

56
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,138
It doesn't concern Yuan.

57
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:00,098
So what if he's a Merfolk?

58
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:01,578
In my eyes,

59
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,177
the Merfolks are way nobler

60
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,818
than the arrogant Dark Clan like you.

61
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,057
Do you hear yourself?

62
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,298
This is outrageous.

63
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,978
Special Envoy, there must be

64
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,138
a misunderstanding in this.

65
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,098
Yuan.

66
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:41,858
I take this pearl

67
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,497
because I want to share your worries.

68
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,258
We, the Kongsangs, reincarnate.

69
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:03,018
Reincarnate?

70
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:05,378
Please wait for me here.

71
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:07,978
I'll return to you.

72
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,578
We will recognize each other with this.

73
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:29,178
Please help me

74
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,457
to protect my clan.

75
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:33,657
Wait for me.

76
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:34,457
I will.

77
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,618
I'll wait for your next reincarnation.

78
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,618
Once we recognize each other,

79
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:45,698
the pearl will respond to its owner.

80
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,217
(The pearl found its owner.)

81
00:04:58,578 --> 00:04:59,138
(Yan'er.)

82
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,258
(You're the reincarnation of Yao Yi.)

83
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:06,097
Yuan.

84
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,018
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:09,738
I don't know what's going on.

86
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,258
The pearl disappeared out of a sudden.

87
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:12,977
Lowly slave.

88
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:14,138
My lord.

89
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:16,578
Yuan.

90
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,337
What evil spell

91
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,337
did you cast on my daughter?

92
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:18,818
Someone.

93
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:20,457
- Tie him up!
- Your Lordship!

94
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:21,378
- Yes.
- Yes.

95
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,018
No!

96
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,818
No one is going to touch him!

97
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,657
If you want to tie him up,

98
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:27,337
tie me up first.

99
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,097
This is ridiculous.

100
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:32,258
Let's go.

101
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:34,018
Yao Yi.

102
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,297
You're finally back.

103
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:40,738
I didn't realize

104
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:44,698
you'd been with me all along.

105
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:52,297
Today,

106
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,618
I must destroy this slave.

107
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:55,657
No, Father!

108
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:56,058
Your Lordship.

109
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:57,457
It's my fault.

110
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,018
I transformed into the woman

111
00:05:59,258 --> 00:05:59,698
in his mind

112
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:00,698
because he was so upset.

113
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:01,297
I wanted to comfort him.

114
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:02,618
He did that

115
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,138
because he mistook me for someone else.

116
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,018
How dare you plead for him?

117
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,097
If it wasn't for him

118
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,417
who offended you,

119
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:11,897
you wouldn't have

120
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,417
had that ridiculous thought.

121
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:14,457
And you wouldn't have

122
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:15,738
disgraced yourself like that.

123
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:16,938
Get off.

124
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,457
I'm going to kill him.

125
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,738
And I'll deal with you later.

126
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:23,138
Yuan!

127
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:28,498
Yuan.

128
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:29,777
Mother.

129
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,217
Please say something.

130
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,018
Yuan.

131
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:35,457
My lord.

132
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,777
Keeper Yuan has contributed a lot

133
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:40,058
for the Crimson Clan

134
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,818
as he has been looking after the clan

135
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,498
for several generations.

136
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:45,777
Please show mercy on him.

137
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,618
He must leave the Crimson Residence
immediately

138
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,977
or I will kill him.

139
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:52,537
No, he can't.

140
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,138
Father.

141
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,578
Yuan has already badly injured.

142
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,938
You can't chase him away.

143
00:06:58,657 --> 00:06:59,217
You!

144
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,200
No, my lord.

145
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,457
Yan'er. Stop infuriating your father.

146
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:03,857
Father.

147
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:05,657
Don't you know what will be awaiting us?

148
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,258
If he doesn't leave today,

149
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,258
everything is going to mess up.

150
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,578
The rumor about
the Princess of the Crimson Clan

151
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,818
fraternizing with a Merman
will be making the rounds.

152
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,138
This is humiliating to our family

153
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,578
and your reputation.

154
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:17,738
How are you going

155
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,258
to live with yourself in the clan
in the future?

156
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:26,897
My lord, my lady.

157
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,178
I'm to blame for what happened today.

158
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,417
As everyone saw,

159
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,977
I have cast an evil spell on Princess.

160
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,178
No, you didn't.

161
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:38,018
Father.

162
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:39,777
I don't know what's that,

163
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:41,738
but it's definitely not an evil spell.

164
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,578
Father, please.

165
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,537
Princess.

166
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,217
No need to plead for me.

167
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:47,897
We need a conclusion

168
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:49,738
for today's incident.

169
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:51,777
Yuan.

170
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,457
As the keeper of the Crimson Residence,

171
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,138
I've ruined the reputation of Princess

172
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,178
lest I protect her.

173
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:01,097
I've failed you.

174
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,378
The marriage alliance between
Crimson and Azure Clans fell short.

175
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:05,897
I have disappointed you, my lord,

176
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,297
and the entire Crimson Residence.

177
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:08,738
I

178
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,498
don't deserve to be the keeper.

179
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,378
I, Yuan,

180
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:18,578
appreciate the kindness Crimson Clan
extended to me over these 200 years.

181
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:20,498
I never expected

182
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:22,938
I'd bring ruinous harm to the clan.

183
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,097
I'm ashamed to face you,
my lord and my lady.

184
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:27,777
I only wish

185
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,258
you won't blame Princess

186
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,338
after I leave.

187
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:33,618
I

188
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,057
bid farewell to you.

189
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:38,978
Yuan.

190
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:40,858
Father, please.

191
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,978
Father.

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
(Yuan)

193
00:08:58,098 --> 00:08:58,897
Keep this.

194
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:09,378
Yuan.

195
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:10,817
- Yuan!
- Chi Song, stop her!

196
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:11,618
Yan'er.

197
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:12,297
Princess.

198
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,018
- Yuan!
- Princess.

199
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:15,978
Let go.

200
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:17,618
Yan'er.

201
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:18,817
Princess.

202
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:19,498
Yan'er.

203
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,080

209
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,738
- Young Lady.

210
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,018
Young Lady.

211
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:39,577
Yuan!

Otherwise,

219
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,057
you'll collapse.

220
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,738
Yuan is badly injured.

221
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,697
What is he going to do?

222
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,978
Our last farewell was
over 200 years ago.

223
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:24,297
Unexpectedly,

224
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:25,378
the lady who's deeply rooted in my heart

225
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,777
has been by my side all along.

226
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,138
Now that the pearl

227
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,978
has responded to its owner.

228
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:38,177
My Yao Yi

229
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,378
is back at last.

230
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:55,338
Up.

231
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,618
Go over there.

232
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,218
Go over there.

233
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:04,897
Get up.

234
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:06,498
Slowly.

235
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:23,618
Are you all right?

236
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,978
It's so tiring

237
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:21,537
to bring you back here.

238
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,417
You can't die.

239
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,218
Your wound is serious.

240
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:46,537
Lie back.

241
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,417
What's your name?

242
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,018
I'm the chief of Extreme Wind City,

243
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:58,417
Chizhu Feili.

244
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,417
You can call me Yao Yi too.

245
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:08,297
How should I address you?

246
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,098
I remember someone called me Yuan

247
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,018
and that's all.

248
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,057
Are you a bad guy?

249
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:38,258
Maybe yes, maybe no.

250
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:39,777
I can't remember anything.

251
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,738
Since you've lost your memory

252
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,258
after the war

253
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,098
and now you met me,

254
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:47,817
I won't allow you

255
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:50,018
to commit to anything heinous
for the rest of your life.

256
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,777
Starting today,

257
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:52,817
I'll give you my surname.

258
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:54,817
And your new name

259
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:56,618
is Chi Yuan.

260
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:58,138
What do you say?

261
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:03,657
Are you willing to teach me

262
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:04,897
the robust swordsmanship skills
of Kongsang?

263
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,697
I will

264
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:08,937
if you call me Master.

265
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:11,618
Master.

266
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:14,138
Well.

267
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,218
You've become my disciple.

268
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,218
You should remember
the rules of the sect.

269
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:20,498
(When the disciples of
the Extreme Wind Swords Sect)

270
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,817
(are roaming around
the chaotic world out there,)

271
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,937
(they must treat the Kongsangs,
Merfolks, and the Ice Clan)

272
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:28,537
(equally)

273
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,018
(and help those in need.)

274
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,258
The reason

275
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,697
why I rejected your proposal

276
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:40,417
because I don't want to marry

277
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,338
someone I don't like.

278
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:43,338
It doesn't concern Yuan.

279
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,978
If you take his life,

280
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:46,417
we, the Dark Clan,

281
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,978
may forgive you

282
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,697
and our clans can still make up.

283
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,618
He's right.

284
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:51,498
Kill him.

285
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:52,417
Kill him, Crimson Queen.

286
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,458
(He's a lowborn merfolk)

287
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:55,498
(of an unknown origin.)

288
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:56,577
(This is outrageous.)

289
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,777
(I won't let Yao Yi stay beside him.)

290
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,858
Yuan.

291
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,338
Are you all right?

292
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:32,738
Yuan.

293
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:34,978
You've become a man now.

294
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,618
Today, I take you here

295
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,738
because I want you to make a choice.

296
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,218
I kept it secretly.

297
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:06,738
I've already known

298
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:08,577
that you're not an ordinary merfolk.

299
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:11,738
When I first saw you,

300
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:12,577
I...

301
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:15,617
I took you as my disciple

302
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,377
and gave you a surname

303
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,218
because I want you to be good

304
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:24,057
and I want to keep you with me.

305
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:26,577
Yuan.

306
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:28,498
Am I

307
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,258
too selfish?

308
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,018
I don't care who you were in the past.

309
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:37,498
If you choose

310
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,537
to return to the Crimson Residence,

311
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,320
(Yuan)

312
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,658
I'll travel alongside you

313
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,738
despite the thorny path ahead.

314
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,498
It's just that, you know,

315
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:51,137
the lifespan of the Kongsangs
is much shorter than the Merfolks.

316
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:53,898
I can't stay with you for too long.

317
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:56,938
If you can't let go of your past

318
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,218
and want to return to your clan,

319
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,377
I won't stop you.

320
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:45,817
I know.

321
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:48,617
Our future might be tough.

322
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,178
Still, I want to be with you.

323
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:52,978
Since

324
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:55,297
you've made your choice,

325
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,377
I'll make mine too.

326
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:11,698
Yao Yi.

327
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:25,738
Yuan.

328
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:26,498
Yao Yi.

329
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:27,817
Yao Yi.

330
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,258
Yao Yi.

331
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,097
I need your word.

332
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,297
Please protect my clan

333
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,817
and wait for me.

334
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:43,137
I'll wait for your next reincarnation.

335
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,297
But before our reunion,

336
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,137
Yuan,

337
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:50,097
please forget about me.

338
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,337
No!

339
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:11,057
My wish doesn't fail me

340
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:13,377
and I won't fail you too.

341
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:15,658
Yao Yi.

342
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:17,738
From today on,

343
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,337
I'll stay

344
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:21,577
by your side.

345
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:22,777
Come what may.

346
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:26,137
Yuan.

347
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:29,057
Please forgive me for lying to you.

348
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:32,458
I was cursed with the Ice Clan's spell.

349
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,498
I couldn't reincarnate.

350
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,978
So, I left a wisp of my soul

351
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,498
in the Crimson Pearl

352
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,938
to keep you company.

353
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:49,178
Because I hate to leave you

354
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,137
and I don't want you to be lonely.

355
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:55,978
It's fine

356
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,258
if you can't remember

357
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:58,738
our past.

358
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,978
I'll wait until you remember me

359
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:05,577
and I'll tell you.

360
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,698
It's been 200 years.

361
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:10,898
Finally, someone

362
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,418
could lift your obsession with me.

363
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,178
I'm so fortunate

364
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:21,857
to have stolen these 200 years.

365
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:24,698
Now that the Crimson Pearl is shattered,

366
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,418
I should leave too.

367
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,178
In time,

368
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,377
when everything returns to peace,

369
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,297
we'll be together forever

370
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,658
like what we used to be.

371
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:48,297
May you be with her

372
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:56,297
for this whole life.

373
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:38,978
I... I'm done.

374
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:41,537
Shi Ying.

375
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:42,978
I'm tired

376
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,097
and I can't fly anymore.

377
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:47,898
Why don't we find an inn in the city

378
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,498
and continue the journey tomorrow?

379
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,377
There's a relay station

380
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:52,458
about two hours' walk from here.

381
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,978
We can rest there today

382
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:56,857
so we can reach Riyue Lake

383
00:22:57,178 --> 00:22:58,458
before tomorrow night.

384
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:00,817
I'm hungry.

385
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:02,137
I can't take another step.

386
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:03,817
No, we must move now.

387
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:06,057
Are you afraid of running into her

388
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:08,738
in the city?

389
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:11,297
The Princess of the Crimson Clan
is so embarrassing.

390
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:13,018
Shame on her.

391
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:15,418
Since ancient times,

392
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:16,498
only the Crimson Clan

393
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:17,698
would reject the proposal
of other clans.

394
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:19,097
Ironically,

395
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:19,978
the Azure Clan turned down this time.

396
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:20,978
We have no idea

397
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:21,898
what has happened, though.

398
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:23,658
I heard

399
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:25,418
that she and the keeper...

400
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:28,817
Shi Ying, wait for me.

401
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:31,817
Didn't you hear them?

402
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,178
They were talking about Yan'er...

403
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:33,938
It's none of my business.

404
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:35,458
Wait.

405
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,297
Can you not be like this?

406
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:38,377
Why do you always deny

407
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,018
your care for her?

408
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:43,377
You ignore me again.

409
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,057
It's been a while

410
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:04,978
since I last saw Sumo.

411
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,137
How's he doing now?

412
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:08,577
Thank you for your grace.

413
00:24:08,857 --> 00:24:10,817
Sumo and I have been doing well

414
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,978
in the Huotu Tribe.

415
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,200
(Old Lord, Huotu Tribe)

416
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:15,537
You've been doing well?

417
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,057
(Lady Yu, Merfolk)
Do you think I'm clueless about

418
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:20,218
how badly Great Consort

419
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,097
has been treating you all these years?

420
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,337
Sometime, I'd stop her.

421
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:26,698
But sometimes all these happen

422
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,537
behind my back.

423
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:32,617
You have been suffering.

424
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,458
Please don't say that, my lord.

425
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,297
My son and I

426
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,337
can live a peaceful life now,

427
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:40,178
which I truly appreciate it.

428
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,258
We didn't suffer.

429
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,178
Sumo should

430
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:50,857
start school this year, right?

431
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,018
Don't worry.

432
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:55,738
I'll take care of this well.

433
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:58,817
He can study

434
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:01,938
and learn shooting

435
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:04,498
with the royal descendants
of the Huotu Tribe.

436
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,658
There are many Merfolks

437
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:08,978
who make achievements in Kongsang.

438
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,498
As long as he can stand on his own feet,

439
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,178
you can rely on him

440
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,498
for the rest of your life,

441
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:20,137
even if I have passed off.

442
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,258
Long live, my lord.

443
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,698
Please don't say anything ominous.

444
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,498
Long live?

445
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:30,018
Human

446
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,978
may live well today,

447
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:34,978
who knows tomorrow...

448
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:40,817
My lord!

449
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:41,777
- My lord!
- My lord!

450
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:42,817
My lord!

451
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:01,698
Lady Yu,

452
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:03,498
you're indeed shameful.

453
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,658
How could you cozy up to His Lordship

454
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:08,258
without concerning his weak health?

455
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:10,178
You've seduced him

456
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,498
and caused him to die in lechery.

457
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,698
Yet you shift the blame
to shadow or such.

458
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:16,377
This is ridiculous

459
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:18,458
that shadow can murder.

460
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:19,777
Men.

461
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:21,377
Bludgeon her to death.

462
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:22,097
Yes.

463
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:23,097
Hold on.

464
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:24,978
His Lordship

465
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:26,297
gave me this death-exemption token.

466
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,420
(Death-exemption Token)

467
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:41,018
Death-exemption token?

468
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,617
I don't see it.

469
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:43,777
Give it back to me.

470
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:44,857
Men.

471
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:46,137
Let go of my mother.

472
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,258
Give it back to me.

473
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:47,658
Bludgeon her to death.

474
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:48,377
Let go.

475
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:52,738
Sumo.

476
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:53,698
Men.

477
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:55,097
Drag them out.

478
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:56,857
- Sumo.
- Don't come near.

479
00:26:57,537 --> 00:26:58,178
Back off.

480
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,137
Or I'll kill you.

481
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,377
Don't you dare to touch my mother!

482
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:02,458
I'll kill you.

483
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:03,617
Back off.

484
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,218
Don't touch my mother.

485
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:06,498
No one is coming near.

486
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:07,537
Stop it.

487
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,218
Sumo.

488
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:16,738
Mother, what are you up to?

489
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:18,057
Ke'erke.

490
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:20,297
This woman killed your father.

491
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:22,218
(Sumo, Merfolk)
Are you going to plead for them?

492
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:23,938
Father just passed away.

493
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:25,978
Mother, you shouldn't use
any punishment.

494
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:27,617
As of now, it's imperative

495
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:28,898
to deliver the message of Father's death

496
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,617
to Jialan City and Extreme Wind City

497
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:32,577
to prevent Huotu Tribe
from falling into unrest.

498
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:39,178
Lord Ke'erke is merciful.

499
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,498
He's right.

500
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,258
(Principal Sorcerer, Huotu Tribe)
Great Consort, please do

501
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:44,577
what he said.

502
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:49,617
Fine.

503
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,337
I'll listen to you.

504
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,018
She won't have to die,

505
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:55,297
but she must be punished.

506
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:57,577
I'm going to silence her

507
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:59,978
from spewing any lies.

508
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:00,978
Ke'erke.

509
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:02,978
Stop pleading for them.

510
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:05,857
Men, take them out.

511
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:06,857
- Yes.
- Yes.

512
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:10,018
Go.

513
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:10,698
Let go!

514
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:11,938
Let go!

515
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:12,857
Let go of me!

516
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:13,978
I didn't kill His Lordship. Let go!

517
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:16,777
Let go!

518
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:18,777
Sumo!

519
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:21,817
Principal Sorcerer.

520
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,178
How's the capture
of those Merfolks going?

521
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:25,097
Everything's all set.

522
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:26,577
The only thing left

523
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,658
is the marriage alliance
with the Princess of the Crimson Clan.

524
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:34,617
Crimson King, accept the decree.

525
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,898
By the mandate of His Majesty
in Jialan Imperial City,

526
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:46,097
"I heard that Zhu Gaozhao,
the Crimson King

527
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,777
has a daughter, Zhu Yan,

528
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:51,097
who's of meritorious origin
with unparalleled beauty

529
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:53,978
and virtuous character, worthy of
being a decent spouse choice.

530
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,898
I hereby grant her
as the consort of Lord Ke'erke

531
00:28:57,057 --> 00:28:58,418
of the Huotu Tribe.

532
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,297
The responsible authority will select
an auspicious date for the wedding.

533
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,458
Hopefully, the boundary will be in peace

534
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,097
and further enhanced by this union.

535
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:08,137
Any disobedience of the mandate
will be accused of deception crime.

536
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,258
That's all."

537
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:13,777
I accept the decree.

538
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:27,377
Young Lady.

539
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:28,978
Young Lady.

540
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:30,418
The Emperor issued an edict

541
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,057
to marry you to the Huotu Tribe.

542
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:37,137
Young Lady, get that off already.

543
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,418
I'm so freaked out now.

544
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:39,617
If we knew we were going to end up here,

545
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,057
it'd be better to marry
into the Azure Clan.

546
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,097
Huotu Tribe is far away
at the frontier in the desert

547
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,698
and the environment there
is extremely hostile.

548
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:48,617
Huotu Tribe?

549
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:49,658
Yes.

550
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,337
Young Lady.

551
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:13,537
Consort Qing is indeed cruel

552
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:15,297
and determined to oppress me

553
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,097
by requesting this decree
from His Majesty.

554
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:20,938
If I disobey the decree,
I'll be accused of deception crime.

555
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:25,297
Yan'er can't just marry to that desert.

556
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,537
Are we really out of depth now?

557
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:35,258
I'll go.

558
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,137
Father, Mother.

559
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:48,738
I think this marriage

560
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:49,978
is what I want

561
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:53,458
and more suitable than
the one with the Azure Clan.

562
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,458
Huotu Tribe

563
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:57,817
is under the jurisdiction of Father.

564
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,978
I'll be revered over there.

565
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,218
No one would dare to walk over me.

566
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:06,817
Besides, I was told

567
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:08,297
that this Lord Ke'erke

568
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:09,617
is a nice man.

569
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:11,377
He's the hawk on the grassland,

570
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:12,978
while I'm the flying pearl from Heaven.

571
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:14,738
It sounds like

572
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,738
we're compatible with each other.

573
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:20,377
You...

574
00:31:27,658 --> 00:31:28,898
Are you really willing to marry there?

575
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:30,577
Mother,

576
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:33,097
if I have to marry someone,

577
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:37,018
this is the best choice.

578
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:40,857
Besides,

579
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,337
you've pampered me

580
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,418
since infancy

581
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:47,817
and I've lived carefreely

582
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:49,777
in the Extreme Wind City

583
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:51,738
without worries.

584
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:55,178
Now that the Crimson Clan
is under duress

585
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:59,377
and both of you have toiled,

586
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,658
as the Princess of the Crimson Clan,

587
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,218
I should do something
to relieve my parents

588
00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:07,698
and the Crimson Clan.

589
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,898
My Yan'er has grown up.

590
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:22,658
Your Supreme Majesty.

591
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:23,698
Have you found any record

592
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,178
of the death of Emperor Xingzun?

593
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,498
In all official historical records,

594
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:29,898
ancient books or confidential accounts,

595
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:30,857
they only recorded

596
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,377
that after Emperor Xingzun
attained the real state,

597
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,498
he relinquished the throne

598
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,258
and traveled to the Eastern Sea

599
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,498
with a raft

600
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,018
towards the Celestial River

601
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,218
and ascended to immortality.

602
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:41,337
Ying.

603
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,377
Perhaps you've overthought.

604
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,097
(Wu Zhen, one of Ten Sorcerers of Ice Clan)
The Cangliu Kingdom

605
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,377
will return to the land of Yunhuang.

606
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:53,337
You knew about the identity of the Sage.

607
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:54,537
What's his identity

608
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:55,458
in the Ice Clan?

609
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:57,658
We received a secret formula

610
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:58,577
from the revered Sage

611
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,418
which needs the fresh blood

612
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:01,377
of Kongsang's children.

613
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,978
This is madness.

614
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:09,978
You can never

615
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:11,297
stop the revered Sage.

616
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:13,498
No one can.

617
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,498
The world created by him

618
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:19,258
must be destroyed by him too.

619
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:24,137
No one can stop him.

620
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,537
The Ice Clan possesses a heinous spell
to refine a longevity pill

621
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:33,258
from human blood.

622
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:35,057
Perhaps

623
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:37,097
he didn't ascend
as an immortal back then.

624
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:37,577
Instead...

625
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:38,097
Ying.

626
00:33:39,337 --> 00:33:40,057
Mind your word.

627
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,617
Don't judge your ancestor.

628
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:45,978
He's the founder of Kongsang.

629
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:49,458
I hope I'm wrong.

630
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:52,738
I know you have many doubts

631
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:53,817
about the actions of the Ice Clan.

632
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:58,898
But never take the prophecy
given by Merfolk Clan lightly.

633
00:33:59,337 --> 00:33:59,938
Yes.

634
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,337
Before the evil emerges,

635
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,097
we need to plan ahead.

636
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,258
I've come across something
in the ancient record.

637
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,777
If the Sea Emperor comes to contact
with Dragon Blood Jade,

638
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:09,177
the sacred relic of the Sea Kingdom,

639
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:10,617
there'll be a reaction.

640
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,057
If we can

641
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:13,298
locate Dragon Blood Jade,

642
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,257
it'll be much easier for us.

643
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:24,217
Yufei.

644
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,057
No.

645
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,018
Don't bring this.

646
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:27,938
But

647
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,978
you use this every day.

648
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,697
Only pick light and valuable things

649
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:34,818
from what I usually use.

650
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,537
Don't take all.

651
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:39,418
But

652
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,737
we have a convoy of horse carriages

653
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:41,778
to carry our things.

654
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:43,378
If we don't bring them all,

655
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:45,378
I'm afraid
the place will be too harsh for us.

656
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:49,858
If so,

657
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:53,137
are you not taking this too?

658
00:34:54,737 --> 00:34:55,498
No.

659
00:34:56,737 --> 00:34:57,458
Yufei.

660
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,217
I remember your hometown

661
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,778
is around Huotu Tribe.

662
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:02,418
(Huotu Tribe)
You haven't returned home for years.

663
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:03,898
Do you miss your home?

664
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:08,737
Perhaps you can go home

665
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,737
when we head for Huotu Tribe this time.

666
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:12,898
Young Lady.

667
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,898
Do you lose your head in anger?

668
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:16,617
I can't understand
what you're saying now.

669
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,338
It's a shame that this map is too old.

670
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:22,298
The defense deployment at Huotu Tribe

671
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,057
must have changed

672
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:25,938
after so many years.

673
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,520
(Jiuyi Mountain)

674
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:44,778
Xueying.

675
00:35:45,697 --> 00:35:46,737
I brought you here

676
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,898
because I have a present for you.

677
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:51,137
I want to thank you for not running away

678
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:54,818
and you've been accompanying me.

679
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,177
Frankly,

680
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,938
I'd say that it's you

681
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:04,737
who has been accompanying me
all this time.

682
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:08,898
No matter

683
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,617
how tough the road is,

684
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:12,858
I'm willing to take the risk

685
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:13,938
together with you.

686
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,778
We won't know how stunning

687
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,537
the scenery here

688
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:25,217
if we don't overcome obstacles.

689
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:29,697
Since the scenery is stunning here,

690
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,217
why don't you call me
by a different name?

691
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:35,898
Shi...

692
00:36:43,898 --> 00:36:45,418

Are you angry?

705
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:23,617
I'm sorry.

00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:24,978

00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:01,338
These dishes

718
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,338
are my new recipe.

719
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,177
I'm sure you'll like it.

720
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:08,978
A while ago,

721
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,137
Keeper Yuan left

722
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,298
and you never visited here since then.

723
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:15,858
Otherwise, you could've tried
these new dishes earlier.

724
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:17,697
It's fine.

725
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:19,577
These dishes

726
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,177
are enticing enough
just to look and smell at them.

727
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,697
I like them so much.

728
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:27,257
Sadly, I can't taste them afterward.

729
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,978
So, the rumor is true.

730
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:33,338
You're marrying down to Huotu Tribe.

731
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,378
If so, I shall congratulate you
in advance.

732
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,938
We must celebrate this with some brew.

733
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:40,018
Get me the brew.

734
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:40,898
Come on.

735
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:44,418
This is the pear blossom brew

736
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,418
fresh from the jar.

737
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:47,498
I'd like to offer this to you

738
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,858
for tasting, Princess.

739
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:50,778
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

740
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:56,018
Xueying.

741
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:02,298
Qing Gang.

742
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:04,458
Thank you for coming all the way here

743
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,657
to bid me farewell.

744
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:08,418
Yan.

745
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:11,217
Do you truly want to marry

746
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:13,057
Lord Ke'erke?

747
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,657
It's better

748
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,778
if you accept
General Qing's proposal, though.

749
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:23,978
Xueying.

750
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:26,097
Please don't say that.

751
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:29,498
Anyway, Huotu Tribe is far away

752
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,338
and you have no family there.

753
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,257
I'm worried
that you might be mistreated.

754
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,257
Rest assured.

755
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:37,458
Lord Ke'erke is a nice man.

756
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:40,177
Don't worry about me.

757
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:42,177
You must take good care of yourself.

758
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,338
Well,

759
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:46,577
you're upright

760
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:48,018
and carry yourself

761
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,217
with an imposing aura.

762
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:52,418
In fact, you're genuine.

763
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:55,458
Yet, you're wasted on Bai Xuelu.

764
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:56,898
You know what,

765
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:58,938
you should watch yourself around her.

766
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,177
She might trick you

767
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:03,217
into her target.

768
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:05,537
If it's true, I'd love to.

769
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,458
Frankly,

770
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,778
I'm worried about you the most.

771
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:14,737
You're soft-hearted,

772
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,018
making you a punchbag.

773
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,018
If you marry into the palace
in the future,

774
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,978
your days won't be easy.

775
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:23,057
If Consort Qing bullies you,

776
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:24,697
don't endure it on your own.

777
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,898
You must tell Prince Shi Yu

778
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:28,298
and ask for his help.

779
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:32,298
As for what I've told you today,

780
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,898
please promise me.

781
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:36,818
All right?

782
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:38,257
All right.

783
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,818
Yan, what's wrong with you?

784
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:43,298
You sounded like

785
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:44,818
this was our last farewell.

786
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:53,418
Not at all.

787
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:55,498
Because I'm happy for you.

788
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:56,418
Look at you two.

789
00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:57,938
One

790
00:40:58,097 --> 00:40:59,657
has found someone you love mutually,

791
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:01,338
while the other one

792
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:03,458
has someone you miss.

793
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,537
You're happy.

794
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,378
Are you not happy?

795
00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:15,057
Of course, I'm happy.

796
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:16,697
I have you two.

797
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,097
Naturally, I'm happy.

798
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:19,898
By the way,

799
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,737
have you informed Priest

800
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:23,537
about your marriage?

801
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,018
Whether I inform him or not,

802
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:29,657
it won't make any difference.

803
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:31,778
I've sent him

804
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:32,938
a wedding invitation

805
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,617
to invite him over.

806
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:37,617
It's a reply

807
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:40,217
to his wedding congratulatory letter.

808
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:43,778
Well.

809
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:45,577
Don't need to worry about me.

810
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:47,378
Come on.

811
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:49,177
Let's not waste the delicacies today.

812
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,378
Fill it up.

813
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:57,018
Come on.

814
00:41:58,378 --> 00:42:00,537
Let's celebrate my upcoming big day.

815
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:01,778
Cheers.

816
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:05,137
Yan, you must be happy.

817
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:55,938
Master.

818
00:42:56,938 --> 00:42:57,858
Is that you?

819
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:01,938
When we got drunk back then,

820
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:04,217
you had someone to escort us back.

821
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:07,338
Now

822
00:43:08,938 --> 00:43:10,097
we're drunk again,

823
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,577
but you will never come again.

824
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,217
This is the last farewell.

825
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,257
But why do you pretend to say goodbye

826
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:22,498
as if there will be a meet again?

827
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:32,217
Yuan.

828
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:35,177
Is that you?

829
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:43,737
Master won't come,

830
00:43:46,697 --> 00:43:48,057
and you've left too.

831
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:53,778
I'm all alone now.
