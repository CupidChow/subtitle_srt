19
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,779
Young Lady, didn't you
go to show the princesses

20
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,859
the new earrings His Highness
bestowed you?

21
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,499
Why do you come back so early?

22
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,098
Xueying looks slow-witted

23
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,138
and useless.

24
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:16,339
I can't believe
she has hooked up with Shi Yu.

25
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:17,939
I wonder

26
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,658
what kind of tricks she has used.

27
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,179
How could this be?

28
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:24,019
Didn't Prince Shi Yu favor

29
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,138
you over her?

30
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,538
He was worried Azure King
would notice

31
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:28,899
his feelings for Xueying.

32
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:30,299
So he used me

33
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,418
as a pretext.

34
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,258
Luckily, Shi Yu has only known

35
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,378
Xueying for a few days.

36
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,299
There won't be a strong attachment.

37
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:40,418
Besides,

38
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,258
a reciprocal love can't

39
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:43,779
necessarily last forever.

40
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,258
No one knows

41
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,658
who the winner is
until the last moment.

42
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,578
You do have a stiff upper lip.

43
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:59,019
Young Lady, what are you doing?

44
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,538
Trying to use me?

45
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:03,899
I'd like to see

46
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:05,258
who's better at playing tricks.

47
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:08,258
Mother,

48
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,258
I won't be defeated.

49
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:28,978
Yan,

50
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,299
have you used the medicine

51
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,299
Cuiliu brought you?

52
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:36,578
Yan,

53
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:38,858
what's wrong with you?

54
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,538
Nothing.

55
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:42,939
I didn't sleep well

56
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,418
last night.

57
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:49,578
Yan, let me ask you something.

58
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:51,219
Do you believe

59
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,538
in love at first sight?

60
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,299
There's no such thing.

61
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,858
It's just presumptuous.

62
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,418
It's the same

63
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:03,858
goes for friends and lovers.

64
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:05,538
Well,

65
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,779
let me tell you something new.

66
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,418
It's the story of a friend of mine.

67
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:13,698
She

68
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,219
falls in love with a man
in the mountain.

69
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,499
And that man says he likes her too.

70
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,179
Just that they can't go public

71
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,179
with their relationship.

72
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,458
What a womanizer.

73
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,099
Being so secretive

74
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:28,619
and acting all mysterious.

75
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,698
This is the womanizer.

76
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,138
Yan,

77
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:34,138
actually,

78
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,698
it's me.

79
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,659
I fall in love with Prince Shi Yu.

80
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,818
Being with him makes me

81
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,539
feel so comfortable, as never before.

82
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,338
Just that I don't know how he feels.

83
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,659
Prince Shi Yu has even inscribed

84
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,018
amorous words.

85
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,218
Can't you understand

86
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,419
his feelings for you?

87
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:01,338
Obviously, he has a crush on you.

88
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,018
You're the legitimate daughter
of Bai Family.

89
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:04,419
He's the only imperial prince.

90
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,778
Both of you are

91
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,419
a perfect match.

92
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,218
But

93
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,299
as we're entrapped

94
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:12,979
in these family interests,

95
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:14,539
he and I

96
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,739
can't get too close to each other.

97
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,499
This is also what he told me.

98
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,458
Prince Shi Yu

99
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:23,539
is a sensible man.

100
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,378
But if this goes on,

101
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,778
it'll be tough

102
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,818
for both of you to be together.

103
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,338
Yes.

104
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:32,099
And he said

105
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,179
if his elder brother was still here,

106
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:35,778
he'd just have to be

107
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:37,018
an idle prince for the rest of his life.

108
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,778
And we wouldn't have to be like this.

109
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:42,458
Yes.

110
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,458
It'd be nice
if his elder brother was here.

111
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,979
Is there really

112
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,539
no other solution?

113
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:00,059
Yan,

114
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,979
you don't have to feel sad for me.

115
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:03,458
I'm fine.

116
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:04,979
Yan.

117
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,099
Don't cry, Yan.

118
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:09,659
Yan.

119
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:11,179
I was finally

120
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,258
touched by you.

121
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,099
Look at you, you just won't give up.

122
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,258
You leave me no choice.

123
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,138
Why are you so loyal?

124
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:20,979
Stop crying.

125
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:21,739
You met him once.

126
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,378
And the Prince Shi Ying has been
on your mind for five years.

127
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:25,378
Who knows

128
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,299
how many years she's going
to pester Shi Ying again?

129
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:29,378
If this continues,

130
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:32,018
his doom will come to pass

131
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,179
and die in your hands.

132
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,218
Go back.

133
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:38,458
Your father will be worried

134
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,898
if you go home late.

135
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,059
Lord Chong Ming, why are you here?

136
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,939
Do you really want to learn

137
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,499
Primordial Spirit-Gathering Spell?

138
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,218
But

139
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,338
didn't Lord Immortal Official

140
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,138
say I didn't have...

141
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:03,659
You just have to answer my question.

142
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,499
Of course I do.

143
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:08,778
I can

144
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,539
risk everything for it.

145
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:11,659
Very well.

146
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,539
Let me tell you this.

147
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,539
Immortal Official asks you
to go to the Emperor Valley

148
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,698
tonight at nine.

149
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:17,818
And fetch Seven Star Lamp

150
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,979
at Emperor Xingzun's tomb.

151
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:24,179
What does this lamp have
to do with the magic?

152
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,578
Have you ever heard
of "The deceased will be revived

153
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,778
before Seven Stars Lamp goes out"?

154
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:29,939
Seven Star Lamp

155
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:31,898
is a lead-in to this magic.

156
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,378
Go get it.

157
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,179
Use it as a pledge to honor your master.

158
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:36,898
But

159
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,018
why didn't you tell me this
at that time?

160
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,778
Stop asking so many questions.

161
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,539
It seems like you're not sincere at all.

162
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:44,419
You gave up
as soon as you were turned down.

163
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,138
Just forget it
if you don't want to do it.

164
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,059
I'll do it.

165
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,778
It's hard to overcome the barrier
between life and death.

166
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,299
Bringing the primordial spirit
of the deceased back together

167
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,499
is the supreme magic in the world.

168
00:07:59,258 --> 00:07:59,859
And this journey to obtain the lamp

169
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:00,818
is extremely dangerous.

170
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,138
It's not an easy task.

171
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:03,939
This is also why Immortal Official

172
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,018
couldn't accept your request.

173
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,578
Don't say I didn't warn you.

174
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:11,619
I'll be sure to obtain it.

175
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:12,859
Okay.

176
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:15,659
If you can't get it,

177
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,578
it means you don't possess

178
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,939
the qualification
of being a magic practitioner.

179
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,898
If so, don't ever
show up before him again.

180
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,659
I'll obtain it.

181
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:40,939
Sister.

182
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:43,978
"My promise to Xueying
deeply rooted within."

183
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:45,978
Where did this dirty thing come from?

184
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,299
Give it back to me.

185
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,139
I can't do that.

186
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:51,578
There must be a womanizer
who had coveted

187
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,059
your beauty when
you were leading the dance.

188
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,019
So he sent such a dirty thing over
to harass you.

189
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,498
No.

190
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:58,338
Sister.

191
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,259
It's a matter of your honor.

192
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,218
I must get to the bottom

193
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,338
of this matter.

194
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:02,939
Sister, what are you doing?

195
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:04,659
Lords,

196
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,179
Princess Xuelu said

197
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,179
there's an emergency.

198
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,419
So I gathered all of you

199
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,139
to discuss it.

200
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,738
I saw a love token

201
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,458
in Xueying's room.

202
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,059
I'm afraid there's a womanizer
in the mountain

203
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,218
trying to harass her

204
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:20,698
because of her beauty.

205
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,858
It's a matter of her honor.

206
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,059
I hope you can investigate this

207
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,338
and hunt him down

208
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,498
to seek justice for my sister.

209
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,059
Both of you, kneel down.

210
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:33,659
You...

211
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:34,939
You...

212
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,019
What are you doing?

213
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,338
I know you're the most prudent
and courteous one.

214
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,939
Tell me, who insisted
on giving you this?

215
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:56,098
You must've accepted it
as you couldn't reject him.

216
00:09:58,978 --> 00:09:59,539
(Xueying,)

217
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,139
we have to
keep our relationship a secret

218
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:03,738
and we can't see each other often.

219
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,059
I have no idea.

220
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:11,139
What a double-distilled

221
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:12,779
Princess of Bai Family.

222
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,019
You've stayed in the mountain
for only several days.

223
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,978
And you already accepted a gift
from someone else.

224
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:18,618
And the snitch is

225
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,059
your own sister.

226
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,458
White King,

227
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,139
you've educated your daughters well.

228
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:34,899
Before I came,

229
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:36,858
I have thought of an idea.

230
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,840
(Royal Tomb of Emperor Xingzun,
the Emperor Valley, Jiuyi Mountain)

231
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,218
Emperor Xingzun in heaven,

232
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,539
I'm sorry to offend you.

233
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,899
I'll borrow the lamp tonight

234
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:46,618
just to save

235
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,379
your descendant's life.

236
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,098
(It's hard to overcome the barrier
between life and death.)

237
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,659
(Bringing the primordial spirit
of the deceased back together)

238
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:23,019
(is the supreme magic in the world.)

239
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,539
(And this journey to obtain the lamp)

240
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:25,659
(is extremely dangerous.)

241
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,139
(And it's not an easy task.)

242
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,059
You really came.

243
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,299
Well, you're seeking
for your own destruction.

244
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:16,578
You don't deserve my pity.

245
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:18,978
When Ying wakes up tomorrow,

246
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:21,299
everything will be over.

247
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,618
You've been practicing hard
for the past few days.

248
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,299
Some of your spiritual power
is restored.

249
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,259
But you still need to rest.

250
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:41,139
I

251
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,978
deliberately picked Jiusui Wheat

252
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,338
to make you a bowl
of mind-calming soup.

253
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,458
Drink up

254
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,659
and get some rest tonight.

255
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:51,698
Here.

256
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:05,299
Chong Ming,

257
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,098
you're hiding something from me.

258
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,379
No, I'm not.

259
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:16,259
Someone has trespassed

260
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,419
on the divine tomb
of Emperor Xingzun.

261
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:19,539
It's mere insects

262
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:20,779
and animals in the mountain.

263
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:22,698
I'll go take care of it.

264
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,818
Someone just won't go away.

265
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,098
Since you can't do it,

266
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:28,659
don't blame me for this.

267
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:43,858
Are you here

268
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,139
for the lamp too?

269
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,338
(Isn't this Kunyuan Palace?)

270
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,939
(Why am I here?)

271
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:20,259
(Kunyuan Palace?)

272
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:21,419
(Darn it, it's burning.)

273
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,259
(I've got to inform His Highness.)

274
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:25,858
Your Highness!

275
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:30,899
Your Highness!

276
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:38,458
Your Highness!

277
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:45,659
Leave!

278
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,179
Your Highness.

279
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:02,259
Shi Ying.

280
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,858
Your Highness.

281
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,179
Leave, Your Highness.

282
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:15,738
Zhu Yan.

283
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:22,458
Your Highness.

284
00:16:22,738 --> 00:16:23,818
It's going to catch fire.

285
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:24,818

If I don't save her now,

317
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:56,778
she'll necessarily die here.

Thank you, Emperor Xingzun.

320
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,139
I finally managed

321
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,379
to lure her here.

322
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:01,939
Yet, you save her again.

323
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:03,498
Chong Ming,

324
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:05,859
I understand you did it
for my own good.

325
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,778
But I'd like to fix this

326
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:09,738
myself.

327
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:11,099
You...

328
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,058
I'll be sure to make her

329
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,298
give up all her thought of it.

330
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:36,698
Lord Immortal Official,

331
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:40,819
I am Zhu Yan.

332
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:46,139
The task you assigned to me,

333
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:49,738
I

334
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:53,018
finally completed it.

335
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,018
Lord Immortal Official.

336
00:19:59,139 --> 00:19:59,978
Come with me.

337
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:23,899
You still believe

338
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,139
there's a magic spell

339
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,538
that can bring one back to life.

340
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:29,099
Lord.

341
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,579
If there was such a spell,

342
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,018
why would the Emperor Valley exist?

343
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,579
All of the emperors

344
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,218
would like to live forever.

345
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,339
Even Emperor Xingzun,

346
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,778
the most highly cultivated person,

347
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,258
has also turned into dirt now.

348
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,339
But you

349
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:47,258
torture yourself

350
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,018
and get yourself

351
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,819
into a mess over someone

352
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,498
that you've only met once.

353
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,139
Look.

354
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,258
You're just like a moth

355
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:11,978
seeking its own destruction.

356
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,498
But

357
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:15,738
why would you ask Chong Ming

358
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:16,899
to tell me this?

359
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:17,978
That's because

360
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:19,978
I was worried that you wouldn't give up

361
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,379
and keep pestering me.

362
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,419
So I deliberately assigned you
a difficult task

363
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,458
to get you
to extricate yourself from us.

364
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,379
But who knew you'd be in over your head

365
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,619
and kept trying to seek an answer.

366
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,419
What?

367
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:34,419
You lied to me?

368
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,659
This can only prove

369
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,458
that you're silly and reckless.

370
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,298
I hate

371
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,538
people like you.

372
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:43,899
I can't believe you'd be relentless
in asking me

373
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:44,859
to be your master.

374
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,179
This is ridiculous.

375
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,939
I wasn't relentless.

376
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:53,298
I didn't want to come here either.

377
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:54,538
But...

378
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,258
But Chong Ming told me that you...

379
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,538
I know that this is dangerous.

380
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:02,379
But

381
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,218
I thought we were friends.

382
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:05,899
Friends?

383
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,819
I've been in cultivation practice
in this valley for years.

384
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,778
Why would I suddenly be friends

385
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:14,419
with a lady like you
who came out of nowhere?

386
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,018
Do you think you're eligible for that

387
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:19,819
because you've saved me before?

388
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,738
I paid you back
with my spiritual power.

389
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,058
And we call it even.

390
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:32,018
Yes.

391
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,698
We're even.

392
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:36,859
If you dare to come
and pester me again,

393
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,339
I'll move out.

394
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,738
I'll practice what I preach.

395
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:49,218
I won't come here again.

396
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,099
Never.

397
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:24,579
Zhu Yan,

398
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,018
stop wasting your time on a person

399
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,738
who's not worth it.

400
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:52,458
Rest assured.

401
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,738
Prince Shi Yu will do his justice.

402
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,419
I'm sure we can find out
who that man is.

403
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,218
Prince Shi Yu is here.

404
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,939
Greetings, Your Highness Shi Yu.

405
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:24,738
Please rise.

406
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,218
What do you need me for?

407
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,099
Your Highness Shi Yu,

408
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,899
Princess Xuelu reported

409
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,538
that she found a love token

410
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,458
in her sister's room.

411
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,458
We think

412
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,419
it's a serious matter

413
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:42,778
but it can be resolved.

414
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,379
However, we shouldn't make it public.

415
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:47,619
It's more suitable

416
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:49,778
to let you manage this.

417
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,058
Where is the evidence?

418
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:58,659
Your Highness,

419
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,778
(My promise to Xueying deeply rooted within)
this is the thing the man in the mountain

420
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:06,778
gave Princess Xueying from White Clan.

421
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,058
I'm afraid this would be

422
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,738
a sacrilege of Princess's honor.

423
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,179
Please make a wise decision,
Your Highness.

424
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:17,258
How do you prove

425
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:18,819
that this was from a man
in the mountain?

426
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,018
Maybe this was carved

427
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,778
by Princess Xueying's admirer
from Ye City?

428
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:24,698
You don't understand, Your Highness.

429
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,978
This wooden bird is made

430
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:29,379
with Jiuyi Mountain's
unique ancient wood.

431
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:31,179
We can't find it at the other place.

432
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:33,738
So this daring womanizer

433
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,619
must be in Jiuyi Mountain.

434
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,099
Well...

435
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:46,379
Somebody.

436
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,018
Yes.

437
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:49,738
Collect the handwriting

438
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,218
of all immortal officials
and immortal servants in the mountain.

439
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:53,099
Including

440
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,058
the servants who follow the baron

441
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,099
of the Six Ministries here to attend

442
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:58,139
the ceremony.

443
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:00,058
We must find out who he is

444
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:03,018
to seek justice for Princess Xueying.

445
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:04,698
Yes.

446
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,056
(My promise to Xueying
deeply rooted within)

447
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:33,339
No one's handwriting

448
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:34,978
matches the carving on the bird.

449
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:36,899
There must be a misunderstanding.

450
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:38,899
Since we've searched the mountain

451
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,498
and no one's handwriting matches it,

452
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,498
just quit investigating it.

453
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:44,419
Wait.

454
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:50,458
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

455
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,018
I heard

456
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:53,778
there's an immortal official

457
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,819
who meditates alone
at the Emperor Valley.

458
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,498
Is his handwriting

459
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,179
included in it?

460
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:02,579
(So you're the one
who colluded with Ice Clan?)

461
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,659
Azure King, you seem to know

462
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,419
a lot about the mountain.

463
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,698
Indeed, there's an immortal official

464
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:14,419
living in the valley alone.

465
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,978
I'll ask him over now.

466
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,619
Young Lady, you're finally back.

467
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:25,698
Something terrible happened.

468
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:26,859
Rumor has it that Princess Xueying

469
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:28,379
has an affair with a man
in the mountain.

470
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,218
Now, Prince Shi Yu

471
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,339
is interrogating her.

472
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:32,218
Princess Xueying

473
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:34,458
remains silent.

474
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:37,339
Did she already fall in love

475
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:38,538
with the man?

476
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,018
It's only been a few short days.

477
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:44,379
Princess of Bai Family has indeed

478
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:46,339
impressed me.

479
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:51,298
Right, how could she do that?

480
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:52,819
How could she do that?

481
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,139
As the legitimate daughter of White Clan,

482
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,458
I can't believe
she'd live a disorderly life.

483
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,018
That's right.

484
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:57,179
It's embarrassing.

485
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:07,899
Xueying is indeed

486
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:09,819
the legitimate daughter of Bai Family.

487
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:12,778
She's defamed like this

488
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,018
and she still insists
on protecting that man.

489
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,819
Unfortunately, that guy

490
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:25,698
doesn't deserve her.

491
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:32,899
Yan.

492
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:37,498
The person said

493
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,139
that he kept the oath in his heart.

494
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:40,899
He is a man.

495
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,099
Yet, he couldn't step forward

496
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,778
when his loved one was suffering.

497
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,778
You might as well ignore the oath.

498
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:55,258
Come, get up.

499
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:58,698
Well...

500
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,218
At worst,

501
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,298
just go back
to the Extreme Wind City with me.

502
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,258
If he refuses
to take the responsibility,

503
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,058
just spend
the rest of your life with me.

504
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,379
At worst, let's be spinsters together.

505
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:12,458
Let's go.

506
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:13,899
Nonsense.

507
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:14,939
Xueying.

508
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:20,379
It's me.

509
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,179
Well...

510
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,258
It's His Highness.

511
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:34,738
It's His Highness.

512
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:38,778
Well...

513
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,218
Your Highness.

514
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:58,819
My promise to Xueying
deeply rooted within.

515
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:00,659
I carved the line myself.

516
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,258
The person who admires Princess Xueying

517
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:05,899
is me.

518
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:08,819
Your Highness.

519
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:13,498
Well...

520
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:14,379
I was worried

521
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:15,379
that my feelings for Xueying

522
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,458
would bring us

523
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,498
unnecessary troubles.

524
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:19,939
But now, I've come around.

525
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:21,939
As the descendant
of the Imperial Clan,

526
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:23,179
if I couldn't even protect

527
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:24,218
my beloved one,

528
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,058
I might not patch on a commoner.

529
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,538
I admire Bai Xueying.

530
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,619
It's not embarrassing.

531
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:37,058
Your Highness, you...

532
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,258
That's great.

533
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:40,498
Your Highness Shi Yu,

534
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,258
you're indeed the backbone
of the country.

535
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,018
Xueying and Your Highness

536
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:46,738
can be said to be
a match made in heaven.

537
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:47,899
This is a predestined match.

538
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,258
What do you think about it?

539
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:51,458
Qing.

540
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:53,498
Report.

541
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,018
Lord High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

542
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:56,698
the immortal official who meditates
in the Emperor Valley

543
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:58,018
has moved out.

544
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,179
(If you dare to come
and pester me again,)

545
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:03,379
(I'll move out of here.)

546
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,538
(I'll practice what I preach.)

547
00:31:05,778 --> 00:31:06,778
(Darn it.)

548
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:08,419
(What do you)

549
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,058
(take me for?)

550
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:12,978
Young Lady.

551
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,619
- Yan.
- Yan'er.

552
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,099
Yan'er.

553
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,298
She is not feeling well.

554
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:18,778
I'll excuse myself.

555
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:20,339
Be careful.

556
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:21,179
Yan'er.

557
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:21,819
Young Lady.

558
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:23,778
Guys...

559
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,139
Guys...

560
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:26,698
Azure King,

561
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,538
the wooden bird case is solved.

562
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:30,099
It's unnecessary

563
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:31,819
to find an unrelated person.

564
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:33,778
I wonder

565
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,419
if you're satisfied with my decision.

566
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:40,760
High Priest of Grand Preceptor,

567
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:42,339
you're in charge of managing
the affairs of Jiuyi Mountain.

568
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:43,339
Of course

569
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,859
you'll call the shot.

570
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:48,698
I'll excuse myself.

571
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:51,018
Well.

572
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:53,419
Qing.

573
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,778
White King, please stay.

574
00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:55,899
Let's go.

575
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,819
What can I do for you,
High Priest of Grand Preceptor?

576
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,179
White King,
you don't have to be so eager

577
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,179
to marry off your daughter.

578
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,179
Shi Yu is not necessarily

579
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:11,778
the future Crown Prince.

580
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,859
What do you mean by this?

581
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:20,018
Azure King suddenly asked
about the immortal official

582
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,179
who stayed in seclusion in the mountain.

583
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,419
Aren't you curious about it?

584
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,419
Wait until he's born anew,

585
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,379
you won't have

586
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:34,099
to grovel over Azure King anymore.

587
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:36,419
Could he be...

588
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:43,738
As Ring of Houtu is not
in Jiuyi Mountain,

589
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,498
doesn't it bring us to a dead end?

590
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,379
If we want Houtu to show up,

591
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:52,419
we must put
the blood of Kongsang in danger.

592
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,379
There will be ample time.

593
00:32:58,419 --> 00:32:59,698
The blood of the emperor?

594
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,939
I guess Azure King has already

595
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,099
figured the blood of the emperor out.

596
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:08,339
Then, just let him take the lead.

597
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:14,128
(Crimson Residence)

598
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,498
She still won't eat.

599
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,018
Since she left the mountain,

600
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,538
she hasn't eaten anything.

601
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:29,579
If this goes on,

602
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,579
how could her body take this?

603
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,698
What's wrong with Yan'er?

604
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:36,218
Keeper Yuan,

605
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,579
go check on her.

606
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:39,018
Please don't worry.

607
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,698
Maybe Princess has suffered setbacks

608
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,819
when she was in Jiuyi Mountain.

609
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:42,978
Let me go check on her.

610
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:52,379
Princess,

611
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:53,579
it's me.

612
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:55,258
Please come in.

613
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:09,899
Princess.

614
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:13,538
Yuan.

615
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,658
Are you here to persuade me

616
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,978
like the others do?

617
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:21,458
I wish to hear no more.

618
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:23,899
And I don't want to eat.

619
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,419
You're right.

620
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:35,899
How could such bland food

621
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:37,819
fit your taste?

622
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,098
Just forget it.

623
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,138
And this medicine.

624
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:46,779
It's not necessary for you to take it.

625
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,259
It's psychological trouble.

626
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,098
You can say it out if you want.

627
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,538
If you don't want to talk about it,

628
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:08,899
I'll be here

629
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,339
to accompany you quietly.

630
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,618
Yuan,

631
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,578
there's no

632
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:27,259
Primordial Spirit-Gathering Spell
in the world.

633
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,098
This has been my wishful thinking

634
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,379
for the past five years.

635
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,779
I can never see the Crown Prince again.

636
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,058
There's no more hope

637
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:38,538
for me to revive him.

638
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:57,658
A mill cannot grind

639
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,299
with the water that is past.

640
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,058
I'm sure Crown Prince's spirit in heaven

641
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,259
could also feel

642
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:06,819
your painstaking effort.

643
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:08,978
Besides,

644
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:11,699
your spiritual practice has been

645
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:12,658
improved a lot.

646
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,859
And you've broadened your vision.

647
00:36:15,978 --> 00:36:17,498
Though you've failed today.

648
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:18,819
Maybe

649
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,939
there'd be some changes in future.

650
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:24,978
Spiritual practice?

651
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,259
But he said

652
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:29,178
I didn't have

653
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:31,098
the qualification
to learn magic techniques.

654
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:33,299
Who is he?

655
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,538
The person you embroider is...

656
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:46,618
(It's him.)

657
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:48,859
(Why did I embroider his face?)

658
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,618
If you have no appetite,

659
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:01,138
then you'll have

660
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:02,538
to apologize to Chef Wu

661
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:03,578
from Yanfeng Restaurant.

662
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:05,498
Wait.

663
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:08,498
What has Chef Wu got to do with this?

664
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:10,578
When you were

665
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:11,419
in Jiuyi Mountain,

666
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:13,538
Chef Wu developed

667
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,018
several new dishes for you.

668
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:17,498
You must be the first one to try it.

669
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:19,538
Or he won't make it for the others.

670
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:21,018
It's not suitable to store seafood

671
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:21,939
and freshwater fishes

672
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,339
due to the weather
in Western Huang.

673
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:24,939
If you don't show up,

674
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,379
Chef Wu can wait,

675
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:27,819
but I'm afraid those ingredients

676
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,058
can't wait any longer.

677
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:32,578
I didn't even know this.

678
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,739
Then, how did he run his business?

679
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:36,138
He asked me

680
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,339
to convey this message to you.

681
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:39,779
As you didn't go there
for a long time,

682
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:40,859
he found no confidante

683
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:41,859
in the culinary world.

684
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:43,018
He felt so lonely.

685
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,419
You haven't shopped
for a long time, have you?

686
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:56,779
Yes.

687
00:37:57,178 --> 00:38:00,339
I couldn't hang out
after I went to the mountain.

688
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:03,739
Come and check it out.

689
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,178
Is there anything you like?

690
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,178
Here.

691
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:13,618
Thank you, Young Master.

692
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:19,219
It's for you.

693
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:23,578
It's a toy for kids.

694
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:25,259
You liked it so much
when you were little.

695
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:26,779
You lost it once because of me.

696
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:28,259
Take it as compensation.

697
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,458
Thanks, Yuan.

698
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:33,939
I'm feeling a lot better.

699
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:47,859
Here we are.

700
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,178
Mister, you're here.

701
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,098
This way, please.

702
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:53,578
In there, please.

703
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,899
This "Pan Out Well" is made

704
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,058
with the King Kong Fish,
it's buried in the sand

705
00:38:58,259 --> 00:38:59,578
and roasted

706
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:00,939
with the spices from Western Huang.

707
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:02,219
Try it out.

708
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:04,058
It's not easy to make roasted fish.

709
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,779
The time is the crucial point.

710
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,299
Please enjoy it, Princess.

711
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,018
How does it taste?

712
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:14,419
It's delicious.

713
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,739
Not to mention

714
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,098
the seafood.

715
00:39:18,578 --> 00:39:20,899
The fresh prawns and crabs
are put in a steamer.

716
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:24,178
And braise them with the secret sauces.

717
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,578
The prawns and crabs are the essence,

718
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,058
but this soup is

719
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,138
a vital part of the dish.

720
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,779
Pairing it with the liquor,

721
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,138
it gives a different feeling.

722
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:38,578
Please enjoy the food.

723
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,098
How is it?

724
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:44,339
It's nice.

725
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:50,899
Yuan,

726
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,859
someone said
that I'm silly and reckless.

727
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:55,978
I'm not qualified

728
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,178
to learn magic techniques.

729
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,219
Tell me.

730
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:01,098
Am I really that useless?

731
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:03,219
Didn't Salang Eagle

732
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:04,419
already give you

733
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:06,018
the answer to this question?

734
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:09,819
It flies.

735
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,339
Look.

736
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,018
I hope

737
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:21,618
that it can fly farther.

738
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,339
So that no one could

739
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:24,219
capture it again.

740
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:27,978
Princess,

741
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,058
not everything could go smoothly.

742
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,379
No one will achieve their goals
without difficulties.

743
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:32,419
No one can define

744
00:40:32,578 --> 00:40:33,899
the value of that Salang Eagle.

745
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:34,899
Only itself

746
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,018
can define its own value.

747
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:37,058
It doesn't matter

748
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:38,379
if the others say it can't fly.

749
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:40,178
It proves itself through action.

750
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:48,299
I thought

751
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:49,939
I was a friend of him

752
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:51,219
as I saved his life.

753
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:52,978
It's okay if he doesn't want

754
00:40:53,178 --> 00:40:53,859
to teach me magic techniques.

755
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:55,699
But he duped me.

756
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:58,699
I didn't mean to pester him.

757
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:00,498
But he secretly

758
00:41:00,498 --> 00:41:01,419
moved away to avoid me.

759
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,138
He feared you

760
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:04,578
as if you were a monster?

761
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:06,339
No matter what,

762
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:08,458
I, Zhu Yan, am

763
00:41:08,618 --> 00:41:09,819
everyone's favorite

764
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:11,138
in Extreme Wind City.

765
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:13,899
But why does he

766
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,458
see me as a beast?

767
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:16,618
Who is he to do that?

768
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:19,739
I haven't seen him before.

769
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,219
But from the way you describe him,

770
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:23,098
I have a word of advice for you.

771
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:25,339
Shoot it, Yuan.

772
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:27,779
Princess, you're a sentimentalist.

773
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,899
You always have pity on people.

774
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:31,899
You're merciful and kind-hearted.

775
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,899
Of course you'll be generous
to the others.

776
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,299
But some people are cold-hearted.

777
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,699
He's cold and heartless.

778
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:40,018
How could he be kind

779
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,699
to a person who he first met?

780
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:43,538
Besides, he lives in seclusion.

781
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,299
He's used to being alone and quiet.

782
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:46,538
This is not his fault.

783
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,379
Of course it's not your fault either.

784
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:51,578
Yuan,

785
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:53,578
how did you know so much?

786
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:54,379
I've lived in this world

787
00:41:54,538 --> 00:41:55,618
for so long.

788
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:57,699
I certainly know more than you do.

789
00:41:58,498 --> 00:41:59,339
By the way, Yuan,

790
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:00,618
I've been curious

791
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:01,699
about this for a long time.

792
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,859
Answer this question for me.

793
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:04,859
Go ahead.

794
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,578
I'm only a teen now.

795
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:09,939
It's inevitable to sense

796
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:11,138
sadness in the mortal world.

797
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:13,178
But you've lived for so long.

798
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:15,339
Is there anything

799
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,819
that has made you cry before?

800
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:19,339
No.

801
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,618
In the past 200 years,

802
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:23,419
you've never cried
a single tear before?

803
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:26,978
Well, Yuan, let's make a deal.

804
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:27,978
From now on,

805
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,859
I'll tell you about it

806
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:30,859
if I feel sad.

807
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,299
If you're upset,

808
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:33,699
you must tell me that as well.

809
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,259
Like if you cry,

810
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:37,419
you've got to let me know as well.

811
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:38,859
Okay?

812
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:41,458
Sure.

813
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:15,819
I'd like to spend more time with you, mother.

814
00:43:17,058 --> 00:43:18,138
I remember that back then

815
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:20,658
when it was my birthday,

816
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:23,098
you would always

817
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,219
make snow cake for me.

818
00:43:26,058 --> 00:43:28,739
I've tried to make it before.

819
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:30,779
But it just didn't

820
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:33,699
taste the same.

821
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:36,458
Mother,

822
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:42,018
I miss you so much.

823
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:45,299
I'd really like to eat

824
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:46,978
