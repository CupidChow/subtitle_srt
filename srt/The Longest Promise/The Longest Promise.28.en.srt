19
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:01,847
What's this?

20
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:06,847
True dragon's mark.

21
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,687
When the Sea Emperor's blood
is affirmed,

22
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,368
it'll appear on the Sea Emperor's body.

23
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,928
I carry the blood
of the Dragon Clan descendants.

24
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:16,928
The dragon mark represents
the serpent dragon's mark.

25
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,447
At this moment, its appearance

26
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:19,968
is to pay homage to the true dragon.

27
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,648
When you were young,
I hadn't encountered the opportunity.

28
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,407
But it's within reach.

29
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,407
Yet, I didn't even know
you were the Sea Emperor.

30
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,088
What Sea Emperor?

31
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:33,928
This is the mission

32
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,368
the God of Dragon bestowed upon you.

33
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:36,648
No.

34
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:38,328
No!

35
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:40,687
Those two Merfolk marine soldiers

36
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:41,567
also mentioned the Sea Emperor just now.

37
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,007
Merfolk marine soldiers?

38
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,167
They wanted to take our Jade Tears.

39
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:46,687
They even killed my mother.

40
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,088
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,127
I'll protect you.

42
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:55,928
I'll take you

43
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:56,727
to a safe place now.

44
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:03,488
(Oh, no.)

45
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,007
(Elder Jian and the others are coming.)

46
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,447
Time is running out.

47
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,208
I'll take you away from here first.

48
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:10,127
No!

49
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:12,727
I don't want to be the Sea Emperor.

50
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,368
You're just like them.

51
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,847
You're a bad person!

52
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,208
I don't want to be the Sea Emperor!

53
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,488
Let go of me!

54
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:21,328
Put me down!

55
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:22,808
Let me go!

56
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:24,368
Let me...

57
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:36,808
The dragon mark appears on his body.

58
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:39,847
You're indeed the Sea Emperor.

59
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,007
That's right.

60
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:53,687
I'm the Sea Emperor.

61
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:55,167
When did you discover it?

62
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,528
Just a moment ago.

63
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,127
Who is this child?

64
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:04,088
His mother died during the war.

65
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:05,687
He is alone and helpless.

66
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,048
I can only take him with me for now.

67
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,328
Does the mighty Sea Emperor

68
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,847
need to personally take care
of an orphan?

69
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,847
Indeed, it's you.

70
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,568
It seems when the Sea Emperor helps
the weak and the poor,

71
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:28,528
it's the moment when heaven
confirms his identity.

72
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,167
Perhaps, it's as you said.

73
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,367
Since you're the Sea Emperor,

74
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,407
then can you fulfill the promise

75
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:38,847
of giving an explanation you made

76
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:41,607
in Extreme Wind City that day?

77
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,167
You must not betray

78
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,528
Yan'er's trust in you.

79
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:49,607
(My blood is getting warmer.)

80
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,008
(It should be Elder Jian)

81
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:51,688
(getting nearer.)

82
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:54,287
The explanation you want,

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,287
I'll give it to you.

84
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:05,648
Trying to escape, are you?

85
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,008
I'll kill you,

86
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,407
you hypocritical Sea Emperor!

87
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:09,448
Don't hurt the child.

88
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,128
Why did you try to escape
when we asked for an explanation?

89
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,727
How can you live up
to Zhu Yan's expectations?

90
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,167
I should just kill you.

91
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,167
If you kill me now,

92
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:18,888
Kongsang will lose

93
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,847
the only opportunity
to live peacefully with the Merfolk

94
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,528
for the next few thousand years.

95
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:23,968
Shi Ying,

96
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,247
I have my own difficulties
that I can't avoid.

97
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,328
I hope you can trust me one more time

98
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:29,888
for Yan'er's sake.

99
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,328
I didn't expect
after we fought together against Diba,

100
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,448
his magic

101
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,927
has made such great progress.

102
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:43,487
This technique

103
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,807
is the highest secret technique
of the Merfolk Clan.

104
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,367
With your cultivation,

105
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:48,448
you could have killed him

106
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,247
without harming that child

107
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:49,968
in that situation.

108
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:51,607
Don't tell me you still believe
his nonsense.

109
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,088
Or did you show mercy to him

110
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,528
because of Zhu Yan?

111
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,927
We're still unclear if
the Evil Star's return is good or bad.

112
00:05:58,648 --> 00:05:59,568
We need to be more cautious.

113
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,328
Or else it might turn blessings
into misfortune.

114
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:04,407
Just now,

115
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,287
he saw through my thoughts.

116
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,407
That's why he mentioned the coexistence

117
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:09,528
of the Merfolk and Kongsang people.

118
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,328
Whether it's just a response
to the situation

119
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:13,888
or what he truly desires,

120
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,648
I'll need some time

121
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:16,568
to observe and investigate.

122
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,247
If it was a deception,

123
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,768
he may be lucky to escape today.

124
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,047
But if we meet again,

125
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,167
I can still capture him.

126
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:25,247
When that time comes,

127
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,688
don't go soft because of Zhu Yan.

128
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:37,448
Greetings, Priest.

129
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:40,167
Keep searching!

130
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:41,088
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

131
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,367
I heard the Merfolk marine force
was lurking nearby.

132
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,727
So I was ordered to investigate.

133
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:50,727
But after a brief encounter,

134
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,727
they hurriedly escaped

135
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,448
as if they had important matters at hand.

136
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,968
It's different
from their usual fighting style.

137
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:58,487
(They)

138
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,807
(must be following the Sea Emperor.)

139
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,607
Lately, I've heard many rumors about you.

140
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,047
Everyone in the army

141
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,247
praises you

142
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:09,247
and wishes to fight alongside you.

143
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,247
Qing Gang,

144
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,008
I'm a cultivator, an outsider,
to begin with.

145
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,688
Being caught up in these conflicts
is really out of my control.

146
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:17,528
If you hear them talking about it again,

147
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,528
tell them not to mention it anymore.

148
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:24,448
Priest,

149
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,008
may I speak to you in private?

150
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,088
Priest,

151
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:30,487
Prince Shi Yu

152
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:32,047
is currently commanding the army,

153
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,407
and he misses you greatly.

154
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,208
I wonder

155
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,247
if you're willing to meet him.

156
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,607
In recent days, they've been engaging

157
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:14,888
in fierce battles

158
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:16,807
with the Merfolk marine force.

159
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:19,008
But some of them

160
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:20,847
have contracted a strange cold illness.

161
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:22,888
Although it's not serious,

162
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:24,648
it shows no sign of recovery.

163
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:26,727
Even the military physician are helpless.

164
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:30,927
Cold-related illness?

165
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:36,208
Priest,

166
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:37,487
this way, please.

167
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,615
(Extreme Wind City)

168
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,808
The Azure River and Crimson River merge

169
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:46,247
at the lowest point
of the mainland's terrain,

170
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,367
which forms a lake.

171
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,928
The vast lake spans thousands of miles,

172
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,048
known as the Mirror Lake.

173
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
(Mirror Lake)

174
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:57,048
There are many monstrous creatures
and enchanting illusions,

175
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:57,887
making it impossible to cross.

176
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:58,247
Please enter.

177
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
Birds that attempt
to fly over it will fall.

178
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,408
But Merfolk are able to reside within it.

179
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,208
After the Sea Kingdom's downfall,

180
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,847
they often hide
in the depths of the lake

181
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,808
to avoid being captured
by the Kongsang people,

182
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,487
and establishing the base
of the Merfolk marine force.

183
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:11,808
So that's what happened.

184
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:12,288
Yu.

185
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:17,328
It's been a while.

186
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,288
Brother!

187
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:29,647
Am I dreaming?

188
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,247
Did you descend the mountain

189
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:32,928
because you read my letter?

190
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,367
I descended the mountain
for other matters.

191
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:36,408
Yu,

192
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:38,887
I'm glad you're the Crown Prince.

193
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:39,647
No, not at all.

194
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:41,647
I never wanted to be the Crown Prince.

195
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,088
You know me very well.

196
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,088
Since young, I have no talents
to be an emperor

197
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:46,247
or to lead soldiers into battle.

198
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,247
It was Mother who forced me to come.

199
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,568
She said if I don't accomplish
any military merits,

200
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,367
I can never see Bai Xueying again.

201
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,487
This battle shouldn't have happened
in the first place.

202
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,328
When the two clans
live peacefully together,

203
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,928
how prosperous Ye City used to be.

204
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,607
But on my journey here,

205
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,928
all I've seen
are innocent civilians displaced

206
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,568
and struggling to survive.

207
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:09,607
That's right.

208
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,367
The cursed Merfolk marine force
is to be blamed for this.

209
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,367
The Merfolk and Kongsang people

210
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:19,487
are the people of the Menghua Dynasty.

211
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,048
The Merfolk marine force

212
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:23,808
did start the war.

213
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:25,968
But with their strength,

214
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:27,688
they can't even shake

215
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:28,847
Menghua Dynasty's foundation.

216
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,527
If they truly cared
about the well-being of the people,

217
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:32,688
their priority

218
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,328
should be to quickly end the conflict

219
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,048
and not give any opportunity

220
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:37,328
to those with ulterior motives.

221
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,408
By launching a full-scale war like this,

222
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,408
they are only making matters worse,

223
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,688
deepening the divide
between the two clans.

224
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,048
What you said

225
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,048
is exactly what I have in mind.

226
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:48,448
I know starting a war is wrong.

227
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:49,688
But I can't seem to express

228
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:50,408
the reasons behind it.

229
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:52,928
I'll do everything I can

230
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,688
to stop the war from spreading.

231
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:57,527
Yu,

232
00:10:58,328 --> 00:10:59,568
you must also believe in yourself

233
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:01,007
that you can accomplish it.

234
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:02,288
No.

235
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,688
Only you can be a good emperor.

236
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:05,808
Look at me.

237
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,688
I can't even lift a pen or hold a sword.

238
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:09,448
I can't even speak properly.

239
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:10,688
I'm completely useless.

240
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,007
I'm not as good as you said,

241
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,127
and you are not

242
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,887
as terrible as you think you are.

243
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,367
Not only I can't be compared to you.

244
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,647
I'm not as brave as General Qing.

245
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:22,847
His martial skills are outstanding.

246
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:23,847
And he can take on

247
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:24,968
ten enemies at once.

248
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,127
He's the perfect vanguard.

249
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,288
And then there's Bai Fenglin
from the Bai Family,

250
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:30,847
who's clever and skilled
in strategic warfare.

251
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,727
He excels at defeating enemies
without even fighting.

252
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,208
He also gathered

253
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:35,727
important intelligence

254
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,688
by interrogating
the Merfolk marine force.

255
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:37,847
Also,

256
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:39,127
Lan Xiqiao from the Lan Family

257
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,247
and Zi Yaoguang from the Zi Family.

258
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:42,448
When compared to all of you,

259
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:43,527
I really fall short.

260
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:44,887
Shi Yu,

261
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:47,408
to be a good ruler,

262
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,487
it doesn't depend on
charging into battle

263
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,168
or devising strategies.

264
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,448
It's about understanding

265
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:56,688
and utilizing people's talents,

266
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,808
placing them
in the most suitable positions.

267
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,288
And just now,

268
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:01,568
you have shown

269
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,968
that you have this ability.

270
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:05,408
Me?

271
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:06,367
That's right.

272
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,168
Those in power should never
be stubborn and self-centered.

273
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:10,767
You have a keen eye for judging people

274
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,928
and are good
at recognizing others' strengths.

275
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:14,487
With more experience,

276
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:15,968
over time,

277
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:17,448
you'll undoubtedly

278
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:18,727
become a wise ruler

279
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,688
who understands the people
and maximizes their abilities.

280
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,048
This is the prescription I developed

281
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,527
for the soldiers suffering
from the cold disease.

282
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:36,408
After I leave,

283
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:37,727
just follow this prescription.

284
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:41,127
Given time, they will surely recover.

285
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,727
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

286
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:47,007
on behalf of the soldiers, thank you.

287
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:56,448
General Qing,

288
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:58,887
do you have something to say?

289
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,808
Lately, there have been
many rumors circulating

290
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,448
about what Princess Zhu Yan did
in Western Huang.

291
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,007
Rumors?

292
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:10,887
It was a rumor

293
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:12,887
about Princess Zhu Yan eloping with you

294
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,168
in Western Huang.

295
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:18,808
(Master.)

296
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:23,088
We have to separate
after a brief meeting.

297
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,607
I feel reluctant.

298
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,448
Why not take me

299
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:29,247
with you wherever you go?

300
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:30,928
I'll follow you

301
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,168
to the ends of the earth.

302
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:38,408
It's just some hearsay circulating
among the people.

303
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,367
But after Consort Qing heard of it,

304
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,968
she summoned Princess Zhu Yan
to the palace for a lesson.

305
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,727
Today is the day she enters the palace.

306
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,367
Consort Qing?

307
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:50,448
Who are these people

308
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:52,727
to gossip about my disciple?

309
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,360
(Renwei Gate)

310
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:00,048
Who are you?

311
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,208
Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain.

312
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:04,048
I've come to the palace on my own
to be reprimanded.

313
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:05,767
His Majesty did not summon you
to the palace.

314
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:06,688
Priest of Grand Preceptor,

315
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:07,647
please leave.

316
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,088
The Princess of the Crimson Clan
was summoned to be reprimanded,

317
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,568
and it's all because of me.

318
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,247
Since it concerns both of us,

319
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,727
it's unreasonable
to punish only one person.

320
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,600
(Renwei Gate)

321
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,168
I, Princess Zhu Yan of the Crimson Clan,

322
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,487
greet Your Highness.

323
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:41,727
May Your Highness be blessed
with eternal peace.

324
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,408
You are truly as your name suggests,

325
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,727
beautiful and a captivating smile.

326
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,767
You're indeed a budding beauty.

327
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,208
(What kind of act is she putting on?)

328
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:03,887
Why aren't you replying to me?

329
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,208
You're right, Your Highness.

330
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,887
And I thought Princess Zhu Yan

331
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,048
is omnipotent.

332
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,367
It turns out

333
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,127
she's just

334
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:16,568
a clueless country girl.

335
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:19,448
It's your father's fault

336
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,847
for keeping you hidden all this while.

337
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,688
I didn't even know among the Six Clans,

338
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,808
there was a woman like you,

339
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,007
who's beautiful, talented,

340
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,408
and has impeccable demeanor.

341
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:31,647
As fate would have it,

342
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,527
you've perfectly matched my preferences.

343
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,487
(She's showing her real colors now.)

344
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:38,088
(I'm sure she's up to no good.)

345
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,088
What do you think?

346
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:43,367
It's all my fault.

347
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,247
As the only daughter
of a prestigious family,

348
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,367
I believe you wouldn't disregard

349
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,367
the dignity of your parents

350
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,688
and engage in such improper behavior.

351
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,767
I wonder
if it was the Priest of Grand Preceptor

352
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,607
who misled you to speak this way.

353
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:03,647
If you can honestly tell me everything

354
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:06,647
about how the Priest of Grand Preceptor
had seduced you,

355
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,847
I promise not to punish you.

356
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:11,007
(I get it now.)

357
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:12,968
(She wants to use me)

358
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:13,847
(to frame Master.)

359
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:19,527
Furthermore, considering
that Yu is the Crown Prince,

360
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,408
it's my selfish desire as his mother

361
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,408
to find several talented
and virtuous women

362
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,328
as his potential matches

363
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:28,328
to continue the royal line.

364
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:30,647
With your appearance,

365
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,168
you'll undoubtedly stand

366
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,688
by the side of esteemed
and noble individuals in the future.

367
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:38,808
I'll accept any punishment
from Your Highness.

368
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:39,847
You...

369
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:41,968
How dare you!

370
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:46,727
Your Highness is right.

371
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:47,928
It's all my fault.

372
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,448
You can punish me as you please,
Your Highness.

373
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,607
Is this all you can say?

374
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:54,448
Your Highness is correct.

375
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:55,647
It's all my fault.

376
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,048
You can punish me as you please,
Your Highness.

377
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,928
Do you think a few things you said

378
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,088
means I can't do anything to you

379
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,367
because I can't find anything
against you?

380
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:03,727
Listen.

381
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,648
I can still rip your mouth.

382
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,007
My hand...

383
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:24,007
Master.

384
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,208
It's you.

385
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,807
How dare you trespass
on my Qingyun Palace

386
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:30,648
and humiliate me.

387
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:31,968
When it comes to audacity,

388
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,487
I'm not comparable to you, Consort Qing.

389
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,128
Relying solely on rumors,

390
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,648
you abused your power
and resorted to private punishment.

391
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,368
People have witnessed

392
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,608
and heard the disgraceful acts

393
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:43,527
both of you have committed.

394
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,727
The physician who attended
to the late Consort Zi

395
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,247
during her difficult childbirth
several years ago

396
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,128
was sent by Consort Qing herself.

397
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:56,327
Not only the Huotu Tribe,

398
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,968
but various tribes
from the Western Huang

399
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,047
frequently send confidential letters
to Consort Qing.

400
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:03,888
Outrageous lies!

401
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:05,247
What sorcery

402
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,047
have you used on them?

403
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,128
To believe rumors so easily

404
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,007
is too simplistic.

405
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,168
(This must be
the Mind-reading Spell)

406
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:14,408
(that Master refused to show me.)

407
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:15,767
(It's astonishing.)

408
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,327
Yan'er,

409
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,007
let's go!

410
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:17,487
Guards,

411
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:18,928
stop them!

412
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,087
His Majesty has arrived!

413
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:20,968
Stop.

414
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,888
Where are you going?

415
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,327
I, Priest of Grand Preceptor of Jiuyi,
shall take my leave.

416
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:34,337
Are you

417
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:37,658
leaving now?

418
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:40,978
Your Majesty,

419
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,178
you must speak up for me.

420
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:45,258
This Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain

421
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:46,698
disregards imperial authority

422
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,577
and dares to intrude into
my Qingyun Palace

423
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:49,778
and threaten me.

424
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:51,738
If this continues,

425
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:53,857
the entire Jialan Imperial City

426
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,857
may fall into a dangerous state.

427
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:56,418
Silence!

428
00:18:58,498 --> 00:18:59,498
If you didn't cause trouble,

429
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:01,817
how would he have come?

430
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:06,258
I suggest you refrain
from stirring up trouble.

431
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:07,978
I want to have

432
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:09,778
a private conversation with him.

433
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:11,097
You can leave.

434
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:19,658
Yes, Your Majesty.

435
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:35,778
You may rise.

436
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:39,495
So this is the disciple you've taken in?

437
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:41,814
You have a good eye.

438
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,495
Please refrain from joking,
Your Majesty.

439
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,134
When I look at your eyes,

440
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:02,015
they are exactly like mine in the past.

441
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:06,094
If there's nothing else,

442
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:07,614
I humbly take my leave.

443
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:09,455
After so many years apart,

444
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,535
don't you have anything

445
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:14,854
to say to me?

446
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,894
I have nothing
to say to you, Your Majesty.

447
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,215
I shall take my leave.

448
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:23,174
Stop!

449
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:27,455
I didn't punish you for deceiving me.

450
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,334
Yet, you repay me

451
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,215
with such disrespect?

452
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:33,935
Shi Ying.

453
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,334
Only the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain is here.

454
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:40,535
There's no one called by that name here.

455
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:43,775
Great.

456
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:47,614
Just great.

457
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,015
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain, huh?

458
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:54,814
You cultivators

459
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,775
are known for following etiquette,

460
00:20:57,614 --> 00:21:00,695
respecting the bond
between parents and children.

461
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:02,894
If you don't repay
your parents' kindness,

462
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:04,695
you won't attain enlightenment.

463
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:05,975
Today,

464
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,094
as your father,

465
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:16,854
I want you to repay my kindness.

466
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,414
Do you think cutting your hair

467
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,134
can repay my kindness?

468
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:14,535
In my heart,

469
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:16,654
there's no longer any debt of gratitude.

470
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:22,134
Do you still think

471
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:23,894
of me as your father?

472
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:29,414
Your Majesty,

473
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:30,574
you only blame Master

474
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:31,854
for not treating you as his father.

475
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:33,574
But all these years,

476
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,695
have you truly treated him as your son?

477
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:40,854
I was at the palace that day.

478
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,414
I even ran into Lady Qiushui.

479
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:44,975
The incident that day
was not caused by the Crown Prince.

480
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:46,894
I was young and ignorant.

481
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,735
I accidentally knocked
into Lady Qiushui's carriage

482
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,094
and almost received punishment.

483
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:51,975
It was the Crown Prince who protected me

484
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:53,174
and even gave me a flower as a gift.

485
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:55,614
He treated a stranger child

486
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,174
with kindness and politeness.

487
00:22:58,414 --> 00:22:58,854
Besides,

488
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,094
Lady Qiushui was already being punished
to copy scriptures.

489
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,215
Why would the Crown Prince
need to resort to killing her?

490
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,094
This action doesn't make sense
no matter how one sees it.

491
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:06,775
Zhu Yan,

492
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:08,374
enough!

493
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:09,894
Because of Lady Qiushui's incident,

494
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,935
people all over the world despised
and cursed him,

495
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,174
calling him immoral
and deserving to die.

496
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:16,975
And as the Emperor

497
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:17,975
and his father,

498
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:19,614
instead of investigating
the truth thoroughly,

499
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:21,735
you hurt him the most.

500
00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:25,854
Talking about this matter
with the opinions of the world is useless.

501
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,055
You're the cause of this, Your Majesty.

502
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,614
So you should've clarified this matter.

503
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:38,174
If I'm punished because of this,

504
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:40,334
I have no complaints or regrets.

505
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:48,775
Since you disregard
the father-son relationship,

506
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,255
I have no choice but to follow the law

507
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,174
and punish you for the crime
of deceiving the emperor.

508
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,055
The Crown Prince didn't
have a funeral back then.

509
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:01,215
No one in the world

510
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,374
could talk about his life or death.

511
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,695
If a person
doesn't have a memorial tablet, funeral,

512
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:08,535
or announcement of his death,

513
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,015
how can he be considered dead?

514
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,495
Then the Crown Prince was never dead.

515
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:14,935
Appearing now is only natural
and reasonable.

516
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,695
How can this be considered
deceiving the emperor?

517
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,495
Is this something you can say?

518
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:26,854
Look at that.

519
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,255
Look at your disciple.

520
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,574
Just as defiant as you.

521
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:31,735
Guards!

522
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:32,854
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:34,134
Take her away

524
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:36,134
and flog her forty times!

525
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:36,574
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:37,255
Wait!

527
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,215
This is my fault.

528
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,015
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

529
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:42,975
Your Majesty,

530
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:44,574
please do not redirect
your anger toward others.

531
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:48,654
I entered the palace without permission.

532
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:50,094
That's the first crime.

533
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:51,894
I showed disrespect toward authority.

534
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:53,334
That's the second crime.

535
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,374
I failed to discipline my disciple.

536
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:56,695
That's the third crime.

537
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:59,775
Your Majesty, please count the crimes
and give appropriate punishment.

538
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:07,215
You're an Immortal Official

539
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,374
who's not involved in worldly matters.

540
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:13,535
But she's not.

541
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:15,695
She offended the Emperor.

542
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,174
And the evidence of her crime is clear.

543
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:20,935
Her crimes implicate her parents,

544
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:22,255
her children,

545
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:23,535
and her spouse.

546
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,295
Masters and disciples aren't included.

547
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:27,174
So tell me.

548
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,094
Who are you to her

549
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:31,015
to accept the punishment on her behalf?

550
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:35,854
You have nothing to say, right?

551
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,134
I know spiritual cultivators like you

552
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,255
are unrestricted by worldly constraints.

553
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:43,574
You can even disregard the law

554
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:44,255
and take her away.

555
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:47,614
Then let everyone from Crimson Residence

556
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:49,775
take the punishment

557
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:51,614
in her place.

558
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:52,455
Your Majesty!

559
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:53,334
Master,

560
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:55,174
stop pleading for me.

561
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:04,894
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

562
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,814
It's an honor

563
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,174
to be convicted guilty of this matter.

564
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,174
A small action
can have far-reaching consequences.

565
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:18,455
The repercussions of one person
can serve as a warning to the people.

566
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:22,535
I shall grant your request.

567
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:24,975
You shall bear this punishment alone.

(I'll never let you down)

599
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:53,174
(in this lifetime.)

600
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:27,495
Ying.

601
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:31,295
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.

602
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,334
I have found the Sea Emperor.

603
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,975
How did you determine his identity?

604
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:40,894
He matched the time and place

605
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:42,495
predicted by orrery.

606
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,134
And the dragon's mark
was revealed on his face.

607
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:46,854
He even used Merfolk Clan's
supreme secret technique.

608
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,094
Did you capture him?

609
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,015
The situation was complicated
at the time.

610
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:54,814
So I intentionally let him go.

611
00:30:57,094 --> 00:30:58,614
You should've gotten rid of him
at that time.

612
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,574
If he's indeed as you say,

613
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,814
this person should be eliminated
as soon as possible.

614
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:07,775
Your Supreme Majesty,

615
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:11,334
now that the Evil Star
has become weak and dim,

616
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:13,094
whether it's good or bad,

617
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:14,614
the threat to Kongsang

618
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:15,894
has greatly diminished.

619
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:18,134
Currently, it's difficult to tell

620
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,094
whether he's a friend or a foe.

621
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:20,814
I have a feeling

622
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:23,374
that I'll meet this person again soon.

623
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:25,894
At that time, I will definitely

624
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,295
uncover the truth

625
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,094
and provide an explanation to the world.

626
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:30,495
Good.

627
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:34,814
If the matter with Evil Star is resolved,

628
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:38,574
you'll have achieved
an unparalleled feat.

629
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,334
Ying,

630
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,654
if you return to the mortal world
at that time...

631
00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:44,495
Your Supreme Majesty.

632
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:46,455
When that day comes,

633
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,654
I'll leave the priesthood.

634
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:52,574
I'm glad

635
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:54,695
that you're willing
to descend the mountain.

636
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:58,495
However, leaving the priesthood

637
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:00,374
will subject you
to the Tribulations of Hell

638
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,134
to endure countless trials
and sufferings.

639
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,695
At that time, it'll be a matter
of life and death.

640
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,935
I've made up my mind.

641
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:11,775
All right.

642
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:14,535
So be it.

643
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:17,854
Your Supreme Majesty,

644
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:19,894
leaving the priesthood

645
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:21,814
doesn't mean I'll return
to the imperial court.

646
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:25,295
I only wish to live a carefree life

647
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:26,614
for the rest of my life.

648
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,854
To live a carefree life
for the rest of your life?

649
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,735
Since the establishment
of Jiuyi Mountain,

650
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:35,414
you're the most accomplished cultivator.

651
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,614
Are you sacrificing
your supreme cultivation

652
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,614
and using your hard-earned freedom

653
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:43,215
only to hide

654
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,055
in the mountains and wilderness?

655
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:46,695
You're destined

656
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:48,975
to revive Kongsang.

657
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:51,055
I don't have the grand ambitions

658
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:52,695
that you have expected of me.

659
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:54,854
I only hope that from now on,

660
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:56,215
I don't let others down

661
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:57,695
and remain true to myself.

662
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,055
The urgent matter at hand

663
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:09,975
is to handle the matter
with the Evil Star.

664
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:12,055
The fate of the world

665
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,055
lies in your thoughts.

666
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,695
I'll do my best.

667
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:37,055
(Since I can make you leave
the priesthood,)

668
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,614
(what happens after this)

669
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,055
(is not up to you.)

670
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,334
Father,

671
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:44,495
I only said

672
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:45,574
what you asked me to.

673
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:47,174
So, you see?

674
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,055
Consort Qing indeed
couldn't find any reason

675
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,334
to accuse the Crimson Clan.

676
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:52,854
But unfortunately,

677
00:33:53,455 --> 00:33:54,894
I couldn't hold myself back

678
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:55,735
in front of His Majesty.

679
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:58,094
Ouch!

680
00:33:58,134 --> 00:33:58,894
- Don't move.
- Lie still.

681
00:33:59,015 --> 00:33:59,574
- Stay still.
- Don't move.

682
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:00,654
Stay still.

683
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:01,854
I knew you would act up.

684
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:02,854
I've been cleaning up your mess

685
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,334
since you were a child.

686
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:05,774
I'm already used to it.

687
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:07,455
But this time,

688
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:09,174
you were too bold.

689
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,574
What if His Majesty gets angry

690
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:12,375
and beheads you?

691
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:15,694
Your impulsive nature

692
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,694
of speaking without thinking.

693
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,895
When can you change it?

694
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:23,094
Am I not fine now?

695
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,375
Father,

696
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:27,895
why is my room

697
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:28,895
exactly like the one

698
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:29,855
in Extreme Wind City?

699
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,415
It's because your father pities you.

700
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,055
He's worried
that you don't sleep well here.

701
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,654
So he turned this room

702
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,694
just like your room

703
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:39,335
in Extreme Wind City.

704
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:41,055
Father.

705
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:42,614
Mother.

706
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,495
Please don't worry about me anymore.

707
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:45,895
Don't worry.

708
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:47,774
I won't do it again.

709
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:48,694
All right.

710
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:49,415
As long as you remember this.

711
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:50,094
Don't forget what you said.

712
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,055
Your Lordship. Your Ladyship.

713
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:51,895
Lord Priest of Grand Preceptor

714
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:53,015
is here to visit Princess.

715
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:55,895
Master is here.

716
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:00,774
- Greetings, Priest of Grand Preceptor.
- Greetings, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

717
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:02,734
Your Lordship.

718
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:03,574
Your Ladyship.

719
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,134
It's my fault

720
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:06,495
for implicating your daughter.

721
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,214
You're her master

722
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,015
who saved her
from danger multiple times.

723
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,294
It's natural for Yan'er

724
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:11,935
to defend you

725
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,335
in front of His Majesty.

726
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,774
I've brought some medicine
from Jiuyi Mountain.

727
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:20,614
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

728
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:22,415
Thank you.

729
00:35:35,495 --> 00:35:35,975
Yan'er,

730
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:37,574
you mustn't behave like this anymore

731
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:38,495
in the future.

732
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:40,815
Don't worry.

733
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:43,614
His Majesty probably

734
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:44,294
won't want to see me again.

735
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:46,535
Master,

736
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:48,174
it's actually a good thing.

737
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:50,015
If others find out

738
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:51,895
that I dared to offend even the Emperor,

739
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,774
they won't trouble me anymore.

740
00:35:58,134 --> 00:35:59,134
Here, drink the decoction.

741
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:04,935
Master,

742
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:06,375
I should do it myself.

743
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:08,335
My hands aren't injured.

744
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:09,455
Be careful.

745
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,375
Just let me do it.

746
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:22,774
Here, be careful.

747
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,614
Let me serve you instead.

748
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,294
My hand slipped.

749
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:36,335
Forgive me.

750
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:37,654
Stop!

751
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:39,375
I said

752
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:40,535
if you go any further,

753
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:41,574
you will...

754
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,654
I told you to stop talking.

755
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:48,094
It's better to change into clean clothes.

756
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:48,815
Stop!

757
00:36:59,254 --> 00:36:59,734
Master,

758
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,134
it's just some flesh wounds.

759
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:04,415
You don't have to worry too much about me.

760
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:10,975
There are already clues
about the Evil Star.

761
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:13,335
I was just about to tell you

762
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:15,214
that Keeper Yuan

763
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,214
is the one I've been searching for,
the one referred to by the Evil Star

764
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:19,574
as the Sea Emperor.

765
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:20,694
What?

766
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:23,174
Yuan is the Sea Emperor?

767
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:24,214
Yes,

768
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:25,774
I've confirmed it.

769
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:29,535
Over seven thousand years ago,

770
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:31,774
when Emperor Xingzun unified Yunhuang,

771
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:35,895
the Merfolk and Kongsang people
lived in peace.

772
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,574
But because the Merfolk Clan

773
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:38,375
lacked

774
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:40,055
a truly powerful leader

775
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:43,094
that they never rose to prominence.

776
00:37:44,254 --> 00:37:46,375
The Sea Emperor became the only hope

777
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:47,415
for the Merfolk Clan.

778
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,015
We're uncertain

779
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:50,335
if the one Evil Star pointed out
is good or bad.

780
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:52,975
The Sea Emperor's attitude

781
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:54,294
becomes the key.

782
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:56,535
If he is

783
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,174
a cruel and warlike person,

784
00:37:58,855 --> 00:37:59,734
the whole Yunhuang

785
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:01,774
will be engulfed in a war.

786
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:03,535
If he is

787
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:04,774
a compassionate person,

788
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:06,935
the two clans can continue

789
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,654
to live in peace.

790
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:10,055
Yan'er,

791
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,254
you know the Sea Emperor.

792
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:13,975
Based on your understanding of him,

793
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:16,015
what kind of person is he?

794
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,214
If Yuan is truly the Sea Emperor,

795
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:21,094
that means Evil Star

796
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:22,574
is a great sign to Kongsang

797
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,055
because he's
the most kind-hearted person,

798
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,574
he never speaks harshly to others.

799
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,935
Every year, he takes me
to release birds and animals.

800
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,055
Everyone in Extreme Wind City

801
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,455
knows that.

802
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:38,815
So you often accompany him

803
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:40,935
to release birds and animals, huh?

804
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:42,015
Yes.

805
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:43,855
Before I ascended Jiuyi Mountain,

806
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:45,134
we would go every year.

807
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:47,455
The same year I became your disciple,

808
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:49,254
we also released the Salang Eagle...

809
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:53,975
Yan'er, are you all right?

810
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:54,935
I'm fine.

811
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,254
It's my fault

812
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,495
for getting too excited.

813
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:58,975
It's all my fault

814
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:00,895
that you suffered such a serious injury.

815
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,614
Yet, I kept asking you.

816
00:39:03,214 --> 00:39:03,975
It's not that, Master.

817
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,855
Actually, the things you asked

818
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,895
are the things I've kept in my heart.

819
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:10,574
To others,

820
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:12,815
they may see Yuan

821
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:13,734
as just fulfilling his duties
as a keeper.

822
00:39:14,574 --> 00:39:15,694
But only I know

823
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:17,495
the depth of his feelings.

824
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,375
In his heart,

825
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,294
I'm his friend,

826
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:22,694
younger sister,

827
00:39:23,214 --> 00:39:23,734
and family.

828
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:27,015
Master, I'm Kongsang people.

829
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,294
If Yuan discriminates

830
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,734
against the Kongsang people,

831
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,015
he wouldn't have done

832
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,055
what he did.

833
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:34,614
I understand now.

834
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:37,935
Besides, I believe that good and evil

835
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,614
cannot be determined by race.

836
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:41,614
Just like
there are unscrupulous individuals

837
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:43,654
among the Kongsang people.

838
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,214
There are also righteous
and generous people

839
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,415
among the Merfolk.

840
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:50,015
So as long as you're willing

841
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,055
to sit down and talk with Yuan,

842
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:54,094
I believe

843
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,134
that the decision you two make

844
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:56,774
will bring happiness to the world

845
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,015
and blessings to Yunhuang.

846
00:39:59,094 --> 00:39:59,815
I'm staying

847
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:01,654
in my mother's old house
in the east of the city.

848
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,094
If he's willing to come,

849
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:04,495
I'll prepare tea and await his arrival.

850
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:09,294
You rest well for now.

851
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,614
I'll come and visit you another day.

852
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:13,335
All right.

853
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:21,094
Yan'er,

854
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:23,654
if you like releasing animals,

855
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:26,535
I can accompany you after this.

856
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:27,734
What do you think?

857
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:29,455
Really?

858
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:32,574
Don't move too much

859
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,015
or the wound may come apart.

860
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,015
Or else drinking the bitter decoction
would be in vain.

861
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,935
You sure are insightful.

862
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:50,535
Isn't this Master White?

863
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,935
Today, let Master White

864
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,654
supervise you to rest well.

865
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:04,654
Master White.

866
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,614
Is this child really the Sea Emperor?

867
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,375
Logically speaking,
the dragon mark should appear

868
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,455
and fade after a month.

869
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:21,214
But why is there

870
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:22,815
not a trace of it on his body?

871
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:27,174
He refuses to admit
that he's the Sea Emperor.

872
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:29,294
So the dragon mark didn't appear.

873
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:31,254
That was how I was able to trick
the Priest of the Grand Preceptor

874
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:33,134
and make him believe
that I'm the Sea Emperor.

875
00:41:34,815 --> 00:41:36,174
But the blood of the Sea Emperor in him

876
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,094
has already awakened.

877
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:39,214
That's why his high fever won't go away.

878
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,455
Then we should send him

879
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,015
to the nearby Quanke Village
for treatment.

880
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:44,535
I know
there's a highly skilled physician

881
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:45,734
in the village.

882
00:41:46,094 --> 00:41:47,535
Ordinary Merfolk physicians
are of no use.

883
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,335
How could they heal

884
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:50,935
someone with the Dragon Blood's power
accumulated for seven thousand years?

885
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:53,694
Would the Sea Emperor be in danger?

886
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:55,375
Die.

887
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,774
The entire Merfolk marine force
deserves to die.

888
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,094
I'll kill all of you.

889
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,335
Why...

890
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:07,855
Why is this child

891
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:08,734
saying such nonsense?

892
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:10,855
If I were his age

893
00:42:11,935 --> 00:42:13,335
and witnessed my own mother

894
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:14,375
being killed
by the Merfolk marine force,

895
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,015
I would also consider
the Merfolk marine force

896
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:17,975
as lifelong enemies,

897
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:19,734
to be killed without mercy.

898
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:23,174
How could this happen?

899
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:26,455
Ruyi.

900
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,015
Deep down in your heart,

901
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:30,654
you also know Elder Jian's actions

902
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:31,895
are wrong

903
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:33,214
and you don't agree

904
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:34,455
with him causing

905
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:36,174
unnecessary sacrifices
of our Merfolk brethren.

906
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:37,335
Am I right?

907
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,455
But

908
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:42,734
Elder Jian has been leading
the Merfolk marine force

909
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:43,935
for hundreds of years.

910
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,455
They've never given up

911
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:46,375
on reviving our country.

912
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:49,694
Perhaps now that we've found the Sea Emperor,

913
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:50,774
everything will change.

914
00:42:51,254 --> 00:42:52,254
They keep talking

915
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:52,935
about reviving the country.

916
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:54,455
But now,

917
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:55,895
the lives of countless Merfolk

918
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:56,935
like Sumo

919
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,174
were destroyed by them.

920
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,935
Sumo may be the Sea Emperor.

921
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:02,415
But he's still a child.

922
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:05,614
Ruyi,

923
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,815
I failed to protect you in the past.

924
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:10,975
But now, I want to protect him.

925
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,055
I absolutely cannot

926
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,495
let him fall into the hands
of the Merfolk marine force.

927
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:17,094
But this child's body

928
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,455
can't hold on for much longer.

929
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:21,694
If she makes a move,

930
00:43:23,654 --> 00:43:24,815
Sumo will be saved.

931
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:32,375
Wipe them all out.

932
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:44,134
Young Lady, why are you up?

933
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,214
Have you forgotten
you're seriously injured?

934
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:47,895
Before my master left,

935
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,015
he transferred spiritual power to me

936
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:49,774
to heal my injuries.

937
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:52,174
I'm much better now.

938
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:55,294
I feel full of strength
throughout my body.

939
00:43:58,614 --> 00:43:59,415
Is this for me?

940
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:00,415
Yes.

941
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,214
I picked this up at the door.

942
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,094
(An old acquaintance hopes
for a meeting.)

943
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,614
(An old acquaintance hopes
for a meeting.)

944
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:12,415
(It's from Yuan.)

945
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:14,694
