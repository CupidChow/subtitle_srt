1
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,850
(Huotu Tribe)

2
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,550
(Zhu Yan, Princess of the Crimson Clan)

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,120
God of Fire above,
a feast of good fortune.

4
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,400
(Lord Ke'erke, Huotu Tribe)

5
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,239
(Great Consort, Huotu Tribe)
Best wishes for a long harmonious relationship.

6
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Best wishes
for a long harmonious relationship.

7
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
I heard the Princess of Crimson Clan

8
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,959
is not willing to be married here.

9
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,880
That princess' heart

10
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,480
belongs to someone else.

11
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,160
But this wedding was granted

12
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,639
by the Sovereign Lord.

13
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,720
If she refuses to marry,

14
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,239
it'll anger the heaven,

15
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,119
and the whole Crimson Clan

16
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,519
will be implicated.

17
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,679
Young Lady,

18
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,359
it's not too late to stop this.

19
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,760
Young Lady,

20
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,639
you can never return

21
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,720
once you step out

22
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,239
of this tent.

23
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
His Lordship and Her Ladyship
are not young anymore.

24
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,320
You're their only daughter.

25
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,280
Do you really have the heart
to abandon them?

26
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,920
Even if I stayed here,

27
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,200
I can never see them

28
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,200
in this lifetime either.

29
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,280
It's no different than being dead.

30
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,319
Deliver the wedding gifts!

31
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,759
Enter the tent!

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,119
I will never marry

33
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
someone I don't love.

34
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,640
Young Lady, but

35
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,600
the person you like

36
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,439
will never marry you in this life.

37
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:40,879
Young Lady.

38
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,799
Silence.

39
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,999
Please receive the wedding gifts,
Your Highness.

40
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,319
First bow.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,080
Second bow.

42
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,040
Third bow.

43
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
Best wishes
for a long harmonious relationship.

44
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,640
Exchange nuptial wine!

45
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,199
Sand Demon! Run!

46
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,520
Run for your lives!

47
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Run!

48
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,439
(Finally,)

49
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,239
(no one will force me)

50
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,600
(to marry again in this life.)

51
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:13,759
Who's there?

52
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,878
(Shi Ying,
Priest of Grand Preceptor of Jiuyi Mountain)

53
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,959
Master.

54
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,040
How...

55
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,479
How could you do this

56
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,719
to the gift I gave you?

57
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,240
Master,

58
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,880
what brought you here
out of a sudden?

59
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,839
I...

60
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,880
I thought

61
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,439
I would never see you again

62
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,439
in this life.

63
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,559
Didn't you invite me

64
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,199
to your wedding feast?

65

=The Longest Promise=
(Adapted from "Zhu Yan" by Cang Yue)

81
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,400
=The Longest Promise=
=Episode 1=

82
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,360
(Within the heaven and earth)

83
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,200
(and the four seas,)

84
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,680
(White Tower,)
(there's a sacred land called, Yunhuang.)

85
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,070
(Jialan Imperial City of the Kongsang)
(there's a sacred land called, Yunhuang.)

86
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,319
(The Kongsang Clan,)

87
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:15,679
(Merfolk,)

88
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,760
(and the Ice Clan)

89
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,839
(have lived here for generations.)

90
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
(Seven thousand years ago,)

91
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,479
(Lang Gan of Kongsang intended
to unify Yunhuang.)

92
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,160
(Yet, the God of Destruction)

93
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,719
(incited evil thoughts)

94
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,199
(for selfish gain.)

95
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
(Bewitched by the God of Destruction,)

96
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,520
(internal strife arises
among the six vassals of Kongsang,)

97
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
(external pressure comes
from the Merfolk marine force,)

98
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,559
(and the Ten Sorcerers of the Ice Clan,
repeatedly start an uprising.)

99
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,799
(Yunhuang)

100
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,640
(is about to fall into war again.)

101
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,479
(But if god takes pleasure)

102
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,400
(in seeing the world destroyed,)

103
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,880
(how does he deserve
to be worshipped by the world?)

104
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,760
(It's unprecedented for a mortal)

105
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,160
(to kill a god since ancient times.)

106
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,000
(Then let me,)

107
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,799
(Shi Ying, be the first.)

108
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,550
(Shi Ying, Crown Prince of Kongsang)

109
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,760
(Zhu Yan, Princess of the Crimson Clan)
(The wind sounds like a bell.)

110
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,199
(The flowers fall like snow.)

111
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,040
(The Snowy Rosa
in Jialan Imperial Palace)

112
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,280
(is so beautiful.)

113
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,199
This flower looks the prettiest.

114
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,240
It's perfect for Crown Prince.

115
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
Mister,

116
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,760
was it you who helped me?

117
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,640
You said you wanted
to give this flower to Crown Prince.

118
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,719
Do you know him?

119
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,640
I'll eventually know him

120
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,679
after I give him this flower.

121
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,959
You want to see him?

122
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,079
Why?

123
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
As the Princess of the Crimson Clan,

124
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,199
I should learn
some powerful magic techniques

125
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,400
to protect Western Huang.

126
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,719
But Father always forbids it.

127
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,280
He said a lady like me

128
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,280
should enjoy tea and do some needlework

129
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,959
like other princesses.

130
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,679
He said it's enough to learn

131
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,479
some defense magic techniques.

132
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,280
That's why

133
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,839
I want to see Crown Prince

134
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,599
so he permits me
to learn magic techniques.

135
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,719
That way, Father wouldn't dare

136
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,400
to forbid me from learning.

137
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,160
Why didn't you ask Emperor
for permission instead?

138
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,920
Emperor and Father are no different.

139
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm afraid all Emperor will say is

140
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,240
what a lady should and shouldn't do.

141
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,240
But Crown Prince is different.

142
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,640
They said he's favored by heaven.

143
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,920
A young promising man
who keeps improving.

144
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm sure he'll understand my feelings.

145
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,679
Her Highness, the Empress has arrived.

146
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,799
Mister,

147
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,959
I have to take my leave now.

148
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,439
We shall meet again if time allows.

149
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,120
"A young promising man
who keeps improving."

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,808
(Bai Yan, the Empress of Kongsang)

151
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,792
(Lady Qiushui,
a merfolk, the Imperial Consort)

152
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
(Helu Garden, Jialan Imperial City)
Lady Qiushui is pregnant.

153
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,880
May Your Highness make way for her.

154
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Forgive me, Your Highness.

155
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,439
It's all because I'm pregnant.

156
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,319
The Imperial Academy of Medicine
repeatedly advised me not

157
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,040
to go up and down excessively

158
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,719
because the prince
in my womb isn't stable.

159
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,559
I hope Your Highness can forgive me

160
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,079
for the inconvenience.

161
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,240
Make way.

162
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,199
We'll stand aside.

163
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,799
She's nothing but a Merfolk,

164
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,679
a slave of the Kongsang people.

165
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,280
Has she forgotten her place

166
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,760
now that she's being doted on?

167
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,120
Quiet.

168
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,280
The Merfolk are also like us,

169
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
the people of Yunhuang.

170
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Next time,

171
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,000
don't say anything discriminatory.

172
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,679
Or else it'll cause trouble.

173
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,880
Assassins!

174
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,520
No,

175
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm not an assassin.

176
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,319
I accidentally bumped into Lady Qiushui.

177
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm truly...

178
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,520
Her Highness is pregnant.

179
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,040
If anything happens,

180
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,240
can you be responsible?

181
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,360
You're wearing scarlet attire.

182
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,599
You're from the Crimson Clan.

183
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,880
Did your father send you
to crash into me on purpose

184
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,040
because he can't bear the sight

185
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,599
of me carrying a royal bloodline?

186
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,319
No.

187
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,240
Your Highness,

188
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,959
my father doesn't know anything.

189
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
I'll be responsible for my action.

190
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,679
Please

191
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,679
punish me alone.

192
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,360
How dare you talk back at me?

193
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,959
My flower!

194
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,239
Give it back to me.

195
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,199
This flower is evidence

196
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,840
of the Crimson Clan trying to harm me.

197
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:25,999
Let me go.

198
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,039
My flower.

199
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,320
Give it back.

200
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,039
My flower!

201
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,759
You...

202
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:34,759
You...

203
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,199
Why do you want to frame my father?

204
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,120
You're so beautiful.

205
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,439
Yet, you're so malicious.

206
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,039
You...

207
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:43,959
Dare you say that again?

208
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,560
Stop!

209
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,439
Greetings, Crown Prince.

210
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,160
Why are you fighting here?

211
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
I have my reasons.

212
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Are you trying to meddle

213
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,320
in the affairs of the Imperial Harem?

214
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,039
(Crown Prince?)

215
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,400
(So that's Crown Prince.)

216
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,160
(I can't believe I've said)

217
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,120
(so many offensive things.)

218
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,519
I'd never interfere.

219
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,679
But according to Kongsang ancestral law,

220
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,279
it's the Imperial Prince's duty
to guide other princes.

221
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,800
(The rumor is true.)

222
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,080
(Is His Highness here to help me?)

223
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,679
Since you're carrying
Father's bloodline,

224
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,199
I have to carry out my duty

225
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,679
as an older brother
to teach my younger brother

226
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,199
in your womb.

227
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,600
The Emperor who possesses good virtue

228
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,039
will grant amnesty

229
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,759
to the world's most heinous people

230
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,560
on auspicious days.

231
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,679
Let alone a child.

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,160
Did I make myself clear,

233
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,400
my brother?

234
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,120
All right.

235
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,840
Since Crown Prince has stepped in,

236
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
we'll let her go.

237
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,400
Let's go.

238
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,640
Yes.

239
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,840
Wait a moment.

240
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,600
Is there anything else, Crown Prince?

241
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,840
According to Kongsang ancestral law,

242
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,160
all princes must copy

243
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,519
the Holy Words of Emperor Xingzun
ten times

244
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,920
as a gift for the Emperor's birthday.

245
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,279
Since my brother is not born yet,

246
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,600
I can only ask you to return

247
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,439
to your chamber
and copy it on his behalf.

248
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,479
Why you...

249
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,999
You're being mean to me

250
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,080
and causing me trouble

251
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
because I'm a Merfolk.

252
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,920
The Kongsang people and the Merfolk

253
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,479
are the people of Yunhuang.

254
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,759
There's no difference between us.

255
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,400
But as for you,

256
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
you wanted to slap

257
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,920
a Saintess of Kongsang
over a trivial matter

258
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,759
and implicate a Kongsang Lord.

259
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,519
I only

260
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,920
slapped her.

261
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,239
Do you need to
make a big deal out of this?

262
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,320
All right.

263
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,279
Forget it.

264
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,039
I shall see

265
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,959
how long you can remain so arrogant.

266
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,199
The Prince favored by heaven

267
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,519
is standing here now.

268
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,640
It was my fault for being reckless
with my words.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,439
I hope Your Highness can forgive me.

270
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Is your face all right?

271
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm all right.

272
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,239
It was just a slap.

273
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,840
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

274
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,560
But...

275
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,959
It's a pity for this Snowy Rosa.

276
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,999
I wanted to present it to Your Highness.

277
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,279
What kind of magic spell is this?

278
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,039
It's amazing.

279
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,679
Restoring Spell.

280
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,160
If you practice magic spells diligently,

281
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,840
you can do it one day too.

282
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,039
This Snowy Rosa

283
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:47,479
is my proof to you.

284
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,400
You can take it

285
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,640
to your father.

286
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,279
Can a lady

287
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,120
do it too?

288
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
There is no difference
between men and women

289
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,479
in guarding the country
and protecting the family.

290
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,439
I'll not

291
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,920
let you down, Your Highness.

292
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,304
(Longevity Hall, Jialan Imperial City)

293
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,759
Yu,

294
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,759
remember to behave later,

295
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,679
okay?

296
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,640
On this holy feast,

297
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,120
allow me to present you
with a dance performance.

298
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,520
Good.

299
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,239
Very good.

300
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,696
(Emperor Beimian, the Emperor of Kongsang)

301
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,120
(In the past, the Emperor Xingzun)

302
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
(managed to comprehend
seven magic techniques)

303
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,800
(from the seven luminaries
and the bright full moon)

304
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,920
(and was acknowledged
by the Heavenly Divine Ring.)

305
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
(The marvelous scene)

306
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,199
(of the past would reappear)

307
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
(in the night.)

308
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:26,192
(Shi Yu, the Second Prince of Kongsang
Qing Yun, the Imperial Consort)

309
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,320
Many skilled mages haven't been able

310
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,400
(Lan Tianyu, the King of the Blue Clan)
to master a single technique.

311
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,510
(Qing Dongfang, the King of the Azure Clan)
Crown Prince was born with a divine spirit

312
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:51,999
(Bai Jing'an, the King of the White Clan)
and wisdom.

313
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,239
(Zhu Gaozhao, the King of the Crimson Clan)
It's Kongsang's blessing

314
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,600
to have such a prince.

315
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,279
Marvelous!

316
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,640
Impressive!

317
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,199
Remarkable!

318
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,160
Lady Qiushui has arrived.

319
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,039
Qiushui.

320
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,719
Greetings, Your Majesty.

321
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,439
Get up quickly.

322
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,600
Why did you come so late?

323
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,519
You just missed

324
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,800
the prince's sword dance.

325
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,479
Perhaps the prince punished me

326
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
to copy the scriptures ten times

327
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,479
because he didn't want me
to watch the sword dance.

328
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,239
What?

329
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,519
How dare the prince punish you
to copy scriptures?

330
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,999
I'm weak.

331
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,519
I feel weary
after copying the scriptures.

332
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,640
So I can only come to wish

333
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,199
Your Majesty a long

334
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,199
and healthy life.

335
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,279
I shall take my leave, then.

336
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:16,679
Are you all right?

337
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,479
I'll accompany you.

338
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,560
Your Majesty,

339
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,239
the auspicious hour has arrived.

340
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,880
The birthday banquet is about to begin.

341
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:27,999
Let's go.

342
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,239
The birthday banquet matters more.

343
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,880
I can return by myself.

344
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,199
If you come with me,

345
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
many people

346
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,120
will make mean accusations

347
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,320
about me.

348
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,439
I'll wait for you at Qiushui Pavilion.

349
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,560
All right.

350
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,519
You had to pick this day
to make things difficult for Qiushui.

351
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,400
Do you admit your mistake?

352
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,360
I apologize for my mistake.

353
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,959
Since you're good at swordsmanship,

354
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,560
you can keep watch at night

355
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,400
in the court.

356
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,880
Yes, Father.

357
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,199
Mother,

358
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,080
brother hasn't eaten yet.

359
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,279
Hush.

360
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
Please help us, Your Highness.

361
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,239
What's the matter?

362
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,279
I'm from Qiushui Pavilion.

363
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,840
Today, Lady Qiushui was ordered
by Your Highness

364
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:48,800
to copy the scriptures.

365
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,120
So she vented her anger
at the palace servants.

366
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:51,400
My sister

367
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,920
is about to be flogged to death.

368
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
I snuck out to ask Your Highness

369
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,679
for help.

370
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,279
Please help us, Your Highness.

371
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
Where's the punished palace servant?

372
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
She is inside.

373
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,439
I dare not enter.

374
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,600
Lady Qiushui.

375
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,880
Lady Qiushui.

376
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,840
Lady Qiushui, are you all right?

377
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:07,920
Lady Qiushui.

378
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,719
Anyone, help!

379
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Anyone!

380
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,360
Your Highness.

381
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,800
Your Highness.

382
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,439
Lady Qiushui.

383
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,560
Lady Qiushui, please get some rest.

384
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,600
I'll send for the Imperial Physician.

385
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,959
We must protect the baby.

386
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,640
Lady Qiushui,

387
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,880
what are you doing?

388
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,120
Your Highness,

389
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
you're finally here.

390
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,719
No.

391
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,479
His Majesty has arrived!

392
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,039
Lady Qiushui.

393
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:48,959
You.

394
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,519
I know you hate me, Your Highness.

395
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,719
Your Highness, no!

396
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,320
Qiushui!

397
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,400
Qiushui!

398
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,160
Your Majesty.

399
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,439
Your Majesty.

400
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,239
I had no idea

401
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,039
the prince

402
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,959
could be so vicious.

403
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,360
No, it wasn't me.

404
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,439
I can no longer serve you.

405
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Also...

406
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,800
Our son...

407
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,519
Your Majesty, please take care.

408
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,039
My...

409
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,279
My soul will return to Biluo Sea.

410
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,239
I hope I can be with you

411
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,120
in the next life.

412
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
Qiushui.

413
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,080
Qiushui.

414
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,439
Qiushui.

415
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,360
Qiushui.

416
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:10,999
Qiushui!

417
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,959
Qiushui!

418
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,600
It wasn't me.

419
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,759
Father,

420
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,880
it wasn't me.

421
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,479
It's you.

422
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:25,679
No.

423
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:27,519
It was you!

424
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:31,560
You killed Qiushui out of anger

425
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,999
because I punished you, right?

426
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
Father, I ask that you investigate this fairly.

427
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,560
I don't know

428
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,120
why she would use her death

429
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
to frame me.

430
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Are you still trying to deny it?

431
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,279
I'm going to seek justice

432
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,640
for Qiushui.

433
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,719
Ying!

434
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,719
Ying.

435
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,320
Mother.

436
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,279
Ying, are you all right?

437
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,199
- Mother.
- Get up quickly.

438
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,080
Your Majesty,

439
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,840
Ying is not a bloodthirsty killer.

440
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,160
I ask Your Majesty to think about
what's odd about this incident.

441
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:12,880
Why?

442
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,880
Are you here to vilify Qiushui too?

443
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,759
Who do you think you are?

444
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,920
I can't believe

445
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,239
you'd actually doubt

446
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,320
your birth son

447
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,400
over one unrelated Merfolk.

448
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,039
After all these years,

449
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:26,759
the Merfolk marine force

450
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,679
has planted so many spies here.

451
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,759
Quiet or I'll kill you!

452
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,439
Mother, watch out!

453
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,439
This matter has nothing
to do with Mother.

454
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,959
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

455
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,320
Ying,

456
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
why should you be responsible

457
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,560
for things you didn't do?

458
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,600
Tell me

459
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,880
you didn't do it.

460
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,439
Did you hear that?

461
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,679
He admits it.

462
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,600
He killed my Qiushui.

463
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,080
Your Majesty.

464
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,120
How could you use

465
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,519
such a despicable means

466
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,640
to force your birth son

467
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,279
to admit a false accusation?

468
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,920
Because you're scared.

469
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,920
If it weren't Ying who killed her,

470
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,320
it would mean Lady Qiushui

471
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,560
was the one who cast the bone.

472
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,519
It would also mean

473
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,560
you gave your heart
to the wrong person.

474
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,439
That's why you insist

475
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,479
on making Ying the killer!

476
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,120
You wretched woman!

477
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:11,759
Mother!

478
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Are you mad?

479
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,039
Mother.

480
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,199
You're a mad person.

481
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:14,840
Mother.

482
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,600
Mad!

483
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,519
Yes, I've gone mad.

484
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,880
I'm mad.

485
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,759
Mother.

486
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,840
There's no need for anyone

487
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,279
to bring down the State of Kongsang.

488
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,120
It is already ruined

489
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,439
at the hands of a fatuous emperor
like you!

490
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:31,880
Mother!

491
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,199
Protect the Emperor!

492
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:34,719
Protect the Emperor!

493
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:45,279
Mother!

494
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,400
Mother!

495
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:47,759
Mother!

496
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,719
What are you doing?

497
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,120
Mother, let go.

498
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:50,920
No!

499
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,160
Let go, Mother.

500
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:52,920
Mother!

501
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,840
Mother.

502
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,840
Mother.

503
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,080
Mother, what's wrong?

504
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,039
Mother, open your eyes.

505
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,400
Mother.

506
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,439
Fire! Fire!

507
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Fire! Fire!

508
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,239
Fire!

509
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,679
Hurry!

510
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,039
Hurry!

511
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,360
Yan'er.

512
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Hurry! A fire broke out!

513
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,719
Young Lady.

514
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,600
Yan'er.

515
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,199
Father.

516
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,679
Yan'er, run!

517
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,239
What happened?

518
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,120
They said

519
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,759
Crown Prince killed Lady Qiushui

520
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,279
over an argument.

521
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,080
The Empress set herself on fire together

522
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,519
with His Highness in Kunyuan Palace.

523
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,980
(Kunyuan Palace, Jialan Imperial City)

524
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,719
Ying,

525
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,999
don't be afraid. I'm here.

526
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,039
Mother.

527
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:10,679
Yan'er,

528
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,880
where are you going?

529
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,039
Father,

530
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,360
you don't know about what happened.

531
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:16,719
I offended Lady Qiushui today.

532
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,880
It was His Highness

533
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,880
who stopped her from punishing me.

534
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,519
So that's what happened.

535
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,360
Yan'er. Yan'er.

536
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
Lady Qiushui

537
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,120
must have framed His Highness

538
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,920
because of me.

539
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,120
Do you want to die?

540
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,479
- Come back with me!
- Father.

541
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,519
Yan'er!

542
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,519
I must save His Highness!

543
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,160
Yan'er!

544
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,920
Yan'er, listen to me.

545
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,239
I have to save His Highness.

546
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:37,959
Yan'er.

547
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:38,719
Yan'er.

548
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,640
Listen to me, Yan'er.

549
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,080
Your Highness!

550
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,880
Yan'er!

551
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,800
Listen to me. Don't go.

552
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,519
Let me go!

553
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,800
Your Majesty,

554
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,239
it was the Empress

555
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,439
who started the fire.

556
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,920
The Empress may be alive.

557
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,360
But she's disfigured

558
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,039
and lost her voice because of the smoke.

559
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,519
As for the Prince,

560
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,880
we only found his charred body.

561
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,760
Shi Ying was a curse.

562
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,599
Just drag his body out
and bury it outside the city.

563
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,559
Don't announce his death.

564
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,439
Don't mourn for him.

565
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,320
Don't build a tombstone

566
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
or a memorial tablet for him.

567
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,680
From now on, the whole country

568
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,159
shall not mention this person.
It's an offense equal to treason,

569
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,400
punishable by the familial execution
of nine generations.

570
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,360
Bai Yan of the White Clan

571
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,880
shall be deposed of her title
as the Empress

572
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,039
and banished to the Cold Palace.

573
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

574
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,370
(Crimson Residence, Ye City)

575
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,999
I lost the only thing

576
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,840
Crown Prince

577
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,959
had given to me.

578
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:10,559
Your Highness,

579
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,079
are you looking for this Snowy Rosa?

580
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,848
(Chi Yuan, a merfolk,
the butler of Crimson Residence)

581
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,639
You've been calling Snowy Rosa

582
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,439
when you were having a nightmare.

583
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,479
I think

584
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:29,920
this should be

585
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,920
your favorite thing.

586
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
So I asked the cleaner of the carriage

587
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,159
to keep it.

588
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,360
Thank you, Keeper Yuan.

589
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,959
You're both Merfolk.

590
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,920
Yet, you're so different in character.

591
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,439
If Lady Qiushui

592
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,720
was as kind as you,

593
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,039
Crown Prince wouldn't have died
from being framed.

594
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,599
Now, Crown Prince is dead.

595
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,840
Yet, no one dares
to make offerings for him.

596
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,559
His Majesty has issued a decree

597
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,400
that holding a private ritual
for Crown Prince is taboo.

598
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,240
No.

599
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,159
Even if it's defying the decree,

600
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,639
I'm going to make offerings to him.

601
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:03,720
I'd never believe

602
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,519
that he was a villain.

603
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,599
All right.

604
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Since you want to make
an offering to Crown Prince,

605
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,880
I shall accompany you.

606
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,439
Keeper Yuan,

607
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,999
are you willing to go with me?

608
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,559
Do you also believe
Crown Prince was framed?

609
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,639
I'm a Merfolk.

610
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,280
I don't know

611
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,400
who was the Prince of Kongsang.

612
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,320
But as the keeper
of the Crimson Residence,

613
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
it's my duty

614
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,320
to protect your safety.

615
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:27,840
Making an offering to Crown Prince

616
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,400
is what Your Highness wanted to do.

617
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,959
Since I can't stop you,

618
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
I can only help reduce the risk.

619
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,880
We can never know
what a person is really like.

620
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,200
Before this, the whole world said

621
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,320
he was noble and righteous.

622
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:51,680
Who would have thought

623
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,760
that he was capable of killing people?

624
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,639
As they say, indulging one's child
is the same as ruining them.

625
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,840
It was the Empress' fault
for spoiling him.

626
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,079
It is my unlucky day

627
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,959
to be doing such a task.

628
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:05,880
Do you think

629
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,920
there are evil spirits nearby?

630
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,519
Stop talking.

631
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,200
We should finish burying him
and get out of here.

632
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,959
When I was in power,

633
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,119
they praised me.

634
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,880
They would revere me

635
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,240
and cry for me,

636
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,039
even though I've never done anything

637
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,639
for them to be grateful to me.

638
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,519
When I fell from power,

639
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,400
they vilified me and spat on me.

640
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,159
They wished they could add
more injuries to me,

641
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,200
even though I've never done them wrong.

642
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,559
Mother, let's leave this place.

643
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,639
Come and leave this palace with me.

644
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,680
We can live

645
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,200
with different identities forever.

646
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,119
Ying,

647
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
I'll send you out of the palace.

648
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,559
This is Jade Bone.

649
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,159
It's an ancient artifact passed down

650
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,959
by Empress Bai Wei.

651
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,119
Who are you?

652
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,119
Ying,

653
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,559
don't be afraid.

654
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:16,120
(High Priest of Grand Preceptor,
Jiuyi Mountain)

655
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,360
Remember this.

656
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,039
Tonight, the mad Empress
set herself on fire,

657
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
and a puppet was burned
in the fire in your place

658
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,280
in Kunyuan Palace.

659
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,840
He'll lead you out of the palace.

660
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,039
This is the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor

661
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,439
of Jiuyi Mountain.

662
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,200
He'll be your master from now on.

663
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,360
Yan,

664
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
must you do this?

665
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,599
Yu,

666
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,479
I'll leave Ying to you.

667
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,639
I owe you

668
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:58,999
in this life.

669
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,119
Yan.

670
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:03,400
Mother,

671
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,639
I don't want to leave.

672
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:05,920
Ying,

673
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,559
don't worry.

674
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,479
I'll always

675
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,479
pray for you

676
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,720
in the palace.

677
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,360
I will not take my life

678
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,039
and let those who harm us

679
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,559
get what they want.

680
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,439
Ying,

681
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,519
feigning your death is a crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

682
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,360
Once you leave,

683
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,079
don't ever return.

684
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,039
Mother, let's leave together.

685
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,400
Our ties as mother and son
are now severed.

686
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,599
Remember.

687
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,360
No need for revenge

688
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,200
and no need to hate anyone.

689
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,599
All that matters is being safe.

690
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,280
Mother, I don't want to go alone.

691
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,720
Let's leave together.

692
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:47,880
Ying.

693
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,479
Mother.

694
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,320
Mother.

695
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,959
This is humanity.

696
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,400
There's an abnormal sign in the sky.

697
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
Crown Prince has returned.

698
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,720
- Run.
- Go now.

699
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:23,720
Let's go.

700
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,079
I cast a spell to hide your fate.

701
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,240
It shines like the sun and the moon.

702
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,840
The vision of the Yin and Yang

703
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,999
is the magic I use

704
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,599
to alter the stars.

705
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,680
Follow me to Jiuyi Mountain

706
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,720
to hide your strength and bid your time.

707
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,039
One day,
you'll return to your real body.

708
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,920
You'll get back

709
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,119
what you lost today.

710
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,519
I, Shi Ying, swear

711
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,959
that I will return to Jialan

712
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,639
to clear my mother's name

713
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,479
and take her with me

714
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,439
after I've completed my cultivation.

715
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,599
Your Highness,

716
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,360
I don't know

717
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,159
if I have the right
to perform sacrificial rites for you.

718
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,519
They said

719
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,999
you were a bad person.

720
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,880
But I believe that you were framed.

721
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:17,639
So

722
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,599
I came to send you off.

723
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
How could this be?

724
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:08,880
Your fate

725
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,639
is encountering a calamity.

726
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,039
Unexpectedly, there's someone

727
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,400
who's performing sacrificial rites
for you.

728
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,400
When the whole nation condemns me

729
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,880
and forsakes me,

730
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,559
she's doing this for me?

731
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Who is she?

732
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,039
It doesn't matter who she is.

733
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,119
When you see her,

734
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,039
Yin and Yang will meet,
and Starflower will bloom,

735
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,519
you must kill her then.

736
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,320
Or else

737
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,680
she'll be the one

738
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,439
who'll take your life in the future.

739
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,920
Keeper Yuan,

740
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,320
did you see

741
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,439
that flash of light?

742
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:54,999
Yes.

743
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,240
What's different about the Snowy Rosa

744
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:58,800
given by late Crown Prince?

745
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,360
What kind of magic spell is this?

746
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,119
Restoring Spell.

747
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,760
It's Restoring Spell.

748
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:12,360
Since this flower can come to life,

749
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,039
does that mean humans
can be revived too?

750
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,200
Does a magic spell like this exist?

751
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,119
There are countless magic spells
in Kongsang.

752
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,999
There are numerous Taoists
for the past thousands of years,

753
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,400
I'm sure something
like Restoring Spells exists.

754
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,959
I, Zhu Yan, swear

755
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:36,079
to master such a skill

756
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,999
to help Crown Prince
turn the dangerous situation around.

757
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,000
(Five years later)

758
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,519
You again.

759
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,720
I told you that

760
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:07,240
our master is in seclusion.

761
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:08,159
He won't be seeing anyone.

762
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,159
Just go back.

763
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,400
How long do I need to wait?

764
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,999
He'll come out from seclusion, right?

765
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,639
If I don't see him today,

766
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,599
I'm not going down the mountain.

767
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:18,880
You lass,

768
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,039
why are you being so unreasonable?

769
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,479
Even if my master came out
from seclusion,

770
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,639
he won't meet you.

771
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,959
Just leave the mountain.

772
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,439
I've waited earnestly for seven days

773
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:28,959
at the foot of the mountain.

774
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,599
How is that unreasonable?

775
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,479
Since you said
I'm an unreasonable person,

776
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,880
I'll show you

777
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:35,800
what an unreasonable person

778
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:36,880
is like.

779
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,999
You lass,

780
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,880
you have gone too far.

781
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,280
Chase her down the mountain.

782
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,999
Tell me.

783
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,400
Where's the Master?

784
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,760
Your Highness,

785
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,280
do you want to see me?

786
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:07,072
(Master Xuanzhen)

787
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:07,880
Greetings, Master.

788
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,039
Greetings, Master.

789
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Master, do you know me?

790
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:16,320
Your Highness, you're famous

791
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,680
for visiting mountains all these years.

792
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,959
How can I not know?

793
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,320
Then I'm sure you know

794
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:24,240
my purpose here.

795
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:26,200
When I was young,

796
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,159
a young man saved me.

797
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,079
But too bad he died a wrongful death.

798
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,559
So I'd like to ask Master

799
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,959
to bring him back to the mortal world.

800
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,079
You only met him by chance.

801
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,599
Why do you still think about it?

802
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,439
Our encounter

803
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,959
may be a brief moment.

804
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,559
Yet he stood up for me,

805
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,479
taught me to be kind,

806
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,680
and protected me.

807
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,119
Besides,

808
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,680
it was because of me
that he was implicated.

809
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
So you're returning his favor.

810
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,599
But do you know

811
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,240
the Transcendence Spell

812
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,680
is an art

813
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
that defies the laws of nature?

814
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,880
It comes with a hefty price.

815
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,119
I'm willing to do everything I can.

816
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,599
I ask that you'll fulfill my wish.

817
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,360
I'm not capable of it.

818
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,959
So I'm afraid I can't help you.

819
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,959
But Your Highness is sincere.

820
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:21,959
Perhaps you can try
going to Jiuyi Mountain.

821
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,400
Jiuyi Mountain?

822
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,119
Jiuyi Mountain
uses Kongsang's magic spell,

823
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
(which is at a higher level.)

824
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:30,240
(That's the only place)

825
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,119
(you can find)

826
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,559
(the Resurrection Spell.)

827
00:47:54,688 --> 00:47:57,808
