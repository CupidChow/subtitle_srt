20

You're finally home.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Yufei.

22
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:03,840
Young Lady.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,959
What's wrong?

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
Send someone to

25
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,760
Bamian Peak
and look for Lady Yu and her son.

26
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,719
This won't do.

28
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,800
I can't just get trapped here

29
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,879
and do nothing.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
(If you want to leave,)

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,439
(read until the end.)

32
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,439
(Then, you can
break through my barrier.)

33
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,759
(When that day comes,)

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,639
(no one can stand in your way.)

35
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:33,724
(Zhu Yan's Note)

36
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,960
Is this Master's drawing of me?

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,680
Sprawling Roots...

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,759
I didn't think Master
would even teach me

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,000
the technique of Sprawling Roots.

40
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,599
What is on the page

41
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,240
he tore out?

42
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
Is it harder to master
than Sprawling Roots?

43
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,960
Does he think it's too hard for me?

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
Let's find a safe place

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
to spend the night.

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,879
This spot seems adequate.

47
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,000
No.

48
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,120
Even if we must take a detour

49
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,639
or lose everything,

50
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,199
we must never get involved

51
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,439
with the Huotu Tribe again.

52
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,879
Indeed.

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,719
We can make more money,

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,039
but we only live once.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,719
What's wrong with the Huotu Tribe?

56
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,360
The Great Consort of the tribe
planned a rebellion.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
Thankfully,
a master from Jiuyi Mountain came.

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,479
Otherwise,
more lives would have been lost.

59
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,919
Indeed.

60
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,599
They haven't caught
the Principal Sorcerer.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
They are transmuting

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,639
with the lives of the Merfolk.

63
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,360
It was dark and menacing.

64
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,919
You should leave now.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,759
Mother.

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,879
We can't keep waiting.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
The Kongsang people

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,399
are all bad guys.

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
We can't trust them.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Did you hear them?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,199
The Principal Sorcerer is using

72
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,759
the Merfolk for transmutations.

73
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,319
Mother.

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,199
We mustn't get caught.

75
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,600
Young Lady.

76
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,439
The scouts reported back.

77
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
They searched Bamian Peak
three times over.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,680
But they couldn't find

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
the lady and her son you mentioned.

80
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,560
A wounded mother

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,160
carrying a child
recovering from illness...

82
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,800
What could they possibly be?

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,920
Young Lady.

84
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,360
I think

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,279
you worry too much.

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,879
As you said,

87
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,879
Lady Yu was a beloved concubine.

88
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,519
She's seen her fair share of the world.

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Surviving while carrying her child

90
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,560
shouldn't be a challenge for her.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Perhaps

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
they had been waiting for too long,

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
so they left when you didn't show up.

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,800
This is my fault.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
I totally overlooked them

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,759
because of the rebellion.

97
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,240
No.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,199
I have to break the barrier soon.

99
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,160
I must find them.

100
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,040
Young Lady.

101
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,439
You were busy yesterday,

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
and you didn't rest well at night.

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,079
It's going to take a toll on your body.

104
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,319
I'm fine.

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,519
Don't worry about me.

106
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,879
Dismissed.

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
I'll figure it out.

108
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,553
(Guwei City, Huotu Tribe)

109
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,879
Spare me some food.

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Back off!

111
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,079
Spare me some food.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,279
Stay still!

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,839
Spare us some food...

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,399
Spare me some water...

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,519
(I still can't sense anything.)

116
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,680
(The Sea Emperor
is not inside Guwei City.)

117
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,079
(So, what else could he be?)

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,399
Excuse me,

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
did anyone escape from this cell?

120
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,040
Escape?

121
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,639
We had hoped the Merfolk marine force

122
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
would send help after learning
about our situation,

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,319
but no one ever came.

124
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,160
Unless you could turn into smoke,

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
there'd be no way

126
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
to leave this cell.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Yeah.

128
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
We are trapped for good.

129
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,040
Will we ever get out of here?

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll get you out of here.

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,600
You?

132
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,600
Impossible.

133
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,839
You will never succeed.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,519
Extreme Wind City is nearby.

135
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,279
They are friendly toward Merfolk.

136
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,319
After you get out,

137
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,439
go to that city.

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,240
Can you really get us out?

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,879
Really?

140
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,879
Can you?

141
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,240
That can't be possible.

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,319
It's unlocked.

143
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,439
Save us.

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,199
Quiet.

145
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,480
Save us, please!

146
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,319
Quick!

147
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:25,879
Quick!

148
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,839
Stay quiet.

149
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,839
Quick!

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,480
Be careful.

151
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,519
We're finally saved.

152
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,240
Quick!

153
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,240
Quick! Don't fall behind.

154
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,480
Watch out.

155
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Principal Sorcerer!

156
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,080
Be careful.

157
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,519
Be careful.

158
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,960
Is this the Principal Sorcerer
who caged you?

159
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,480
- Yes!
- That's him!

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
It's him!

161
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,639
Who are you?

162
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,639
How dare you sneak into Guwei City!

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,679
You committed countless sins.

164
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,440
Today, I shall avenge my people!

165
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,200
Run!

166
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,120
You're a Merfolk.

167
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,919
You know the sword art of Kongsang?

168
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,320
(Are these Merfolk)

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,360
(without any souls?)

170
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,879
Imbecile!

171
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
Speaking of yourselves!

172
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,919
Being used

173
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,879
and dying for me

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,720
are the greatest purposes you have!

175
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,799
Pursue!

176
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,080
You...

177
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,519
These Merfolk

178
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,200
have lost their souls.

179
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,919
They weren't even alive.

180
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,840
Rather than let them be used

181
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,320
and become empty husks,

182
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,279
why not send them back to Biluo Sea

183
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,519
so they can find peace?

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
But their bodies were whole.

185
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,360
The Evil Star has risen.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,759
When the Sea Emperor is crowned

187
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,399
and the God of Dragon returns,

188
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,039
they still stand a chance to wake up!

189
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,519
The only Merfolk who possesses
both a spirit and a soul

190
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,960
is you.

191
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,919
Besides,

192
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,440
given your knowledge on the matter,

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,919
you are not a commoner

194
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,799
among the Merfolk.

195
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,639
Are you

196
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,720
the Sea Emperor?

197
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,879
Are you really the Sea Emperor?

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,720
Why are you looking for him?

199
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,879
Who are you?

200
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,879
Priest of Grand Preceptor
from Jiuyi Mountain.

201
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
The Evil Star is rising,

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,440
the search for the Sea Emperor
and defending Kongsang

203
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,039
are my responsibilities.

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,080
(He is Yan'er's master.)

205
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,399
(What is he doing here?)

206
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,799
The power of Diba, the God of Darkness,

207
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
requires a hundred Merfolk
to be sacrificed

208
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,159
before it can be acquired.

209
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,159
I've been waiting
for this chance for ages.

210
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,639
I lacked the necessary conditions.

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,600
But then,
I saw you, the Priest of Grand Preceptor,

212
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,879
in the Huotu Tribe.

213
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120
You commanded a rain of arrows
with only one arrow.

214
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,080
I knew you'd fulfill my last wish.

215
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,360
I knew it!

216
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,039
You fell for it!

217
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,759
War will soon ravage Western Huang!

218
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,159
If you surrender yourself to me,

219
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,840
if you agree to serve me,

220
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,639
I can spare your life.

221
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,639
I am the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

222
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,080
Why should I bow down

223
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,120
to living filth like you?

224
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,440
Not a chance.

225
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,720
How ignorant.

226
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,120
I'll let you in on a little secret.

227
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,320
Consort Qing sent me here.

228
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,399
I know Jiuyi Mountain's

229
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,519
Priest of Grand Preceptor

230
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,000
was the former Crown Prince Shi Ying!

231
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,080
How about we make a deal?

232
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,840
I'll give up on aiding Shi Yu.

233
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,080
I'll aid you in retaking the nation.

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,960
When the job is done,

235
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,879
I want a plot of land in
Western Huang as payment.

236
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,919
Every word you speak

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,960
pains my ears.

238
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,639
Shi Ying!

239
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,559
Know your place!

240
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
The power I possess now

241
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,240
came from the primordial demon god!

242
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Your power is no match for me!

243
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,879
Even if I must exhaust my power and die,

244
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,440
I won't let you get away with your crime.

245
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,679
You consumed my people.

246
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,840
I will make you pay for this!

247
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,360
I'll aid you.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,080
You are no match for him.

249
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,039
Leave now.

250
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,679
If you're not afraid of him,

251
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,440
why should I?

252
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,679
You shall both die!

253
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Watch out!

254
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,119
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

255
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,480
He's finally dead for good.

256
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:46,920
Oh no.

257
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:48,920
The gem contained

258
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,200
the power of the primordial demon god.

259
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,119
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

260
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,079
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

261
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,680
What's wrong?

262
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,240
Priest of Grand Preceptor?

263
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,839
You're finally awake.

264
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
You said you could handle it by yourself.

265
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,680
You even asked me

266
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,279
to check the nearby bases.

267
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,720
What happened to you?

268
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,839
How many fingers?

269
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,279
And now?

270
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,599
I'm glad you're awake.

271
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,799
The shards contained the power
of the primordial demon god.

272
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,200
It conflicts with

273
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,200
your power of heaven and earth.

274
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,599
It will subdue your spiritual power.

275
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,480
The longer it lingers in you,

276
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,039
the greater the damage.

277
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,400
You must find a way

278
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,680
to get rid of it.

279
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,960
What am I doing here?

280
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,880
Where is the Merfolk?

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,960
I was just about to tell you.

282
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,480
By the time I arrived,

283
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,039
he was carrying you.

284
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,319
He clearly looked exhausted.

285
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
He was as pale as a ghost.

286
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,319
Before he left,

287
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,359
he left you in my care.

288
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,400
By the way,

289
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,279
he gave me the Merfolk's medicine.

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,839
You let him leave?

291
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:29,799
I...

292
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,000
See that?

293
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,079
When he moves, the Evil Star moves.

294
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,640
He must be

295
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,640
the man we've been searching for.

296
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,240
What?

297
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,319
But I didn't know who he was.

298
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,200
If he is the Sea Emperor,

299
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,720
the two of you

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,440
will be at war with each other in the future.

301
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,599
Judging by his personality,

302
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,519
if he is the Sea Emperor,

303
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,440
the two clans

304
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,000
might not go to war at all.

305
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,559
Instead, we could work as allies.

306
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,799
Perhaps the Evil Star

307
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
might not be

308
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
a calamity

309
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
for Kongsang.

310
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,000
Over the years,

311
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,039
the Merfolk marine force

312
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,839
didn't seem to act
on a wise commander's orders.

313
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,880
The Evil Star had just risen.

314
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,640
He must have learned about his identity

315
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
as the Sea Emperor not long ago.

316
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,960
However,

317
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,359
he is not in the marine force.

318
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,720
Otherwise,

319
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
why would he come to battle Diba alone?

320
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,359
As for the Merfolk,

321
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,279
they obey the Sea Emperor.

322
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,319
The Sea Emperor's opinion

323
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,119
will eventually decide
the fate of the clans.

324
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,279
If they have a wise ruler,

325
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,680
it's a blessing for both clans.

326
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,440
The phoenix passes on at the withered.

327
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
Heroes are born in war.

328
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,400
Just like this barren land beneath us,

329
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,599
it will one day

330
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
be thriving with pasture
and fields of flowers.

331
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,119
Ever since we came to the Huotu Tribe

332
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,119
looking for the Evil Star,

333
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,720
you've foiled the Great Consort's plan
and defeated Diba.

334
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,240
You've done many good deeds.

335
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,440
But in the end,

336
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,359
you let others have the credit.

337
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,279
And now, your power is sealed away.

338
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
Is it worth it?

339
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,759
Let's not waste any time.

340
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,240
We have to

341
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,480
track down the Evil Star
as soon as possible.

342
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,599
I think

343
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,440
you should first extract the shard.

344
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,039
I've been training for two days.

345
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,039
I still can't understand
the knowledge within.

346
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,920
Lady Yu and her son are waiting for me.

347
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,960
How can I be so useless?

348
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,119
I get it now.

349
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,240
These movements are connected.

350
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,440
There's more to simply sitting down.

351
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,119
It's the movement before standing up.

352
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,359
It requires

353
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,559
a charged upward thrust,

354
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,119
instead of lowering peacefully.

355
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,480
Young Lady.

356
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,119
Have some food before you continue.

357
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,079
Young Lady!

358
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,000
What happened?

359
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,160
Young Lady!

360
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,079
Are you alright?

361
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,680
I did it!

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,480
Young Lady!

363
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,319
Young Lady!

364
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Yufei.

365
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,400
I must go to Lady Yu and her son.

366
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,559
When I find them,

367
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
I must bring them home.

368
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,039
They will like Extreme Wind City.

369
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
(Sumo was having a fever.)

370
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,720
(Maybe Lady Yu took him
to an apothecary.)

371
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,160
This is the last apothecary in town.

372
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,839
Yufei, go check inside.

373
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:57,920
Yes, Young Lady.

374
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,079
Jiuyi Mountain's
Priest of Grand Preceptor

375
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,559
single-handedly subdued

376
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,160
the entire army of the Huotu Tribe

377
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
and defeated Diba.

378
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,119
He sure is amazing.

379
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:09,799
Incredible.

380
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,880
I heard about this too.

381
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,119
Rumor has it

382
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,000
the Priest of Grand Preceptor

383
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,960
was the former Crown Prince.

384
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,079
The former Crown Prince is alive?

385
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,279
I think

386
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,440
he came to the Huotu Tribe

387
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
to build up his influence.

388
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,519
Of course.

389
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,640
With this accomplishment,

390
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,759
he's earned the right

391
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,119
to fight for the throne of Kongsang.

392
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,400
Some said he was

393
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,720
meditating on the mountain
with his heart

394
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,559
pure and untainted.

395
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,359
He clearly got impatient.

396
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,960
- Yeah.
- Indeed.

397
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,400
These people...

398
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
These are baseless claims.

399
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,559
My master is a righteous person.

400
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,839
He cares about the people.

401
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,400
He wouldn't seek to take the throne.

402
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,279
He would never take revenge.

403
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,680
Young Lady, calm down.

404
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,880
I'll bring them here now

405
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,039
so you can teach them a lesson.

406
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,079
Forget it.

407
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,240
I had already caused a lot of trouble
to my master.

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,359
If I stick my neck out again,

409
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,079
I might get to vent my anger,

410
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,759
but I'll bring even more trouble
to my master.

411
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,319
Let's bear with it.

412
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:05,480
Well?

413
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,319
Did you find the two?

414
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,680
They weren't in there.

415
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,839
Everyone we've spoken to

416
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
said they had never seen the pair.

417
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,319
Could it be

418
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
they are already

419
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,359
in Extreme Wind City?

420
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,640
Lady Yu and the Old Lord

421
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,799
used to visit His Lordship together.

422
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:25,880
This time,

423
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,799
you saved both of them.

424
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
Maybe they had waited too long

425
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,519
and decided to go back
to Extreme Wind City.

426
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,200
At the moment,

427
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,559
we're all out of options.

428
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,920
Let's pack up

429
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,559
and return to the city now.

430
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,160
Let's go.

431
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,640
((Rumors about the Priest's attempt
to set up his influence were all nonsence.)

432
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,720
We see this everywhere along the path.

433
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,880
Others might not know who wrote this,

434
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,000
but I know.

435
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,839
As expected from your disciple.

436
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,000
For me,

437
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,200
this isn't embarrassing.

438
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,839
Mind your business.

439
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,599
However,

440
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:00,640
we've never

441
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,279
spread word about your good deeds.

442
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,480
Why is it that everyone already knows?

443
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,000
Could it be

444
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,799
your disciple's doing?

445
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,119
His Supreme Majesty did this.

446
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,640
Yeah.

447
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,319
The High Priest of Grand Preceptor

448
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,079
wants you back in Jialan.

449
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,319
His Supreme Majesty

450
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,279
had already learned
about the Great Consort's plot.

451
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,400
He expected me to leave the mountain

452
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,279
and put an end to the matter.

453
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,519
Yeah.

454
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,839
But it wasn't your fault.

455
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,880
The blood of
the royal family flows in you.

456
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,599
You couldn't have
let the rebellion succeed.

457
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,279
After the matter
with the Evil Star is over,

458
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,039
I'll return to Jiuyi Mountain at once.

459
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,319
The Evil Star is just up ahead.

460
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,359
Let's go.

461
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:08,400
(Merfolk's Dungeon)

462
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,440
Lord Left Envoy.

463
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
Lord Left Envoy.

464
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,599
It's been 200 years.

465
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,119
How did you find this place?

466
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,599
It's been 200 years.

467
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,519
The marine force's communication wave

468
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
hasn't changed.

469
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I heard you were here.

470
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,000
So, I came by.

471
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,039
(Elder Jian, Merfolk)
It seems all the rumors

472
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,839
about the marine force over the years

473
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,119
have been true.

474
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,119
It was a misunderstanding.

475
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,359
Just misunderstanding.

476
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,079
You carry the oldest surname

477
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,119
of the Merfolk.

478
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,640
The blood of the Dragon Clan's
side branch flows in you.

479
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,279
You can sense

480
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,160
the blood of the Sea Emperor
in an instant.

481
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,839
Everyone expects you to return.

482
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,799
By the way,

483
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,400
have you found any lead
on the Sea Emperor?

484
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,400
No.

485
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,839
Can you sense

486
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,319
if the Sea Emperor is here?

487
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,839
Could you show us

488
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,000
the miraculous power?

489
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
None of them is the Sea Emperor.

490
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,519
(Xi, Merfolk)
Give them the muting pills.

491
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,359
Take their Jade Tears.

492
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,319
- Yes.
- Yes.

493
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:57,920
Stop!

494
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,720
You really are into illicit conduct.

495
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
Even the people of Kongsang are

496
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,119
not allowed to do something so cruel.

497
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,000
How could you victimize your own people?

498
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,720
Where is your conscience?

499
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,279
Sir.

500
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,359
You abandoned us 200 years ago.

501
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,119
You hid in Crimson Residence.

502
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,599
We didn't judge you,

503
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,200
who are you to judge us?

504
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
War and revenge require
resources for the military.

505
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,440
These Merfolk captives

506
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
are dying anyway.

507
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,359
Rather than let their deaths be in vain,

508
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,480
why not put their lives to better uses?

509
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,880
We want to rebuild

510
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,799
so no Merfolk will ever
be exploited again,

511
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,559
not because you get
to exploit the innocent.

512
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,680
Release all of them now.

513
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,359
Now that you've said it...

514
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,960
Release them.

515
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,000
Thank you.

516
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,960
Get up.

517
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,519
Thank you.

518
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,599
Take it easy.

519
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,279
A filth like you

520
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,759
has no right to search
for the Sea Emperor with me.

521
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,400
If I ever see you
harm innocent Merfolk again,

522
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,160
I'll make you pay!

523
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,400
There have been rumors
that Jiuyi Mountain's

524
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,799
Priest of Grand Preceptor

525
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,279
was killing Merfolk.

526
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,960
However,

527
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,799
someone spread different rumors
to clarify the claims.

528
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:27,920
If there are explanations,

529
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,920
we'll present our evidence.

530
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,920
Find an opening
to kill the dragon slayer.

531
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
That should make the Merfolk obey

532
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,599
and pay more tributes.

533
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,880
Who are you?

534
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,599
How dare you infiltrate the dungeon?

535
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,240
Elder Jian!

536
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,279
Elder Jian!

537
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,559
I know what you're planning.

538
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,359
I came to offer my assistance.

539
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,359
Your assistance?

540
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,680
What do you mean?

541
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,440
To start a war.

542
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,160
It will not be like
your petty skirmishes,

543
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,200
but an all-out war with Kongsang

544
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,720
similar to 200 years ago.

545
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,599
If the Sea Emperor returns amidst chaos,

546
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,599
he has no right to punish you.

547
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,640
Your top priority at the moment

548
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,200
is to lay siege to Extreme Wind City.

549
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:41,636
(Extreme Wind City)

550
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,759
Princess,

551
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,319
an urgent letter from
His Lordship and Her Ladyship.

552
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,119
Extreme Wind City is besieged

553
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,200
by the marine force.

554
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,200
(Yan'er, do not come back recently)
The main routes to the city

555
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,319
(because of marine force's invading)
are crawling with enemy soldiers.

556
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,359
Please delay

557
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,000
your trip to Extreme Wind City.

558
00:33:59,119 --> 00:33:59,880
Stay in Huotu Tribe

559
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,759
until it's safe to return.

560
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,079
I am the Jiang Bead Flying Flame
of Extreme Wind City.

561
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,279
I'm the disciple of Jiuyi Mountain.

562
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,199
How can I hide in the Huotu Tribe?

563
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,159
I must return to the city

564
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
and aid my parents.

565
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:12,679
Princess.

566
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
War is not child's play.

567
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,159
You should follow
your parents' instructions.

568
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,760
We were returning

569
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,039
to look for Lady Yu and Sumo.

570
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,599
We now have
all the more reason to return.

571
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,880
Ready the horses for me.

572
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,320
Yes.

573
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,360
Young Lady.

574
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,360
(Relay Station)

575
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,840
Princess.

576
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:04,440
Welcome.

577
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:05,840
Messenger Zhang.

578
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,960
Do you have spare horses to exchange

579
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
so we can travel all night?

580
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,239
Not long ago,

581
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,599
the Merfolk marine force attacked.

582
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,119
They took many of our horses.

583
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,719
We no longer have
any horses to exchange.

584
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,599
These soldiers are unbelievable!

585
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,800
Indeed.

586
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,559
They also seized Xia City.

587
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
They've made it a base.

588
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,480
Inspection checkpoints are tight.

589
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,559
Given your large group,

590
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
they won't grant you any passage.

591
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,320
Why are they taking Xia City?

592
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,519
The army provisions

593
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,239
to Extreme Wind City

594
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,840
were confiscated in Xia City by them.

595
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,800
How dare they steal my father's supply!

596
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,159
Very well.

597
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,039
I shall get rid of them

598
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,639
and help out Extreme Wind City.

599
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,400
Princess, no.

600
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,280
You travel with a large group,

601
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,960
but the marriage delegation
is no match for them.

602
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,920
You can't fight trained soldiers.

603
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,119
If you are captured,

604
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,719
you're causing
the Crimson King more trouble.

605
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,079
I believe in my chances.

606
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,920
There must be a way.

607
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,760
Princess!

608
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:57,920
Princess!

609
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:09,760
Master.

610
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,719
What are you doing here?

611
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,360
There is only one way
out of the Huotu Tribe.

612
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,039
It's perfectly normal

613
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,280
to run into you here.

614
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,159
Did you think

615
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,800
I'd still be trapped

616
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,000
in the Huotu Tribe?

617
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,119
You said so yourself.

618
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,440
With power comes greatness.

619
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,559
You asked me to train
and escape the barrier.

620
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,559
Extreme Wind City

621
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,880
is being attacked by the marine force.

622
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:32,920
As a daughter,

623
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,639
it's only right for me to go there

624
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and aid my father.

625
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,239
Are you

626
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,960
thinking about
setting up another barrier

627
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
to trap me?

628
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,440
Is there another relay station nearby?

629
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,840
None within a hundred li.

630
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,039
Chong Ming.

631
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,199
In this case,

632
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,599
we must hurry up

633
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,719
and travel at night.

634
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,920
Master!

635
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,760
Do you think you're invincible?

636
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,599
You're wounded inside and out.

637
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
You can't travel without shelter.

638
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,960
Whatever the case is,

639
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,199
I must have my beauty sleep.

640
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm staying in the inn.

641
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:11,920
Master.

642
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,760
Why must you avoid me
every chance you get?

643
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
I know it all.

644
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
I will set out tomorrow morning.

645
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,880
You need not be bothered

646
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,400
to share the inn with me.

647
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,920
Master!

648
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,679
I'd only trained a few days

649
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,079
following instructions in the books,

650
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,320
I didn't know I'd become this strong.

651
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,760
Alright,

652
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,400
I'm calling the shot here.

653
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,840
We are spending the night here.

654
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,199
Shut it now before she learns the truth.

655
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,199
Wait.

656
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,559
Master and Chong Ming

657
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,679
can travel a thousand li a day.

658
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,400
If nothing went wrong,

659
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,480
they would've traveled
much further ahead.

660
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,239
What happened?

661
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:16,920
Who is it?

662
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,320
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

663
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
I am the servant of Princess.

664
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,239
Princess passed out

665
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,840
all of a sudden.

666
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,159
Could you take a look?

667
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,159
I knew something was off yesterday.

668
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,000
So, I employ a little trick to test you.

669
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,519
Your spiritual power is stagnant.

670
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,239
How did you get wounded?

671
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Was it the battle against

672
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,480
the Principal Sorcerer?

673
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,960
What is this?

674
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,880
The shard of the gem

675
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:15,920
from the Principal Sorcerer's staff.

676
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,760
How can an ordinary shard
do this to you?

677
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,239
Was the shard

678
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,360
tainted or something?

679
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,920
Now that she's found out,

680
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,679
I'll be honest with her.

681
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,960
The shard was embedded with
the power of the demon god.

682
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:29,800
It conflicts with

683
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
the power of Jiuyi Mountain.

684
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,199
If we don't get it out in time,

685
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,360
the longer it lingers,

686
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,000
the greater the harm.

687
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,800
What do we do now?

688
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,360
I asked the birds.

689
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,280
There is a divine healer

690
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
in Xia City by the name of Xu.

691
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,719
He specialized in treating
Immortal Officials.

692
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,679
He can deal with
all kinds of conditions.

693
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,599
Alright.

694
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,679
We're going to Xia City tomorrow

695
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,639
for this physician.

696
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,639
You should

697
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,559
stay out of this.

698
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:55,480
Why you...

699
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,239
How dare you trap me?

700
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,719
You are...

701
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm insolent and audacious,

702
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,079
rude and disrespectful?

703
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,360
You once

704
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,559
said the same thing about me.

705
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,000
But you took those words back.

706
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
If you want to leave,

707
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,400
stay here and recover your strength.

708
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,119
When you're ready,
you can set yourself free.

709
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,280
Yan'er is right.

710
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,480
It's an urgent matter.

711
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,679
Let me go now.

712
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,239
At the moment,

713
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
your health

714
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,719
comes before anything.

715
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,360
Do as I say.

716
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,519
Tomorrow,

717
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,840
we'll take you to the physician.

718
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,039
Chong Ming.

719
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,400
You mustn't collude with Zhu Yan.

720
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:45,840
Undo this barrier now.

721
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,119
The Merfolk marine force

722
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,320
is on the move.

723
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,320
They are eager to march

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,800
due to the rising Evil Star.

725
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,719
We should hurry up

726
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
and find the Sea Emperor.

727
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,119
Only then can we devise a plan.

728
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Enough.

729
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,119
No more excuses.

730
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,159
The Evil Star is moving in the direction

731
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,159
of Extreme Wind City,

732
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,039
where Yan'er is headed for.

733
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,960
Besides,

734
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,079
Xia City

735
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,840
is occupied by the Merfolk marine force.

736
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,320
The Evil Star you're pursuing

737
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,639
is ahead of Xia City.

738
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,280
To reach him,
you must pass through Xia City.

739
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,280
Xia City is crawling

740
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,400
with enemy soldiers.

741
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,199
If they found out

742
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,760
I was the so-called dragon slayer,

743
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,480
Zhu Yan would be in danger

744
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,119
if she traveled with me.

745
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,800
Do as I say.

746
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,559
Undo the barrier.

747
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,519
Even if I did undo the barrier,

748
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,079
could you escape your disciple

749
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,440
who has become so mighty?

750
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,440
Power speaks for itself!

751
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:38,800
Chong...

752
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,440
Chong Ming!

753
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,599
Master.

754
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Stop giving me the look.

755
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,920
It won't do you any good.

756
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,360
It's not the same as running away
from a wedding.

757
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,480
If I can petrify you,

758
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,239
of course I have

759
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,119
a flawless plan in mind.

760
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,400
Here.

761
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,119
Collect some water with this.

762
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:46,559
Thank you.

763
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,679
It's time for your medicine.

764
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,599
I am no match for your

765
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,519
mighty disciple.

766
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,760
Besides,

767
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,519
as you said earlier,

768
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,000
the world operates in a repeating cycle.

769
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,760
Every bit of power
you borrow from nature

770
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,280
must be returned in the end.

771
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,920
How you treat others

772
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,480
will decide

773
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,159
how you're treated.

774
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,559
I wouldn't dare intervene.

775
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,719
It's karma.

776
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:15,960
Yeah.

777
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,119
Chong Ming has a point.

778
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,280
Here you go.

779
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:22,679
Master.

780
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:23,960
The medicine

781
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,039
was prescribed by Chong Ming himself.

782
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:27,760
You must take it three times a day

783
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
to recover quickly.

784
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:31,960
Here you go.

785
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,079
Why aren't you taking the medicine?

786
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,440
You've petrified him.

787
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:44,840
How can he open his mouth?

788
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,960
It's getting late.

789
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:48,639
We will reach Xia City

790
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,760
before this evening.

791
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,719
You must convince this man.

792
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,840
We need

793
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:53,800
his cooperation

794
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,000
for the plan to succeed.

795
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,079
Understood.

796
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,719
I must go, nature calls.

797
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,239
Master,

798
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,639
I shall lift the Muting Spell

799
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,800
so you can use your mouth.

800
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,800
Master.

801
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,039
Pardon me.

802
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,480
I think I did it the wrong way.

803
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,800
Otherwise,

804
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,480
you would've started reprimanding me.

805
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,639
I get it now!

806
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,559
I should draw the line
based on the mouth shape.

807
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,119
Tracing the lines, tracing the mind.

808
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,639
With my skillful, hand is lifted.

809
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,760
Break!

810
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,320
Did I do it wrong again?

811
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,440
I got the wrong spell this time.

812
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:26,920
Let's try it again.

813
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,119
Tracing the lines, tracing the mind.

814
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,199
With my skillful, hand is fitted.

815
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:38,079
Break!

816
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,159
Why aren't you talking?

817
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:44,719
You're pressing on my lips,

818
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,079
how can I speak?

819
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,920
You had to redo a simple Muting Spell

820
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,119
three times to get it right.

821
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:55,559
Sorry about that.

822
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,960
I embarrassed you three times.

823
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:57,719
Master.

824
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:58,760
I have an idea.

825
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,639
I'll lift
the Immobilization Spell for you.

826
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,119
That should make you feel better.

827
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:03,800
I swear

828
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,199
I'll get it done on the first try.

829
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:19,440
Stop.

830
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,320
Go any lower,

831
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,679
and you're dead.
