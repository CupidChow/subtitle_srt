Zhu Yan.

20

Zhu Yan.

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Qing Gang.

22
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,279
Zhu Yan is awake.

23
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,719
Zhu Yan.

24
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,120
You saved me?

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes.

26
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,039
Xuelu and I were heading
to Jiuyi Mountain

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,439
for an important matter
to discuss with Priest.

28
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,319
And we ran into you.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
You two are staying together now?

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Xuelu is my betrothed.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,719
Despite the countless obstacles,

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
you found each other.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Congratulations.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,920
Thanks.

35
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,159
Xuelu.

36
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,319
You made the decision to spend
the rest of your life with Qing Gang.

37
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,759
I'm sure you two will live happily ever after.

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
We are now friends.

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,439
I want to apologize to you

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,759
for what I have done.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
It's all in the past.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,039
I haven't even thanked you for saving me.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,439
Oh, you guys

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
were trying to see Priest,
weren't you?

45
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,520
Don't let me keep you.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Go.

47
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,559
Don't mention my name, however.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,920
Zhu Yan.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,920
What happened between Priest and you?

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,080
If Zhu Yan doesn't want to bring it up,
don't force her.

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,319
You barely recover.

52
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,200
What if you suddenly lose your hearing

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,279
or vision again?

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,039
We still have time anyway.

55
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,200
Let us look after you for a few days.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,759
But...

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,680
No but.

58
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,200
You said that we are friends.

59
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:45,879
You can't take it back.

60
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,400
Let me check on the remedial broth.

61
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,480
Tell me about your journey.

62
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,839
Bai Fenglin is still a scoundrel

63
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,800
who will not own up what he has done.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Until Qing Gang came,

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
we traveled here.

66
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,120
It's a shame that I cannot bring

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Mother's memorial tablet

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,999
back to the Bai Residence.

69
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,600
Do you think your late mother

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
would care if her memorial tablet
is in the Bai Residence or not?

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,840
Xuelu.

72
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm sure she couldn't care less

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,439
about a man

74
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,800
who never gave her a status.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,160
Nor something symbolical
like a memorial tablet.

76
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,559
You are what she held the dearest.

77
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,120
Xuelu,

78
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,879
Qing Gang and you are in love.

79
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,319
You are also
one of the most powerful members

80
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,079
in the White Clan.

81
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,319
I think this is what she wanted to see.

82
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,439
Her daughter has grown up
to become someone

83
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,319
so resilient and unyielding.

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Your ancestor, Bai Wei,

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
left a legacy

86
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,639
not as the spouse of Emperor Xingzun,

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,120
but as the warrioress

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,519
who quit her throne and status
to fight for her subjects.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,879
Xuelu,

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,280
you have taken the first step.

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,319
Now soar higher.

92
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,639
Do you feel better now?

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
My vision and my hearing are back.

94
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,199
Thank you.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,040
We still have to find ways

96
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,240
to restore your other senses.

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,160
Let's be patient.

98
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,559
Fortunately, you two are here with me.

99
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,600
Oh, Qing Gang.

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,439
I owe you an explanation
regarding what happened

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,680
at Zhaoyun Crossing.

102
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,399
I am not a traitor
who serves the Sea Kingdom.

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
I just didn't want to see

104
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
the loss of so many precious lives

105
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,999
during the disaster.

106
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,120
So I theorized correctly.

107
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,559
I had the same idea too.

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,559
However, it is a major issue.

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Once you're healed,

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
you should present yourself in the court

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,840
and explain everything.

112
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,160
I promise.

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,480
Zhu Yan.

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,399
Xuelu.

115
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,319
Priest is relinquishing his title

116
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,439
to enter the Tribulations of Hell.

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,639
Is it true?

118
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,280
Everyone is preparing for the ceremony
under the mountain.

119
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,920
All immortal officials

120
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
are heading toward Jiuyi Mountain too.

121
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
(Master was just reborn.)

122
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,319
(He couldn't possibly survive that.)

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
No wonder you were reticent.

124
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,879
Priest must have renounced his title for you.

125
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
And you left Jiuyi Mountain

126
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,959
to stay away from the whole debacle.

127
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,399
But now,

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,879
he is no longer your master.

129
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,840
You two can now be together.

130
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,959
I'm not feeling too well.

131
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,999
I'll get some rest now.

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,600
Zhu Yan.

133
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,319
Zhu Yan, are you up?

134
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,480
Zhu Yan?

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,319
Zhu Yan?

136
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,120
Where is she?

137
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,240
Did she go to Jiuyi Mountain alone?

138
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,040
Probably.

139
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,559
She must be worried sick

140
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,240
after she heard the news
about Priest yesterday.

141
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,680
I hope they can clear things up

142
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,759
between themselves.

143
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,519
An edict for you, Qing Gang.

144
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,080
Your kin, Qing Yun, was found guilty
of poisoning the consorts

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,080
and assaulting His Majesty
due to jealousy.

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Her crime is unforgivable

147
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,799
and she has pleaded guilty to it.

148
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,120
Her brother, Qing Dongfang,
was an accomplice

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,679
and was found guilty of colluding
with enemies.

150
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,840
In accordance with the current
code of punishment,

151
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,480
he is to be demoted to a commoner.

152
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,399
Qing Gang proves to be
a courageous official

153
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:00,440
whose fidelity should be exemplified.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
Qing Gang is now appointed
the Azure King.

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
Hereby concludes the edict.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,879
Duly noted.

157
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,720
His Majesty wants you
to return to Jialan

159
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,399
for your inauguration ceremony.

160
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,600
Please do so
at your earliest convenience.

161
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,519
I shall return

162
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,600
once I conclude my business here.

163
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,600
Good.

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
The Sea Kingdom
was a threat not long ago

165
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,679
and the Ice Clan
is on the prowl at the moment.

166
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
We are in dire need

167
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,639
of a brave hero like you,

168
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,399
Azure King.

169
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,679
The Ice Clan?

170
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,879
Yes.

171
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,120
On our way to the Jiuyi District,

172
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,200
we ran into

173
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,080
a band of travelers from the Ice Clan

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
who hurried to Jiuyi Mountain.

175
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,279
Qing Gang.

176
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,440
We should head to the Jiuyi Mountain at once.

177
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,560
They must be after Priest.

178
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,759
Are they trying to ambush him

179
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,200
after he is greatly weakened

180
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,240
by the Tribulations of Hell?

181
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:55,720
Let's go.

182
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,080
Go.

183
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
You will walk the path to Hell.

184
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,879
Are you aware of it?

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,840
Yes.

186
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,039
Even if you might

187
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,720
cease to exist?

188
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,159
I'll never regret.

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
Ever since Shi Ying was young,

190
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,159
he vowed to serve the immortals.

191
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,759
Before he achieves his ambition,

192
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,919
he succumbs to the mortal desires.

193
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
He wants to break the vow
and leave the mountain.

194
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,879
For this atrocious betrayal,

195
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,399
he wishes to seek atonement

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,840
by putting his vessel through trials.

197
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,840
Today, he renounces his title
and stands with his decision,

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,600
knowing the risk involved.

199
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,639
Go now.

200
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,960
Surrender your vessel

201
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,279
and wash away your sins.

202
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,279
You will no longer be an immortal

203
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,999
and can return to the Mortal Realm.

204
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,360
(Ying.)

205
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,720
(You know very well)

206
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,200
(if you succumb
to the mortal desires or not.)

207
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,279
(You can retain your title.)

208
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,360
(You don't need)

209
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,519
(to go through this.)

210
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,120
(Star Gazing Hall)

211
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:52,480
(No.)

212
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,120
(God sees everything.)

213
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,519
I, Shi Ying, will renounce my title

214
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,080
and go through the Tribulations of Hell

215
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,919
to return to the Mortal Realm.

216
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,200
Even at the cost of my own life.

217
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,840
Ying.

218
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,879
Mother.

219
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,879
Ying.

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,080
All my life,

221
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,780
I feel like a bird embroidered
on the folding screen.

222
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,080
Perhaps it could escape
from the folding screen

223
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,600
but it could never possess a soul.

224
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,560
I will send you away.

225
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't worry.

226
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,080
I will pray for you every day.

227
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,519
I will not end my life.

228
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
I will not let those sinister beings

229
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,720
have the satisfaction.

230
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,679
You are faking your death

231
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,919
so you are essentially
deceiving His Majesty.

232
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:22,840
Therefore,

233
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,879
do not come back.

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,360
No.

235
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,320
I will not leave you to suffer alone, Mother.

236
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Mother.

237
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,639
Our spirits are not caged birds.

238
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,360
They are wild plants.

239
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,519
A great fire will reduce them to ashes

240
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
but all it takes is one breezy rain

241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,480
to breathe life into us.

242
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,120
Mother.

243
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,639
The freedom outside of Jialan City

244
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,159
is the breezy rain.

245
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,679
Mother,

246
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,440
I will stay with you forever

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,200
and protect you.

248
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,600
Mother.

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Mother?

250
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:41,999
Mother!

251
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:45,999
Where are you?

252
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,039
Ying.

253
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,919
You think you can save me?

254
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:56,399
No.

255
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,560
No!

256
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:03,999
No.

257
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,679
No.

258
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,520
No.

259
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,360
No.

260
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,600
Mother!

261
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:19,520
No.

262
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:21,919
No.

263
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,959
Mother!

264
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,080
No.

265
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,600
He...

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,919
What is happening to Shi Ying?

267
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,120
He's suffering from the illusion
created by his inner demon.

268
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,520
There is guilt in his heart.

269
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,919
He is now facing the greatest fear
and pain of his life.

270
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,040
And he musters all his blood essence

271
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,879
to overcome it.

272
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,120
If he cannot overcome it,

273
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,879
he will become a demon,

274
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
doomed for eternity.

275
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,840
A demon...

276
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,080
Yan'er.

277
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:45,679
Yan'er.

278
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,120
It's you.

279
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,159
Master.

280
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,679
It's me.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why are you here?

282
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,439
I have been waiting for you.

283
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,399
It's you.

284
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,560
You killed Yuan.

285
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,879
Why would you do that?

286
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,239
Why?

287
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,639
You have to pay for it.

288
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,120
I'll kill you!

289
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:32,679
Okay.

290
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,919
I'll kill you.

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,719
Master!

292
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,679
Stop!

293
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,639
Stop it, Master.

294
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,800
Master!

295
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,479
Master!

296
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,159
Don't do it.

297
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,360
Master!

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,760
Master!

299
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,560
Master!

300
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,800
Master!

301
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,360
(Sorry.)

302
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,679
(I killed your beloved.)

303
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,000
(I will now pay the price.)

304
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,879
Stop it, Master.

305
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,800
Stop it.

306
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,040
Master!

307
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,040
I'll kill you!

308
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,199
Master.

309
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,600
Master.

310
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,719
Zhu Yan.

311
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,879
Master.

312
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,520
Master.

313
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,800
Master.

314
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,679
9,999 trials of the Tribulations of Hell

315
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,959
are created by his inner demon.

316
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,399
He has survived all of it.

317
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,000
And now, his final trial.

318
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,639
Divine Judgment.

319
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,199
Master...

320
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,919
Master...

321
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,360
Master...

322
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
The Divine Thunder will attack
his Qihai pressure point

323
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,639
to incapacitate his immortal power.

324
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:36,600
Previously, all immortals failed at this stage.

325
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:38,439
Ying.

326
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,159
Please make it out alive.

327
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,360
Master.

328
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,840
Master.

329
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:39,399
Master.

330
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,919
- Shi Ying.
- Master!

331
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,000
- Shi Ying.
- Ying.

332
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,199
- Priest of Grand Preceptor.
- Priest of Grand Preceptor.

333
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,760
Ying.

334
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,879
Master.

335
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,919
Yan'er.

336
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,919
It's you.

337
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,120
You came.

338
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:34,320
Ying.

339
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,040
Master.

340
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
I have prepared ten years for this day.

341
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,560
Once he ingests this elixir

342
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,399
and we inject
some of spiritual power into him,

343
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,520
he will recover.

344
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,199
The Ten Sorcerers are attacking us.

345
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,280
Others will need some time

346
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,479
to get into this Cryo Barrier.

347
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,080
Protect Shi Ying.

348
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,919
I see the Ten Sorcerers of Ice Clan

349
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,280
came to Yunhuang.

350
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,000
What a rare occasion.

351
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,399
May I know who gives you

352
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,199
the audacity to barge into
our Jiuyi Mountain?

353
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,120
You'll be dead anyway.

354
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,360
You don't need to know.

355
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,399
Get in position.

356
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,360
Mutual Annihilation.

357
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,600
They want us to die with them.

358
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,760
Protect Shi Ying.

359
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,360
Yin and Yang, combine.

360
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,439
I reign supreme.

361
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:39,600
Celestial Assault!

362
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,399
High Priest!

363
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,320
Your Supreme Majesty.

364
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,479
- High Priest!
- High Priest!

365
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,600
- Your Supreme Majesty.
- High Priest.

366
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:19,959
Master.

367
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,879
Master.

368
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,639
Ying.

369
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,719
Ying.

370
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,840
Forgive me.

371
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,639
I couldn't restore your power.

372
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:20,760
Your Supreme Majesty.

373
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,040
Yan'er told me

374
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,000
that you were trying to protect her.

375
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,320
But I know

376
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,600
that you were trying to protect me.

377
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,719
You did everything for me.

378
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,000
For me.

379
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:38,919
Ying.

380
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,600

406

Consort Qing took her life on the spot.

407

Then Azure King had

417
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,639
You survived the tribulations

418
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,239
but lost all your power.

419
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,400
I would love to tell you
to stay out of everything

420
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,839
and remain indifferent to the world,

421
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
but I know you well

422
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,920
that you will intervene.

423
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:00,880
(Ying.)

424
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,120

(Don't push yourself too far.)

428
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,279
(Tell yourself
that you already do your best.)

429

(Because there's nothing)

430
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,040

433
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,679
(I decided to stay out of politics.)

434
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,600
(Tomb of High Priest Shi Yu of Kongsang)
I ignored your father,

435
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,799
my brother, to rule with negligence
at his discretion.

436
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,359
That's why all the officials
are complacent now.

437
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,679
The vulnerability of Kongsang

438
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:06,000
is our fault,

439
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:12,199
not the innocent subjects'.

440
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,159
Help us rectify this mistake.

441
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,359

447
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,719
The Ten Sorcerers attacked

448
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,120
at such uncanny timing.

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
Xuelu and I will return to Jialan
to convene with His Majesty

450
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,279

00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,440
Please take care of yourself.

453
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,239
I owe you a sincere apology.

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
If you ever need

455
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,420
Qing Gang or me,

456
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,300

Take good care of yourself

462
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,239

00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,279
Don't sulk.

468
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,600
Go take a stroll somewhere.

469
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
The High Priest was alone
for most of his life.

470
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,319
I want to keep him company here.

471
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,920
(The memorial tablet of Qing Yun)

472

473
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,440
Her Highness must have gone to a happy place.

474
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
My condolences.

475
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,560
Yu.

476
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Let's come another day.

477
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,080
If someone finds out

478
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,000
that we are paying respect
to Consort Qing in secret,

479
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,279
we might...

480
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,560
Father.

481
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm sorry.

482
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,839
I shouldn't have paid respect to Mother.

483
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,679
Yu.

484
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:07,880
Get up.

485
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:12,799
Why didn't you tell them

486
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,159
what Bai Fenglin did?

487
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,600
After the recent attack
on Jiuyi Mountain,

488
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,359
His Highness has lost all his power.

489
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,600
Zhu Yan is also afflicted
with a mysterious disease.

490
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,920
His Highness has a lot on his plate

491
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,279
so we shouldn't give him extra burdens.

492
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,480
Right.

493
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,359
Since the envoy has said

494
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,880
that His Majesty has made
a full recovery,

495
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,759
as the new Azure King,

496
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,880
you can lay out Bai Fenglin's crime

497
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,600
