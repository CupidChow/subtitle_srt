Qing Gang?

20
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:32,103
Princess,

21
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:33,184
are you all right?

22
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,144
General Qing, why did you save me?

23
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:38,024
I'm someone

24
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:39,983
who values winning and losing too much.

25
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,103
I don't need your concern.

26
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:43,464
Are you still upset

27
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,263
over the things I've said earlier?

28
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,663
I'm blunt and outspoken.

29
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,223
I'm not good with words.

30
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,543
But I meant you
and the Crimson King no harm.

31
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,864
I can't stand by and watch

32
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:57,744
when you were ambushed today.

33
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,144
You sure have a one-track mind.

34
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,383
So what if I was ambushed?

35
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,784
In any case,

36
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,304
I don't plan to stay here anymore!

37
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:08,784
I can't stand people

38
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:10,263
who play tricks behind others' backs.

39
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:13,663
How about we team up

40
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:15,543
and go up the mountain?

41
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:20,864
You...

42
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:25,584
You...

43
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:30,823
Watch out!

44
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,024
Help!

45
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,103
Ying advanced
as the Priest of Grand Preceptor

46
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:53,703
and started to select first disciple.

47
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:57,064
This is one step closer to the goal

48
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,184
I've arranged for him.

49
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:01,503
Congratulations, Your Supreme Majesty.

50
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,663
The outcome of the disciple selection

51
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,263
must be within my control.

52
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,784
The last name written on the winning pouch

53
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,064
shall be the Priest of Grand Preceptor's

54
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,064
first choice of disciples.

55
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,944
For last name written on the losing pouch,

56
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,663
make sure they encounter accidents

57
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:25,824
and try to eliminate them
as soon as possible.

58
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,543
Kill them if necessary.

59
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,024
Yes.

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,983
(Bai)

61
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:39,584
As for her,

62
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,464
Ying must marry a woman
from the White Clan

63
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,464
when he ascends to the throne.

64
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:45,704
Bai Xuelu

65
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,584
is the Bai Family's eldest daughter.

66
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:49,824
She's clever and intelligent.

67
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,543
I'm sure she'll be able to assist Ying

68
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,784
as the Emperor in the future.

69
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,144
Let the two of them

70
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,344
form a bond.

71
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:58,303
Yes.

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,410
(Qing)

73
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,464
Your Supreme Majesty,

74
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,223
what is this?

75
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,464
Qing Gang isn't here
for the disciple selection.

76
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:10,944
He's investigating the identity
of the Priest of Grand Preceptor.

77
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,504
How dare he play

78
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:13,784
such a trick

79
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:15,384
right under my nose.

80
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,584
I'll make sure he won't leave alive.

81
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,504
Send the beast, Qiong Qi

82
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,904
to his side.

83
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,584
If anything unexpected happens,

84
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,944
it'll be his fate.

85
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,344
But

86
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,144
how do we deal

87
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,543
with the Crimson Clan's princess?

88
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,344
She's traveling with Qing Gang.

89
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,303
If she runs into Qiong Qi,

90
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,663
she's likely to get hurt.

91
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:38,743
Since she's in the same group

92
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:39,944
as Qing Gang,

93
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:41,983
it shall be her fate

94
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,944
if she loses her life.

95
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:45,464
Yes.

96
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,344
General Qing,

97
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:50,223
many people want to team up with you.

98
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,663
Why did you pick me?

99
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,063
Please rest assured.

100
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:55,464
On the battlefield,

101
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:56,504
I never abandon

102
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:57,623
any of my comrades.

103
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:58,944
It's the same here.

104
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:00,824
I won't abandon you too.

105
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,183
You've misunderstood me.

106
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,384
I don't hold any grudges against you.

107
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:06,743
I just don't want
to ascend the mountain.

108
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,223
Nor do I want to be part
of the disciple selection.

109
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:09,623
Since we're in the same group,

110
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:10,543
we'll face glory and shame together.

111
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,144
In that case, I can only

112
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,344
apologize to you.

113
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:16,103
If you're not for the selection,

114
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,584
what are you doing here then?

115
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:38,384
This is bad.

116
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:39,863
It's Qiong Qi.

117
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,543
What kind of luck is this?

118
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,543
Run!

119
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:00,024
Run!

120
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:21,863
Qing Gang!

121
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:29,824
Qing Gang!

122
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:01,944
Run!

123
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:33,024
Qing Gang!

124
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:33,704
I thought the Azure Clan

125
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,024
is proficient in using poison.

126
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,024
Use it quickly.

127
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,303
Even if it doesn't make it dizzy,

128
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:38,904
it can still weaken it.

129
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:40,823
Hurry!

130
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,144
Why are you hesitating?

131
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,864
Our lives are at stake here!

132
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:00,384
What kind of poison did you use?

133
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:02,224
Why didn't it have any effect?

134
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:03,183
But at least

135
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:03,744
it gives us

136
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,063
some time to escape.

137
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,264
Using poison is a deceitful method.

138
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,463
I don't like using it.

139
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:08,984
Even though I belong to the Azure Clan,

140
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,384
I haven't studied it much.

141
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:12,543
So, you don't have

142
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,504
any potent poison.

143
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:16,183
It seems like we're doomed this time.

144
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:34,943
I'm so thirsty.

145
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:39,864
How did the Qiong Qi find out

146
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:41,104
their hiding place?

147
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:45,984
Just now, I saw

148
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,984
Grand Marshal Feng and Yu
blow the whistle.

149
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,343
I didn't expect
it was to lure the Qiong Qi.

150
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,624
How did you see them?

151
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:52,984
Where were you just now?

152
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:54,984
I...

153
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:56,744
I went to Qianyue Peak

154
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:57,984
to teach that annoying girl a lesson.

155
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,624
I didn't expect Qing Gang to rescue her.

156
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:00,904
But if you look at it,

157
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,224
even heaven is on your side.

158
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:03,583
They even encountered the Qiong Qi.

159
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,703
I can't believe you interfered
with the selection of the disciple.

160
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,024
According to the rules
of Jiuyi Mountain,

161
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,224
those who interfere with the selection
shall be punished.

162
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:14,583
Then I'll punish myself

163
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:15,864
by not sleeping in the trees

164
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:17,744
but sleeping in a bed

165
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,463
for a month.

166
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,104
I'm doing it for your own good.

167
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,264
But

168
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,343
the Qiong Qi was already
in the mountains.

169
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:26,583
They would have encountered it anyway.

170
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,504
You must not intervene and save them.

171
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,104
Why is the Qiong Qi
so difficult to deal with?

172
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,423
I told you that your pepper powder

173
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,423
wouldn't work.

174
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,744
I'll think of something.

175
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,343
I'll hold it off.

176
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:13,583
You can run for your life.

177
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:15,384
In the Yunhuang Compendium,
it's recorded

178
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,384
that the Qiong Qi enjoys evil words

179
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:18,583
and loves to watch conflicts.

180
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,024
Those with good conduct are punished,
and those with bad ones are rewarded.

181
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,663
Punishing the good
and promoting the bad.

182
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:24,904
Punishing the good
and promoting the bad.

183
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,303
Punishing the good
and promoting the bad.

184
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:30,904
Stop!

185
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,264
If you kill him today,

186
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:36,784
you're helping the people
eliminate harm.

187
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:44,703
Qing Gang,

188
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,663
even you have your moment today.

189
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:49,583
Lord Qiong Qi,

190
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:52,624
it turns out ancient books are fake.

191
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,543
You're not a ferocious beast at all.

192
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:55,663
I can tell

193
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:58,663
that you're a majestic creature.

194
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:00,504
Lord Qiong Qi,

195
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:01,784
you had no idea.

196
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,744
He's the notorious demon

197
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:04,744
in the army.

198
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,063
He kills without blinking an eye,

199
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:07,463
countless lives

200
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:09,183
died by his hands.

201
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:10,463
If you kill him today,

202
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,984
you'll be eliminating harm
for the people.

203
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:31,984
Scold me.

204
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,264
Scold me.

205
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:36,703
I...

206
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,144
I've taken countless

207
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,063
lives before too.

208
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:41,823
I thought

209
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:44,024
I would die under the hands
of righteous men.

210
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:45,904
But I didn't expect

211
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,744
to end up in your belly today.

212
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:52,463
Are you helping people eliminate harm?

213
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,423
Lord Qiong Qi,

214
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:15,543
until we meet again.

215
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,144
What kind of tricks
did you use just now?

216
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,504
According to ancient books,

217
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,264
Qiong Qi likes wicked people

218
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,784
and dislikes righteous ones.

219
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:26,423
I was just trying my luck.

220
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,864
I was speaking nonsense

221
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:32,984
full of loopholes.

222
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,224
But luckily the Qiong Qi
has a simple mind

223
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:36,904
and couldn't see through my trick
at the time.

224
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,823
It seems

225
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,264
we're not meant to die today.

226
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,264
We finally escaped from a disaster.

227
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:56,343
Such a strong smell of blood.

228
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,943
Could it be that it has come back again?

229
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:13,264
Chong Ming,

230
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,463
tell me what is this.

231
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,224
Isn't...

232
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:20,423
This is...

233
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:21,663
Could this be

234
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:22,943
the legendary Power of Chaos?

235
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,543
It hasn't appeared in hundreds of years.

236
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,463
Why does it suddenly appear here?

237
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,703
The Qiong Qi
is undergoing a tribulation.

238
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:31,943
Could the Power of Chaos

239
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,224
follow the Qiong Qi

240
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,504
because it's the Qiong Qi's tribulation?

241
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,624
The Power of Chaos existed
before the creation of heaven and earth.

242
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,703
It was born from accumulated resentment
throughout history.

243
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,543
It doesn't belong to any magical system.

244
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,063
Emperor Xingzun of the past

245
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,303
was helpless against it.

246
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,024
Forget about those two guys.

247
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,024
I'm afraid that even you
and the High Priest of Grand Preceptor

248
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,183
are not its match.

249
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:03,024
The Power of Chaos
annihilates everything in its path.

250
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,504
It has no form and is immortal.

251
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:06,504
These two

252
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,384
finally escaped the Qiong Qi.

253
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,343
If they were swallowed
by the Power of Chaos,

254
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:12,624
not even bone fragments

255
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:13,823
would be left.

256
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:16,823
Perhaps it is the will of heaven.

257
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,463
Shi Ying. Shi...

258
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:21,784
He must have gone to save

259
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:22,864
that cursed lady.

260
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:23,784
This...

261
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,463
Hurry, Zhu Yan!

262
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:36,583
Qing Gang.

263
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:37,224
Zhu Yan!

264
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:44,104
Qing Gang, watch out!

265
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,183
What is this place?

266
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:10,744
How did I get here?

267
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,463
It's merely a disciple selection.

268
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,423
How did you encounter the Qiong Qi

269
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,823
and even unexpectedly end up here?

270
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:20,224
Who are you?

271
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:22,943
It doesn't matter who I am.

272
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,463
What matters
is the Priest of the Grand Preceptor

273
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:26,663
is tired of you

274
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,423
and worried
that you would pester him to death.

275
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,904
That's why he deliberately
made things difficult for you.

276
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:33,423
No, he wouldn't do that.

277
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,624
He's the Priest of the Grand Preceptor
after all.

278
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:37,864
No matter how heartless he is,

279
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:39,343
he wouldn't go to such extremes.

280
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,784
Why wouldn't he?

281
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,224
He has deceived you before.

282
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,104
Didn't he send Chong Ming here

283
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:46,543
to deal with you earlier?

284
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:49,384
Everything you said is all lies.

285
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,703
You're lying to me.

286
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,703
He wouldn't do such a thing.

287
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,384
You're lying!

288
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:55,984
They are all lies!

289
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:58,183
He deceived you,

290
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,024
looked down on you,

291
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,943
and used every means
to drive you out of Jiuyi Mountain.

292
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:05,624
Yet, you had to stay here

293
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:08,583
and endure it.

294
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:07,184
I'm going to kill
the Priest of the Grand Preceptor.

295
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:08,103
I'm going to kill the person

296
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,143
who looks down on me.

297
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,303
Let me go! Let me go!

298
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:13,903
Let me go!

299
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:15,744
Stay still.

300
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:19,583
The person you want to kill

301
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:20,944
is in front of you.

302
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:23,303
It's you.

303
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:24,424
Let me go!

304
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:25,704
I want to kill you.

305
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,184
I want to kill you!

306
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:42,704
Why didn't you dodge?

307
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:45,103
I don't want you to die.

308
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:48,784
You don't want me to die...

309
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,383
This is the Abyss of Resentment.

310
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,464
The resentful spirit

311
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,623
is manipulating your resentment.

312
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:20,343
Don't look,

313
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:21,543
and don't listen.

314
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,303
Who are you?

315
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,343
What just happened?

316
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,863
Did you save me?

317
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:49,464
What happened to my eyes?

318
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,184
Why is my vision blurry?

319
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,583
My voice...

320
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:57,744
Why does it sound strange?

321
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:00,143
We're within the Power of Chaos
at the moment.

322
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:01,823
You're affected
by the resentful spirits.

323
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:04,303
So you're unable to see
or hear clearly temporarily.

324
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,024
But you'll recover soon.

325
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:08,784
The Power of Chaos?

326
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:10,744
Before the creation of the universe,

327
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:12,784
heaven and earth were in chaos
to begin with.

328
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,984
After the gods created the world,

329
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,704
only this place remains
to absorb resentment.

330
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,583
Gong Gong struck Buzhou Mountain,
which caused great destruction.

331
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:21,784
When Nuwa Goddess repaired the sky,

332
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,903
she cut off the four limbs
of a giant turtle.

333
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:25,504
All the resentment of them

334
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,303
was absorbed here.

335
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:29,504
And the Power of Chaos

336
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:31,063
has now become
the world's favorite place

337
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,504
for absorbing the resentment

338
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,103
and malevolent energy of all things.

339
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:39,823
Then who are you?

340
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:41,264
Why did you come here,

341
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,063
and why did you save me?

342
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:44,984
You don't need to know the details.

343
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:46,504
If you trust me,

344
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:47,944
then come with me.

345
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,424
Thank you.

346
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:54,784
Thank you, sir.

347
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,664
I lost my rationality earlier.

348
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:00,103
Did I do

349
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,303
anything disrespectful?

350
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:02,543
No.

351
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,424
It was just an illusion.

352
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:15,744
Princess Zhu Yan!

353
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,143
Stay away from us!

354
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,543
- This is bad.
- Watch out!

355
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:25,383
Someone, help!

356
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:26,343
Help!

357
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:28,143
Sister!

358
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:30,024
Sister!

359
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,623
Sister!

360
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,264
Run quickly.

361
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:35,264
The Bai Family cannot lose

362
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:36,224
two of their daughters.

363
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:37,063
Run now!

364
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:39,903
(The Qiong Qi loves listening
to mean words.)

365
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,264
(Punishing the good
and promoting the bad.)

366
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:42,664
(Punishing the good
and promoting the bad.)

367
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:43,543
Wait!

368
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:48,343
You cannot eat this wicked person!

369
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:54,343
Forgive me.

370
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,063
Forgive me.

371
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:55,984
Sister!

372
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:01,504
She is disrespectful and unfilial,

373
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,143
plotting a rebellion.

374
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:14,984
She is a ruthless killer,

375
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:17,103
a notorious thief who preys on the poor.

376
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,343
She's also a seductress,

377
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,103
specializing in forcefully
marrying common men.

378
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,184
In any case, you can't have her!

379
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:26,744
Sister.

380
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:29,984
(Someone highly skilled)

381
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:30,984
(is clearly helping us in secret.)

382
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:32,224
(I wonder who it is.)

383
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:36,424
Are you all okay?

384
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:37,903
General Qing,

385
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,264
we only met twice.

386
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:43,784
Yet, you know me so well.

387
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:47,823
I'm disrespectful and unfilial,

388
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,583
a ruthless killer,

389
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,103
and a seductress too, right?

390
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:01,704
I'll be borrowing your robe for now.

391
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:03,744
I supposed you won't mind, right?

392
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:06,543
You can have it, Princess Xuelu.

393
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:08,184
The Qiong Qi likes wicked people.

394
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,623
That's why I came up with the plan.

395
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:11,343
I had no intention to slander you.

396
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,583
General Qing, there's no need
to be nervous.

397
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:15,823
I know

398
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:17,903
you always look out for me.

399
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:20,823
But just now,

400
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,823
Qiong Qi didn't believe it at first.

401
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:23,903
Why did it

402
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:25,383
suddenly change its mind and leave?

403
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:28,903
It's because we're blessed by heaven.

404
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:30,744
That's why we escaped danger.

405
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,224
However, this place is filled
with strange phenomena

406
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:35,103
and is not safe.

407
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:37,623
We should leave now.

408
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:42,143
Where's your teammate?

409
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:44,024
Princess Zhu Yan

410
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,784
was engulfed by a cloud of black smoke.

411
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:47,303
I'm searching for her now.

412
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:49,704
Yan is with you?

413
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:51,823
Then where is she now?

414
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:56,024
Then we should hurry and look...

415
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:56,944
Then we won't be in your way

416
00:24:56,944 --> 00:24:57,784
to search for her.

417
00:24:58,504 --> 00:24:59,383
Zhu Yan is clever.

418
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:00,984
I'm sure she'll be all right.

419
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,303
Then

420
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:05,623
I look forward to seeing you
at the peak.

421
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,424
General Qing, I'll wait for you.

422
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,343
General Qing,

423
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,103
I'll leave Yan to you then.

424
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:15,744
(Even heaven is on my side.)

425
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:18,303
(The first disciple
will be no other than me.)

426
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:14,424
What did I

427
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:16,623
just come into contact with?

428
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,103
It was soft and chilly.

429
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:21,784
Like a ghost.

430
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:23,303
Did I run into a ghost?

431
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,184
Am I going to die?

432
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:38,903
Take it.

433
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:41,343
What's this?

434
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:44,784
There are ghosts in this place.

435
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:47,704
If you get into contact with them,
you'll die.

436
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,583
Oh, I know.

437
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,383
This is a bead to ward off evil spirits.

438
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:54,664
Thank you, sir.

439
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:58,383
Let's go.

440
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,424
(Indeed, effective medicine
is sure bitter.)

441
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:10,343
(But at least)

442
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,784
(it's a token of his kindness.)

443
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,143
(I should endure it.)

444
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,224
(That's strange.)

445
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:16,583
(Why do I taste)

446
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:18,664
(Chinese goldthread?)

447
00:27:25,504 --> 00:27:26,264
Sir,

448
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,784
what is this?

449
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:34,343
It's you.

450
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,704
Why did you come and save me?

451
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,184
If it were anyone,

452
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:39,383
I would have come.

453
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:40,623
People from Six Ministries

454
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:42,063
came up the mountain

455
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:43,303
because they wanted
to become my disciples.

456
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:44,504
I cannot let any

457
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,903
of you have any mishaps.

458
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:49,543
Your words sound nice.

459
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:50,744
But I think

460
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,264
you secretly want to get rid of me.

461
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,504
You're afraid it'll get out of control

462
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:54,343
and end badly.

463
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,744
That's why you came to save me.

464
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:57,583
Think whatever you want.

465
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,224
So what's the deal
with this Chinese goldthread?

466
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,583
I just wanted you

467
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:10,984
to keep quiet.

468
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:14,264
So you thought I was annoying earlier.

469
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:16,744
There was no danger just now.

470
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,464
Yet you made me eat

471
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,744
something so bitter.

472
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,343
It wasn't a ghost or spirit just now.

473
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:26,583
Then what was that?

474
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:42,464
Forget it.

475
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,264
Let's just let bygones be bygones.

476
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:46,784
Think whatever you want.

477
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:54,623
Stop!

478
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,664
Since we're no longer in danger,

479
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:00,464
let's go our separate ways

480
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:01,863
and find our own paths.

481
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:04,383
You find me annoying anyway.

482
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:06,184
So I don't want to travel with you.

483
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:13,303
Hey, you.

484
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:14,903
Don't follow me.

485
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,383
Then I'll go ahead.

486
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:00,704
Farewell.

487
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:12,464
I...

488
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,024
Do we really have to walk past it?

489
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,543
You can fly, right?

490
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:18,704
The Power of Chaos

491
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,623
doesn't fall within the scope
of any magic techniques.

492
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:21,944
Over here,

493
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:23,744
I can't use magic.

494
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:26,944
Greedy Spirit.

495
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:19,903
Zhu Yan, run!

496
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:01,424
That was close.

497
00:33:04,744 --> 00:33:05,303
Within the Power of Chaos,

498
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:07,224
only this artifact

499
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,744
can function on its own.

500
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:11,543
You only need to open the Jade Umbrella,

501
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,024
and it'll form a protective barrier

502
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:14,704
to withstand external attacks.

503
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:18,024
But if you close it,

504
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,024
it's just a toothpick

505
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,823
that can only be swung with brute force.

506
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:22,903
Didn't you see

507
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:24,303
how I used it

508
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:26,224
along the way?

509
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:29,784
I...

510
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:45,623
I broke it.

511
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:47,383
What should I do now?

512
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:48,944
What else?

513
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,704
I'll compensate you.

514
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:56,504
Can I?

515
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:00,103
What?

516
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:03,303
I'll compensate for the artifact.

517
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:08,383
I'm sorry.

518
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:10,863
Don't apologize to me.

519
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:13,823
Apologize to yourself.

520
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:15,863
You don't want to become my disciple.

521
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:17,903
So I won't accept you as one.

522
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:19,784
You may have ascended the mountain

523
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:20,903
with the intention
of becoming my disciple.

524
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,704
But you can't even imitate

525
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:25,624
how I use the artifact.

526
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:27,863
So

527
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,584
you were angry

528
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:32,104
because I didn't study.

529
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:34,303
Not because I broke your artifact.

530
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,144
The artifact is an external object.

531
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,184
Why would I care about it?

532
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:40,423
So

533
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:43,544
I'm more important than this artifact.

534
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:44,704
Nonsense.

535
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:46,104
Human lives

536
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:48,264
are more important than artifacts.

537
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:01,664
What's this?

538
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:24,664
Come up.

539
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,544
I didn't do it on purpose.

540
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,383
What's going on here?

541
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:11,903
It seems like my guess was correct.

542
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,264
The hopes, trust,

543
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,064
and joy in people's hearts

544
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:17,704
will rebuild the Bridge of Heart

545
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,264
and help us cross to the other side.

546
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,503
But doubts,

547
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:23,624
suspicions,

548
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,023
and lies in people's hearts

549
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:28,184
will damage the Bridge of Heart.

550
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,144
Lies?

551
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:34,983
What I said just now wasn't a lie.

552
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:36,343
Is that so?

553
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,664
You look quite guilt-stricken to me.

554
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:43,224
Come on.

555
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:44,784
To cross this bridge,

556
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,303
let us think

557
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,584
of happy things.

558
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,584
When I was young,

559
00:36:58,584 --> 00:36:59,903
in the palace,

560
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:02,863
the Crown Prince helped me
out of trouble

561
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,544
and gave me a gift, Snowy Rosa.

562
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,343
Although I had only a brief moment

563
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:10,784
with the Crown Prince,

564
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,544
his noble bearing

565
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,144
is unforgettable to me.

566
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:30,823
Now, it's your turn.

567
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:38,863
When I was young, my mother

568
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,584
often made pastries for me to eat.

569
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:42,784
They were delicious

570
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:44,303
and they melted in the mouth.

571
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:52,503
But

572
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,303
ever since she passed away...

573
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:06,383
When I was young,

574
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:09,863
my father didn't allow me to cultivate.

575
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:13,903
He always said it wasn't good for a girl

576
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:15,784
to wield weapons.

577
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:18,023
But

578
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,503
after returning from Jialan City,

579
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:22,423
he changed his mind

580
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,383
after listening
to the Crown Prince's words.

581
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,584
Sometimes, he even personally guided me.

582
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:40,383
I can't think of any happy moments now.

583
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:41,584
Why don't you continue yours?

584
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,544
(I didn't expect)

585
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:47,463
(he doesn't have
that many happy memories.)

586
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:49,784
(It's no wonder he's so cold)

587
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,423
(and distant from others.)

588
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,343
Every spring,

589
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,463
Keeper Yuan would personally

590
00:38:58,624 --> 00:38:59,664
make a kite for me

591
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:01,624
and take Yufei and me

592
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:03,023
to the grasslands to fly the kite.

593
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:05,144
The kites made by Keeper Yuan

594
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:06,224
were large and light,

595
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:07,823
and they were never the same each year.

596
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:09,064
And Yufei

597
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,463
has the most beautiful voice

598
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,064
in the grasslands.

599
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:13,184
You know what?

600
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:14,983
Every festival,

601
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,863
we would gather around the bonfire.

602
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:17,903
We would hold hands,

603
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,664
watch her sing, dance,

604
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,224
and eat roasted lamb.

605
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:23,903
Oh,

606
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:25,104
I also have a friend,

607
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:26,224
named Xueying.

608
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:27,664
She was born in

609
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:28,584
Jialan Imperial City.

610
00:39:29,544 --> 00:39:32,983
She has a gentle and lovely personality.

611
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:08,383
(Father, Mother,)

612
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:09,903
(Crown Prince, Yuan,)

613
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:11,584
(Yufei, and Xueying.)

614
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:13,784
(I've already talked about them.)

615
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:15,983
(What other happy memories
could I share?)

616
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:18,943
Oh,

617
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:20,624
there's one more thing.

618
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:23,104
Later, I met you in Jiuyi Mountain.

619
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:24,463
Is that

620
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:26,823
also considered a happy moment too?

621
00:40:27,784 --> 00:40:29,343
Oh, I said something wrong.

622
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,463
I'm sure the bridge will collapse.

623
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:31,744
We must run!

624
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:52,184
What's going on?

625
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:56,503
At that time,

626
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,383
you treated me harshly.

627
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,584
I swore I would never see you again.

628
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,624
But why does it grow

629
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:05,823
this Bridge of Benevolence?

630
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,943
Let's go.

631
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:45,863
Could it be that the path we just took

632
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,064
was also a thought in your mind?

633
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,264
Could it be that this memory

634
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:53,383
also brings you happiness?

635
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:00,624
Fine.

636
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,624
You must be really happy

637
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,343
when you finally made me angry
and leave that day.

638
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,423
Let's go quickly.
