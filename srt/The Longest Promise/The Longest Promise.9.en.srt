19
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:23,135
My husband and I
were engulfed by Power of Chaos

20
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:26,815
when we were traveling outside.

21
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,734
And now,

22
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:34,334
he has already passed away,

23
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:40,015
leaving me alone in this place.

24
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:47,015
It's been a really long while
since I saw people.

25
00:02:56,894 --> 00:03:00,095
There are fierce delusional spirits

26
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,255
roaming around here.

27
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,054
You two,

28
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,894
please go inside with me.

29
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:13,894
Granny, be careful.

30
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,174
Come on.

31
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,095
Young people,

32
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,334
you must be tired.

33
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,614
Wipe off your sweat.

34
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,575
Here, wipe off your sweat.

35
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:44,734
Thank you, Granny.

36
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:46,855
All right.

37
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:52,614
I've been searching
for a way out desperately

38
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:55,255
for twenty years,

39
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:58,494
but to no avail.

40
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,855
Here, drink some water.

41
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,734
Finally, I met you here today.

42
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:14,255
You can keep me company from now on.

43
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:15,654
Granny.

44
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:16,695
Someone is waiting for us

45
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:17,695
outside.

46
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:18,774
Why don't you

47
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:19,815
come with us?

48
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,255
I don't see anything good out there.

49
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:25,294
The gentleman next to you

50
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,894
is someone with great ambition.

51
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,534
This is the only place

52
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,015
where the two of you

53
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:36,094
can stay together forever.

54
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,175
And so,

55
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:43,534
he'll only have his eyes fixated on you

56
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,735
and no one else.

57
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,175
Isn't that good?

58
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,414
Granny, you have mistaken us.

59
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,094
I'll never be with him forever.

60
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,575
Staying just half a day beside him
is boring enough.

61
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,175
Right?

62
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:12,894
She's right.

63
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,255
We plan

64
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:15,894
to stay here.

65
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,334
Pardon?

66
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,495
Don't be shy, young girl.

67
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:32,055
It's exhausting

68
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,175
after walking for a long time.

69
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,015
Here, have a piece of pastry.

70
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,454
It's better not

71
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:43,974
to eat food from a stranger.

72
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:45,454
Since we've decided

73
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:46,974
to settle down here,

74
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,654
she's not a stranger to us.

75
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:53,935
Exactly.

76
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:56,255
He's right.

77
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:01,774
Come on, open wide. I'll feed you.

78
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:23,695
You two

79
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,815
will stay here with me for good.

80
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:44,575
Rest assured. It's safe.

81
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:45,894
They are all dust.

82
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:47,854
She's a delusional spirit.

83
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,495
We have to break her obsession

84
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,214
to deal with her.

85
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,575
Most people are cautious

86
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,294
and her desire can't be satisfied.

87
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:56,815
The more they reject her,

88
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:57,974
the more obsessed she becomes,

89
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,294
which arouses more anger in her.

90
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,135
Why did you give me the pastry

91
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,454
when you didn't eat it?

92
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,094
There are no chopsticks here.

93
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,615
I couldn't eat.

94
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:10,255
Fine.

95
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,534
You're the elegant one,
and I'm uncivilized.

96
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,214
I simply deserve to eat dirt.

97
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:16,214
Exactly.

98
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,334
Now that you've tasted the dirt

99
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:19,414
and it's not delicious,

100
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,495
why should I eat it, then?

101
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:23,534
You!

102
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,375
What a way

103
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:30,894
you ruin my day.

104
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:40,774
This is it.

105
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,960
(The full moon wanes and
overflowing water spills.)

106
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
(Extreme resentment breeds wrath
and death leads to a new life.)

107
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:51,894
The full moon wanes and
overflowing water spills.

108
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:56,214
Extreme resentment breeds wrath
and death leads to a new life.

109
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,055
What does this mean?

110
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,774
Greed, resentment and delusion.

111
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:03,615
We've broken the three spirits.

112
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,175
This should be the way
to get out of this place.

113
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,334
However,

114
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,615
I haven't fathomed
the underlying meaning.

115
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:15,935
Have you ever thought that you'd

116
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,495
be trapped inside here with me forever

117
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,255
when you came in?

118
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,055
Priest of Grand Preceptor.

119
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,935
You're of noble status

120
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:30,495
and with decent behavior.

121
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,054
Yet you risk yourself in danger

122
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,814
for a clumsy and reckless person like me,

123
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:38,694
is it worth it?

124
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,294
I'm talking to you.

125
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,174
I don't have to answer that.

126
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:55,934
Because we'll leave this place.

127
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,095
Look, the exit.

128
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:07,294
It is, and it's not.

129
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:10,574
What do you mean?

130
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,894
If I push you into that hole

131
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,694
and sacrifice you to Power of Chaos,

132
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:22,894
I can leave this place unscathed.

133
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:24,735
What did you just say?

134
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,255
I came here

135
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,735
for the force of Chaos

136
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:31,015
to aid my cultivation.

137
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,814
So, you didn't mean

138
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,294
to save me?

139
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,215
Well, you should blame
your own tough luck

140
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:40,934
for being engulfed by the Power of Chaos.

141
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:42,294
But

142
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,174
you're a godsend to me.

143
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:49,174
Anyway, it will be considered an accident

144
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,375
if something happens to you

145
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:53,174
during the disciple selection competition.

146
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:54,855
Crimson King

147
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:57,215
won't blame me.

148
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:08,975
You must be lying.

149
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:11,255
I've deceived you before,

150
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,294
and I'm doing it again.

151
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,654
You're so predictable.

152
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,135
You...

153
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:21,735
Either I push you down,

154
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,735
or you jump down yourself.

155
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,054
Either way,

156
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,054
you're going to die.

157
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,735
You always fool me,

158
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,455
trick me, and look down upon me.

159
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,455
I hate you. I hate you!

160
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,054
How fantastic.

161
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:34,294
How did you identify the way
to leave this place?

162
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,095
Isn't this

163
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:40,135
all within your plan?

164
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,534
The full moon wanes
and overflowing water spills.

165
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:47,615
Extreme resentment breeds wrath
and death leads to a new life.

166
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,054
The hole that's shrouded

167
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,255
by immense resentment

168
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:52,894
will only open

169
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,015
for those who are vexed
with extreme resentment.

170
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,534
If I don't make her resent me,

171
00:12:57,855 --> 00:12:59,534
how could she turn the death end

172
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,015
into an opportunity

173
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,455
and return to the mortal world?

174
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,975
But she'll never know

175
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,735
your kind will

176
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:10,894
when she jumped off here.

177
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,455
When she's passing through the hole,

178
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,534
she would only resent you, hate you,

179
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,095
and curse you.

180
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:20,054
Meanwhile, her strong resentment

181
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,054
will consume you

182
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,855
and trap you here.

183
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,054
You'll end up being like me.

184
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:33,215
Zhu Yan.

185
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:37,774
Zhu Yan.

186
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:39,894
Zhu Yan.

187
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:44,735
Qing Gang.

188
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,615
Where am I?

189
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,255
Qianyue Peak.

190
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,215
How long has it been?

191
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:58,735
Half an hour.

192
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,255
The black mist engulfed you.

193
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,894
But how did you manage
to get out of that?

194
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,615
One day inside the hole
is a moment in the world.

195
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,335
I'm still alive.

196
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:20,455
Once she realized

197
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,135
that you did that

198
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,654
to save her

199
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,414
but ended up being killed
by her resentment,

200
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:29,015
she'll be in pieces.

201
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,934
And that's what I'm looking forward to.

202
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,615
What? A benign thought?

203
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,294
I've never seen

204
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,455
someone harbored a benign thought

205
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,495
when they jumped through
the Hole of Life and Death.

206
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,135
When did you

207
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,495
hint at her?

208
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,654
The entire place is under your control.

209
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,174
I have no chance

210
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:56,414
to tell her about this.

211
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:58,095
You said

212
00:14:58,534 --> 00:14:59,335
that her feelings

213
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,015
stem from me

214
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,855
and will backfire on me.

215
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,255
To your surprise,

216
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:05,814
it's a benign thought she holds.

217
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,495
Probably she has discerned

218
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:09,215
my real intention.

219
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:12,495
Be it the Crown Prince

220
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,654
or Priest of Grand Preceptor,

221
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:15,455
she has never doubted me.

222
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:18,015
I'm not good at gambling,

223
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,654
but my bet didn't fail me today.

224
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:27,215
At that time,

225
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:28,975
he was trying to save me.

226
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:30,654
I guessed it right.

227
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:32,814
Either I push you down

228
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:36,054
or you jump down yourself.

229
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,455
Either way,

230
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:38,934
you're going to die.

231
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,335
You always fool me,

232
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:47,054
trick me, and look down upon me.

233
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:49,255
I hate you.

234
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,054
I hate you!

235
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:01,335
(Strangely,)

236
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,654
(I'm still not convinced)

237
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,095
(that you'd do that to me.)

238
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:10,455
If so, how will you escape?

239
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,335
Where are you now?

240
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:15,255
Zhu Yan.

241
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,934
What's wrong with you, Zhu Yan?

242
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:20,375
We must set off

243
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:21,615
right now

244
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,654
for the Jade Bone.

245
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:23,694
I thought joining Jiuyi Mountain

246
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:24,814
was against your will.

247
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,255
Why are you so eager now?

248
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,015
(Maybe the Jade Bone)

249
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:29,534
(can find its owner.)

250
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,054
Stop asking. We should go now.

251
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:41,294
Your Supreme Majesty.

252
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,574
Is it worth risking your life

253
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,615
to save a mere princess?

254
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,654
Lang Gan, Emperor Xingzun,
was once the great invincible

255
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,455
and even failed to get the upper hand

256
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,934
while mired in the Chaos.

257
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,694
But you just went into it

258
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:58,934
without hesitation.

259
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:00,455
I wouldn't have interfered

260
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:01,934
if it had been a natural disaster.

261
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,095
But the Power of Chaos

262
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:04,574
was coming after Qiong Qi.

263
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:05,735
And someone

264
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,054
deliberately provoked Qiong Qi

265
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,334
to attack them.

266
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,175
I just couldn't turn a blind eye.

267
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:11,895
That's my plan.

268
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:15,814
Qing Gang

269
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,334
is sent by the Consort Qing

270
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:19,374
to spy on you

271
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:20,614
with the intention to kill you.

272
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:24,655
I'll never let him off the hook.

273
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,935
He's not your match,

274
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,215
but the Azure Clan
has exceptional poisoning skills.

275
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,534
You won't know

276
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:32,895
what trap he set against you

277
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,854
when he's in the mountain.

278
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:36,814
I wouldn't know

279
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,175
if Qing Gang intended to kill me.

280
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,574
But if I hadn't saved them,

281
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:41,774
kin of all six Clans

282
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:44,534
might lose their lives here.

283
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,015
Ever since the founding
of Jiuyi Mountain,

284
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:47,334
there was no such tragedy happened

285
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,134
during

286
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,774
the disciple selection competition.

287
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,415
If such horrendous accidents
were to occur

288
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,175
as soon as I ascend
as the Priest of Grand Preceptor,

289
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:54,854
how would I

290
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,015
take in disciples in the future?

291
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,175
Nonsense.

292
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,534
The lives of the two aren't

293
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,495
even half as precious as yours.

294
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,534
Even if something happens,

295
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,175
don't worry.

296
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:07,574
I assure you

297
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:09,695
that no one will make a squeak.

298
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:11,215
Your Supreme Majesty.

299
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:14,215
We cultivate to protect all beings.

300
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,334
We can't take people's lives lightly.

301
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:19,134
If you want me
to diverge from the teaching

302
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:20,735
and become a degenerate person,

303
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,574
I'm not going to take in disciples.

304
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:41,574
Fine.

305
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:44,695
I compromise.

306
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,255
I won't interfere with you
in choosing the disciple.

307
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:48,614
However,

308
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,534
you spoke steadfastly just now.

309
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,054
I begin to be dubious about something.

310
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,374
Have you met Zhu Yan

311
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:02,015
before this?

312
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:07,175
And that convinces me
why you saved her without hesitation.

313
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:09,054
You have overthought.

314
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,814
I have never met Zhu Yan.

315
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,294
Besides, given her aptitude,

316
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,495
I doubt I'll let her stay

317
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,495
in the mountain

318
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,975
and teach her.

319
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,094
Ying,

320
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,495
I know

321
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:35,015
you harbor a kind heart

322
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,574
and don't want others to suffer for you.

323
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:40,695
But you should know

324
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:45,094
that if you've met her before,

325
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,895
she would be that cursed lady
who will do harm to you.

326
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,774
I won't allow her to live.

327
00:19:57,215 --> 00:20:00,054
So, I believe

328
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,215
you won't keep her in the mountain.

329
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,614
Right?

330
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,094
Since my explanation

331
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,015
isn't going to put your worries to rest,

332
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:15,935
I will do whatever you say.

333
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,977
(Qianyue Peak, Jiuyi Mountain)

334
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:57,215
(His artifact is moving freely.)

335
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,895
(Probably he has already escaped)

336
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,735
(from the Power of Chaos by now.)

337
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:05,655
Qing Gang, please.

338
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:07,854
Both of us arrived at the peak
at the same time.

339
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:09,415
After retrieving the Jade Bone,

340
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,415
let's have

341
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:11,655
a fair and open competition.

342
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,094
You don't have to hold back.

343
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,134
Xuelu, walk slowly.

344
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:25,655
Yan.

345
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:38,574
Yan.

346
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:50,895
(Why didn't Bai Xuelu be bounced back?)

347
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:54,614
(This enchantment)

348
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,054
(is set by the person on my side.)

349
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:57,334
(The Jade Bone is mine.)

350
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:08,854
(The first team
to reach the top of the hill)

351
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:09,774
(and take this Jade Bone,)

352
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:11,134
(the winner of that team)

353
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,253
(will be the first disciple)

354
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,614
(of Jiuyi Mountain in the future.)

355
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:14,415
(Drats!)

356
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,455
(I've forgotten the enchantment)

357
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:16,374
(set by the Priest.)

358
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,094
Xuelu.

359
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:54,774
Xuelu.

360
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:27,854
Xuelu.

361
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:35,655
Xuelu.

362
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:36,495
Bai Xuelu!

363
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:38,814
Xuelu!

364
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,334
Princess Xuelu!

365
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,294
Bai Xuelu!

366
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,015
Everything is initiated
by the Jade Bone.

367
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:49,495
Destroy it now.

368
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,015
No, the Jade Bone is mine.

369
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:53,094
I'll be the first disciple.

370
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,255
I'm not going to let go of it,
no matter what.

371
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,854
Xuelu, please let go of it.

372
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:03,374
Qing Gang.

373
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:04,294
Qing Gang.

374
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:43,175
Xuelu.

375
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,294
Xuelu.

376
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,094
Xueying.

377
00:24:58,215 --> 00:24:58,695
Bai Xuelu.

378
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:00,495
Destroy the Jade Bone now.

379
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:02,215
You're dragging everyone down.

380
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:04,175
Don't you ever think
of taking this from me.

381
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,814
Do you hear yourself?

382
00:25:06,094 --> 00:25:07,655
You're killing yourself.

383
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,294
Even so,

384
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:11,455
I'm willing to die with the Jade Bone.

385
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,094
Bai Xuelu.

386
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:17,854
Xuelu.

387
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:32,094
Yan.

388
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,294
It was just an illusion.

389
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:33,495
I got it.

390
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,655
This is the second assessment, wisdom.

391
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:36,495
Yan.

392
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:38,374
You'd rather destroy the Jade Bone

393
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:39,094
and sacrifice yourself

394
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:40,175
to save us.

395
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:41,534
This is a great kindness.

396
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,455
Great kindness is wisdom.

397
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,814
Priest of Grand Preceptor is looking

398
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:45,655
for a kind person

399
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:46,975
as his first disciple.

400
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:48,695
And the Jade Bone chose you.

401
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,134
Congratulations, Yan.

402
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,814
I got the Jade Bone first.

403
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,334
Give it back to me.

404
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:00,574
Why should I?

405
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,374
Judging from
your aptitude and character,

406
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:03,175
you're not qualified

407
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:04,574
to be the first disciple of the Priest.

408
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,255
Qing Gang got injured

409
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,415
because of you.

410
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,814
Qing Gang should
have the Jade Bone instead.

411
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,015
Give it to me.

412
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,015
Xueying.

413
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:08,334
Are you all right?

414
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:13,255
Where are Xuelu and General Qing?

415
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:16,134
Princess Xuelu, hang in there.

416
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:19,895
Xuelu.

417
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:20,695
Bai Xuelu.

418
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:22,814
Hold on tight.

419
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:25,814
Xuelu.

420
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:31,574
This is foolish.

421
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:48,334
(He escaped from the Power of Chaos.)

422
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,134
(After the ceremony ends,)

423
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,854
(I'll leave without worries.)

424
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:52,935
According to the rules
of the competition,

425
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,854
anyone who managed to reach Qianyue Peak

426
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:57,294
is eligible to join Jiuyi Mountain

427
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:58,814
and become the nominal disciple

428
00:28:59,015 --> 00:28:59,814
of the Priest of Grand Preceptor

429
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,695
and study magic techniques
for one month.

430
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,175
Yes.

431
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,015
Thank you, Priest of Grand Preceptor.

432
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:11,015
The winner of the first team
that obtained the Jade Bone

433
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,175
will be taken in
as the Priest's first disciple

434
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:15,975
and is allowed to stay

435
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,534
to learn from
the Priest of Grand Preceptor

436
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,854
after the one-month period.

437
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,054
I have limited abilities

438
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,495
for this position.

439
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,854
I'll withdraw from the candidate
of the Priest's first disciple.

440
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:41,935
Xueying.

441
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,655
In this case,

442
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,255
Bai Xuelu

443
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,774
will be my first disciple.

444
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:49,574
I, Xuelu, am grateful for your grace.

445
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:50,614
Hold on.

446
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,574
Greetings, High Priest.

447
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:55,415
Your Supreme Majesty.

448
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:05,854
I have a different opinion.

449
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:06,975
Princess Zhu Yan

450
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,574
gave up on the Jade Bone
that was within her reach

451
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,854
to save her friends.

452
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:14,935
Besides, she wasn't equipped
with any tools in the mountain

453
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,534
and she drove Qiong Qi away.

454
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,735
She's brave and wise,

455
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,054
and she shouldn't be passed over.

456
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:28,255
I wonder what you say.

457
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,255
I know

458
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:37,814
you harbor a kind heart

459
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:40,215
and don't want others to suffer for you.

460
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:43,015
If you have met with her before,

461
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:46,895
she'd be that cursed lady
who will do harm to you.

462
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:50,735
I won't allow her to live.

463
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,895
So, I believe

464
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:58,294
you won't keep her in the mountain.

465
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,054
You're right, Your Supreme Majesty.

466
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:04,695
I had poor judgment.

467
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:06,455
In this case,

468
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:08,814
I'll take Princess Zhu Yan

469
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:10,294
as my first disciple

470
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:12,255
and teach her magic techniques.

471
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:19,774
It's stipulated

472
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:21,614
that the winner is the one
who retrieved the Jade Bone.

473
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,015
Don't change the rule easily.

474
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:24,255
This is not a child's play.

475
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:26,334
How about this?

476
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,655
You don't have to take in
the disciple as of now.

477
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,015
You may take some time

478
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:30,895
to observe

479
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,455
their character and aptitude

480
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:34,294
and select your first disciple

481
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:36,415
after the one-month learning.

482
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:38,854
And this will be impartial

483
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:40,134
and rightful.

484
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:41,534
How does that sound?

485
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:45,774
I obey you, Your Supreme Majesty.

486
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,175
Thank you, High Priest.
Thank you, Priest.

487
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:55,574
Grant them immortal tokens.

488
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:15,534
(Use this brush)

489
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:16,895
(to verify the identity of the Priest.)

490
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:19,614
(If he turns out to be the Crown Prince,
exterminate him.)

491
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:21,175
(The destiny of the Azure Clan)

492
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,975
(falls on your shoulders.)

493
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:52,495
Yuan.

494
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,334
It must be boring waiting
down the mountain.

495
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:55,574
Why did you come down?

496
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:57,215
Did you pass the selection?

497
00:32:58,814 --> 00:32:59,975
Cut that off.

498
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:01,975
These Chinese's rings

499
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:03,695
are interlocking.

500
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:05,854
But what I've encountered

501
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,534
was more complicated.

502
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:08,695
Care to share?

503
00:33:08,975 --> 00:33:09,814
You know what,

504
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:10,935
the Lord Immortal Official

505
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:11,814
I ran into before

506
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,415
is the new Priest of Grand Preceptor.

507
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:16,255
Are you surprised

508
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,854
when you hear this too?

509
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,735
So, what's your next plan?

510
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:25,255
I passed the preliminary selection

511
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:26,574
by accident.

512
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,975
But I won't...

513
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:31,574
I don't want

514
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:32,655
to become his disciple.

515
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:39,334
Are you all right, Yuan?

516
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:43,255
I'm fine.

517
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:46,334
Perhaps I'm tired lately.

518
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:50,655
Yuan.

519
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:52,935
I've learned

520
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:53,735
a soul-soothing magic technique

521
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,134
from Jiuyi Mountain.

522
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:56,695
Let me try it out on you.

523
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:26,574
What's this?

524
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:29,694
The water realm.

525
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,214
I've never thought of seeing it again

526
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,174
in my life.

527
00:34:36,214 --> 00:34:37,054
This...

528
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,775
How did it emerge from the air?

529
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,015
When a foreign spiritual power

530
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,694
penetrates merfolk's scales,

531
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:45,534
a transient illusion will manifest,

532
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:47,094
namely, the Mirage Spell.

533
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,415
Inside it,

534
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:52,975
one can feel the water flowing.

535
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,015
But it's a hallucination,

536
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,614
so they won't drown.

537
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:06,054
This is amazing.

538
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:29,654
Is this your first time

539
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:30,734
seeing the Mirage Spell?

540
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:31,734
Certainly.

541
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:33,975
I don't allow anyone

542
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:34,895
to touch my scale.

543
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:36,694
Do you?

544
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:38,734
You don't believe it?

545
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:41,975
The Water Thrust is a weapon

546
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:43,495
that comes along when merfolks are born.

547
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,614
It only comes to being

548
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,815
as the Mirage Spell

549
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:47,295
first manifests.

550
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:49,174
And this Water Thrust

551
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:51,455
is created by you.

552
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:53,975
If that's the case,

553
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,335
this thrust is now yours.

554
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:59,295
Also, I hope I'm the first one

555
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,214
and the last

556
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:02,134
to see your Mirage Spell.

557
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:22,455
Princess.

558
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:25,935
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:27,975
Yao Yi.

560
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,694
I have no clue

561
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:34,415
why I can't refuse Princess.

562
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,415
I don't want to disappoint her.

563
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:48,975
Thank you, Yuan.

564
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:51,094
I wanted to solve your trouble,

565
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:52,094
but it ended up

566
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:53,614
that you comforted me again.

567
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:56,015
I did feel calm

568
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,174
and have a peaceful mind

569
00:37:58,415 --> 00:37:59,295
in the water.

570
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:00,455
And I came around

571
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:01,694
to something that annoys me.

572
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:03,495
Human feelings

573
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:05,015
are like the flow of water.

574
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:07,134
They can't be forcibly controlled.

575
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:08,534
They should go the way

576
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:09,734
based on their will.

577
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,495
And that's freedom.

578
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,654
Feelings are like the flow of water.

579
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:16,815
So, I must follow

580
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:17,734
my inner voice.

581
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,495
I'll express my gratitude to the Priest.

582
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,895
Regardless of what upsetting words

583
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:23,015
he has said to me,

584
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,815
he saved my life

585
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,335
this time.

586
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,895
Although I'm reluctant

587
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,375
to return to Jiuyi Mountain,

588
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:32,734
I still have to do

589
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,094
what must be done.

590
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,415
He saved you? Are you all right?

591
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:37,614
I didn't know the selection

592
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,815
could be so dangerous.

593
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:40,935
No, it's nothing.

594
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:41,694
Yuan.

595
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:43,654
The danger is over.

596
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:45,815
I'm now going back to the mountain.

597
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:46,574
You should

598
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:47,975
take care of yourself too.

599
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,895
After I offer my gratitude to him,

600
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:51,015
I'll come back.

601
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:53,775
Princess...

602
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:04,295
That cursed lady

603
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,295
is staying for lessons?

604
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:07,174
I shouldn't have

605
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:08,174
let her off.

606
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:09,174
Because of me,

607
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,214
she even teamed up with Qing Gang.

608
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,254
Otherwise, she wouldn't have

609
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:13,375
arrived at the peak

610
00:39:13,614 --> 00:39:14,654
after you took her
out of the Power of Chaos.

611
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,415
I bitterly regretted it now.

612
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:19,415
I'm so regretful

613
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,694
that I have more wrinkles now.

614
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:27,455
If you were to die

615
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:28,895
in the hand of that girl,

616
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,614
I wouldn't have anyone

617
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,254
to display my dashing looks to.

618
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:34,455
Forget it.

619
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,495
I won't bother

620
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:38,734
to smooth the wrinkles out.

621
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:40,335
In about a month,

622
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:41,694
she'll leave.

623
00:39:42,654 --> 00:39:44,015
But the High Priest said

624
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:45,614
she'd be your first disciple.

625
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:46,975
Because

626
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,174
he's dubious about

627
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,295
why I saved her

628
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:50,855
and said that purposely before me.

629
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:52,614
And hence, I agreed.

630
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:53,775
And you saw that,

631
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,614
he went back on his word immediately.

632
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,975
What if

633
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,015
such miraculous things happen

634
00:39:59,214 --> 00:39:59,815
that Zhu Yan

635
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:01,134
becomes your first disciple?

636
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:02,254
I must say,

637
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,335
I think you treated her

638
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:06,054
slightly differently...

639
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:07,094
Concerning her aptitude,

640
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:07,895
she's far from

641
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:09,214
being my first disciple.

642
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:11,214
Indeed.

643
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:14,895
Crimson Clan is in the back of beyond.

644
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:16,775
Even though the Crimson King

645
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,534
hired mages with a handsome reward,

646
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:20,015
they wouldn't stay long either.

647
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:20,935
The most they do

648
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:22,295
is to briefly teach her

649
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:24,054
a few moves.

650
00:40:25,534 --> 00:40:27,895
Her strength may be decent
in the Western Huang.

651
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:29,214
But compared

652
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,375
to the other Six Clans of Kongsang,

653
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,654
she's barely

654
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,254
an amateur.

655
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:37,134
Yes.

656
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,694
Me? An amateur?

657
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,534
How dare they demean me!

658
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:49,015
Forget it.

659
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:50,375
I only came here

660
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:51,534
to speak my true mind.

661
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:52,975
It doesn't matter how you see me.

662
00:40:59,174 --> 00:40:59,895
Why are you here?

663
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,775
I came to ask

664
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:02,815
how did you

665
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:04,134
escape from the Power of Chaos.

666
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:07,415
I manage to get off the place

667
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,094
when you discerned my intention.

668
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:10,775
If I didn't realize

669
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,415
that you were saving me,

670
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:14,574
wouldn't you

671
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,415
lose your life there?

672
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:18,134
Do you really think

673
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:19,495
that I'd put my life

674
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:20,815
on the line

675
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:21,935
to save you?

676
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:24,335
Since I could enter the Power of Chaos,

677
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:25,455
needless to say,

678
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:27,174
I have a way to leave there unscathed.

679
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:28,415
I see.

680
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:30,574
Very good.

681
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:31,895
No matter

682
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:33,335
why you saved me,

683
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:35,174
it's true that you got me

684
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,174
out of the Power of Chaos.

685
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:37,694
I, Zhu Yan,

686
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:38,975
am a sensible person.

687
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:40,295
So, I came here

688
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,375
to express my gratitude.

689
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:44,855
Thank you.

690
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:47,654
Secondly, I came here

691
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,694
to bid farewell.

692
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:53,375
Jiuyi Mountain is a revered place to
acquire magical techniques in Kongsang.

693
00:41:53,654 --> 00:41:56,495
So, you must boast incredible skills.

694
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,815
Since you think

695
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,654
I'm not bright, and I'm reckless

696
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,015
and with limited knowledge,

697
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:04,174
I don't think

698
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,295
I should insist on staying
in Jiuyi Mountain.

699
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:06,734
The world is vast outside.

700
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,775
Though I'm less capable,

701
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,815
I'll surely find a mentor

702
00:42:11,054 --> 00:42:12,174
who approves of me

703
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:14,094
and teaches me advanced magic techniques.

704
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:24,618
(Zhu Yan, Jiuyi Mountain)

705
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,134
(The High Priest is still
suspicious of her,)

706
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,415
(if she leaves at this moment,)

707
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:29,694
(it might enhance his doubts.)

708
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:31,174
(She can't leave.)

709
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:33,855
As the ancient teaching
of Jiuyi Mountain says,

710
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:35,654
"Don't give up the pursuit of knowledge,

711
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:37,654
and disciples shouldn't leave
their master on their own accord."

712
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:39,935
If you're determined to leave,

713
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:41,335
you may leave one month later

714
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:43,574
after the lessons end.

715
00:42:44,335 --> 00:42:45,415
But you're not allowed to go now.

716
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,415
The enchantment will stop you

717
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:48,935
even if I don't,

718
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,214
let alone the High Priest.

719
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:53,855
"Don't give up the pursuit of knowledge,

720
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,614
and disciples shouldn't leave
their master on their own accord."

721
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:56,815
You said this is the rule.

722
00:42:56,935 --> 00:42:57,935
So, do the rules allow Lord Chong Ming

723
00:42:58,134 --> 00:42:59,855
to intervene in the selection?

724
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:00,734
You...

725
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:04,935
Well.

726
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:06,415
That's my own behavior.

727
00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:07,534
He isn't related to this.

728
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:08,694
Besides,

729
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:10,054
he has already punished me for that.

730
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,174
Well. But he did say

731
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:15,174
that he wasn't allowed

732
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:16,455
to meet people

733
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:17,614
when he was the immortal official

734
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:19,495
in the Emperor Valley.

735
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:21,855
But he met with me again.

736
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:24,335
And that tells me

737
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:25,415
the rules

738
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:27,214
aren't rigid.

739
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:28,975
That's different.

740
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:30,254
You swore

741
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:30,975
that you wouldn't tell anyone

742
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:32,495
that you met him before.

743
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:33,415
I, Zhu Yan,

744
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,975
am a person of my word.

745
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:36,295
I will make good

746
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:38,054
on my promise.

747
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:39,254
It would be great.

748
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:41,214
But you

749
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:43,614
reneged on the promise

750
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,694
by taking me as your first disciple

751
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:47,734
because of the High Priest.

752
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,054
I, Zhu Yan,

753
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,254
am not someone

754
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:54,214
you can summon

755
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,295
however you want.

756
00:43:57,614 --> 00:43:58,335
