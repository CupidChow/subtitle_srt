00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:58,898
I'll drink

20
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,939
one last sip!

21
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,858
I must defeat Bai Xuelu!

22
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,658
I will defeat Bai Xuelu

23
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,779
and stay here.

24
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:24,578
You actually
wanted to be my first disciple

25
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,378
even when you're dreaming?

26
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,219
Why am I all tied-up?

27
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:16,939
Cultivating Hall?

28
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,899
(Last night,)

29
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,619
(I was going to kiss Master indirectly.)

30
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:22,739
(After that, I was hugging him.)

31
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,459
(He became the white beast again.)

32
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:25,658
(Oh no.)

33
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,779
(What happened last night?)

34
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:37,779
Master White.

35
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,779
Just drink up, Master White.

36
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,939
This is called indirect kissing.

37
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:45,858
Stop.

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,378
Oh no.

39
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:56,418
This is so embarrassing.

40
00:03:58,179 --> 00:03:59,499
He's not going to silence me, is he?

41
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,538
No, I have to escape.

42
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:17,818
This is great.

43
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,619
Priest.

44
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,059
Where are you going?

45
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:41,659
I...

46
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,299
First, I skipped

47
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:45,979
the exam yesterday.

48
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,499
Second, I ignored the lesson.

49
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:49,299
Third, I hurt my classmate.

50
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,018
Fourth, I indulged myself in alcohol.

51
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,698
Fifth, I disrespected my master.

52
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,099
I'm a heinous sinner.

53
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,778
You can punish me however you want.

54
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,099
Just don't chase me off the mountain.

55
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,258
Of course, I will punish you.

56
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,338
Didn't you say you wanted to become

57
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,258
my first disciple last night?

58
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,138
Not at all!

59
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:11,659
I said something wrong
after I got drunk.

60
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,299
I didn't know my own place.

61
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,939
I still have a long way to go.

62
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:20,179
I want you to look into my eyes.

63
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,739
Don't think of anything else.

64
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,859
Just listen to your heart

65
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:24,979
and tell me.

66
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,578
Do you wish to be my first disciple?

67
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:34,698
I

68
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:37,458
do.

69
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:39,258
Very good.

70
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:40,979
Since you're sincere,

71
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:42,338
let us give this a try.

72
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:44,499
Priest,

73
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:45,659
are you encouraging me

74
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:47,059
to be your disciple?

75
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,059
I'm not encouraging you.

76
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,539
I'm giving you a reminder.

77
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:52,099
The skill difference between

78
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,419
you and Bai Xuelu is too far apart.

79
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:54,619
If you truly wish to catch up

80
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,059
to her from the back,

81
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,578
you will face unimaginable difficulties.

82
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,578
And, I won't be lenient toward you.

83
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,299
I will only keep a closer eye on you

84
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,018
and keep testing you.

85
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:07,859
Can you endure that?

86
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,059
I'm willing to give it a try.

87
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,338
All right. It depends on
your performance now.

88
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:19,979
Thank you, Priest.

89
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:48,419
Thank you, Priest.

90
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:53,698
After all I've done to prevent it,

91
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,059
I still saw the scene

92
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,619
that I didn't want to see.

93
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,659
You actually let her
spend the night in the hall

94
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,578
and encouraged her
to be your first disciple?

95
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,258
Right now, I have four
first disciple candidates.

96
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,138
Qing Gang has a mission to accomplish.

97
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,979
Bai Xueying doesn't want to study.

98
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,939
The only ones who truly wish to study

99
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:14,179
are Zhu Yan and Bai Xuelu.

100
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:15,979
And Bai Xuelu

101
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,739
is the candidate chosen by High Priest.

102
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,018
Taking her as my disciple
is just the first step

103
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:20,619
of High Priest's plan.

104
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:21,939
He's treading carefully

105
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:23,499
and wants Bai Xuelu

106
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:24,939
to be my first disciple

107
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,698
so that he can force me

108
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,099
to return to Jialan one day.

109
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:29,979
I see.

110
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,739
So, you have no choice,

111
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,458
and you don't want to
be manipulated by High Priest.

112
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,619
That's why you can only
put your hopes on Zhu Yan

113
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:37,578
and hope that she becomes
your first disciple.

114
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:38,939
The most important attribute

115
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,179
I see before I take them in as
my first disciple is their heart.

116
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:42,979
Most people

117
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,619
use magic techniques

118
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,218
to get their ways.

119
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,499
For example, Bai Xuelu.

120
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,859
She only wants power.

121
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:51,659
Only Zhu Yan

122
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,338
is sincere in learning.

123
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,619
I still think that it's inappropriate.

124
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,698
For you and her.

125
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:01,619
I've thought about it.

126
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,018
If the situation I'm worried about

127
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,818
does happen in the future,

128
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:07,499
I shall face them together with her.

129
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:09,659
If that's the case,

130
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:11,619
it's almost impossible for Zhu Yan

131
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:12,698
to be your first disciple.

132
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,299
Although she doesn't have
a solid foundation,

133
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,499
she's not afraid of setbacks,

134
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,258
and she can think on her feet

135
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:18,378
and overcome ordeals.

136
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:20,698
I thought to myself

137
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,578
that a miracle might happen.

138
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,739
If so, I shall look forward to it.

139
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:52,978
God of Dragon.

140
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,978
Yuan, if one day,

141
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,419
the God of Dragon loses its control

142
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,179
while waking up

143
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,338
from its slumber,

144
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,379
you must stay away from it.

145
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,139
(Father of Merfolk Zhi Yuan)
Because us from the side branch

146
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,098
with the dragon lineage

147
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:11,659
will be summoned by
the true dragon lineage.

148
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:12,858
However,

149
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,498
we will be suppressed by it.

150
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:18,139
It will endanger our lives.

151
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,432
(Huangquan Waterfall, Jiuyi Mountain)

152
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,818
(God of Dragon,)

153
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,379
(I, Zhi Yuan, the merfolk,)

154
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,179
(have answered your call.)

155
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:21,738
Darned Xingzun

156
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,779
and Kongsang people.

157
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,458
God of Dragon,

158
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,738
what can I do for you?

159
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,259
I'm going to head out there

160
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,379
and kill all Kongsang people,

161
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,259
especially the Six Clas

162
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,139
that followed Xingzun to trap me here.

163
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,019
None of them will escape!

164
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,019
God of Dragon!

165
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,139
God of Dragon!

166
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,098
God of Dragon!

167
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:23,659
God of Dragon

168
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:24,818
harbors deep hatred
for Kongsang people,

169
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:26,539
the world will change

170
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,578
when he wakes up from his slumber.

171
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,779
I'm afraid it would only take a moment
for it to happen.

172
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:31,659
And, the Six Clans
have to face his wrath.

173
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:33,978
If that happens,

174
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,978
I'm afraid only the Dragon Blood Jade

175
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,139
can save Princess Zhu Yan.

176
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,618
How could I think of it that way?

177
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:51,218
Princess,

178
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,738
I hope you will learn something

179
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:56,498
in Jiuyi Mountain

180
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,098
so that you could protect yourself
in the future.

181
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,779
Priest is going to teach us
Wind-manipulating Spell

182
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,419
at the Star Gazing Plaza.

183
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,659
Before this, it was only theory.

184
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,779
This time, it's a battle practice.

185
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:16,939
What a shame.

186
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,498
Those who had committed mistakes

187
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:19,858
can only withstand
their punishments here.

188
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,939
Stop right there!

189
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:30,458
Yan!

190
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:31,539
Yan.

191
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,498
I'll stay here and help you out.

192
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:34,218
Me too.

193
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,259
No need for that.
You guys can head to class.

194
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,259
I'll help you out after class then.

195
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,818
Go now. Don't be late.

196
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,578
Although I miss the chance

197
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:57,299
to listen to Priest's teaching,

198
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,379
I can practice the chant

199
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,858
for a hundred times.

200
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,019
Wind, obey my will!

201
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,899
Wind, obey my will!

202
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:19,139
(Why don't I)

203
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,578
(use the chant of
Wind-manipulating Spell)

204
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:21,498
(and give it a try?)

205
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,299
Wind, obey my will!

206
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,659
Wind, obey my will!

207
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,019
Halt!

208
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:57,379
Halt!

209
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:12,659
Halt!

210
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,179
Princess Zhu Yan, you do
live up to your name

211
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:23,259
as the lousiest student indeed.

212
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:24,498
You can't even

213
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,578
control a mere leaf.

214
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,419
That's all for today.

215
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,978
Please practice

216
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,179
after heading back.

217
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,379
Priest, thank you for your teaching.

218
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:41,738
We shall take our leaves.

219
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,419
Priest,

220
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,939
I followed the book's instruction

221
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:53,458
and recited the chant perfectly.

222
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,659
But why can't I do it?

223
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:56,779
What is that the case?

224
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:59,179
You've already learned its theory.

225
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,379
Next,

226
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,698
it depends on your enlightenment.

227
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,698
I will demonstrate it

228
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,338
to you once.

229
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:07,179
Observe closely.

230
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:08,698
Okay.

231
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,779
I created Wind-manipulating Spell

232
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,059
after sweeping the bottom

233
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,698
of the Emperor Valley daily.

234
00:15:58,578 --> 00:15:59,098
Actually,

235
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:01,218
I cannot control the leaves
by themselves.

236
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,419
I control it through observing
the wind's direction

237
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:04,738
and borrowing its strength.

238
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:06,818
Try to imitate what I've done

239
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,139
and observe closely.

240
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,978
Your shoulders mustn't be too tense.

241
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:58,978
If you're not relaxed,

242
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,419
you won't feel the wind.

243
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:02,259
Again.

244
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:12,179
Stop.

245
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:14,939
Raise your hand.

246
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:16,579
This side too.

247
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:19,018
Relax your shoulders.

248
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:21,859
Again.

249
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:35,939
Zhu Yan,

250
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,498
what were you thinking?

251
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:41,778
I...

252
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,258
When you feel,

253
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,099
you need to use
the five aggregates and six senses

254
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,258
to feel.

255
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,698
Why didn't you observe the wind?

256
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,899
Observe the wind?
Can wind even be seen?

257
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:55,538
Remember this.

258
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:57,698
Wind has life too.

259
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:59,458
It's ever-changing,

260
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,939
yet predictable.

261
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:02,538
When you reach a certain level,

262
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,179
you'll be able to see it.

263
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,218
I feel like I understood something,

264
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:14,778
yet I don't.

265
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,058
All right, time's up.

266
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:20,458
I've used

267
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:21,619
the same amount of time

268
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,099
to teach you and the others.

269
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,738
As for the rest, you can
figure them out yourself.

270
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:37,659
You're leaving already?

271
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:40,819
Priest, I haven't mastered it yet!

272
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,899
How do I observe the wind?

273
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:11,458
You did it!

274
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,498
Yan, you're amazing.

275
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,379
One month is up.

276
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:29,339
Today,

277
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,538
we shall choose
the first disciple for Priest.

278
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,139
This disciple
shall be the 287th first disciple

279
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,579
of Jiuyi Mountain.

280
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,218
Aye.

281
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,218
After one month of training,

282
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:44,379
there are four candidates
who have the right

283
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:45,738
to contest for the position.

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,978
(Bai Xuelu)

285
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,978
Bai Xuelu, 15 points.

286
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,819
Qing Gang, 12 points.

287
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,379
Zhu Yan, eight points.

288
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,939
And Bai Xueying, five points.

289
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,419
Those whose names are called
shall duel each other.

290
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:00,339
Qing Gang.

291
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,018
I've already received a military order.

292
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:06,339
I have to leave the mountain today.

293
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,258
I, Qing Gang, forfeit.

294
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:11,619
Permission granted.

295
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:15,778
Bai Xuelu.

296
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,139
Bai Xueying.

297
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:25,899
I'm unskilled.

298
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,698
I'm afraid I cannot
bear the responsibility.

299
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,778
Please pardon me for forfeiting.

300
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,139
Permission granted.

301
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:32,179
Zhu Yan.

302
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:37,778
Priest.

303
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,339
Princess Zhu Yan,

304
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,819
do you have anything to say?

305
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:42,419
No.

306
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:45,819
I'm willing to duel Princess Xuelu.

307
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,339
She doesn't know her own place at all.

308
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,258
How dare she...

309
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:51,379
Sister,

310
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:52,419
didn't Father tell us

311
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,018
to leave the mountain in advance
and avoid dueling each other?

312
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:55,738
But now, the situation
isn't under my control.

313
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:56,939
If I forfeit now,

314
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,619
Zhu Yan will win without contesting.

315
00:21:58,939 --> 00:21:59,339
But...

316
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:00,538
If the first disciple was chosen

317
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:03,218
because everyone else has forfeited,

318
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,859
I'm afraid

319
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,099
Jiuyi Mountain and Priest

320
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,018
would be disgraced

321
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:07,579
when people hear about this.

322
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,058
Yan is no match for you.

323
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,379
You must go easy on her.

324
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,258
Do not hurt her.

325
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:12,498
Don't worry.

326
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,579
I know my limits.

327
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:16,978
I won't harm your bestie,

328
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,179
Princess Zhu Yan.

329
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,579
These are the rules.

330
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,939
The person

331
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,179
who can push the other off the stage

332
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,978
or render her unable to fight
before the alarm rings

333
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:28,258
will be the victor.

334
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,099
If no one is victorious
when the alarm rings,

335
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,419
the person with the higher points wins.

336
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:35,619
The match begins now.

337
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,258
(She actually improved this much?)

338
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:40,819
(No, I need to win.)

339
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:01,379
Why can't Yan move her hands?

340
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:02,538
This artifact

341
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,298
contains the power of frost.

342
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:06,339
It counters the Crimson Clan.

343
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,298
Why would she have that?

344
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:13,738
Sister!

345
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,619
You promised me
you won't go too harsh on her!

346
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,179
Yan, you should admit defeat!

347
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:32,738
(Remember,)

348
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:34,339
(wind has life too.)

349
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:35,738
(It's ever-changing,)

350
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,339
(yet predictable.)

351
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:40,379
(When you reach a certain level,
you'll be able to see it.)

352
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:21,978
A desperate struggle.

353
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:23,899
What a joke.

354
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:29,018
Ride the cloud

355
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,939
and soar through the sky!

356
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,819
Princess Zhu Yan actually mastered
the Cloud Ascension Spell?

357
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,179
That's the best wind magic techniques

358
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,139
one could learn.

359
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:46,298
Your Supreme Majesty,

360
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:47,978
please allow this competition

361
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:48,899
to be held fairly.

362
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,379
The match is over.

363
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:20,738
From today onward,

364
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,099
Priest will take Zhu Yan

365
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,939
as his first disciple.

366
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,218
As for the other students,

367
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:27,859
the semester has ended.

368
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,498
Please pack your belongings
and prepare to leave the mountain.

369
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:33,139
I shall obey.

370
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,058
Bai Xuelu.

371
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:06,899
I don't need your pity.

372
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,560
(Zuowang Palace)

373
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,498
High Priest, please

374
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:26,139
give me one more chance.

375
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,419
Before this, you said confidently

376
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:34,179
that Zhu Yan

377
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:35,619
was no match for you.

378
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:39,458
Since you couldn't keep your promise,

379
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:40,619
you should return

380
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,458
and hone your temper.

381
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,218
Your Supreme Majesty,

382
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:45,698
I've let you down.

383
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,458
I'll definitely reflect upon my actions
when I head back.

384
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,778
I shall obey High Priest's commands.

385
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,619
However, Zhu Yan once forfeited

386
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,379
the exam in the Star Gazing Plaza.

387
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,659
A person like her

388
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:00,619
has become the first disciple
of Jiuyi Mountain.

389
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,339
I'm afraid

390
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:03,659
the public might not be convinced.

391
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:04,698
You don't need

392
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,458
to worry about that.

393
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:08,819
Leave now.

394
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:14,819
High Priest.

395
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,258
You once said you didn't want

396
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:34,058
to call him your master
in the Star Gazing Plaza, right?

397
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:36,419
High Priest, please pardon me.

398
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,018
I said that brazenly

399
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:41,738
as I didn't know about
the height of the mountain.

400
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:44,498
Now, I know how tall it is.

401
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,298
Its peak is unattainable,

402
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,099
just like the path to mastering
magic techniques.

403
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,939
I've decided to train here.

404
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,018
Please let that be
water under the bridge.

405
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,538
You don't need to be so fearful.

406
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:59,258
Since you've defeated
all your opponents,

407
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,538
you've earned the right

408
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,018
to become the Priest's first disciple.

409
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,579
I just want

410
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,619
to give you a reminder.

411
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,258
From now on, you must
practice caution with your words.

412
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:09,179
Yes, High Priest.

413
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:13,339
However, you need

414
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:15,218
to memorize the Disciple Commandments

415
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,619
written by the first High Priest

416
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,058
of Jiuyi Mountain.

417
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,939
Yes, High Priest.

418
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,619
However, I don't know

419
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,339
where to find it.

420
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,258
It's right here.

421
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,899
You need to find it yourself.

422
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,339
Of course,

423
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,619
in order to show your sincerity,

424
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,058
you cannot use any magic techniques.

425
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,058
But the Hall of Books

426
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:52,139
will be closed for maintenance
in three hours.

427
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,579
More importantly,

428
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,939
the scrolls in Jiuyi

429
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:57,698
are just like the mirror.

430
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,978
They're easily covered with dust.

431
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:03,058
You need to wipe the dust off

432
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,258
after you read them.

433
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,058
And you need to change the water

434
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:07,939
whenever you clean one scroll.

435
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:11,698
Only then, it can show
the sacredness of the hall.

436
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:14,379
You shall do so until
you find the commandments.

437
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:16,939
(I'm new to magic techniques.)

438
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,458
(And I don't have a solid foundation.)

439
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:19,978
(I'm afraid it might be
extremely difficult)

440
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,538
(for me to locate a scroll.)

441
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:24,579
(And, I need to wipe
the dust off the scrolls)

442
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:25,819
(and change the bucket of water
every so often.)

443
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,058
(This is literally impossible.)

444
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,258
I will not force you

445
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,339
to find it.

446
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,139
Since you're not sincere
and you do not have courage,

447
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:36,698
even if you are

448
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,498
the Priest's first disciple,

449
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:40,538
you won't achieve anything great
in the future.

450
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,899
If so, I can only find another candidate

451
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,179
for the Priest.

452
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:47,218
Make up your mind.

453
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:50,218
I'm willing to give it a try.

454
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:08,778
Your Supreme Majesty,

455
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:10,778
according to the rules
of Jiuyi Mountain,

456
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:12,579
since ancient times,

457
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:13,939
the Four Grand Marshals

458
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,298
will hand the commandments
to the new disciples.

459
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:17,498
No one has ever let the new disciples

460
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:19,139
search for the commandments themselves.

461
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:21,258
No one dares to insult

462
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,298
or be disrespectful to the sect

463
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:26,859
for the past thousands of years.

464
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,698
Since she does things unorthodoxly,

465
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,379
you cannot blame me

466
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,099
for teaching her a lesson
on your behalf.

467
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:35,419
Your Supreme Majesty,

468
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:37,179
why are you punishing Zhu Yan

469
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:38,379
for Bai Xuelu's incompetency?

470
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:42,659
I don't know what you're talking about.

471
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:45,778
I know you've chosen Bai Xuelu
as your candidate.

472
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:48,179
But Zhu Yan

473
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:49,619
appeared out of nowhere.

474
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:51,379
That's why you've decided

475
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:52,698
to take Zhu Yan as your disciple

476
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,379
in order to go against Bai Xuelu,

477
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,099
whom I preferred.

478
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,258
Even if Zhu Yan couldn't find

479
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:58,538
the Disciple Commandments,

480
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:00,298
I'll only announce to the public

481
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,179
that I'm removing her from her position
as the first disciple.

482
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:03,419
I will never take

483
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,298
Bai Xuelu as my first disciple.

484
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:08,339
Very good.

485
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:09,939
You've grown up, huh?

486
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:13,458
You dare to talk back to me now.

487
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:16,658
I dare not do so, Your Supreme Majesty.

488
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,498
I just hope that you won't

489
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:19,779
interfere with the decisions I make.

490
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:25,939
Your Supreme Majesty, Priest.

491
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,419
I shall take my leave.

492
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,458
Master.

493
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,819
(I've been searching for written books.)

494
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,339
(But I've forgotten that
the first High Priest)

495
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:05,978
(was an avid painter.)

496
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,339
(Therefore, the Disciple Commandments)

497
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:09,819
(shouldn't be recorded in words.)

498
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,859
(It should be a painting instead.)

499
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,960
(Disciple Commandments of Jiuyi Mountain)

500
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:53,339
I'm not

501
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:54,538
an understanding master.

502
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:58,299
It'll be tough if you train under me.

503
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,178
I'm not afraid of hardships.

504
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:01,779
It'll be lonely.

505
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:03,178
It won't.

506
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,379
In the past, there were only dead bodies
in the valley.

507
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:07,939
That's why you were alone.

508
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:09,178
But from now on,

509
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,098
I'll be keeping you company, Master.

510
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,058
Since you're my first disciple,

511
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:16,098
I will expect you to obey

512
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:16,978
my strict rules.

513
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,219
If you don't do a good job,

514
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,419
you might be punished.

515
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,419
Don't cry by then.

516
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:25,458
Okay.

517
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:39,899
From today onward,

518
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,779
you'll be my master.

519
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,178
Master.

520
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:44,739
Master.

521
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:07,458
I thought you were angry at me.

522
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:08,658
What are you doing here?

523
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:17,498
Your Supreme Majesty, I know you did it

524
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,379
for my sake.

525
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:21,899
I dare not be angry at you.

526
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,379
But now,

527
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,178
my mother has passed away.

528
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:27,859
I don't wish to return to Jialan.

529
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:30,859
Your Supreme Majesty,

530
00:37:31,138 --> 00:37:31,978
please allow me to serve the gods.

531
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:48,259
Back then,

532
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:51,618
you were just the Crown Prince.

533
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:55,219
Although you were talented and
mighty at both the pen and the sword,

534
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,259
you were still a child.

535
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:58,419
Now,

536
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,259
you've already become the top practitioner

537
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,779
of the magic arts of Yunhuang.

538
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:05,259
If only your mother

539
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,978
could look at you now.

540
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,178
I believe

541
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,498
that she'll be proud of you.

542
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:16,739
I can even imagine

543
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,739
the way she smiles
when she looks at you.

544
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,018
You're her only offspring.

545
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:25,419
She didn't fight for power

546
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,899
because she was a kind person.

547
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:30,978
But if you and I

548
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,098
don't fight for it now,

549
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,458
who else will remember

550
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:34,259
the grievances

551
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,498
she suffered back then?

552
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:37,739
Who else will help you and your mother

553
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,739
to take back

554
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,299
what was stolen from you two?

555
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:43,259
But back then,

556
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,699
I rushed back to Jialan

557
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,658
because of my selfish desire.

558
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,978
I even sent a letter to her
who was still in the palace.

559
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:51,578
That's how my mother was...

560
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:55,339
My mother

561
00:38:56,498 --> 00:38:57,419
is gone now.

562
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,739
It's pointless

563
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:00,779
no matter what I do now.

564
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,498
And, I don't have a reason

565
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:06,138
to Jialan now.

566
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:28,899
Your Supreme Majesty,

567
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:31,739
today is your birthday.

568
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,498
Let me offer you a cup of tea.

569
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,379
Snow cake.

570
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,339
This was your mother's favorite snack

571
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,819
before she passed away.

572
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:22,098
Today

573
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,498
is my birthday.

574
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:28,178
Ever since my mother entrusted me to you,

575
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:32,339
you had put all your attention on me.

576
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:34,458
You helped me to improve

577
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,098
and planned my life for me.

578
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,899
You have already
forgotten about yourself.

579
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:40,458
However...

580
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:42,618
However, Your Supreme Majesty,

581
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:43,658
you should have your own life too.

582
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,018
You should have your own joy

583
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:46,458
and interests in life.

584
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,498
I don't want you

585
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,098
to forget about the person named Shi...

586
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,779
the person named Shi Yu because of me.

587
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:59,138
I will forever

588
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:00,658
be grateful to you.

589
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,578
Not only are you my uncle

590
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:04,939
and my master,

591
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:06,739
but you should also

592
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,018
be yourself.

593
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,939
Now, you cannot understand
how it feels like

594
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,419
to be an elder.

595
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:18,859
If there's no longer anyone
you care for

596
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,699
in the world,

597
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:22,458
it's pointless

598
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,299
to live.

599
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:27,618
Let me

600
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:29,739
be alone for now.

601
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:36,178
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty.
