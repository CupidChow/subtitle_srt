19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,200
Princess,

20
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,681
look at the thing
you've been longing for.

21
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,401
This is known as Mingyue Silk,

22
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,761
the greatest treasure
of the Merfolk Clan.

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,401
It's gorgeous.

24
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,760
I can use this

25
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,040
to bid farewell to old friends.

26
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,641
Though there's no

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,121
Primordial Spirit-Gathering Spell
in the world.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,641
I'll still continue
to practise magic spell.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,361
To travel around the world

30
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,361
and protect the important person

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
like Yuan.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,121
Thank you, Princess.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,961
What about me, Princess?

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,681
You certainly are

35
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,961
an important person to me.

36
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,521
Just that I'll need you to send

37
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,000
this thing to Jiuyi Mountain now.

38
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,440
Yes.

39
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:54,760
I'll excuse myself.

40
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,760
Get some rest, Princess.

41
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:57,880
Okay.

42
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,320
(Qingyun Palace, Jialan Imperial City)

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,840
(Qingyun Palace, Jialan Imperial City)
I've found something strange in Jiuyi Mountain

44
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:21,641
for the past few days.

45
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,241
That day when I had just reached
the mountain,

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,760
I found an immortal official

47
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,000
that I've never met before.

48
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,401
It's odd.

49
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,641
Why would the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor

50
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,040
make you embarrassed

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,961
in front of the kings

52
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,320
because of a mere immortal official?

53
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,401
There must be something fishy.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,760
Rumor has it, when the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor was young,

55
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:55,681
he was madly in love with Bai Yan.

56
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,720
If it wasn't because Bai Yan insisted

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,081
on marrying Emperor Beimian,

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,921
the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
wouldn't have

59
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,401
hidden in Jiuyi Mountain.

60
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,921
Let's say the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor insisted

61
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,121
on helping them in secret.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,720
He faked Shi Ying's death
and took him away.

63
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,481
I think it's completely possible.

64
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,121
But if Shi Ying is still alive,

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
doesn't it mean he and the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,801
have committed the crime
of defrauding the Emperor?

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,241
The Emperor is inscrutable
and it's been a long time.

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
Who knows Emperor Beimian's stance

69
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,640
on the incident.

70
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,721
We won't know
if he has gotten suspicious.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,801
Brother.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,681
This is the reason why

73
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,801
I would collude with Ice Clan.

74
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:40,601
You and I got to have
something up our sleeves.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,200
So,

76
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,440
we must not let the Emperor know

77
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:45,841
that the person is still alive.

78
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,640
And we have to eradicate

79
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,681
the loose ends for Yu
as soon as possible.

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
But,

81
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,241
isn't that person very skillful?

82
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,000
If the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
joins hands with him,

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,841
I'm afraid we won't be able

84
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,281
to succeed easily.

85
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,041
It looks like

86
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,161
we still need to wait.

87
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,801
Now, we have to win over the Six Clans.

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,921
Just that the Crimson King is too unctuous.

89
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,161
Even now,

90
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,241
he still wants to keep himself out
of the disputes.

91
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,281
I've got to make him suffer a bit.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,921
(Since His Highness Shi Yu is
in love with Xueying,)

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,200
you and I should
make a plan for Xueying.

94
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,721
This is for the overall interests
of White Clan.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,400
If you make trouble again,

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,921
you'll end up like your mother.

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,281
Princess.

98
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,640
Consort Qing is actually looking for you.

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,440
Consort Qing.

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,520
(I'll wait for you with tea
in Qingyun Palace)

101
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,320
Princess Xuelu is here.

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,121
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

103
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,200
Please take a seat.

104
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,000
I dare not sit with you, Your Highness.

105
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,921
You don't have to be so polite.

106
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,721
You're a clever girl.

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,281
I'm a direct person.

108
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,601
So I won't beat around the bush.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me ask you something.

110
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,281
Do you want to marry Yu?

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
You have a discerning eye.

112
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,921
My feelings for him are obvious.

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,121
So I dare not hide it.

114
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:44,400
Indeed.

115
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,000
I like you more than your younger sister.

116
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,320
Whether your relationship with Yu

117
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,520
will be further developed,

118
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,760
it's all up to me.

119
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,320
However,

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
it depends on your performance.

121
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,361
I'll be at your disposal.

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
I wonder if there's any interesting news

123
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,041
on your trip to Jiuyi Mountain

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,601
that you want to tell me.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,681
The Star-gazing Ceremony was held
once in ten years.

126
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,640
It's gotten my mind blown

127
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,801
and broadened my horizon.

128
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,960
I wonder what you'd like to know.

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,440
Did you go to the Emperor Valley?

130
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,361
I've always admired Emperor Xingzun

131
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,960
so I was going to his tomb to worship him.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,560
Unexpectedly, I passed out

133
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,361
before I entered the valley.

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,640
Perhaps there was someone

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,681
in the Emperor Valley

136
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,640
who didn't want a mortal
like me to go near there.

137
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:57,481
From that day on,

138
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,121
Princess has been wearing
the earrings that Madam left.

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,481
This time, Consort Qing bestowed on you

140
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,241
the earrings which are made
with the finest Warm White Jade.

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,880
Your effort is indeed paid off.

142
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,481
Let me put them on for you.

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,200
It's not necessary.

144
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,960
Since Her Highness appreciates
your ability,

145
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
what are you going to do next?

146
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,481
Why don't you replace Xueying

147
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,880
at one sitting?

148
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,921
She doesn't appreciate me.

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,880
Obviously, she's trying to use me.

150
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,320
But,

151
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,520
I've confirmed a thing.

152
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,320
That the person in the Emperor Valley

153
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,841
is indeed the focus of all attention.

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,281
I passed out in the Emperor Valley
for no reason.

155
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,081
That day, the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor got cagey

156
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
when he talked about this person.

157
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,721
Even Consort Qing cares about it now.

158
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,481
I guess there's only one person

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
that can be so notable.

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,680
Just because I've got nobody.

161
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,721
So they don't have to pay the price

162
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
even when they offend me.

163
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,441
Anyone can use me and trample me.

164
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't care who this person is.

165
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:08,040
I'll risk everything to approach him.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,961
To get the leverage for myself
to enter the play.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,481
I won't let anyone trample me again.

168
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:18,160
Mother.

169
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,640
It hurts.

170
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:24,880
Be gentle.

171
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:27,841
- Don't move.
- Father.

172
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,920
It's only been several months
since you left home.

173
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:32,721
Why are you hurt so badly?

174
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,121
There's no war in Western Huang lately.

175
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,241
His Majesty commanded me

176
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,880
to lead the army and practise

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
with Qing Gang's Shadow Warrior.

178
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,481
Qing Gang is the best

179
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,481
among the young officials
of the Six Ministries.

180
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:47,640
Each of his Shadow Warriors

181
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
is good at individual combat.

182
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,160
I'm getting old.

183
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm no longer a match for him.

184
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
Azure King must've...

185
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:00,680
Azure King?

186
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,040
What's wrong with him?

187
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,561
It doesn't matter.

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
It's common to get some injury

189
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,481
at the parade ground.

190
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,160
Qing Gang didn't respect
the elder at all.

191
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Didn't he know how to show leniency?

192
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:13,920
It's not his fault.

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,441
We should do our best
on the battlefield.

194
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:19,561
It hurts.

195
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,241
Yan,

196
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,040
Ying has finally become 18 today.

197
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,841
We don't have to worry

198
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,081
about that cursed lady anymore.

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Soon, he'll be able
to take in disciples.

200
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:42,481
When his cultivation base reaches
the real state,

201
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,241
he'll be able to return to the world.

202
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,880
To seek justice for you.

203
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,280
Come in.

204
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,441
Your Supreme Majesty.

205
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,601
Ying,

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,640
today is your birthday.

207
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,601
And it's the day
when your curse is lifted.

208
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,640
I've prepared a gift

209
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,321
for your coming-of-age ceremony.

210
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,260
(Priest of Grand Preceptor,
Jiuyi Mountain)

211
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,241
I'll choose an auspicious day

212
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,680
to hold your coronation ceremony.

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
From now on, you are

214
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,961
the Priest of Jiuyi Mountain.

215
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,361
Thanks for your appreciation,
Your Supreme Majesty.

216
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,920
Just that I'm less experienced.

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
This is unconvincing.

218
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,280
The Four Grand Marshals have been
trained for years.

219
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,760
They're more eligible
to take the position.

220
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,121
You don't have to be too humble.

221
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,481
I know you've practised hard for years.

222
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:55,601
Your cultivation base has
surpassed the supreme state.

223
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,680
You're an adult now.

224
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,081
Just stop rejecting me.

225
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,201
I'll take the command.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,760
Ying,

227
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,361
you've lived in seclusion for six years.

228
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,721
I'm sure you'll surprise everyone.

229
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,400
I've sent the notice

230
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,361
of you enrolling new disciple

231
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,121
to the Imperial Residence
of the Six Ministries.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,961
The people from the Six Ministries,
regardless of gender,

233
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,920
they're all allowed to join
the recruitment test.

234
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,361
The people who pass the test

235
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,400
will be your nominated disciples.

236
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,721
They'll stay in the mountain

237
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,680
and practise with you for a month.

238
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,800
And the person
who scores the best result

239
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
will be your first disciple.

240
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,800
He or she can stay with you

241
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,680
on a long-term basis

242
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,680
and you'll personally teach him or her.

243
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,481
The gender doesn't matter?

244
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,721
Your Supreme Majesty,

245
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,481
I've never seen
an immortal official aggressively

246
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,601
taking in disciples before.

247
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,441
And no female disciple has

248
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,520
ever been accepted.

249
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,601
Rules are meant to be broken.

250
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,441
Of course we can change it.

251
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,640
I think instruction knows

252
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,880
no class distinction.

253
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,241
And you don't have to be wedded

254
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,561
to the distinction
between male and female.

255
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:05,121
This enrollment is your chance

256
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,601
to win over the clans.

257
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:07,841
By then,

258
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,040
the people from the Six Ministries
who pass the test

259
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,000
will be your disciples.

260
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,680
If you want to achieve great things

261
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,201
in the world,

262
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,081
they'll facilitate your power.

263
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,361
I just want to be in retreat

264
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,481
and serve the divine spirits.

265
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,361
I'm not intended to join
the fight in the world.

266
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:33,280
The people of Kongsang
are living peacefully now.

267
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,241
The disciples
of the Six Ministries are profligate

268
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:38,160
and weak.

269
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,841
If you can make a talent out of them,

270
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,040
this will benefit the country as well.

271
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,441
Go on.

272
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,121
I'll provide you

273
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:49,400
with a new shelter on the mountain.

274
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,361
From now on, you'll practise in the Cultivating Hall.

275
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,201
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

276
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,561
When Ying returns to Jialan
as the Emperor,

277
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,040
according to the rules, he'll need

278
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,880
to marry the daughter of White Clan.

279
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,961
This time,

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
I'll make the daughter of Bai Family

281
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,601
become his first disciple.

282
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,080
(Cultivating Hall, Jiuyi Mountain)

283
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,640
For the past tens of thousands of years,

284
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,201
I've never seen someone celebrating
their birthday like this.

285
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,400
You were well in the valley.

286
00:14:58,561 --> 00:14:59,721
Why must you move out of there?

287
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,601
I'm exhausted
that I can't feel my waist.

288
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm so thirsty.

289
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,640
His Supreme Majesty has his own reason.

290
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
What is the High Priest
of Grand Preceptor up to?

291
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,040
Why does he want you
to take in disciples?

292
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:17,680
Maybe that haunting Zhu Yan

293
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,441
will come back again.

294
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,520
She's so annoying.

295
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,361
Chong Ming,

296
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,800
didn't you say

297
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
you've prepared a birthday gift for me?

298
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,160
Yes, I've prepared

299
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,520
a ten-thousand-year
ancient divine artifact

300
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,481
to celebrate your birthday.

301
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:31,760
Come with me.

302
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,481
This is the burnt ancient divine wood

303
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
that was struck by lightning

304
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,121
at the top of Splendor Hill
ten thousands years ago.

305
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
If you bring it along,

306
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,000
it can ward off evil spirits.
How is it?

307
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
It doesn't seem convenient
to bring it along.

308
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:58,880
Not bad.

309
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,961
Why don't we put it on the rooftop

310
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:02,680
to protect our Cultivating Hall?

311
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,000
You don't like it, do you?

312
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,121
It's okay.

313
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:07,561
I've got another gift.

314
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,201
I'm sure you'll like this.

315
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:17,081
How is it?

316
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,800
This Mingyue Silk can be said to be magnificent.

317
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,721
Take it back and have it tailored...

318
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:23,441
What is this?

319
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,160
Well...

320
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,121
No, what do you mean?

321
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,800
Did that girl embroider it?

322
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,841
That girl?

323
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,561
Chong Ming,

324
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,601
I'm very satisfied with your gift.

325
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,920
Thanks for your effort.

326
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,680
But I don't like

327
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
this embroidered handkerchief.

328
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,000
Burn it.

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,081
But this Mingyue Silk is quite nice.

330
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll bring it back
and have it tailored as a cloak.

331
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,960
The High Priest of Grand Preceptor
suddenly commanded

332
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,160
to promote that unidentified immortal official

333
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,440
to a priest.

334
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,601
And he's recruiting
a great number of disciples.

335
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,801
This immortal official

336
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,601
has just turned 18 this year.

337
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,160
The age matches it either.

338
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,361
I suspect that the immortal official

339
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,160
who hides in the Emperor Valley

340
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,720
is him.

341
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,160
What should we do now?

342
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:41,801
Should we just send someone there to kill him?

343
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,761
It's not confirmed yet.

344
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,281
We can't act recklessly.

345
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,480
To prevent from spooking him.

346
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,880
We can't wait any longer, brother.

347
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,561
I think we should send

348
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Azure Clan's most capable person

349
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,640
to take the chance of this recruitment

350
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,761
to spy on them.

351
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,200
Didn't you also think highly of Qing Gang

352
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,240
from Azure Clan's side branch?

353
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,321
That's exactly what I think.

354
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
As a precaution,

355
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,400
I've got to use that kind of thing.

356
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:09,761
Azure Clan is an expert in poison.

357
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,281
This is in the first place.

358
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,121
The most poisonous thing in the world,

359
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,440
Magpie Branch.

360
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
Xueying, Xuelu,

361
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,960
you ask the servants to pack the luggages.

362
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,801
You're going to Jiuyi Mountain

363
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,920
to join the selection of the Priest's disciples.

364
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,920
Am I going too?

365
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,361
My dear daughter,

366
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:34,880
I can't reject the invitation

367
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,400
from the High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

368
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:39,001
I'll need you to go to the mountain.

369
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,321
You don't need to fight for anything.

370
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:43,880
It's Mid-Autumn Festival a month later.

371
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,001
I'll take you to Jialan

372
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,841
to meet His Highness Shi Yu.

373
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,041
Don't worry, Father.

374
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,841
On this journey,

375
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,680
I'll be sure to take
good care of Xuelu.

376
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,240
That's what I meant.

377
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,041
If anything happens to her,

378
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,361
I'll hold you responsible for that.

379
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:07,081
Both of you must remember

380
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,200
that on this trip,

381
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,761
especially when you're on the mountain,

382
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,160
you must not manifest yourselves.

383
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,521
Just take it as an experience.

384
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:14,720
Got it?

385
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,841
We understand.

386
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,081
Especially you.

387
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm well aware
of the purpose of this trip.

388
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,680
I won't make troubles.

389
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,160
One month is extremely short.

390
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,601
Whatever you want, Father.

391
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,720
(Shi Yu is no longer my target.)

392
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
(This Priest who comes out of nowhere)

393
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,561
(must be the person who lives
in the Emperor Valley.)

394
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,521
(As long as I take him down,)

395
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,561
(I'll have the leverage to negotiate)

396
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,321
(with the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
and Consort Qing.)

397
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,480
Yan.

398
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:06,041
Father, Mother.

399
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,440
I've got a great news for you.

400
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,041
Here, see for yourself.

401
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,920
We knew that you like
to practise magic technique.

402
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,920
Jiuyi Mountain is going

403
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,920
to make an exception and take in
female disciples this time.

404
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,160
The High Priest of Grand Preceptor
sends a letter over

405
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:20,480
to invite you to the contest
on the mountain.

406
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,440
Jiuyi Mountain?

407
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,680
If you could pass
the recruitment competition,

408
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,361
you'll be able to attend
a retreat there for a month.

409
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,121
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.

410
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
I...

411
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,841
I'll think about it.

412
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,200
Yan.

413
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:39,801
Yan.

414
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:02,680
You look sulky.

415
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Are you afraid to see

416
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,200
the person who makes you sad?

417
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,121
I guess so.

418
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,001
When I heard of Jiuyi Mountain,

419
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,081
it reminded me of the person

420
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,400
who denied my ability.

421
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:18,640
Why would I return to the place

422
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,240
that underestimates me?

423
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,440
Could that person represent Jiuyi Mountain?

424
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:25,880
The Priest is going to be your master, not him.

425
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,321
But

426
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,440
if I run into him

427
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,880
and he says something annoying again,

428
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:32,720
what should I do?

429
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,281
You just have to gain

430
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,400
acknowledgement from the Priest.

431
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,521
It doesn't matter
who the others think of you.

432
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,200
Maybe when you become
the disciple of the Priest,

433
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:42,480
you'll notice
that the person is not that special.

434
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
Look.

435
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,440
The Salang Eagle that you rescued

436
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
has already gotten a new life.

437
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,601
It really is
the Salang Eagle that I saved.

438
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:07,561
That's right.

439
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm Jiang Bead Flying Flame.

440
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,601
I'm the Salang Eagle
that soars in the sky.

441
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,561
As long as I do my utmost,

442
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,281
not to mention staying

443
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,521
in the mountain for a month,

444
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
it won't be a problem for me

445
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,400
to be the first disciple.

446
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,841
Princess, you just have to do your best.

447
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,841
What now? Don't you believe me?

448
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,920
Several hundreds years ago,
my great-grandmother Chizu Feili,

449
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:27,720
was the renowned heroine in the Six Ministries.

450
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:33,640
Don't you know her?

451
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
Yuan came to the Crimson Residence
200 years ago.

452
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,160
That time,

453
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,321
the Crimson Clan was managed

454
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,041
by my great-grandmother.

455
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,561
You must've seen her, right?

456
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,880
What did my great-grandmother look like?

457
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:49,680
Yuan.

458
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,001
Yao Yi.

459
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,121
Are you alright?

460
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,081
Yao Yi.

461
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,801
Yao Yi, I'll take you with me.

462
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:04,640
It's not necessary.

463
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,281
You must go on living.

464
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:09,480
If you leave,

465
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,361
how could I live alone?

466
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,841
No!

467
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,561
The people of Kongsang will reincarnate.

468
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:19,281
Reincarnation?

469
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,281
You must wait for me.

470
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,361
We'll use this to make ourselves known
in the next life.

471
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:49,240
You must protect my kinsmen for me.

472
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,160
Wait for my return.

473
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,081
Sure.

474
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:55,400
I'll wait for you to be reincarnated.

475
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,801
Before we meet again...

476
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,841
Yuan,

477
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,121
forget me.

478
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,001
Yao Yi.

479
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,680
Yao Yi.

480
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,640
(A merfolk can only love a person in his life.)

481
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,480
(I can no longer remember)

482
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,960
(the face of my loved one)

483
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,081
(until one day, she is reincarnated)

484
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:26,281
(and reunites with me.)

485
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:27,561
I

486
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,081
don't remember
what your great-grandmother looked like.

487
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,521
Indeed.

488
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:35,920
It's already been 200 years.

489
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,400
You might not remember her.

490
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,801
If I pass away several years later,

491
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,041
you must not forget about my appearance.

492
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:52,200
Well, Yuan.

493
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,240
Just stay here and wait for my good news.

494
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,920
Of course.

495
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,880
Take care of yourself in the mountain.

496
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,761
This is a gift for you from me.

497
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm worried
that you might feel bored here.

498
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,440
That you'll miss Extreme Wind City.

499
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,361
Xueying,

500
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,521
I didn't expect you could come.

501
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,960
By the way,

502
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,081
how are you and His Highness Shi Yu

503
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,561
doing lately?

504
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,761
Actually, after we went down
the mountain,

505
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,680
we didn't get the chance
to see each other again.

506
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,920
But Father said

507
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
he could take me to Jialan

508
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,720
to join the Mid-Autumn Festival.

509
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,960
I think I'll be able

510
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,960
to meet him by then.

511
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,880
Mid-Autumn Festival?

512
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,361
Isn't that at the end of next month?

513
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,121
It seems like

514
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:51,200
you've never thought of being selected

515
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
as the first disciple of the Priest.

516
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,440
Stop teasing me.

517
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,321
I'm thinking

518
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,480
if we could pass the selection,

519
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,321
we'll be able to practise together

520
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
in the mountain for a month.

521
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,841
I'm sure we'll learn
many things from it.

522
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,240
On our way down the mountain,

523
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
we'll be able to travel together.

524
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,400
Go down the mountain?

525
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,200
By then, if I get selected

526
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,640
as the first disciple of the Priest,

527
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:14,841
I won't go down the mountain.

528
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:17,121
Yan,

529
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,801
you also want to be the first disciple?

530
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:20,480
Yes.

531
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,841
Why? Do you think I can do it?

532
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,561
Well, actually,

533
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
there are many competitors this time.

534
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,801
Like my elder sister.

535
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,240
Father doesn't want us to fight for it,

536
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,680
but she seems to care a lot

537
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,240
about this selection.

538
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,121
She asked Cuihe to gather

539
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,521
the books about magic spell.

540
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,640
A while ago,

541
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,281
she didn't even keep
her hands off the books.

542
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,200
Are you saying

543
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:47,720
that I can't defeat your elder sister?

544
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,200
No.

545
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,361
Actually, my elder sister

546
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:55,041
has been practising magic techniques
since she was a kid.

547
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,041
She can even fight my elder brother.

548
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,521
However,

549
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,480
since Qing Gang has joined this time,

550
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:04,761
it's unlikely that my elder sister would win.

551
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:06,400
Qing Gang?

552
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:07,680
Yes.

553
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,680
Qing Gang is the leader
of the Shadow Warriors.

554
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:10,521
I wonder why he would come

555
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,281
to Jiuyi Mountain to be an disciple.

556
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,240
If he wants to take the position

557
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,480
of the first disciple,

558
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,400
no one is a match for him.

559
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,160
I'd like to meet

560
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,880
this rude person as well.

561
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,160
A person who I'd like to meet

562
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,880
and another person
who I don't want to see.

563
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,081
What are you talking about, Yan?

564
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Nothing.

565
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,240
I just hope

566
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,801
that I won't run into this person

567
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,041
during the time
when I'm in the mountain.

568
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:43,480
If I see him, I'll...

569
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,480
Ying, today, I'll...

570
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,680
No way.

571
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
Why are you so formal?

572
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,240
We've known each other for so long.

573
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:21,561
Can't I see it?

574
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,361
There's nothing to see.

575
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:26,361
Just get to the point.

576
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:28,880
Fine, today

577
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,281
is your promotion ceremony

578
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,521
and the recruitment test
of your disciple.

579
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
There are many noble ladies
from the Six Ministries.

580
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:35,521
What if that brat of Crimson Clan

581
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,561
comes again?

582
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,321
Her power is weak.

583
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,601
Besides, even if she's lucky enough
to pass the test,

584
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
she won't be able
to be my first disciple.

585
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,001
There's nothing to be worried about.

586
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:46,121
She'll stay in the mountain for a month

587
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:47,561
if she passes the test, Ying.

588
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
She's your cursed lady.

589
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,801
Ying.

590
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,440
Ying.

591
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:56,720
It won't do.

592
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I must come up with a panacea.

593
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,321
This is a treasure
from the Western Region.

594
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:24,160
Treasure?

595
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,321
This is very valuable.

596
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:26,321
Let me see it.

597
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,801
No.

598
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
- What if you break it?
Let me see it.

599
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:29,240
Excuse me.

600
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,121
The gifts for the Priest
from the ministries

601
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,200
have already been handed

602
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,200
to the divine servants
before we go up the mountain.

603
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,121
Why do you still have it?

604
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
These gifts are not for Lord Priest.

605
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,480
They are for General Qing Gang.

606
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,281
Miss,

607
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,561
I guess you don't know this.

608
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,561
The rule for this selection
of the Priest's disciples is

609
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,880
that we'll be divided into pairs.

610
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:48,640
Whoever is on the same team

611
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,081
with General Qing Gang,

612
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:52,001
they're already winning.

613
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:54,801
(Qing Gang again?)

614
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,041
Miss Xuelu,

615
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,081
why didn't you prepare a gift?

616
00:29:58,761 --> 00:29:59,720
Father told me

617
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,521
to take good care
of Xueying on this journey.

618
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:05,121
Of course I've got to team up
with Xueying.

619
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,440
Moreover, a word of advice.

620
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,240
Don't ever think of using the gifts

621
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
to win over General Qing.

622
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:14,761
Why is that?

623
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,001
Because he's not someone

624
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,240
who'll show mercy.

625
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,561
Is that so?

626
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,801
Indeed, General Qing

627
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,321
has remarkable skills.

628
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,001
It's cheating
to learn the rules in advance.

629
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
(Qing Gang, Azure Clan of Kongsang)
Jiuyi Mountain is a place to retreat.

630
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,041
You're not allowed to make a scene here.

631
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,121
I'll hand these gifts
to the divine servants.

632
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,480
They'll give it to the commoners nearby.

633
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,440
Miss Xuelu,

634
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,121
you know General Qing very well.

635
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,240
(He is my number one rival)

636
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,480
(in the selection
of the first disciple.)

637
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
(Of course I'll enquire
into his background.)

638
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:45,200
General Qing,

639
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,240
there's one thing I've always
wanted to ask you.

640
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,720
I heard that you got a firm foundation
in magic technique.

641
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,801
And you got
brilliant achievements in war.

642
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,400
You won't learn anything

643
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,880
from the magic of Jiuyi Mountain.

644
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,601
Then, why do you come here?

645
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,041
Also,

646
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,601
I heard that you had defeated

647
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:02,121
the Crimson King a while ago.

648
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,081
That he can't even fight back.

649
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Yan.

650
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,720
The Crimson King is in his 40s.

651
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,440
He's not as powerful as before.

652
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,761
Defeating him is not something to be proud of.

653
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,880
Shut up!

654
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:20,920
You're really rude and wayward.

655
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,521
You must be Princess Zhu Yan, right?

656
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,680
Victory and defeat
are common in a battle.

657
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,480
You take it too seriously.

658
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,361
You...

659
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,041
Right, Zhu Yan.

660
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,001
Don't let it get to you.

661
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:33,960
Even your father is not

662
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,081
a match for General Qing.

663
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,041
If you lose to him again,

664
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:38,801
don't cry in front of everyone.

665
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
Who told you I'll cry?

666
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,361
Qing Gang,

667
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,321
why don't we battle it out now?

668
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,081
What do you think?

669
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,601
Bai Xuelu,

670
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,400
this is what you want, right?

671
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,480
As you drive a wedge between us,

672
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,680
you simply want me to fight Qing Gang

673
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,960
and make a scene.

674
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:01,200
In this way, we'll violate

675
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,081
the rule of Jiuyi Mountain.

676
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,761
Then, we'll be disqualified
from joining the selection.

677
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,680
You want to use me
to eradicate Qing Gang.

678
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,880
I won't fall for it.

679
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,240
General Qing,

680
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,001
do you think I'll do that?

681
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Qing Gang,

682
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,440
we'll have this fight sooner or later.

683
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
But this will happen
only after the selection ends.

684
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:21,321
Sure.

685
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
This is an agreement.

686
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,001
I'll certainly be there by then.

687
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,240
What are you doing?

688
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,481
My disciple.

689
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,041
Here.

690
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:32,601
Make an oath.

691
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,240
Do not have fun
and get married in this life.

692
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:40,760
Do not return to the mortal coil,
forget about the crown.

693
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,760
You'll serve the Divine
for the rest of your life.

694
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,840
I swear

695
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:46,921
I won't have fun
and get married in my life.

696
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,121
I won't return to the mortal coil,
I'll forget about the crown.

697
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,921
I'll spend the rest of my life
serving the Divine.

698
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:05,760
This is the end
of the coronation of the Priest.

699
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,001
- Greetings to Priest.
- Greetings to Priest.

700
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:51,360
(I can't believe it's you.)

701
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,840
(I won't be your disciple).

702
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,401
- Congratulations, Priest.
- Congratulations, Priest.

703
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,881
What is a mage?

704
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,720
We spread the Divine's kindness.

705
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,521
This is to ordain conscience
for everything.

706
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,320
We learn the magic of the four seasons.

707
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,481
To protect the commoners from danger.

708
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,360
Without this sentiment,

709
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,001
you're not allowed to be my disciple.

710
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,401
- To ordain conscience for everything.
- To ordain conscience for everything.

711
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,360
- To protect the commoners from danger.
- To protect the commoners from danger.

712
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:20,640
The match begins.

713
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,121
You'll be in pairs.

714
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,200
You'll win and lose together.

715
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,640
If one of the members is out,

716
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:31,280
both of you will be eliminated.

717
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,401
Do you understand?

718
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,360
- Understood.
- Understood.

719
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,441
Wait.

720
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:39,561
I don't want to take the test.

721
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,601
Please let me leave now.

722
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,601
If you want to leave,

723
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:48,481
do it with your own ability.

724
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,441
I won't stop you.

725
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:51,800
Zhu Yan,

726
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,601
with this qualification of yours,

727
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,881
you can't be the first disciple
of the Priest even if you stay.

728
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,160
You...

729
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,961
The recruitment test has
two rounds in total.

730
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,081
The first round is an intelligence test.

731
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,921
You'll have to use your quick wit

732
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,840
to cope with the crisis in the mountain.

733
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,760
Those who reach the top of Qianyue Hill

734
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,481
can stay and learn for a month.

735
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,280
The second round is a wisdom test.

736
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:17,081
To choose the first disciple.

737
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,160
This is my artifact.

738
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,481
I'll hide it on the top of Qianyue Hill.

739
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,720
The first team
to reach the top of the hill

740
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:28,961
and take this Jade Bone,

741
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,961
the winner of that team

742
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,640
will be the first disciple

743
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,601
of Jiuyi Mountain in the future.

744
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,601
That's great.

745
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,481
Yes.

746
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,961
I'm Bai Xuelu from White Clan.

747
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,441
Priest, may I ask

748
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,240
what danger it is in the mountain now?

749
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,121
The road is bumpy.

750
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:46,160
There are numerous traps and beasts.

751
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:49,001
And there is a Qiong Qi that's going on trials.

752
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,441
It's wandering around the mountain.

753
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,401
Qiong Qi?

754
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:53,280
Qiong Qi?

755
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,561
I dare not to do this.

756
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,160
With your current ability,

757
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm afraid it's hard
for you to fight it.

758
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,160
If you run into it,

759
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:03,401
do not go head on with them.

760
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,001
You can only go another way.

761
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,881
I'll be in Jiuyi Hall

762
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,680
waiting for your return.

763
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,460
(Star-gazing Hall)

764
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,481
Let's go.

765
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,280
Go, go, go.

766
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Come on.

767
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:23,160
Let's go.

768
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,601
(This can only prove)

769
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:38,001
(that you're silly and reckless.)

770
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,041
Xuelu.

771
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:55,640
Xuelu.

772
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,121
Xuelu.

773
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,881
Xuelu.

774
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,121
Xuelu, I sprained my ankle.

775
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,081
I can't stand up.

776
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:27,760
Xuelu.

777
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,320
Xuelu.

778
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,521
Xuelu.

779
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:46,921
Xuelu.

780
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,521
What are you looking at?

781
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,521
What are you waiting for?

782
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,200
Quickly get up.

783
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:17,961
Xuelu.

784
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:20,081
If you really want to thank me,

785
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,921
just keep yourself on your toes.

786
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:24,001
Don't slow me down.

787
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,320
Xuelu.

788
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,041
No wonder he was acting all mysterious.

789
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
It turns out that he's the Priest.

790
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,521
Look at the fuss he makes

791
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
in the selection of his disciple.

792
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,240
Back then,

793
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,521
I was in way over my head

794
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,001
and wanted to be his disciple.

795
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:50,720
Of course he didn't approve of me.

796
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:54,041
You look down upon me.

797
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,041
I don't even want to stay here.

798
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,160
Since you refused to let me go,

799
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,081
I'll just sit here
and wait to be eliminated.

800
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,041
Who is it?

801
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,081
Who is it? Come on out!

802
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,280
Who are you?

803
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,121
Come on out now!

804
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:41,561
Chong Ming.

805
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,320
Chong Ming.

806
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,041
It's you, isn't it?

807
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:49,481
Come out.

808
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,081
Come fight me one-on-one if you dare.

809
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:00,561
You can't win the first place

810
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,561
even without me.

811
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,280
I just don't want you

812
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,561
to feel embarrassed by then.

813
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,001
You make it sound like

814
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,240
I want to be his disciple.

815
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,881
I can still learn magic

816
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,561
even when I leave Jiuyi Mountain.

817
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:16,121
I don't want to stay here, anyway.

818
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,160
As such,

819
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,881
why don't you just eliminate me?

820
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,680
Why did you throw these stones at me?

821
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:24,001
Weren't you able to fight leopard?

822
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:25,441
Bring it on.

823
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,680
I promise I won't avoid your hit.

824
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:30,521
Then, don't blame me for this.
