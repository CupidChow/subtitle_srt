19
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,421
Master is not coming.

20
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:04,262
Now, you're gone too.

21
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:09,781
I'm the only one left here.

22
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:32,101
How can I bear to leave you alone?

23
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,501
The truth is, I know

24
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:41,981
why you're going to Huotu Tribe
to marry.

25
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,422
Until the day you're free

26
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:46,981
without any worldly burdens,

27
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:48,981
I will come to you.

28
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,781
I want to tell you

29
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:54,221
that you're the one

30
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:55,981
who made me wait for two hundred years.

31
00:02:59,062 --> 00:02:59,941
(But)

32
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,742
(now the God of Dragon has awakened,)

33
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,221
(and my whereabouts
have also been exposed.)

34
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,182
(I absolutely cannot)

35
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,821
(let you fall into
the same predicament and danger)

36
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:13,422
(like two hundred years ago.)

37
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,462
After I guide the Sea Emperor
on the right path,

38
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:20,221
the enmity between the two clans

39
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,501
will no longer exist between us.

40
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,941
Then no one can hurt you anymore.

41
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:25,422
And no one

42
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,701
can stop us from being together anymore.

43
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:32,821
Yao Yi,

44
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,182
wait for me.

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,740
(Crimson Residence)

46
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:03,182
When you returned last night,

47
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:04,462
you have been holding this map.

48
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,781
You continue studying it
when you woke up today.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,342
I can tell

50
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,981
this is the latest map.

51
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,422
How can you tell?

52
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:15,701
My town folks told me

53
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,302
(Relay Station)
that this relay station is under construction.

54
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,662
And it's already marked on this map.

55
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:21,662
(This map marks the Huotu Tribe's)

56
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,862
(main roads at each checkpoint)

57
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,542
(Huotu Tribe)
(so meticulously.)

58
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,821
(It seems someone
prepared this just for me.)

59
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:35,821
(No.)

60
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:37,422
(I must be dreaming.)

61
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,102
(It can't be Yuan.)

62
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,742
Where are Xueying and Qing Gang?

63
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,341
Princess Xueying and General Qing

64
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:44,941
went back early this morning.

65
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,782
I suppose General Qing

66
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,261
left this map to you.

67
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,622
(With Qing Gang's upright character,)

68
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:51,782
(how could he possibly notice)

69
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:52,821
(what's on my mind?)

70
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,182
(Never mind that.)

71
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,782
(Who cares where this map is from?)

72
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,302
(I'll use it first.)

73
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:58,422
Maybe he did.

74
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,021
Since I'm marrying into the Huotu Tribe,

75
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,422
I should study more about it.

76
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:04,222
That's right.

77
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:05,862
We're leaving in two days.

78
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,261
Young Lady,

79
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:12,941
are you really not taking

80
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,102
this jade flute with you?

81
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,742
Father.

82
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:34,782
Mother.

83
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,701
I've been a willful child.

84
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,901
I often cause trouble

85
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,982
and make both of you worry.

86
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:47,941
I shall never forget

87
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,622
your upbringing.

88
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,302
I'll be setting off

89
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:55,302
on a long and arduous journey

90
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,062
without knowing when I can return.

91
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:01,461
I won't be able to fulfill my duty
as a daughter.

92
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:04,461
I can only hope
I can be your daughter again

93
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,141
in the next life

94
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,461
and be a good daughter.

95
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,542
So both of you

96
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,622
can enjoy the happiness of family life.

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,800
(Crimson Residence)

98
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:50,862
I cut off my hair to return it to you

99
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,381
for the kindness of your upbringing.

100
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,581
After this goodbye,

101
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,501
we'll be separated.

102
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,302
Yan'er,

103
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,341
don't ever say that.

104
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:19,581
It's not like we're not seeing
each other anymore.

105
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,302
You may be married.

106
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:25,782
But you can still

107
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,422
come home and visit your family.

108
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,422
As long as you're willing,

109
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,862
you can come home

110
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,581
every several months.

111
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,102
Yan'er,

112
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,422
I made some arrangements for you.

113
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:39,662
I won't let you suffer

114
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:40,622
in Huotu Tribe.

115
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,182
This is the wedding escort

116
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:43,701
I've selected especially for you.

117
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:44,581
Among them

118
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,581
are those who watched you grow up.

119
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,102
They'll be faithful to you

120
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,422
and keep you safe.

121
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,501
And these

122
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,341
food and clothing.

123
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,381
I've also prepared them for you.

124
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:56,381
In the future...

125
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,622
In the future, I will send you more...

126
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,021
I want you to live the life

127
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:05,662
you have in Extreme Wind City.

128
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,141
Father.

129
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,941
Mother.

130
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,021
Promise me

131
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,021
that no matter what happens
in the future,

132
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:28,742
you must live well.

133
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:32,981
Mother has bad knees.

134
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,621
Remember to burn wormwood.

135
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,861
Father, don't be angry all the time.

136
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,902
I still prefer to see you smile.

137
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,461
I'll laugh often.

138
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:50,861
Yes.

139
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,502
Today is the big day of Yan'er.

140
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:57,101
Didn't we agree

141
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:58,502
to be happy?

142
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,101
Yes, be happy.

143
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:04,502
Don't worry about us.

144
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,341
We'll be fine.

145
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:11,182
As for you,

146
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,382
without your father and me

147
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:17,502
by your side,

148
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,821
you have to take care of yourself.

149
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,382
There, there.

150
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,341
Stop crying.

151
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,542
This is a good thing.

152
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,502
Marrying her off is a good thing.

153
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,542
(Salang Eagle,)

154
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,101
(I hope that in the future,)

155
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:12,382
(I can fly as high as you,)

156
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,062
(soaring in the sky.)

157
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:49,461
The Huotu Tribe
welcomes Princess Zhu Yan!

158
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,701
Good day, Your Highness.

159
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:59,662
Everyone, please rise.

160
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:01,341
Thank you, Your Highness.

161
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,221
Your Highness had a long journey.

162
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,701
We've prepared everything you need.

163
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,302
Please enter the tent and get some rest.

164
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,782
This is my son, Ke'erke.

165
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,142
It's an honor for Ke'erke to be able

166
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,262
to marry Your Highness.

167
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:29,221
Greetings, Your Highness.

168
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,182
(He's a fine-looking man)

169
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:33,542
(and somewhat heroic.)

170
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,422
(It's a pity I don't like him.)

171
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,382
I, the Principal Sorcerer
of the Huotu Tribe,

172
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,422
greet Your Highness.

173
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,302
(These people may appear strong.)

174
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:44,981
(But none of them is my match.)

175
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:46,941
(Somehow, I dreaded)

176
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:47,941
(this Principal Sorcerer.)

177
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,821
(I have to test his magical techniques.)

178
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,341
Please enter the tent to rest
for a few days

179
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,262
while waiting for the auspicious day.

180
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,182
Thank you, Great Consort.

181
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:56,821
This way, please.

182
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,302
(The Principal Sorcerer's skills
are just common.)

183
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:39,581
Yu.

184
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:41,741
Yu,

185
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:44,101
what are you doing?

186
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,422
Your Highness,

187
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:46,621
I just found out

188
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,741
a grasshopper with a broken leg.

189
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:51,262
I'm trying to take it back for treatment.

190
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:53,422
Your hands.

191
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:57,581
Empty my pencil case

192
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,542
and give it to Prince Shi Yu.

193
00:15:58,981 --> 00:15:59,621
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,142
Grasshopper bites are not serious.

195
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:02,022
But it hurts.

196
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,302
Let's put it in the box first, okay?

197
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:06,581
Put it here.

198
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,861
Thank you, Your Highness.

199
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:27,981
(I've been hoping
and my hope has come true.)

200
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,382
(The good news
about your safety spreads.)

201
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:32,821
(Looking back, we've been apart
for a long time.)

202
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:35,461
(The future is long,
let's have more gatherings.)

203
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
(Good news about your safety spreads.)

204
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,502
(I heard your disciple Princess Zhu Yan)

205
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,022
(is about to marry
into the Huotu Tribe.)

206
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,741
(If you descend the mountain
to attend the ceremony,)

207
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,502
(I wonder if you could come
for a visit to Jialan?)

208
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,502
It's getting full.

209
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,581
Ying, it's going to overflow.

210
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,062
(Don't tell me)

211
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:13,262
(he's rushing to Western Huang
to steal the bride.)

212
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,062
(The calmer he appears on the outside,)

213
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,341
(the more restless his heart is.)

214
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,621
(Is he suppressing his frustration?)

215
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:40,661
Chong Ming.

216
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,141
We'll go right away.

217
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,062
Are you washing my brush?

218
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:46,542
No.

219
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:48,901
I'm thirsty.

220
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:49,942
Yes, I'm parched.

221
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,160
(Borrowing Record, Zhu Yan)

222
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:20,421
Master.

223
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,542
Do you know what my wish is?

224
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:25,782
I want to have my name,

225
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,821
Zhu Yan, written in the borrowing record

226
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,942
of all the books here.

227
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:35,022
Can you finish reading so many books?

228
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,581
I'm going to be here

229
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,502
for a long time
and stay with you forever anyway.

230
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,341
Someday, I'll be able
to finish reading them all.

231
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,393
(Borrowing Record)

232
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,542
How are you enjoying

233
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,302
the food and living arrangements here,
Your Highness?

234
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,181
Great Consort,
you've put in a lot of effort.

235
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:11,302
By the way,

236
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:12,742
I heard the Huotu Tribe

237
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:14,222
has encountered sand demons before.

238
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,742
Is this true?

239
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,421
Your Highness actually knows
about the sand demons?

240
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,421
Indeed, you have vast knowledge.

241
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,181
We had some troubles with them
a few years ago.

242
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,341
But we haven't seen them
for a long time.

243
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,942
Your Highness, you can rest assured.

244
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,141
Then I won't disturb your rest.

245
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:32,661
I'll take my leave.

246
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,022
Young Lady.

247
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:45,942
Yufei,

248
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,101
I want to tell you something.

249
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,421
But promise me

250
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,821
that you won't make a fuss after that.

251
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,302
I'm going to run away.

252
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,302
What?

253
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:05,861
Young Lady,

254
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:07,302
are you serious?

255
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,262
Yes.

256
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,302
I'm going to play dead and run away.

257
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:12,742
Before I agreed to marry

258
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:13,702
into the Huotu Tribe,

259
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:15,621
I've already made up my mind.

260
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:18,942
No wonder you agreed

261
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,421
so readily at the time.

262
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:23,141
Marrying into the Huotu Tribe
was an imperial decree.

263
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:26,262
Disobeying it would be a grave offense.

264
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:27,462
I don't want to bring trouble

265
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:28,942
to the entire Crimson Clan
because of me.

266
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,581
So I can only escape by faking my death.

267
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,141
This way,

268
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,502
I can maintain Father
and Mother's dignity,

269
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,062
and relieve the pressure
by the Azure Clan on the Crimson Clan.

270
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:39,942
I can also secure my own freedom.

271
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,861
Young Lady, you can't do this.

272
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,621
Yufei, think about it.

273
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,341
I was ordered

274
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,742
to add firewood for Your Highness.

275
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,181
Why does that sound like...

276
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:51,302
Keeper Yuan?

277
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:52,502
It really is you.

278
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:54,861
Yuan.

279
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:55,982
Young Lady,

280
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:57,502
I'll go and keep watch for you.

281
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,302
Yuan, it's really you.

282
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:04,942
Yes, it's me.

283
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:08,421
Yuan, please sit down.

284
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:14,141
Yuan,

285
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:15,942
is your injury better now?

286
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,742
Where have you been all this time?

287
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,821
I've been with you all along
during this time.

288
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:21,502
So

289
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,421
you knew about my plan.

290
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,341
You were the one

291
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:28,942
who sent the map and nuts.

292
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:32,302
You still protect me like always.

293
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:34,661
Everything is ready now.

294
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:35,821
On your wedding day,

295
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,542
what's your plan?

296
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:38,181
I can take you away from here
at any time.

297
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:39,262
No.

298
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,421
I can't accept your help anymore
this time.

299
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:44,581
Why?

300
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,141
I appreciate your thought.

301
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:48,421
But defying the decree
and escaping the marriage

302
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,782
is a capital offense.

303
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,262
Whether this plan succeeds or not,

304
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:52,861
I'll bear the consequences alone.

305
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,062
I can't

306
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,262
and don't want to involve anyone else,

307
00:21:58,181 --> 00:21:58,821
including you.

308
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:01,621
Yan'er.

309
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:02,782
Yuan,

310
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:04,262
all the time,

311
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,982
you've been sharing my worries.

312
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:08,022
But everyone has setbacks

313
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,621
they must face alone.

314
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:11,421
This time,

315
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,542
I'm fully prepared.

316
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,821
The First Disciple of Jiuyi Mountain's
Priest of Grand Preceptor

317
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:16,341
is not just a reputation.

318
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:19,181
I'll escape safely this time.

319
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:21,621
Yuan,

320
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:22,942
please don't get involved

321
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,181
in this matter for my sake anymore.

322
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:26,742
I know your concerns.

323
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,462
And during this journey,

324
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:29,702
I've heard many bad things

325
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:30,861
about the Merfolk marine force.

326
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:33,181
Yuan,

327
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:34,341
please don't concern yourself
with me anymore.

328
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:36,181
Go and attend to your own matters.

329
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:40,062
(The internal turmoil
in the Merfolk marine force continues.)

330
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:41,262
(If Elder Jian knows)

331
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:42,381
(I'm with Yan'er,)

332
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,022
(it'll be bad for Yan'er.)

333
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:45,621
Yan'er,

334
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:47,262
you must be careful
in everything you do.

335
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,381
I have found a suitable horse for you.

336
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:50,421
It's in the nearest stable

337
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:51,542
to the military barracks.

338
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:52,621
Also,

339
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,742
the eastern side of the tribe
has strengthened its guard posts.

340
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:56,621
The defense on the
west side is the weakest.

341
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,302
After you leave,

342
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,141
head west and don't look back.

343
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,062
When you arrived at
Tianchi in the desert,

344
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:03,141
you'll be out of danger.

345
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:04,702
The hardship you have to face

346
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,861
is no less than mine.

347
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:07,982
But I can't even help you.

348
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:09,381
Yuan,

349
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:11,421
you have to take care of yourself.

350
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:13,542
I'll take care of myself.

351
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:16,421
After I'm done with my tasks,

352
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,542
I'll wander the world with you.

353
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:20,062
Is that all right?

354
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:22,381
Hey, the soldier who tends the firewood.

355
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,222
Why are you still inside?

356
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:24,821
The Great Consort will punish you

357
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:26,222
for disturbing Her Highness's rest.

358
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,421
Why are you shouting?

359
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,181
What's wrong with adding more firewood?

360
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,262
Can you bear the responsibility
if the Princess is freezing?

361
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:32,942
Yan'er,

362
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,821
you must take care of yourself.

363
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:37,141
Wait.

364
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:39,022
Yuan,

365
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:40,742
promise me

366
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,702
that we'll both complete

367
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,341
our tasks successfully.

368
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:46,901
After that, we'll meet somewhere safe.

369
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:48,262
Okay?

370
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:46,262
I didn't expect there to be a barrier.

371
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,341
I'm sure it was the Principal Sorcerer
who set this barrier.

372
00:24:58,022 --> 00:24:59,141
As expected, it's a common barrier.

373
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:01,861
It can only stop nearby herdsmen.

374
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:11,262
A warmblood horse may be fast.

375
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,262
But it can't run far.

376
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,542
A coldblood horse can travel far.

377
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,502
But it's easily caught up.

378
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:25,982
Only this horse

379
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,302
is a good horse.

380
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:07,302
That's hot.

381
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:14,621
Is this what you eat?

382
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:19,702
I understand it now.

383
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,621
That barrier

384
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:23,022
was not to guard against others.

385
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:25,302
But to trap you.

386
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:30,222
Who can be so cruel

387
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,101
as to starve this child alive?

388
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:39,782
I'll go and find something
to eat for you.

389
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:41,942
If I can,

390
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,381
I'll find a physician

391
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,022
for the child...

392
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,621
Then what do you want me to do?

393
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:01,861
You know this?

394
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
(Yuan)

395
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:19,742
Yuan?

396
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:22,621
You know Yuan?

397
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,542
Who are you?

398
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
(Yu)

399
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:30,861
Yu...

400
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:33,942
Lady...

401
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:37,222
You're Lady Yu,

402
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,782
the Old Lord's favorite concubine?

403
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,901
I met you when I was little.

404
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,462
It must be because the Old Lord

405
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,302
has passed away

406
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:47,982
that the Great Consort
can no longer tolerate you.

407
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:49,022
So she imprisoned

408
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:50,421
you here and tortured you.

409
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,502
What's the child's name?

410
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:09,982
Su...

411
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,240
(Sumo)

412
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:14,062
mo.

413
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,502
Sumo.

414
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:23,661
(If I only bring a little food,)

415
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,062
(it'll only prolong their lives
for a few more days.)

416
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:27,421
(After I leave,)

417
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:28,982
(they still have to starve.)

418
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:30,222
(To save them,)

419
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,462
(unless I get them out of here.)

420
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,341
(But my plan)

421
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,262
(only allows for my escape.)

422
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:39,381
(I can't even take care of Yufei.)

423
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,502
(How can I bring two people)

424
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:42,742
(who can't even walk?)

425
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:45,022
Mother.

426
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,341
You're up.

427
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:47,502
Who are you?

428
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:49,581
Don't hurt my mother.

429
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:51,421
You...

430
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,040
(Zuowang Palace)

431
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:07,462
Does the White King know

432
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:09,742
that you're here?

433
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,302
No, he doesn't.

434
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,062
I came here secretly.

435
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,982
Is it a task for Consort Qing again?

436
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:21,702
Your Supreme Majesty, please understand.

437
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:22,942
I've never been bound

438
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:24,861
by anyone before.

439
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,141
I only want to serve

440
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:29,462
the strongest in the world.

441
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,101
According to what you said,

442
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:32,621
the incident at Nvluo Creek

443
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,421
is you testing the power
of Jiuyi Mountain, then.

444
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,222
I admit my mistake.

445
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,022
I take full responsibility
for my past actions.

446
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:41,462
But through this incident,

447
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,181
I'm completely devoted.

448
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,502
I've come today to redeem my sins,

449
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:49,782
to inform you
of Azure Clan's conspiracy.

450
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,782
That day, Consort Qing ordered me
to enter the palace.

451
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:57,181
I accidentally saw Consort Qing

452
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,181
conspiring with Huotu Tribe envoys.

453
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:00,821
Your Highness,

454
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,141
Lord Ke'erke's

455
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,581
marriage to Princess Zhu Yan

456
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:04,901
has already begun preparations.

457
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:06,222
Please don't worry.

458
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:07,381
Everything

459
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:08,861
will go according to your plan.

460
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,581
As for Great Consort Suda,

461
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:14,782
does she think this marriage

462
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,222
and subsequent arrangements

463
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:19,062
are all blessings from heaven?

464
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:20,861
The Great Consort obeys me.

465
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:22,782
Of course, it'll follow according to plan.

466
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:26,141
Good, very good.

467
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:29,821
People say that Azure Clan
is good with Gu.

468
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:31,621
Actually, they don't know,

469
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,502
the real most powerful Gu insect

470
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:35,022
isn't poisonous insects,

471
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:36,942
but people's hearts.

472
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:39,661
How could those barbarians see through

473
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:40,702
Your Highness's marvelous strategy?

474
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:42,782
With time,

475
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:44,861
Prince Shi Yu
will surely achieve great merits

476
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:46,462
and firmly sit on the throne.

477
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,222
The most suspicious thing in this matter

478
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:58,821
is what the envoy
of the Huotu Tribe said.

479
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:00,661
"With time,

480
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:03,821
Prince Shi Yu
will surely achieve great merits

481
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,101
and firmly sit on the throne."

482
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,942
Huotu Tribe may be a large tribe
in the borderland region.

483
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:09,341
But their loyalty

484
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,782
is far from being entrusted
with such an important task.

485
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:15,462
I hope the clues I provide

486
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:17,101
can be of help to you.

487
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,502
You're quite clever.

488
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,262
Consort Qing

489
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,341
planted this Principal Sorcerer,

490
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,742
an expert in dark witchcraft
in the Huotu Tribe

491
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,141
as early as five years ago.

492
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,141
This time,

493
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:29,942
taking advantage
of the Old Lord's death,

494
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,302
the Principal Sorcerer incited
the Great Consort.

495
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,181
Intending to marry off Zhu Yan
to control Western Huang

496
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:37,542
to carry out treasonous actions.

497
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:41,542
Consort Qing sent Shi Yu
to suppress the situation

498
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,262
and earn merits for Shi Yu.

499
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:45,742
They will take action

500
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,702
within these few days.

501
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,222
It turns out everything

502
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:51,702
has been under your control.

503
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:52,861
I was just about

504
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:54,742
to send Shi Ying

505
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:56,062
to the Huotu Tribe.

506
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:05,901
It's just up ahead.

507
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:10,062
Be careful.

508
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:17,982
This is where I rest.

509
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,421
It's very secluded.

510
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:21,462
Even if someone discovers your escape,

511
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:22,982
they won't find their way here.

512
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:33,782
Here's some food

513
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,341
to fill your stomach.

514
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,181
Let me help you.

515
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:26,942
Go away!

516
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:27,982
Go away!

517
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:29,382
Go away!

518
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:30,822
Go away!

519
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:33,942
Go away!

520
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:37,542
Go away!

521
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:41,261
Is he all right?

522
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:02,621
Get up quickly.

523
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,062
You're much older than me.

524
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,902
I can't accept your gesture.

525
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:12,701
Stay here.

526
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:13,661
Rest without worry

527
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,422
and wait for my return.

528
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,221
A star rises.

529
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:47,542
Could it be a sign of my new life?

530
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,661
(Please don't concern yourself
with me anymore.)

531
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,062
(Go and attend to your own matters.)

532
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:40,422
The Evil Star has already risen.

533
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,181
If the Sea Emperor falls into

534
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:45,382
the hands of those with evil intentions,

535
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:47,181
both Kongsang and the Merfolk

536
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,062
will be plunged into eternal calamity.

537
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:53,502
Then I can't feel at ease with you
by my side.

538
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,542
Yao Yi,

539
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,141
you really know me best.

540
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:20,701
Did you also see

541
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:21,781
the Evil Star?

542
00:37:22,422 --> 00:37:24,101
I was about to report this to you.

543
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,382
Please allow me to go down
the mountain to investigate.

544
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:30,342
The fever breaks out,
and the God of Dragon awakens.

545
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,221
It's all indeed an omen.

546
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:35,181
Judging from the direction,

547
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:37,101
the Evil Star appeared

548
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,661
in the Huotu Tribe in Western Huang.

549
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:43,462
The shifting of the celestial bodies
relates to the destiny of Kongsang.

550
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:44,621
We

551
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,661
cannot just stand idly by.

552
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:49,542
In this case,

553
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,022
then

554
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:53,502
there is no need to worry too much.

555
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,342
The prophecy just says

556
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:57,382
the Sea Emperor would return

557
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:58,781
with the Evil Star.

558
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,502
But it did not mention his return

559
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,462
will pose any threat to Kongsang.

560
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:06,422
The defeat and annihilation
of the Merfolk Clan

561
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:08,502
happened many years ago.

562
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,261
The majority of the merfolks

563
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,022
have learned to live in peace
with the people of Kongsang.

564
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,542
Therefore, it's still uncertain

565
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,261
whether the appearance of the Evil Star
is auspicious or ominous.

566
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,022
We cannot come
to a definite conclusion yet.

567
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,701
Indeed, we cannot come
to a definite conclusion.

568
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:25,902
However, this prophecy
is deeply ingrained in people's hearts.

569
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,221
There will inevitably be those
who are eager to take advantage.

570
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:31,822
If they seize on this opportunity,

571
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,141
chaos will ensue in the world.

572
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:37,902
Your Supreme Majesty,

573
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,942
if the appearance of the Evil Star
is an auspicious omen,

574
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,822
then it heralds a peaceful
and prosperous era.

575
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,382
If it's ominous,

576
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,542
I'll take advantage to eliminate

577
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:50,902
the newly risen Evil Star at any cost.

578
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,581
You may go.

579
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,581
Yes, Master.

580
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:10,781
Bai Yan,

581
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,022
the rise of the Evil Star

582
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,181
may be a chance bestowed upon Shi Ying

583
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,141
by heaven.

584
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,141
If you're watching from above,

585
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,261
please bless him to rise to fame.

586
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,862
With the Sea Emperor's return
and the rise of the Merfolk,

587
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,342
I can finally obtain

588
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:46,661
the Ring of Houtu.

589
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,422
What's the connection

590
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,101
between the Evil Star
and the Ring of Houtu?

591
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:53,181
In troubled times,
the Houtu will appear.

592
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,261
As long as there is chaos
and calamity in the world,

593
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,382
the Ring of Houtu

594
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,062
will leave the Biluo Sea

595
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,141
and return to Kongsang.

596
00:40:01,462 --> 00:40:03,621
Now that the Evil Star has risen,

597
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:05,301
it's an opportunity.

598
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,701
I just need to push a little

599
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:10,382
and stir up the conflict
between the Merfolks and Kongsang.

600
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:14,661
Chaos in Yunhuang is imminent.

601
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:16,141
Congratulations, Sage.

602
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,942
However, I've received information

603
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:20,181
that the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain

604
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,661
has been investigating your whereabouts.

605
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,261
If you do decide
to make a public appearance,

606
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:25,542
you must be cautious.

607
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,221
This is the descendant

608
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,661
who's most similar to me.

609
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,422
I suspect he has guessed my identity.

610
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:38,141
It could be troublesome
if he keeps pestering me.

611
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:43,342
However, since the Evil Star
has already risen,

612
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,621
his main task is to investigate
the evil force,

613
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:49,301
allowing me to maneuver.

614
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,621
When he finds me again,

615
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:57,542
I'll have my own way of dealing with him.

616
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,181
A group of useless people.

617
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:02,062
A disabled merfolk

618
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:03,741
and a half-dead child,

619
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,741
and you still let them escape.

620
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:06,781
Don't just stay there.

621
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:07,781
Bring them back to me!

622
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,181
If you can't find them,

623
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,062
none of you will live.

624
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:12,342
Yes, Great Consort.

625
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,101
Great Consort, please calm down.

626
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,581
The current priority

627
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:21,982
is for Lord Ke'erke and Princess Zhu Yan

628
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:23,101
to complete their wedding as scheduled.

629
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:25,261
I will carry out the subsequent plans

630
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,141
on the night of the grand wedding.

631
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:29,462
Have the materials for the ritual

632
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:30,982
been prepared?

633
00:41:31,382 --> 00:41:32,581
Great Consort, don't worry.

634
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:35,502
We've recently caught more merfolks.

635
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:36,942
Everything is prepared.

636
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,101
(Has the Sea Emperor
already left Huotu Tribe?)

637
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:58,261
(Why can't I sense)

638
00:41:58,301 --> 00:41:59,062
(his presence at all?)

639
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:04,141
That's strange.

640
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:06,621
There is not a single merfolk
here at all.

641
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:10,221
Excuse me, mister.

642
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,261
When I passed by a few days ago,

643
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:14,181
I saw some merfolks around here.

644
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:15,342
But these several days,

645
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:16,181
why is there none now?

646
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:17,221
How would I know?

647
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,781
Go and ask someone else.

648
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,462
Rest assured.

649
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:25,342
I won't tell others.

650
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,781
A few years ago,
the Old Lord was in poor health.

651
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:31,661
Soldiers of the Huotu Tribe

652
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,942
started hunting merfolks everywhere.

653
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,301
There are not many merfolks here,
to begin with.

654
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,502
I don't know why these two days

655
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:40,261
more soldiers are on the street.

656
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,902
They captured all the merfolks.

657
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:45,502
I heard they're being imprisoned

658
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:46,422
in Guwei City.

659
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:48,822
Why did they catch the merfolks?

660
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:50,141
Where is Guwei City?

661
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,502
I'm just a merchant.

662
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:52,862
How would I know that?

663
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:54,542
I heard it's quite far.

664
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:55,982
You should leave.

665
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:57,581
The soldiers

666
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:59,022
are still catching merfolks.

667
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:00,902
Go now.

668
00:43:05,621 --> 00:43:06,382
Guwei City?

669
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:08,621
Could it be that the Sea Emperor

670
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:09,781
was taken to Guwei City

671
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:10,822
and lost my connection with him?

672
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:13,462
I need to find Guwei City first.

673
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,542
The Evil Star clearly shows

674
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,902
that the Sea Emperor is nearby.

675
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:20,221
But there isn't

676
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,542
even a single merfolk here.

677
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:25,581
I'll go check it out.

678
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:26,701
All right.

679
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:29,822
Excuse me, mister.

680
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:34,902
Thank you.

681
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:38,822
I got something.

682
00:43:39,422 --> 00:43:41,661
They say all the merfolks are locked in

683
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,581
a place called Guwei City.

684
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:43,542
But no one knows

685
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,462
where Guwei City is.

686
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:45,741
That's odd.

687
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:46,542
Who's behind it?

688
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:48,982
There are many merfolks
in the Huotu Tribe.

689
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,101
Only the one with the highest authority

690
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:53,221
can imprison them all.

691
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,701
You mean the Huotu Tribe's
Great Consort?

692
00:43:58,741 --> 00:43:59,502
Let's meet her.

693
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:00,382
Let's go.

694
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:01,422
Wait a moment.

695
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:03,062
Are you going to see her now?

696
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,101
Or else?

697
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:05,502
Have you forgotten

698
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:06,661
that your student

699
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:07,982
is getting married here today?

700
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:11,301
So what?

701
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:12,621
I'm not meeting her.

702
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:15,301
If you're going to steal the bride,

703
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:16,342
I will accompany you to the end.

704
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:17,542
But if you have to take

705
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:18,342
her mother-in-law away

706
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,141
on her big day,

707
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:21,022
don't you think

708
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,422
it's too cruel?

709
00:44:22,942 --> 00:44:24,502
Actually, we can still wait
for a day or two.

710
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:25,462
No.

711
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:26,902
Looking for the Sea Emperor

712
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:27,982
is of utmost importance.

713
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:30,062
To ruin a happy day,

714
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:31,422
you better do it yourself.

715
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:32,822
I'll be looking for some birds

716
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,141
to find out where Guwei City is.

717
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:35,221
See you later.

718
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:44,462
God of Fire above,

719
00:45:44,862 --> 00:45:46,581
