19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,879
You ask me to protect the people.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
But did you see it?

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,480
This lawless world

22
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,319
and these ruthless vile people,

23
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,799
they don't deserve

24
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,479
your mercy and forgiveness.

25
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,919
I'll take revenge.

26
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,000
Shi Ying.

27
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,319
What's wrong with you, Shi Ying?

28
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,919
Get lost!

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,599
This flower...

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,719
(Have I come here before?)

31
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,080
(And this lake,)

32
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,080
(I think I've seen it before.)

33
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,560
(Could I see it in my dream?)

34
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
Lord Chong Ming,

35
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,360
why are you here?

36
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,439
Divine Bird Chong Ming.

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,639
You...

38
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,919
You actually can turn into a human.

39
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,400
I think I've said this before.

40
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,280
(Shi Ying was once moved by this lady.)

41
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,159
(Maybe she can save Shi Ying.)

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,599
Come, follow me.

43
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Where are we going?

44
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,960
Aren't you looking
for my immortal friend?

45
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,719
- He's in there.
- What?

46
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,560
Who are you talking about?

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
They won't let you off.

48
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,919
They won't even let

49
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,080
you rest in peace.

50
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll avenge you.

51
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,560
Quick.

52
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
Stop!

53
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,000
Stop it!

54
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,399
Stop it!

55
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,439
Stop it!

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Bai Yan doesn't deserve it.

57
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,079
She doesn't deserve an tribute.

58
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
Watch out!

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,240
You're finally awake.

60
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,040
Lord Immortal Official,

61
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,120
I always feel

62
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
that I've seen you before.

63
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,240
Stop talking.

64
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,399
Save your breath.

65
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
Don't frown.

66
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,920
You don't look handsome in this way.

67
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,079
It was me who wounded you.

68
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,160
You did hit me hard.

69
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
But it's okay.

70
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,360
My mother said

71
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,839
I'm tough.

72
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,439
I haven't seen my mother for a month.

73
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,800
And I've already missed her.

74
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,240
I think I heard you say

75
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,199
that you can never see

76
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,360
your mother again?

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,839
Lord Immortal Official.

78
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,160
How...

79
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
How do you feel?

80
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,279
I'll be all right.

81
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
If you don't believe it,

82
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,519
promise me this.

83
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,759
When I wake up,

84
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,959
you have to do me a favor.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay?

86
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Okay.

87
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,800
It's a deal.

88
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:41,920
Chong Ming.

89
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,720
Speed up.

90
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,720
(Xileng River, Jiuyi Mountain)

91
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,759
(The power contains the supreme Yang.)

92
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,240
(As the glacier
contains the supreme Yin.)

93
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,919
(When Yin and Yang meet,)

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
(the Crystal Flower appears.)

95
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,279
You must kill her.

96
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,759
Otherwise,

97
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,120
she'll become

98
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,759
the person who kills you.

99
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,720
Crystal Flower.

100
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,919
Isn't that Crystal Flower?

101
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,879
When Yin and Yang meet,
the Crystal Flower appears.

102
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,519
The prophecy has come true.

103
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
Stop, Shi Ying.

104
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,960
This lady is your predestined doom.

105
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,519
It's not her.

106
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
You and High Priest of Grand Preceptor
have read the Elixir Book.

107
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,799
Her birthdate is not
the date stated in the prophecy.

108
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,639
I guess it's just

109
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,000
the abnormal phenomenon
caused by the conflict

110
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,759
between my power
and that of Crimson Clan.

111
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,320
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

112
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,879
If you can't do it,

113
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,320
I'll do it for you.

114
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,600
What's wrong with you?

115
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
You can't even take this.

116
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
Did you transfer
all your spiritual power to her?

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
It's still uncertain whether she is

118
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
my predestined doom.

119
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,200
But she saved

120
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,279
our lives just now.

121
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,519
This is certain.

122
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,039
If we kill her now,

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,240
it's incompatible with morality.

124
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,519
I'm a bird,

125
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,600
not a human.

126
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,559
I don't care

127
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,480
if it's incompatible with morality.

128
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,039
An ungrateful bad deed like this,

129
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
just leave it to me.

130
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,480
If there's any retribution,

131
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,759
I'll take full responsibility for it.

132
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,320
You'll kill her

133
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,639
over my dead body.

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,159
If she's really your predestined doom,

135
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,159
she'll also kill you in future

136
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,399
even though she's saved you today.

137
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,960
I've lived for thousands of years.

138
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
An indecisive person

139
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,519
like you

140
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,120
normally doesn't end up well.

141
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,759
Decisive?

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,519
If you were

143
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,840
a decisive bird,

144
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,360
you wouldn't have clung

145
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,000
to an unfortunate immortal official
like me.

146
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,320
You're infuriating me that it causes

147
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,320
my wrinkle to sprout up.

148
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
(Were you the only person)

149
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,559
(who did the one thing)

150
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,879
(for me)

151
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,120
(when I was accused)

152
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,159
(and cast aside by the nation?)

153
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,799
Lord Immortal Official,

154
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,960
what is this place?

155
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,320
Why am I soaking wet?

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,679
You're a mortal.

157
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,679
You can't withstand the pure Yang Qi.

158
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,039
I bring you here

159
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,159
is to use the coldest water

160
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
of Xileng River as a media

161
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,919
and transfer the spiritual power to you.

162
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,240
In order to rescue me,

163
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,200
you transfer your spiritual power to me?

164
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,279
Then, will this

165
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,759
hurt you?

166
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:47,759
It's not a big deal.

167
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,320
Besides,

168
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,279
this is my fault.

169
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,120
Never mind, it's all right.

170
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,080
It's over.

171
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,320
Don't bring that up again.

172
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,000
Lord Immortal Official,

173
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,879
you're so amazing.

174
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,559
You still can cast a spell
even after transferring

175
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,960
your spiritual power to me.

176
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,039
It feels like

177
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
I'm full of energy now.

178
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Even more energetic

179
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,559
than I used to be.

180
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,080
It's fascinating.

181
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,039
I can't believe I can jump this far.

182
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,440
Lord Chong Ming,

183
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,120
today really is a great day.

184
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,159
I saw you

185
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,720
turn into a human for the first time.

186
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,879
And I met

187
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,240
your immortal friend in a fight.

188
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,679
(By the way,)

189
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,840
(I was dying just now.)

190
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,919
(This Immortal Official)

191
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,320
(can easily cure me.)

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
(He's got)

193
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
(the power to bring someone)

194
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,440
(back to life.)

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
(He's the hidden master)

196
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
(I'm looking for.)

197
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Lord Chong Ming,

198
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,240
are...

199
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,879
Are you mad?

200
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,759
Aren't

201
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,559
we friends?

202
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
I guess it's because we've been
out here for too long.

203
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,879
Chong Ming is getting impatient.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Since your wound has been healed,

205
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,799
we've got to go.

206
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,200
Lord Immortal Official,

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
have you recovered?

208
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
I mean here.

209
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,559
Chong Ming,

210
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,519
let's go.

211
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,480
We're going to fly back.

212
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,240
That's great.

213
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
I didn't get

214
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,519
to see the view on my way here.

215
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,399
I must feast

216
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,960
my eyes on it on my way back.

217
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Just that

218
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
where would you like to sit later?

219
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
As you're so tall,

220
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,840
if you sit in front of me,

221
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,519
you'll surely block my view.

222
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,320
It doesn't seem right

223
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,600
to ask you to sit behind me.

224
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait for me.

225
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,720
(Immortal Official is feeling depressed)

226
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,720
(but he couldn't vent out the emotions.)

227
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,919
(I feel so bad for him.)

228
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,039
Help.

229
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's take a detour.

230
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Where are we?

231
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,200
This is my deceased mother's cenotaph.

232
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,839
Lord,

233
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,240
can I pay respect to her?

234
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
You were deranged
because of his deceased mother.

235
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,680
And I happened to meet you at that time.

236
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,680
It was my pleasure
to solve your problems.

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,519
That was how I gained

238
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
your precious spiritual power in return.

239
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,160
Now that we have landed here.

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,440
I guess it must be

241
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,319
a divine sense of fate
arranged by your mother.

242
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,160
(Is this really)

243
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,119
(predestined?)

244
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,079
(Is she)

245
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,480
(that person?)

246
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,960
(Madam and I had never met
each other before.)

247
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,480
(We're two worlds apart.)

248
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,799
(But fate brought me over.)

249
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,319
(So I came to pay my respect.)

250
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,079
Wait.

251
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,519
Let me thank you on my mother's behalf.

252
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:31,960
Lord,

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,839
you're a hidden master

254
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,839
who possesses great power.

255
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,119
I'm like a nobody

256
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,599
in front of you.

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,319
I'm not qualified to enlighten you.

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
Just that I'd like to speak

259
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,880
my mind.

260
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,319
I don't know how your mother died.

261
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,200
But you sounded angry just now,

262
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,480
and I saw no epitaph on the tombstone.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,039
I think there must be
some sort of grievances.

264
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,200
You were deranged

265
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,559
because of this, wasn't you?

266
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,039
But she has passed away.

267
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,720
As a parent,
she must be hoping that her kid

268
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,799
could stay safe and go on living.

269
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,480
I appreciate the thought.

270
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,839
But you're still young

271
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,599
and you're naive.

272
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,920
There are many things

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
that you can't understand.

274
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,720
You got me wrong, Lord.

275
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
I became like this

276
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,839
because I didn't want

277
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,079
to let Mother down

278
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,920
and let the bad guys have their ways.

279
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,440
The principal concubine of Father
didn't have kids.

280
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,039
She always perceived me as an eyesore,

281
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,000
and a threat.

282
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,200
All she thought about was

283
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,640
to get rid of me.

284
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,799
In order to protect me,

285
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,519
Mother had suffered

286
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,920
a lot.

287
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,640
There was one time
when it was my birthday.

288
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
An abnormal phenomenon happened.

289
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,519
It actually snowed heavily that day.

290
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,599
I had never seen snow before.

291
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,920
So I was surprised and excited.

292
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,200
So I secretly built a snowman.

293
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,480
But the concubine accused me

294
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,920
of making a puppet to hurt her.

295
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,839
Then, Mother kneeled before her

296
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,279
and ate the snowman

297
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,440
bite by bite.

298
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,039
What happened then?

299
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
After that incident,

300
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,599
Mother became violently ill.

301
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,799
I swore to avenge her.

302
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,240
Yet, she had a sudden heart attack.

303
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,559
Before she passed out,

304
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,119
she said something to me.

305
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,640
I'll never forget about it.

306
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,799
She said,

307
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,519
Yan'er,

308
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,119
I didn't protect you

309
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,839
to make you live like a coward

310
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,680
but to want you

311
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,799
to live in a dignified manner.

312
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,039
If you waste your life

313
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,519
and go astray

314
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,000
out of pique,

315
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,599
that's what will sadden me the most.

316
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,079
And that's what those bullies

317
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,519
most want to see.

318
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,480
(Mother,)

319
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,039
(I'd like to grow up fast)

320
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,160
to protect you.

321
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,200
You can't just protect

322
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,920
your mother.

323
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,960
You have to become

324
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,400
a man with honor.

325
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,000
To protect the people in Kongsang.

326
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,359
Because of Mother's teachings,

327
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,839
I get to free myself
from complicated thoughts

328
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,319
and have a healthy and happy life.

329
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,839
Instead, that concubine

330
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,799
ended up getting ill

331
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,799
when I was nine

332
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,400
as she was scheming and jealous.

333
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,119
So Lord,

334
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,480
don't you think

335
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,799
I've offered you

336
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,319
a heartfelt word of advice just now?

337
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,400
But there's one thing
I can't understand.

338
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,640
Your birthday is in May,

339
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,640
it's Summer time.

340
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,000
How could you build a snowman
during that time?

341
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,839
How did you know

342
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,279
when my birthday is?

343
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,200
When I was at the Pavilion of Books,

344
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:43,839
I saw this

345
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,279
Saintess Elixir Book
of the Grand Ceremony of Worship.

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,599
This is not the point.

347
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,880
Answer my question.

348
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,640
Indeed, I was born

349
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,319
on the coldest winter day.

350
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,359
I was brought to the residence
when I was two.

351
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,319
Father worried
the principal concubine would think

352
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,519
that the person who was born
on the darkest day would bring bad luck.

353
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,880
So he told the public

354
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,599
that I was born in May.

355
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,960
Come here.

356
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,920
Her birthday is on the darkest day.

357
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,400
Yet, she was born
at the brightest crimson place.

358
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,519
We've got it right this time.

359
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,319
She is definitely

360
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,440
your predestined doom.

361
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,200
Shi Ying,

362
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
you really should do it this time.

363
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Lord,

364
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,319
let me
light the Changming Grass for you.

365
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,640
Actually, it's been five years ago

366
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,160
since I used a magic spell to light

367
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,319
the fire of commemoration.

368
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,599
Five years ago?

369
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,680
Who did you pay homage to?

370
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,079
You're an outsider.

371
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,200
I guess I can tell you that.

372
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,119
The person I paid homage to was

373
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,400
a mere acquaintance of mine.

374
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,839
Then,

375
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,480
why did you pay homage to him?

376
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,960
Everyone said

377
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,720
he was an evil who killed people.

378
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
But I'm the only one
who knows it isn't true.

379
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,200
He made me learn a magic spell

380
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,480
and protect the country.

381
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,079
How could a person like this be an evil?

382
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,440
You were mere acquaintances.

383
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,640
But you had faith in him

384
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
and paid homage to him

385
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,039
when everyone spat on him.

386
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,440
If he knew it,

387
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

388
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,680
I think he should know that.

389
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,359
That day, my tears

390
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,519
dropped into the fire.

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,119
That Snowy Rosa

392
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,640
suddenly turned into a flame

393
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,759
and hit me between my eyebrows.

394
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,279
But I didn't

395
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,200
get hurt.

396
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,279
I guess this was the response
of his spirit of heaven

397
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,519
to me.

398
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,359
The magic spell of Crimson Clan
represents Yang.

399
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,519
The tear of a little girl
represents Yin.

400
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,599
The prophecy of the High Priest

401
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,640
is fulfilled.

402
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,839
Do it.

403
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,640
(The aggregation of those coincidences)

404
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,440
(has become your doom.)

405
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,160
(If you meet this girl)

406
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,359
(before you're 18,)

407
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,960
(you'll die in her hands for sure.)

408
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,680
(You must kill her.)

409
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,519
Lord,

410
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,359
why do you look at me like this?

411
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
I must kill her this time.

412
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,720
You'll kill her over my dead body.

413
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,960
What's the matter?

414
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,119
Lord.

415
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,599
Lord, what is this?

416
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,440
There is always strange wind
in the mountain.

417
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,519
People will be swept away by it.

418
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,559
No wonder.

419
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,200
I felt the wind just now.

420
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:52,839
Chong Ming,

421
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,039
what's wrong with you?

422
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,960
(Ying,)

423
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,000
(I was afraid that I might hurt you)

424
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,759
(so I withdrew my attack.)

425
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,440
(Yet, you used the spiritual power
you've left)

426
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,640
(to bind me.)

427
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
(I'm really furious.)

428
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,359
Chong Ming didn't get to avoid

429
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,039
that strange wind

430
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,279
and caught a cold.

431
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,400
He can't open his mouth now.

432
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,079
He caught a cold so soon?

433
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,839
It was indeed a strange wind.

434
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
(Have you ever seen a strange person
who's so good-looking?)

435
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,000
(You're the strange one.)

436
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,200
(Your entire family is strange.)

437
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,240
Chong Ming,

438
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,839
are you sure you're all right?

439
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,720
I've eliminated
the cold pathogen for him.

440
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,160
Only then, he's able to send you back.

441
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,119
Chong Ming,

442
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,720
you must send the princess

443
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
back to the mountain safely.

444
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,400
We can't run

445
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,599
the risk of any accidents this time.

446
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,720
Lord Immortal Official,

447
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,039
it was me

448
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,000
who didn't sit tight.

449
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't blame it on Lord Chong Ming.

450
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,079
Then, you've got to sit tight this time.

451
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,519
What are you trying to do?

452
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,440
This gesture,

453
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,680
why does it look so familiar?

454
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,640
I think I've been
to the Emperor Valley before.

455
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,759
But why can't

456
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,920
I recall it?

457
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,160
I've met you before,

458
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,119
don't I?

459
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,640
You're trying to erase my memory,

460
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,799
aren't you?

461
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,720
Yes.

462
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,519
Because I don't want anyone

463
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,799
to know about my existence.

464
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,400
And I don't want anyone to know

465
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,440
that I live here.

466
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,880
Are you going to do
the same thing this time?

467
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,799
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,920
Don't do this.

469
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,960
We've become friends.

470
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,839
Don't...

471
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,759
Lord,

472
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:56,720
did you already erase

473
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
my memory?

474
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,119
Or it'll only take effect after a while?

475
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
Promise me.

476
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,839
When I wake up,

477
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,319
you have to do me a favor.

478
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,240
(I've promised her a thing.)

479
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
(But I haven't fulfilled it.)

480
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,279
(So I can't erase)

481
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,680
(her memory about this.)

482
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,839
(This is the rule of using a magic spell.)

483
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,519
Lord Immortal Official,

484
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,519
I beg of you.

485
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Don't erase my memory.

486
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,720
I swear

487
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,559
I won't tell anyone

488
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,640
that I've been here.

489
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,440
We once had a deal.

490
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,799
When you're healed and wake up,

491
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,519
I've got to do you a favor.

492
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,119
What do you want me to do?

493
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,000
I want...

494
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,079
(It's indeed inappropriate)

495
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,720
(to impudently ask)

496
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,079
(to be his apprentice)

497
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,519
(as he just gets over the pain)

498
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,240
(of losing his mother.)

499
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,880
The clock struck five in the morning.

500
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Lord Immortal Official,

501
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,079
I must go back now.

502
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,680
Or I'll get caught by my father.

503
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,359
As for

504
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,200
my request,

505
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,839
let's talk about it next time.

506
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,759
Don't worry.

507
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,960
I won't tell anyone

508
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,839
that I came by.

509
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,720
Never.

510
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay, I trust you.

511
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,440
But,

512
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,599
the Emperor Valley is
the forbidden spot of Jiuyi Mountain.

513
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,119
The trespassers
will be sentenced to death.

514
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,160
Don't ever come here again.

515
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,319
Chong Ming,

516
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,079
I'm counting on you.

517
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,799
I didn't mean to give you
the flower that day.

518
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,680
Yet, you were so kind
to come pay homage to me.

519
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,240
(It was an act of kindness)

520
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,200
(to send me off.)

521
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,079
(Yet, you became the prophecy)

522
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,119
(that will hold me back.)

523
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,160
(It was you
who trespassed the Emperor Valley)

524
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,519
(and activated the prophecy.)

525
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,160
(It was also you who helped me
overcome my fear.)

526
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,880
(Our fates are entangled
with each other.)

527
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,079
(Though I'll die)

528
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,480
(because of you in future,)

529
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
(I'm still the one)

530
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,599
(who's indebted to you.)

531
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,200
What is this?

532
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,640
I'll tell you

533
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,839
if you eat it.

534
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
I pushed that girl

535
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
off the cliff

536
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,440
from the top of Jiuyi Mountain.

537
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,200
I used her seven spirits and three souls

538
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,079
to make

539
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,319
this highly toxic fruit,

540
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,400
named Soul-Breaking Fruit.

541
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,440
I can guarantee that you'll die

542
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,799
right after you eat it.

543
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
It's better than suffering

544
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,680
the heart-piercing pain
a few years later.

545
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,880
If her soul was scattered,

546
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,200
then who'd pierce my heart

547
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,480
a few years later?

548
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,960
You knew that she was

549
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,920
your predestined doom.

550
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,240
Why did you let her go

551
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,680
and seal my power?

552
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
Luckily,
my flying ability isn't reduced.

553
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,680
It took me a day

554
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,119
to fly to that coldest land

555
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,440
to get the Crimson fruit
to sustain your spiritual power.

556
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,240
Otherwise,

557
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,319
you couldn't have hidden it

558
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,359
from the High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

559
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,039
You asked me to protect the people.

560
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,839
But did you see it?

561
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,960
This lawless world

562
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,200
and these ruthless vile people,

563
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,799
they don't deserve

564
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,079
your mercy and forgiveness.

565
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll take revenge.

566
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,279
What do you think

567
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,680
I should do?

568
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,519
Kill her?

569
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,839
Kill a woman who risked her life

570
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,839
to pay homage to me back then

571
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,200
and rescued me from going down

572
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,559
an ominous path?

573
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,119
(Wait until you've mastered
the magic spell,)

574
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,079
(you can use it to protect the people.)

575
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
(That's your mother's wish.)

576
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,599
The prophecy has yet to be sanded.

577
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,519
Now, morality comes first.

578
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,519
Sorry, I can't do it.

579
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,720
But don't worry, Chong Ming.

580
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,599
I'll cherish

581
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
my life.

582
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because I want to master

583
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,680
my magic power sooner

584
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,960
and use it to protect

585
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,480
the people like my mother said.

586
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,920
What about her memory?

587
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Why didn't you erase it?

588
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,000
That's because

589
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,559
I promised to grant her a wish.

590
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,000
So I can't cast a spell on her.

591
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,400
Actually,

592
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,720
she's just a teenager.

593
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,200
As long as I refuse to see her,

594
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,640
she'll forget

595
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,279
about me

596
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,480
in a couple of days.

597
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,359
The problem is
whether she can forget it.

598
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,640
It's already been five years.

599
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,559
She didn't forget

600
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,680
about Prince Shi Ying.

601
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,599
Everyone said he was

602
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
an evil who killed people.

603
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,839
But I'm the only one
who knows it isn't true.

604
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,880
He made me learn a magic spell

605
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,200
and protect the country.

606
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,960
How could he be an evil?

607
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,519
It's been five years.

608
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,960
She still remembers me.

609
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,640
It's indeed rare.

610
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,160
I admit

611
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,799
that I'm grateful to her.

612
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,839
But I've got it all figured out.

613
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,759
Whether she comes or not,

614
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,119
I won't see her again.

615
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,640
That'd be great.

616
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,960
But I think

617
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,839
you should also erase her memory.

618
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,000
Or the High Priest of Grand Preceptor
will notice it.

619
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,319
He won't let her go.

620
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,559
This is for her own good.

621
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
As for her wish,

622
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,079
it's easy to be fulfilled.

623
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,240
I know what she wants.

624
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,559
You know it?

625
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,359
Of course.

626
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,920
She has praised me

627
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,559
for my feather several times.

628
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,599
What she wants is

629
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,759
my feather for sure.

630
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,759
This little girl is

631
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,240
a bit chatty

632
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,079
but she has good taste.

633
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,599
Chong Ming's feather?

634
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,159
Chong Ming actually gave me

635
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,199
his feather.

636
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,400
I wonder

637
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,440
when he gave it to me.

638
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,639
I guess it was Lord Immortal Official

639
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
who asked him to give me that.

640
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,639
You're awake, Young Lady.

641
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,679
What is this?

642
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,800
It's as white as snow,

643
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,400
as warm as velvet.

644
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,000
It's water and fire proof.

645
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
It can cast the poison away.

646
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,079
Besides the feather
of Divine Bird Chong Ming,

647
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,800
what else could be

648
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,559
this incredible in the world?

649
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,920
Young Lady, I can't believe you got

650
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,000
the feather of the Divine Bird.

651
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,760
As far as I know,

652
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,599
there are only two to three pieces

653
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
in the imperial tribute.

654
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,440
I got it from a friend of mine.

655
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:37,920
Well,

656
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:38,719
as they gave me

657
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,079
such an amazing gift,

658
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,559
did it mean they also want

659
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,639
to be my friends?

660
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,960
Who are they?

661
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,360
I can't tell you that.

662
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
But I think

663
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,719
that person could teach me

664
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,960
the power which can bring
people back to life.

665
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,599
You can't tell anyone this.

666
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,480
Also,

667
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,039
you're not allowed to tell anyone
that Chong Ming

668
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,159
has given me his feather.

669
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,280
Is there any progression
in the magic spell

670
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,360
that you want to learn?

671
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,119
Could the spell really gather
the primordial spirit

672
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,079
of the Prince Shi Ying?

673
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
Well,

674
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,199
I don't know that either.

675
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,719
But,

676
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,679
I'll try my best whenever there is

677
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,079
a glimpse of hope.

678
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,199
I'd like to meet him too.

679
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,360
Well,

680
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,840
I wish for you to get

681
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,519
what you want sooner.

682
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,920
By the way, Yufei,

683
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,599
go get me paper and a pen.

684
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,360
I'd like to write Yuan a letter.

685
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,440
To ask him to prepare
a marvelous gift for me.

686
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,880
It's a return gift
and it's also a gift for my master.

687
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,960
It must be very special.

688
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,079
Yes, Young Lady.

689
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Princess.

690
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Princess Xueying is back.

691
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,119
Xueying,

692
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,719
did you cry just now?

693
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,960
What's wrong?

694
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,519
Granny sent someone over

695
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,039
to ask us to go to Star Gazing Plaza.

696
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,360
She said she was going to determine
the candidate for the Star Gazer.

697
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,559
It's getting on my nerves.

698
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,960
Forget it.

699
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm such a fool.

700
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,440
Just forget about the Star Gazer.

701
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,199
Don't say that.

702
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,960
Give me a second.

703
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,239
Young Lady,

704
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,239
he gave you this as a gift.

705
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,519
If you give it to another person,

706
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,880
he'll feel sad if he knows it.

707
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,400
Anyway,

708
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,960
Xueying is more important.

709
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Look, Xueying.

710
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
This is the feather of Divine Bird Chong Ming.

711
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,480
If you decorate

712
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,039
your dress with it,

713
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,760
none of those rarities

714
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,440
could be a match for it.

715
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,760
Here.

716
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,480
It's extremely hard to obtain

717
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,519
the legendary feather of Chong Ming.

718
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,320
Yan, how did you get it?

719
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't ask.

720
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:05,719
Just take it.

721
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,320
No, I can't.

722
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,960
This is too much.

723
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
I won't accept this even if I have

724
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,079
to give up on being the Star Gazer.

725
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,360
Xueying,

726
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,719
Star-gazing Ceremony is held
once every decade.

727
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,119
It's an once-in-a-lifetime chance to take

728
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,840
the position as the Star Gazer.

729
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,199
Xueying,

730
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,360
do you want
your mother's spirit in heaven

731
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,880
to feel sad for you?

732
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,000
This is valuable

733
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,639
but it's a mere worldly possession.

734
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,239
It'll be fine

735
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,840
as long as you promise not
to tell anyone

736
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,960
that I give you

737
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,320
this feather.

738
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,840
Yan,

739
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,280
thank you.

740
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,079
I won't

741
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
let you guys down.

742
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,440
I trust you.

743
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,159
Lords and Princesses,

744
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,199
as Prince Shi Yu just arrived
at Jiuyi Mountain,

745
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,159
he was tired after his journey.

746
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Now, he's not acclimated
to the environment

747
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,360
and falls ill.

748
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,679
He has canceled
today's welcoming ceremony.

749
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,159
Half-Spring Mushroom.

750
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Ruta Rosea.

751
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,199
Dragon Buddha.

752
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,920
Cangshan Perfume.

753
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,400
All of them are the herbs
that taste sweet,

754
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,920
they can nourish the body
and calm the mind.

755
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,119
Does Father prepare these

756
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,159
for the important guest

757
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,519
in the mountain?

758
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,920
I bought

759
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,400
these valuable herbs at a high price

760
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,639
from the divine servant
in the mountain.

761
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,679
You understand what I want

762
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,519
as soon as you smell the herbs.

763
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,000
You are indeed smart.

764
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,360
Xueying,

765
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,880
you should learn from your sister.

766
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,679
Think about it
when something happens.

767
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,639
Don't forget

768
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,880
about your duty as White Clan.

769
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,679
Yes.

770
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:55,880
Xuelu,

771
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,880
I'll need you to send

772
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,519
the herbs to His Highness.

773
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,679
You must seize this chance.

774
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:05,960
Yes.

775
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,559
Do you know
why Father puts me in charge?

776
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,960
Because only my tricks

777
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
can handle Prince Shi Yu.

778
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,320
To make him obey us.

779
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,840
To stabilize

780
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,199
our top position
among the Six Clans.

781
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,920
Now, you should know

782
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,079
who will take the position

783
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,920
as the Star Gazer.

784
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Ying.

785
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,039
Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty.

786
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,199
You don't look good.

787
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,519
Have you reached a plateau

788
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,960
in your training lately?

789
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,000
I've got
some distracting thoughts lately.

790
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,079
It indeed slows down my training.

791
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,800
(Ying should've been deranged)

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,159
(because of my trap.)

793
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,639
(He can only make up his mind)

794
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,039
(to take revenge
after experiencing this hardship.)

795
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,719
(How could he)

796
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,440
(look so calm?)

797
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,639
(Was there anyone in the mountain)

798
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,360
(who helped him get through this?)

799
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,679
I just went

800
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,920
to worship your mother.
