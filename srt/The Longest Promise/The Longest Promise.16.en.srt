19
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:01,278
This is it.

20
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,038
You actually...

21
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:07,558
You actually chose this?

22
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:10,278
That's right.

23
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,237
Master, please name it.

24
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:20,118
Master,

25
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:23,558
is there anything wrong with it?

26
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:30,118
Your Supreme Majesty,

27
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:31,998
this is the artifact I've chosen.

28
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:33,238
Ying,

29
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:35,757
you cannot wield this artifact.

30
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:37,037
You should put it back

31
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:38,238
and choose another one.

32
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,278
First, it cannot be used to attack.

33
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:43,518
Second, it cannot be used to defend.

34
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:44,917
Its strength

35
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,678
is that it can share damage
with another person.

36
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:48,358
However,

37
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,998
the other party must be willing,

38
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:53,558
and your spiritual power
must be connected to the other party.

39
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,197
However, if you wish to do so,

40
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,518
you need to risk your life

41
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,157
and transfer
half of your spiritual power

42
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:00,717
to the other party.

43
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,358
Tell me.

44
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,958
Where would you find
such a person in the world?

45
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,757
So that's the case.

46
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,078
Master, you risked your life

47
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,037
to save me once.

48
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:16,238
You even transferred
your spiritual powers to me.

49
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,558
This artifact fits me perfectly.

50
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,798
I'm willing to take this artifact.

51
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,437
Master, please name it.

52
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,157
Master,

53
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:34,157
are you letting me name it?

54
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,197
If so, please pardon me.

55
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,197
I'll name it

56
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:42,477
Gongshang.

57
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:43,717
What do you think about the name?

58
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,838
Since the person who uses this artifact

59
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,278
need to live and die together
with the other party,

60
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:50,877
isn't it just like the shining Gong
and Shang stars

61
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,437
that keep the dark night

62
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,998
and the earth company?

63
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:58,437
Its shining luster

64
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,238
is just like the description
of Gong and Shang stars

65
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,197
in the ancient manual.

66
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,958
They rely on each other

67
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:07,597
and guard each other

68
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,317
for all eternity.

69
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,278
Its wielder will surely be safe.

70
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:13,998
Master,

71
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,358
what do you think about the name?

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
(Gong Shang)

73
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:24,798
So, Master, you chose

74
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,718
the same artifact as me back then.

75
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:29,038
You even gave it the same name.

76
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:30,598
Seems like this artifact

77
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:31,757
is the fate that ties me

78
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:33,197
to you, Master.

79
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:35,598
I will take this artifact.

80
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:40,558
You should think twice.

81
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:44,837
Master, are you embarrassed

82
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:45,757
because

83
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,877
an uneducated individual like me
actually

84
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:50,358
came up with the same name as you?

85
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,397
That's not what I mean.

86
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:54,358
Don't tell me you've started

87
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:55,517
disliking this name

88
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:56,998
after such a long time?

89
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,397
That's not what I mean.

90
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,558
Since you don't dislike its name

91
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,358
or me,

92
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,077
could it be...

93
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:09,957
Could it be that you don't want to admit

94
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:11,798
that your heart and my heart
are interconnected?

95
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:12,798
Enough.

96
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,358
I will go on a retreat soon.

97
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,397
I don't know how long it'll last.

98
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,038
You should train by yourself.

99
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,118
Do not interrupt me again.

100
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,038
Master,

101
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,317
I understand.

102
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,238
As the water flows from the mountain,

103
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:27,918
Gong and Shang will be together
for an eternity.

104
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:31,358
From now on,

105
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,478
you will be my artifact.

106
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,877
From today onward,

107
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:38,598
Priest of Grand Preceptor
will go through a crucial moment

108
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:41,197
before gaining access to the real state.

109
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:42,798
I've already

110
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:45,118
set up nets above and snares below.

111
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:46,397
We just need to wait

112
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,918
for those wicked individuals
to fall into them.

113
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,038
If Ying could gain access

114
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:53,197
to the real state this time,

115
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,678
he would be ready

116
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:57,558
for his return to Jialan.

117
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,598
He just needs
to give us the nod by then.

118
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:02,038
In Kongsang,

119
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:03,837
Emperor Xingzun was the only person
to gain access to the real state

120
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,798
7,000 years ago.

121
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:06,757
I never expect

122
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,358
Priest of Grand Preceptor to be strong
enough to gain access to the real state

123
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:09,998
at such a young age.

124
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:11,637
He's truly impressive.

125
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:13,397
Remember.

126
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:16,918
His attempt to gain access
to the real state

127
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:18,637
is a secret.

128
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,397
You mustn't tell anyone else.

129
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:22,197
Yes, sir.

130
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,277
The sage said

131
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,437
Shi Ying will go on a retreat and
try to gain access to the real state.

132
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:29,598
By then, he will be at his weakest.

133
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:31,077
I think

134
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,238
it's time for us to act.

135
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,757
That's great news.

136
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,678
If so, Brother, why didn't you

137
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:39,718
send the elites of the Azure Clan

138
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:40,798
to Jiuyi Mountain?

139
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:42,918
Don't worry.

140
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,158
I already started stationing

141
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,277
my troops right after
receiving the news.

142
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:47,678
I will never let

143
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,757
High Priest of Grand Preceptor
get his way.

144
00:06:59,277 --> 00:06:59,918
Your Highness,

145
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,238
the Empress of the Crimson Clan
has come to visit you.

146
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:03,957
Mother is here?

147
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:06,277
Mother!

148
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:07,877
Mother!

149
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,197
I heard you.

150
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:14,798
Seems like my daughter

151
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,238
has completely forgotten about me.

152
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:18,998
That's not true.

153
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:22,718
Yan'er.

154
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:23,798
Just now,

155
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,478
I've met up with
High Priest of Grand Preceptor.

156
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:27,637
He was full of praise for you.

157
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,877
Now that you've finished your training,

158
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:31,718
you can find a chance

159
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:33,197
to leave the mountain now.

160
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,158
Yan'er, you're so capable now.

161
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,837
I'm sure you can find a great husband
in the future.

162
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,038
I won't listen to you!

163
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,598
I don't want to get married!

164
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,277
I will never get married!

165
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:45,437
Silly girl.

166
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,077
You don't want to get married?

167
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,077
Don't tell me you want

168
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:49,718
to spend the rest of your life
in Jiuyi Mountain

169
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,038
and learn magic techniques
from the priest?

170
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:53,517
What's wrong with that?

171
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,038
I want to follow Master all my life

172
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:57,077
and protect him.

173
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,077
I'll be a powerful

174
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,077
female immortal official.

175
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:01,598
Nonsense.

176
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,558
Your master is a recluse.

177
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:06,598
Even if you wish to follow him
for the rest of your life,

178
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,118
he won't accept it.

179
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:11,197
Your Highness.

180
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:12,637
Yuan.

181
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:14,598
Her Highness

182
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:15,757
has brought you

183
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,077
Yanfeng Restaurant's newest snacks.

184
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,077
Try them.

185
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,197
They're delicious.

186
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,517
Yan'er, eat up.

187
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:37,877
Slow down.

188
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:38,958
By the way,

189
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:39,998
this place is so far away.

190
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:41,637
How did you guys manage
to bring them here?

191
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,438
Won't they spoil on the way here?

192
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,557
Keeper Yuan suggested us

193
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:47,838
to bring them with us.

194
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,358
You were lucky too.

195
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,037
On our way here,

196
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,358
we found ice in time

197
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:54,397
for us to change them.

198
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:56,757
I heard

199
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,318
that powerful merfolks
can manipulate water

200
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,238
and turn water into ice.

201
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,598
Yuan,

202
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,277
I want to learn that technique too.

203
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,517
This way, I can teach you
that technique.

204
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:07,637
After that, you can bring

205
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,277
all the food in Yanfeng Restaurant

206
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:10,838
to me.

207
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,838
Your Highness must be craving them.

208
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:13,718
No.

209
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,598
I want Master to try them.

210
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,438
What are these?

211
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:21,998
These are gifts

212
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,397
for Priest of Grand Preceptor.

213
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:25,557
Keeper Yuan prepared them
especially for him.

214
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:28,838
They look so beautiful.

215
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:30,877
The weather is getting colder lately.

216
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:31,877
Master

217
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,557
could use this coat.

218
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:34,598
Let's hope

219
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:35,877
that your master will like it.

220
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:37,478
Don't worry.

221
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:38,877
If I like something,

222
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,598
Master will like it too.

223
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,118
(It sounds like Yan'er is pretty close)

224
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,318
(to her master.)

225
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:47,037
It's a shame

226
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,557
that Master has gone on a retreat.

227
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,118
It's already been a few days.

228
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:54,397
I was wondering why the security
here was so tight.

229
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,277
So, it's because of this.

230
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,598
Why don't I deliver this

231
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,277
to Master now?

232
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:02,238
It's been some days

233
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:03,677
since I saw Master anyway.

234
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:08,397
Your Highness.

235
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:10,958
Yuan,

236
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:12,358
you're following me.

237
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:13,478
Do you wish

238
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:14,557
to see Master too?

239
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:16,598
It's a pity that no outsiders
are allowed

240
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,037
in The Emperor Valley.

241
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:21,198
I'm saying

242
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:23,238
that there might be dust on the coat

243
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:24,358
after we traveled all the way here.

244
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:25,478
Let me pat them off.

245
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,037
There isn't any dust.

246
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,238
I'll make a move now.

247
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:32,757
Your Highness...

248
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:49,998
Why isn't there a single guard

249
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:51,318
outside of

250
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,118
Master's retreat?

251
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:53,958
Even Chong Ming isn't around.

252
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:45,157
Who would've expected Master

253
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,637
to suffer such pain

254
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,397
at such a young age?

255
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:52,318
Master,

256
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:53,757
today,

257
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:55,557
my mother came to Jiuyi Mountain
to visit me.

258
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:59,078
Initially, I was happy.

259
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:00,917
But she actually came here

260
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,358
to persuade me to find a husband.

261
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,318
I don't want to get married.

262
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,397
Master, I don't want to leave your side.

263
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,677
Once, my biggest wish

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,757
was to save His Highness.

265
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:16,718
But now,

266
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:18,797
I can no longer

267
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,078
realize that wish.

268
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:26,438
If so, my biggest wish

269
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,517
is to stay by your side, Master.

270
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:31,637
It's because

271
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:33,517
you're the only person who encouraged

272
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:34,637
a girl like to learn magic techniques

273
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,037
besides

274
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:39,118
His Highness.

275
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:39,958
Luckily, Master was meditating.

276
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,517
I think he didn't hear

277
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:44,238
what I said

278
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,397
and what I did

279
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:48,998
just now.

280
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:03,198
Master is so good-looking.

281
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,557
The immortal stance

282
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,318
cannot describe anything.

283
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,358
I killed someone!

284
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:54,358
Calm down.

285
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:55,917
You killed someone

286
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,598
to protect me.

287
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,517
But Master, I thought
you were meditating?

288
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,598
How could you leave that state?

289
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,517
It doesn't matter.

290
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,718
What's going on?

291
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:09,078
Your Supreme Majesty.

292
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,478
Why did you leave your meditation?

293
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,877
And, what are you doing here?

294
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:16,157
Your Supreme Majesty,

295
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,757
Zhu Yan is here to protect me.

296
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:18,838
Protect you?

297
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:20,557
You don't need her protection at all.

298
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,318
This is pointless.

299
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,438
I deliberately left you unguarded

300
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:30,838
and cast the Blood Curse spell

301
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,598
to lure them into the trap.

302
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,037
If they dare to approach you,

303
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:37,517
the Blood Curse will trigger.

304
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:38,958
By then, I will lead my men here

305
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:39,838
and capture all of them.

306
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:40,877
But you?

307
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,037
You barged in recklessly

308
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,037
and ruined my plan.

309
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:50,718
And you!

310
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,557
In order to save her,

311
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,358
you were willing to sacrifice

312
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:57,078
your chance to enter the real state.

313
00:16:58,598 --> 00:16:59,358
What?

314
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,358
Master

315
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:03,718
was going to enter the real state?

316
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:07,198
Master, I'm sorry.

317
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:08,877
I was too reckless.

318
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:10,837
Your Supreme Majesty,

319
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,958
stop blaming Yan'er for this.

320
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,238
I will give this another attempt

321
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:15,958
after a few more days.

322
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,757
After a few more days?

323
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:19,438
It's easy for you to say.

324
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:21,998
However,

325
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:22,998
who are those people

326
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,357
who tried to kill Master?

327
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:26,478
Get out.

328
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:28,317
This is none of your business.

329
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:44,638
If you dare to ruin our plan again,

330
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,557
I will never spare you.

331
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:00,837
(The relationship between them)

332
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,557
(is unusual.)

333
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,357
(I have to find out)

334
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,837
(who this Zhu Yan is.)

335
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:10,478
Your father and I

336
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:12,317
sent you to Jiuyi Mountain

337
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:13,878
so that you could

338
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:15,158
stay in a peaceful place.

339
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,757
I never expected Jiuyi Mountain

340
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:19,438
to be full of dangers as well.

341
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:20,918
No.

342
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:23,557
You will leave the mountain
with me tomorrow.

343
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:24,878
No matter how important
these magic techniques are,

344
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,757
they're not as important as your life.

345
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,638
I mustn't let you be in danger anymore.

346
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:29,678
Mother,

347
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,678
you should stop being paranoid.

348
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:34,037
Your daughter

349
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,438
is very capable.

350
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,597
This is just a scratch.

351
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,238
What scratch?

352
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,037
The divine servant said

353
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,357
your wound would only heal

354
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:46,797
after ten days.

355
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,077
How dare you still boast?

356
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:51,158
Madam,

357
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,037
this soup can help replenish
one's spiritual power.

358
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,918
Your Highness, please drink it
while it's hot.

359
00:18:58,517 --> 00:18:59,198
Keeper Yuan,

360
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,557
persuade Yan'er for me

361
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:03,317
and tell her to leave the mountain
together with us.

362
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,317
Madam, I know you love your daughter.

363
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,557
And, Her Highness was chosen
as the first disciple

364
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:12,678
because of her exceptional talents.

365
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,597
Jiuyi Mountain has found
a worthy student.

366
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:15,998
They won't let her leave like that.

367
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,238
It takes some time

368
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,678
before Her Highness can leave
the mountain too.

369
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:21,398
We require His Lordship to
issue a written order

370
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:23,317
and hand it personally
to High Priest of Grand Preceptor

371
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,958
before we can make any decisions.

372
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,077
Okay.

373
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:28,517
When I go back,

374
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,158
we'll draft a written order.

375
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,438
Madam, please don't worry.

376
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,077
Her Highness has expended her energy.

377
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:39,837
Madam, I assume you're tired
after the long trip too.

378
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:42,357
Please rest early after
finishing the medicine.

379
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:43,277
God of Dragon,

380
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:44,837
you've finally revealed yourself.

381
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:48,757
You've served the Kongsang people
for many years as a slave.

382
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,238
Do you still remember
your true identity?

383
00:20:51,878 --> 00:20:52,517
I, Zhi Yuan,

384
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:54,398
will never forget that.

385
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,718
So, Lord Left Envoy,

386
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:59,597
you still remember that
your surname is Zhi?

387
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:03,198
It's the top surname
after the Sea Emperor's.

388
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:04,718
But you forgot about your duty
to restore your nation

389
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,757
that was entrusted to you
by your ancestors.

390
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:08,438
You're here to protect

391
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:09,797
a Kongsang princess instead.

392
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:11,918
I will kill her right now

393
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,958
and sever your ties
with the Kongsang people!

394
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:14,718
No!

395
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,238
God of Dragon, no!

396
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:20,117
The Kongsang people are descendants
of Lang Gan.

397
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:21,678
None of them are innocent.

398
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,198
I will offer this girl

399
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:25,398
as a sacrifice to our war flag!

400
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:28,597
No!

401
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:33,638
Yan'er!

402
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,718
Come out!

403
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,198
Yan'er!

404
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,117
Yan'er! Come out!

405
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:49,277
Hurry and come out!

406
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:03,077
Yan'er!

407
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:04,797
Yan'er!

408
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,998
Yan'er!

409
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,037
Yan'er!

410
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,277
You shed a tear.

411
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:45,678
I...

412
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:48,678
I...

413
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,198
The Dragon Blood Jade
is the Merfolk Clan's sacred treasure.

414
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:54,438
It's the clue to locate the Sea Emperor.

415
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:58,037
It's guarded by the descendants
of Zhi for many generations.

416
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,678
As it was hidden within the eyes,

417
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:03,478
the guardian mustn't shed a single tear.

418
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:05,198
You shed no tears even when

419
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:06,198
your beloved passed away.

420
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:08,317
But now, you actually shed a tear

421
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,837
because of a Kongsang princess.

422
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,878
Could it be that you've already
fallen for her?

423
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,398
No way.

424
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:14,878
No way!

425
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:16,557
That's impossible!

426
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,198
The person I love is Yao Yi!

427
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,837
A merfolk can only fall in love
with a single person in their lifetime!

428
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:22,958
They can only love a single person.

429
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:25,357
Zhi Yuan, you should admit it.

430
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:26,837
You love Zhu Yan,

431
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:28,117
the princess of the Crimson Clan.

432
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,077
That's impossible!

433
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:30,718
That's impossible!

434
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:32,718
The fate of the Sea Kingdom

435
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,998
actually changed because of you?

436
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:36,238
Zhi Yuan,

437
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,878
remember your mission.

438
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,837
Do not disappoint me.

439
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:21,638
I didn't let Yao Yi down!

440
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:46,998
Was everything

441
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,398
just a dream?

442
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,117
That's impossible!

443
00:24:53,198 --> 00:24:54,317
I love Yao Yi,

444
00:24:58,918 --> 00:24:59,958
yet I have to protect

445
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,517
the Dragon Blood Jade.

446
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:06,317
(You shed no tears even when)

447
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:07,878
(your beloved passed away.)

448
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:09,317
(But now, you actually shed a tear)

449
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:11,398
(because of a Kongsang princess.)

450
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:13,797
(Could it be that you've already
fallen for her?)

451
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:15,918
(Not only did you give up
on your surname,)

452
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,198
(but you also betrayed
the nature of the Merfolk Clan.)

453
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:19,998
(Just admit it.)

454
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:21,837
(You love Zhu Yan,)

455
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:23,357
(the princess of the Crimson Clan.)

456
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,718
A merfolk can only fall in love
with a single person in their lifetime.

457
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:28,837
I cannot let Yao Yi down.

458
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,398
As for the extra relationships,

459
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:37,837
it's time for me to end them.

460
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:03,198
Your Supreme Majesty,

461
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,638
all the elites of the Azure Clan

462
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:06,878
except for those under the Azure King

463
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:07,958
and Qing Gang

464
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:09,077
are all here.

465
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:10,357
The Azure Clan

466
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:11,878
has suffered a huge blow.

467
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:12,878
I think they've lost the power

468
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:13,998
to create trouble for now.

469
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:15,958
I spread

470
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,597
the news

471
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:19,198
and lured the Azure Clan here

472
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:20,517
to capture all of them.

473
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:22,837
It was supposed to end well.

474
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:25,878
However, Ying

475
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,037
left his meditation by force

476
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:29,277
and lost his chance to enter
the real state because of Zhu Yan.

477
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,398
Seems like this Zhu Yan

478
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:33,757
brings calamity to Ying.

479
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,597
I used up my lifetime's cultivation

480
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:36,918
to do a divination.

481
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:38,077
I realized that the real state
of Heaven and Earth

482
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,357
and the alignment of the nine planets

483
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,357
is in ten days.

484
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:43,958
If you cultivate your primordial spirit
by then,

485
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,718
you may receive the power
of the nine planets.

486
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,398
Priest of Grand Preceptor

487
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:50,357
has one more chance

488
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:51,718
to enter the real state.

489
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:52,797
You guys

490
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,517
must never let down your guard.

491
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:55,757
You guys need to tighten the security.

492
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:57,398
That Zhu Yan,

493
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:58,597
do not let her

494
00:26:58,757 --> 00:26:59,797
cause trouble again.

495
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:01,718
Yes, High Priest.

496
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:08,117
I never expected us

497
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:10,757
to fail this time.

498
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,718
Don't panic.

499
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,317
It was just a bait this time.

500
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:18,718
Now, High Priest thinks

501
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:21,158
that most of the elites
of the Azure Clan are gone.

502
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:24,478
Even if he doesn't let down his guard,

503
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,398
he'll never expect us

504
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,198
to start another battle elsewhere.

505
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,718
He can enjoy himself for the time being.

506
00:27:32,238 --> 00:27:33,077
If not,

507
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:36,077
we won't get the chance

508
00:27:36,597 --> 00:27:38,037
to use our killer move.

509
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,077
As for the next step,

510
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,398
how can we lure

511
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:45,718
the desireless priest

512
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:49,438
into our trap?

513
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:52,317
Bai Xuelu.

514
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,757
She's familiar with
Jiuyi Mountain's terrain.

515
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:57,277
And, she visits

516
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,678
our palace from time to time.

517
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:03,998
Why don't we give her a chance

518
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:06,238
to atone for her mistake?

519
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,517
Does your hand still hurt?

520
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:17,398
If it weren't for the rule

521
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:19,678
that visitors can only
stay here for two days,

522
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,918
I'll only return

523
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,718
when you're fully healed.

524
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:24,158
You can

525
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:25,198
just recuperate

526
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:26,597
in this courtyard at ease.

527
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,238
When I head back,

528
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:29,198
your father and I

529
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,998
will draft a written order

530
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:33,998
and bring you home in
less than half a month.

531
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:35,757
I won't go back.

532
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:36,718
I've finally found

533
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:38,077
my calling here.

534
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,958
How could I end it abruptly?

535
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,238
You can learn

536
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:44,878
magic techniques anywhere.

537
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:46,317
I'll hire the best teachers

538
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,357
for you when we return

539
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,597
to Extreme Wind City.

540
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:49,757
No one is better

541
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:51,998
than my master in this world.

542
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:52,958
You!

543
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:54,958
This child is...

544
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:55,718
Your Highness,

545
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:56,878
High Priest seeks an audience with you.

546
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,517
High Priest?

547
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:00,317
Think about

548
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,638
what I've said.

549
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:06,958
Your Highness.

550
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:08,757
When do you plan to depart?

551
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,277
Your carriage is ready.

552
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:11,357
Keeper Yuan,

553
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,517
persuade Yan'er for me.

554
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,837
I'll bid farewell to High Priest.

555
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:16,918
We'll depart when I'm back.

556
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:17,998
Yes, Your Highness.

557
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:26,638
Yuan,

558
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:27,837
I assume you intend

559
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,357
to persuade me on Mother's behalf.

560
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:30,918
Your Highness, you're no longer a child.

561
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:32,277
I'm sure you can bear responsibility

562
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:33,438
for the path you've chosen.

563
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,357
It's pointless for me
to say anything extra.

564
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:38,198
Yuan, I knew you understood me the best.

565
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:38,918
Here.

566
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:39,878
Your Highness, be careful. Sit down.

567
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,757
Don't worry. I'm fine.

568
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,077
By the way, Yuan,

569
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:45,238
I wish to head underwater

570
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:46,517
and practice the Fushui Spell again.

571
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:47,478
Can I do so?

572
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:02,958
No.

573
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:04,757
It's best if you don't.

574
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:06,077
Your Highness, since you've mastered

575
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,037
the Fushui Spell,

576
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,797
you shouldn't head underwater

577
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,077
while you're wounded.

578
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:12,517
But Yuan,

579
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:14,357
I'm not good at it yet.

580
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:15,478
And,

581
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:17,158
I'm already fine.

582
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:18,678
You don't believe me?

583
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,438
Look.

584
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,277
Your Highness, be careful!

585
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:25,438
Be careful!

586
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:27,277
Yuan,

587
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:29,678
I know you're the best.

588
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:30,958
I'm begging you here.

589
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:31,998
Please?

590
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,998
I'm sure you'll say yes,

591
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,638
am I right?

592
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:38,837
Yuan, you...

593
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,037
What's the matter?

594
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,357
Your Highness, since you're already
a grown-up,

595
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:44,198
and that you're training
in Jiuyi Mountain,

596
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,478
it's best if we distinguish

597
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,158
between our status and gender.

598
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:49,597
I didn't do a good job before this.

599
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:50,797
Your Highness, please forgive me.

600
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:53,037
Did I do something wrong?

601
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:55,837
Why did you say that out of the blue?

602
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:57,238
Your Highness, do you want
Priest of Grand Preceptor

603
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,357
to think that the royalty
of the Crimson Clan

604
00:30:58,517 --> 00:30:59,438
are uneducated barbarians?

605
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,198
Yuan, you're right.

606
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:08,357
I was too willful.

607
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,238
Your Highness, I have something
for you to try.

608
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:23,958
Please try to use it.

609
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,317
(The Dragon Blood Jade
is actually untouched.)

610
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,077
(Seems like the Dragon Blood Jade)

611
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:35,678
(is related to Her Highness)

612
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:36,517
(by fate.)

613
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:38,638
(Maybe it can protect her.)

614
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:41,517
It's so beautiful.

615
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:44,198
Your Highness, you may wear it.

616
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,918
The mountain hasn't been safe lately.

617
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,077
The Empress is deeply concerned
about your safety.

618
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,277
This piece of jade

619
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,198
might be able to protect you.

620
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:52,438
Yuan,

621
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:54,678
I thought we already grew distant

622
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:56,478
from each other after what you said.

623
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,277
You're still nice to me.

624
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:01,277
I can

625
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:02,958
breathe a sigh of relief now.

626
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:04,317
However,

627
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,797
this should be

628
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,878
your heirloom, right?

629
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:08,517
This is such a precious gift.

630
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:09,678
I can't accept it.

631
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,037
Ordinary Kongsang people

632
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:14,478
will crush the jade

633
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:15,757
when they touch it.

634
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,718
However, Your Highness,
you could touch it without any problem.

635
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,438
That means you're fated to wield it.

636
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:22,878
Is that so?

637
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:26,317
You and I are fated to meet.

638
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,757
(If our clans do clash
against each other,)

639
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:31,958
(I hope this jade can protect you.)

640
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:35,238
(And I pray that you,)

641
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:36,797
(the descendant of Yao Yi,)

642
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,398
(will always stay safe.)

643
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,597
If that's the case,

644
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:44,277
I shall accept you.

645
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,557
Thanks.

646
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:52,077
Why did he leave

647
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:53,158
without telling me?

648
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,597
Empress, you can take your time

649
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:04,117
preparing for Her Highness's departure.

650
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:05,958
If you're still worried about
Her Highness,

651
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:07,797
you may make a life charm

652
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:09,678
with Her Highness's time of birth

653
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:10,517
and ask your men

654
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,317
to deliver it to me.

655
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:15,718
I shall bless it together

656
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:16,638
with the Four High Priests

657
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,517
so that mishaps won't
happen to Her Highness.

658
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:21,398
If that's the case,

659
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,597
let me express my gratitude,
High Priest.

660
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:26,158
I shall leave,

661
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,557
instruct my men to make the life charm,

662
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,797
and deliver it to
the mountain immediately.

663
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,837
Greetings, Consort.

664
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,398
You guys may leave.

665
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:42,317
Yes, Consort.

666
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:43,077
Yes, Consort.

667
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:45,317
You may sit.

668
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:54,478
This is a huge issue.

669
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:55,998
Initially,

670
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:58,597
I didn't want you to get involved.

671
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:00,517
However,

672
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,998
I do know that you're an obedient girl.

673
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:04,678
That's why

674
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:07,158
I'll treat you as one of us.

675
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:09,357
Sit down.

676
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:11,797
Thank you, Consort.

677
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:17,117
I hope you can find a way

678
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,838
to lure the priest

679
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:19,998
to Nvluo Creek, which is

680
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,597
at the south of Jiuyi Mountain.

681
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:27,237
What?

682
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:29,878
Are you not willing to do so?

683
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:31,318
Or do you have

684
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:33,918
something else in mind?

685
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:35,278
Consort, you misunderstood me.

686
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,237
This is a difficult task.

687
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:39,677
I'm just trying to
figure out a solution.

688
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:41,918
If you can

689
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,358
complete this task for me,

690
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:45,318
Xuelu,

691
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,278
you'll be truly

692
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:48,798
one of us by then.

693
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:10,677
Isn't that...

694
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:15,438
Isn't that the divine bird, Chong Ming?

695
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:05,197
Master.

696
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:06,517
What are you doing here?

697
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:16,037
So, it was you.

698
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,237
Master,

699
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,958
why have you come out of your retreat?

700
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,677
It's been so long since
I played a flute.

701
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:12,998
I was rusty.

702
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:16,237
But it sounded fine to me.

703
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:18,037
Master,

704
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,358
can you form

705
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,478
all kinds of shapes

706
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:21,717
with the clouds

707
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,117
you make?

708
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,278
If so,

709
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:30,237
I want to see a mountain made of clouds.

710
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:47,318
Master,

711
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:48,998
can you make a courtyard

712
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:50,998
on that mountain?

713
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:06,798
Amazing!

714
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:08,637
Master,

715
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,237
can you make our figures

716
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:11,798
and put them in the courtyard?

717
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,958
I haven't passed the test of Chaos Logic

718
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:20,478
and Vitality yet.

719
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:21,758
And, my spiritual power

720
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:23,637
isn't as abundant.

721
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:25,478
Just make do with it.

722
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:30,958
If so, Master, let me
send you back first.

723
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:31,958
It's fine.

724
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:33,798
It's common for cultivators

725
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:36,077
to encounter ordeals.

726
00:38:36,677 --> 00:38:37,798
It's just that I'm on a different level.

727
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,358
Naturally, I have to endure it longer.

728
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,077
Most of the time,

729
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,318
I will be weak from swimming
in my consciousness.

730
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:47,037
I only woke up today.

731
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:52,717
About what happened
in the stone chamber,

732
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:54,597
I would like to thank you for it.

733
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,918
Master, you don't need to console me.

734
00:38:59,197 --> 00:38:59,878
I think

735
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,878
I dragged you down instead.

736
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:05,197
You weren't able to enter the real state
because of me.

737
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:07,758
Actually,

738
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:09,358
entering the real state or not

739
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:11,157
isn't that important to me.

740
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,077
You know that.

741
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:15,958
I wanted

742
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:17,197
to chase that lass away.

743
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:19,117
But you learned a lost skill

744
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:20,918
when she was here.

745
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,677
I'm caught in a dilemma.

746
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:26,157
What lost skill do you mean?

747
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:27,438
Please tell me.

748
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:28,838
You learned how to smile.

749
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,517
Ever since she came here,

750
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:33,958
the youth who always rejected

751
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:34,918
other people

752
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:36,438
learned how to smile.

753
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:47,758
You must believe in my abilities.

754
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,798
Missing out on that opportunity
is no big deal.

755
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:52,717
(Master came here to thank me)

756
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,318
(right after he woke up.)

757
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:55,478
(I'm sure it's because he's afraid)

758
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:56,838
(that I might feel guilty about it.)

759
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:58,358
(If I keep dwelling on it,)

760
00:39:58,597 --> 00:39:59,958
(he won't be able to rest at ease.)

761
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,037
That's right.

762
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:02,838
Master, you're so skillful.

763
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,998
I'm sure you'll succeed.

764
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:08,517
Yan'er,

765
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:11,478
do you wish to learn
the Cloud Manipulation Spell?

766
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,438
I do.

767
00:40:27,077 --> 00:40:27,758
Master,

768
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:30,318
is this your gift for me?

769
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:31,637
Try it.

770
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:24,077
Master.

771
00:41:24,517 --> 00:41:24,998
Look.

772
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,278
What do you think about
the portrait I drew with the cloud?

773
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,237
It looks like

774
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:33,478
a person.

775
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:36,438
Master, that's you.

776
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,117
Master, look over there.

777
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,237
It's thick, bushy,

778
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:41,838
and slightly tilting upward.

779
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:44,478
Don't they look like your brows?

780
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:50,157
All right.

781
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:51,758
It's getting late.

782
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:53,117
You haven't fully recovered yet.

783
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,597
You need to recuperate in your room.

784
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:56,278
I'll return to the stone chamber too.

785
00:41:58,478 --> 00:41:58,998
All right then.

786
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:00,677
Master, I'll prepare
a pot of fine liquor

787
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:01,557
to celebrate the occasion

788
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:03,237
after you succeed
in entering the real state.

789
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:04,438
In the future...

790
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:06,037
I'm saying

791
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:08,157
a long time in the future.

792
00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:10,478
Master, whenever you pass a test,

793
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:11,478
I'll prepare

794
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:12,798
a pot of fine liquor for you.

795
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:14,117
Although I don't drink,

796
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:17,637
I can

797
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:18,717
be there for you

798
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:20,557
as you enjoy it.

799
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:21,637
That's great.

800
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:23,157
Master, we still have plenty of things

801
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:24,237
to do together in the future.

802
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:25,318
It's a promise then.

803
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:26,557
It's a deal.

804
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,237
By the way,

805
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:32,478
Chong Ming will face

806
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:33,998
the heavenly calamity in a few days.

807
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:36,197
I hope you two

808
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:37,358
can take care of each other.

809
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,197
He might look fierce on the surface,

810
00:42:40,478 --> 00:42:41,637
but he's just a child

811
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,197
inside.

812
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:46,918
Master, don't worry.

813
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:48,398
Once you come out of your retreat,

814
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:49,318
Chong Ming and I will receive you

815
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:51,637
in your room in Jiuyi Mountain.
