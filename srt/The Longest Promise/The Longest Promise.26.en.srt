19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,097
Master, how about this?

20
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:00,008
I'll help you undo
the Immobilization Spell.

21
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:01,690
So you can feel more comfortable.

22
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,024
This time, I swear

23
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,768
I'll definitely succeed in one go.

24
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:18,495
Stop.

25
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,088
If you go any further,

26
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,512
you'll die.

27
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,304
Master,
drink the medicinal decoction then.

28
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,000
Open your mouth.

29
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,568
I don't need you to feed me.

30
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,536
Hurry up and undo the spell.

31
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,488
With your current skills,

32
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,856
what are you going to do
if you encounter

33
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,080
a large group of Merfolk marine force?

34
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:45,800
I'm not afraid
of the Merfolk marine force,

35
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,664
I'm afraid that you'll escape.

36
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:48,815
So

37
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:50,176
let me

38
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,535
serve you instead.

39
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,464
My hand slipped.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,050
Forgive me.

41
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:58,095
Stop!

42
00:02:59,176 --> 00:02:59,736
I said

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,760
if you go any further,

44
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,176
you will...

45
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,456
I told you to stop talking.

46
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:07,055
You...

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,376
It must be because of the strong wind.

48
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,576
Don't be angry.

49
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:14,335
Master, look.

50
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,416
People are destined to die anyway.

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,504
Instead of dying soaked
in medicinal decoction,

52
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,272
it's better

53
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,490
to die in clean clothes.

54
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:22,256
Stop!

55
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:26,416
Master,

56
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:29,296
you're wearing
so many layers of clothes.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,200
With this many clothes,

58
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,992
don't you feel hot?

59
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,576
As your Master,

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,728
I naturally have to consider everything.

61
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,416
As your disciple,

62
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,775
I also have

63
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,784
to consider everything.

64
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:53,095
Here.

65
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:54,296
Master,

66
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,856
you should just drink
the medicinal decoction.

67
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,800
What's your business here?

68
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,032
Visit my relatives.

69
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:10,720
Okay, go.

70
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,055
You, what brings you here?

71
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,696
Sir,

72
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,136
please let me in.

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,160
Our place is at war everywhere.

74
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,952
I came to seek refuge
with my third uncle.

75
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:18,608
Get lost.

76
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,480
Even beggars are trying
to enter Xia City. Next!

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,856
Please show some mercy.

78
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,215
Master,

79
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,855
we've reached the city gate.

80
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,256
If you go alone,

81
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:35,775
we'll be discovered.

82
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,975
So everything must go

83
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,904
according to my plan.

84
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,376
We'll disguise ourselves

85
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,576
as a Crimson Clan couple.

86
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,280
You don't have to say a word.

87
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,450
Just do as I say.

88
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:00,056
Thank you.

89
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:00,655
Thank you.

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,400
Stop your carriage.

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,888
Stop right there.

92
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,295
Where are you from?

93
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,328
What brings you to the city?

94
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,176
Sir, my husband and I are both

95
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,096
from the Crimson Clan.

96
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,610
My husband caught a serious cold

97
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,264
during his business journey.

98
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:20,256
I want to bring him into the city
to see a physician.

99
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,944
This man is our driver.

100
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,104
Where is he?

101
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,960
Tell him to get off the carriage.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,920
His cold is truly serious.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,512
It's not convenient for him to get off.

104
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,000
He has to get off.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,304
No carriages are allowed into the city.

106
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:34,816
But...

107
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,016
No buts.

108
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,808
Get off immediately.

109
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,056
Dear...

110
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:45,295
My dear.

111
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:47,896
Dear,

112
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:49,775
I'm all right.

113
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,048
We should hurry into the city
and find a physician.

114
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:01,535
Ming,

115
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:03,456
you can just drop me off here.

116
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,576
You better don't let me infect you...

117
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,824
Infect you with this disease.

118
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,240
Sorry about that, sir.

119
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,436
Just go already.

120
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,120
My dear.

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,269
Hurry off now.

122
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,200
Thank you.

123
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,810
Be quick.

124
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,700
Thank you.

125
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,225
I'm going now.

126
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,392
Be careful.

127
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,250
Next!

128
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,149
Don't look back.

129
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,741
Lest it aroused suspicions.

130
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,047
What about Chong Ming?

131
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,380
He's a bird.

132
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:39,490
When it's nighttime,

133
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,865
he'll naturally fly in here.

134
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,175
So this is

135
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,616
your foolproof plan?

136
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,220
Who would have thought my master

137
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,352
could act so well?

138
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,992
Master, you look good

139
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:53,368
in our clan's clothes.

140
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,640
Since I've already entered the city,

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,624
I'll find the physician on my own.

142
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,416
You don't need to risk yourself
for me anymore.

143
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,390
Let's part ways here.

144
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:05,820
Immobilize!

145
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:11,295
You...

146
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,016
I told you

147
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,056
my plan is foolproof.

148
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:17,095
How can I easily let you go?

149
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,016
Since we're dressed

150
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:22,816
as Crimson Clan,

151
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,016
we should follow
the customs of the clan.

152
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,728
In the Crimson Clan,

153
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,072
the husbands have to obey the wives.

154
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,096
I've already found out the location

155
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,064
of Physician Xu's apothecary
from Chong Ming.

156
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:38,936
Come with me, my dear.

157
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,333
My dear, what's wrong?

158
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,250
Are you shy?

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,680
(Don't mind the unused medicines on shelves)

160
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,090
(Just care that people are free from illness)

161
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,610
Remember to take your medicine on time

162
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,226
(Renxin Clinic)
and get more rest.

163
00:07:59,226 --> 00:07:59,991
All right. Thank you.

164
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,986
Master, we're here.

165
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,364
You're welcome. Take care.

166
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:06,376
Are you here to seek treatment too?

167
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:07,576
Mister,

168
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,493
we specifically came from out of town

169
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:11,013
to find Physician Xu.

170
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,460
It's chaos out there.

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,302
It's not easy for you two to come here.

172
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,840
Please wait a moment.

173
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,210
Physician Xu is currently attending

174
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,071
to other patients.

175
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:20,835
It will be over soon.

176
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,453
Please rest here for a while.

177
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,880
Excuse me.

178
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,222
Please wait.

179
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,742
Can you prepare

180
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,857
some home-cooked meals for us?

181
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,480
It's chaotic outside.

182
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,551
My husband and I

183
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,431
haven't eaten much all day.

184
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,835
I can tell
that you two are deeply in love.

185
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:41,626
All right.

186
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:43,662
I'll go to the kitchen
and see what we have.

187
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,420
Please take a seat first.

188
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,951
Master, eat something.

189
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,496
You don't even

190
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,575
have the energy to be angry with me.

191
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,496
Once you fill up your stomach,

192
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:09,856
you'll have the energy

193
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:10,976
to keep being angry.

194
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,336
(I'm fine being hungry a little.)

195
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,455
(I mustn't aggravate Master's injuries.)

196
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,455
(Could it be that Master
is going to feed me?)

197
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,016
Master.

198
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,928
Actually, I know

199
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:19,431
you rejected me this time

200
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,866
because you were upset
that I put myself in danger.

201
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,017
You were seriously injured
in Jiuyi Mountain

202
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,380
because of me.

203
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,937
I've always felt indebted to you.

204
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,151
I don't want to owe you anything

205
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,204
when we enter the mortal world.

206
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,026
Look at you.

207
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,653
There you go again.

208
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,537
You have to push me away

209
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,140
just to make yourself happy.

210
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,448
Have you forgotten

211
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:42,826
the words you said to me

212
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:44,420
on the day we met?

213
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,377
If you practice magic spells diligently,

214
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,710
you can do it one day too.

215
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,182
This Snowy Rosa
is my proof to you.

216
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,380
You can take it to your father.

217
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,137
Can a lady do it too?

218
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:00,888
There is no difference
between men and women

219
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:03,000
in guarding the country
and protecting the family.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,986
Since you believe that I'm not confined

221
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:07,164
to being just a girl in the house.

222
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,293
Then don't look at me

223
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,880
with the eyes of one
who sees weakness in others.

224
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,220
You don't owe me anything.

225
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,715
I'm doing this to
uphold my own principles.

226
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,724
As cultivators,

227
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,022
how can we ignore

228
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,684
others in distress?

229
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,137
This is what you taught me.

230
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,306
When did I say such a thing?

231
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,986
On the fourth day

232
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,610
after I became your disciple,

233
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,364
you disregarded your own safety

234
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:35,146
and went to Jiuyi District
to treat the villagers.

235
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,657
Although you didn't say it yourself,

236
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,300
this is the lesson you taught me.

237
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,100
Neglecting those in need
goes against our true nature.

238
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,191
Release the spell
and let's eat in comfort.

239
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,453
Since we're already here,

240
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,213
I won't leave.

241
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,377
Physician Xu,

242
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,380
how is his condition?

243
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,080
You're from Jiuyi Mountain.

244
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,328
How did you know?

245
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:41,502
This Immortal Official

246
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,290
is overflowing with Jiuyi Mountain's

247
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,400
pure and ethereal aura.

248
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,560
Except for the dark shade

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,631
on his left shoulder,

250
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,080
which may be the result

251
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,773
of an attack by an evil force.

252
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,340
Over sixty years ago,

253
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,060
I resided in Jiuyi Mountain,
practicing medicine.

254
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:03,520
There were countless divine trees
and medicinal herbs on Yaoshen Peak.

255
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,720
The Hall of Books housed medical texts
from all over the world.

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,937
It was truly a dream place

257
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:12,300
for all healers in the world.

258
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:15,342
It's indeed as Chong Ming said.

259
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,340
You'll surely be able to cure my master.

260
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,568
Please remove your clothes

261
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,008
and let me see.

262
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,915
Luckily, you arrived today.

263
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,100
If it was one day later,

264
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,151
the evil energy would have entered
his bones through his meridians,

265
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,004
and it would have been too late.

266
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,168
Physician Xu,

267
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,660
are you going to cut it open?

268
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:42,535
Please wait outside, miss.

269
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:44,616
Please use

270
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,455
more numbing herbs for my master.

271
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:48,655
His previous mastery of magic
was profound

272
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,376
and he didn't really suffer major injuries.

273
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,136
So it'll be painful for him.

274
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,415
Miss, don't worry about it.

275
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:55,695
Physician Xu,

276
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,136
please proceed with the knife.

277
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,415
This girl is really nice to you.

278
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,575
In my early days of cultivation
in Jiuyi Mountain,

279
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:15,175
I made friends
with an Immortal Official.

280
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,295
At that time,

281
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:18,535
he was only a few years older
than you are now

282
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:20,575
and was a Grand Marshal.

283
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:22,256
Everyone thought

284
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,216
he would reach greater heights.

285
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:25,775
But he insisted
on facing the Tribulations of Hell

286
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,256
to return to the mortal world.

287
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:29,216
All for one woman.

288
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,256
Tribulations of Hell?

289
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:31,496
Indeed.

290
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,496
On the eve of the ritual,

291
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,096
I asked him

292
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:38,896
if it was worth

293
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,496
risking his life

294
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:42,736
and losing his lifelong cultivation

295
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,455
after he succeeded

296
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:46,655
for the sake of a woman.

297
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:48,856
He said

298
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,695
without her in the mountain

299
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,175
is hell.

300
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:56,856
What was his fate then?

301
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,336
Over hundreds of years,

302
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,376
no one could pass through
the Tribulations of Hell,

303
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,815
and he was no exception.

304
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,175
Once he entered the trial,

305
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,896
he perished under the heavenly thunder,

306
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:14,616
leaving behind nothing but dry bones.

307
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:15,856
As for me,

308
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,336
after I witnessed

309
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,096
his miserable state with my own eyes,

310
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:20,616
I ended my cultivation

311
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:21,856
and returned to the mortal world.

312
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:23,856
Those who reside in the mountains
had renounced emotional attachment.

313
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,976
Yet, most are infatuated souls.

314
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,295
Since he has detached himself
from emotional attachment,

315
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:32,136
he shouldn't seek affection
in the mortal world.

316
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:36,496
This will hurt.

317
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,575
As a reminder,

318
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,496
the foreign object
may have been removed.

319
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,935
But the evil energy remains deep.

320
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,896
It'll take time to cleanse it.

321
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,055
So in the next three days,

322
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,256
you can't use any power.

323
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,616
If you forcefully try to use them,

324
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:32,856
you'll only suffer a backlash.

325
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,535
To expedite your recovery,

326
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,336
you can only rely on your essence qi

327
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,856
to expel the evil energy.

328
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,695
And essence qi

329
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:45,055
is the foundation of a cultivator,
the basis of all things.

330
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:49,016
I hope you won't act recklessly.

331
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,295
Thank you, Physician Xu.

332
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:01,336
How's Ying?

333
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,136
Chong Ming,

334
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,096
don't worry.

335
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,136
He's undergoing treatment now.

336
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,576
Since you're here,

337
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:08,816
I can depart with peace of mind.

338
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:09,695
Where are you heading?

339
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:11,296
Back to the relay station.

340
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:12,336
Yan,

341
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:13,255
it must be hard for you.

342
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:14,255
Won't...

343
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,776
Won't you say goodbye to him?

344
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:17,376
It's all right.

345
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,935
Let him focus on his treatment.

346
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:22,495
He's a stubborn person.

347
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:23,935
Don't take it to heart.

348
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:25,455
I understand

349
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:26,856
that my master acts

350
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:27,695
for my own good.

351
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:29,215
But it's a pity

352
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,616
that cultivators are detached
from worldly emotions.

353
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,376
And for a mortal like me,

354
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,455
I shouldn't annoy him anymore.

355
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,136
Goodbye.

356
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:38,376
Yan,

357
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,215
it's not like that.

358
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:40,336
Actually, your master...

359
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,136
Third!

360
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,215
What is that?

361
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:44,776
Master.

362
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,856
The divine healer has extracted
the foreign object.

363
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:51,576
I'll stay

364
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,695
to rest for a few hours

365
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:53,695
and I'll be all right.

366
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:56,776
You can go now.

367
00:17:58,655 --> 00:17:59,175
All right.

368
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:01,056
Then rest well.

369
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,336
I'll take my leave first.

370
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:10,896
Yan. Yan!

371
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:12,495
Yan!

372
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,336
How can you not even

373
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:23,935
say thank you?

374
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:25,136
You're not as considerate

375
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:25,776
as a bird like me.

376
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,576
Excuse me, mister.

377
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,896
Is there a granary nearby?

378
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:30,576
Granary?

379
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,495
You can follow this path ahead.

380
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,015
Cross the bridge, then turn left.

381
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:35,015
Then you'll see it.

382
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:36,735
Thank you very much.

383
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:37,695
It's nothing.

384
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:47,616
Actually, I know

385
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:49,415
you'll send the bird's nest.

386
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,136
Only you know me best, my daughter.

387
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:55,695
When the Priest of Grand Preceptor

388
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,455
quelled the rebellion
of the Huotu Tribe,

389
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,175
you were still able to remain composed.

390
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:00,896
But now,

391
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,056
there is news of his victory
in Xia City.

392
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:04,015
I'm sure you have some thoughts.

393
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,816
That's why you're here

394
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:06,935
to find the daughter

395
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,015
who has been in contact
with Jiuyi Mountain.

396
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:12,975
It's my fault.

397
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,536
Since you returned from Jiuyi Mountain,

398
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:16,175
I've been restricting your movements.

399
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,816
But now,

400
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,896
it seems you're more farsighted than me.

401
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,856
What are your thoughts

402
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,136
about this matter?

403
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,455
Pardon me for being disrespectful.

404
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,376
If you were punished

405
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:33,616
by the Emperor in anger

406
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,296
and became a criminal,

407
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:37,255
what would you do?

408
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:41,175
Most people

409
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:42,856
can only struggle to survive

410
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,336
and spend the rest
of their lives in hardship, right?

411
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,056
But individuals
like the Priest of Grand Preceptor

412
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,415
who possess hidden talents

413
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,655
can make a comeback.

414
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,975
We can't find another person like him
in the entire of Kongsang.

415
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:55,215
The country is of paramount importance.

416
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:56,495
When making a stake,
stake on potential individuals.

417
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,455
Now the result has turned out this way,

418
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,215
why are you still hesitating?

419
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,655
If we ignore the signs,

420
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:06,455
it'll lead to future retribution.

421
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,655
What you said

422
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,136
indeed makes sense.

423
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,136
But we still need to observe.

424
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:14,495
After all, the Priest of Grand Preceptor

425
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,336
was known to be a deceased person.

426
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:18,096
And he also committed the crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

427
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,215
I don't want to hide it from you.

428
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,056
Zhu Gaozhao has written a memorial

429
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,816
of the Priest of Grand Preceptor's
achievement

430
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,536
and submitted it to the court.

431
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,655
How the Emperor views it

432
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:31,056
will be evident in the next few days.

433
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:32,576
Whether it's deceiving
the Emperor or not

434
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:34,455
depends on the Emperor's discretion.

435
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,536
It all depends on
whose words the Emperor listens to.

436
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:37,735
Father,

437
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,015
throughout history, wealth and fortune
are gained through hardships and risks.

438
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:42,735
Since the establishment
of the Menghua Dynasty,

439
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,975
the White Clan has always been
in a superior position

440
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,255
and has never considered
the Azure Clan a threat.

441
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,735
Do you want to see

442
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,935
this long-lasting prosperity

443
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,536
jeopardized in your hands?

444
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:04,816
(Mother,)

445
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,495
(I'll soon be able
to place your memorial tablet)

446
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,536
(into the Bai Residence.)

447
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,136
So you're the Sage.

448
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:20,495
Last time,

449
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:22,655
you used me

450
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:25,136
and deceived me.

451
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:26,655
Last time,

452
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,616
I didn't ask for anything from you.

453
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:31,136
So why would I go all out to assist you?

454
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,136
Don't you know

455
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,576
the easiest thing to trust in this world

456
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,336
is self-interest?

457
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:40,655
This time I ask you to come

458
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,576
because I want to make a deal.

459
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:44,376
A deal?

460
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:47,655
Quelling the Huotu Tribe's rebellion

461
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,616
is something I've planned for Shi Yu
for years.

462
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,096
Yet Shi Ying took the credit.

463
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:54,896
How I wish

464
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,056
I could crush Shi Ying to his bones.

465
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,455
If you can help me get rid of Shi Ying,

466
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,495
you can set any conditions

467
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:04,215
you want.

468
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,935
Things are different from the past.

469
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:08,616
If you go all out

470
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,776
to kill Shi Ying,

471
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,495
the whole world will know

472
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:16,495
it was the Azure Clan that killed

473
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:18,296
the former Crown Prince

474
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,136
who made outstanding
military achievements.

475
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:20,336
When the time comes,

476
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,296
it's not certain if Shi Yu can keep

477
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:23,935
his position as the Crown Prince.

478
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:25,935
Let alone the throne.

479
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:27,695
So what you mean is...

480
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:31,816
Only in times of war

481
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,215
is there an opportunity
to make achievements.

482
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,856
Instead of letting Shi Ying
steal the credit,

483
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:39,495
why don't you petition the court

484
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,695
and declare a full-scale war
against the Merfolk marine force?

485
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:43,616
Let Qing Gang assist

486
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:46,215
and Shi Yu lead the troops
on the battlefield.

487
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:47,096
No.

488
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:49,935
It's too risky

489
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:51,856
to let Shi Yu lead the troops.

490
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:55,415
We'll secretly assist and support him.

491
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,415
We'll help him completely annihilate
the Merfolk marine force.

492
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:01,056
At that time, from the Emperor

493
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,455
to the common people,

494
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:05,296
they will all look at him in awe.

495
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,096
Here.

496
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:15,175
Taste it.

497
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,175
I personally made this bird's nest,

498
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,415
especially for you.

499
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,336
You are indeed farsighted.

500
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:31,376
Xuelu,

501
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,655
you're truly a blessing
to the White Clan.

502
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,856
You've awakened me with your words.

503
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:37,096
It seems

504
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,175
a real change is about to happen.

505
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:44,455
Father,

506
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,536
Consort Qing said today

507
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:47,695
I have the intention of harming Shi Yu

508
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,415
and has forbidden me
from entering the palace again.

509
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:51,655
But I never had such an intention.

510
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:53,975
I don't know if you can make it clear
to Consort Qing

511
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,935
on my behalf.

512
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,455
What's the point of mentioning
those trivial matters?

513
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,296
Just stay at home
and reflect on yourself.

514
00:23:59,015 --> 00:23:59,576
Bai Ming.

515
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:00,455
Yes, Your Lordship.

516
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:02,056
Send Princess Xueying

517
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:02,856
back to her room.

518
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:03,816
Father.

519
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:04,975
Your Highness,

520
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:05,975
this way.

521
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:06,896
Xuelu...

522
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:19,616
Xuelu,

523
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:22,735
if you have any wishes,
feel free to speak up.

524
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,056
I can fulfill them for you.

525
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:28,856
Wish?

526
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:33,856
Then please also send

527
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,096
a bowl of bird's nest soup to Xueying.

528
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,975
She has done her best

529
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:40,896
for the Bai Family.

530
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:43,576
Of course.

531
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,616
I'll ask someone
to deliver it right away.

532
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:47,695
But this time, for the campaign

533
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,776
against the Merfolk marine force,

534
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,056
I recommended Fenglin.

535
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:53,096
I need to have a serious talk with him.

536
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:54,655
Then I won't see you out.

537
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:08,296
Your Highness,

538
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:09,776
haven't you been concerned

539
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:10,616
about Madam's matter

540
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:11,655
for a long time?

541
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:13,415
Why didn't you take the opportunity

542
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,776
to bring it up to His Lordship?

543
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,336
If I move into the Eastern Palace,

544
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:19,015
I'll eventually fulfill my desires.

545
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:22,136
There is no need to rely on others.

546
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,096
But Xueying

547
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:25,455
is not as ruthless

548
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,576
and tough as me.

549
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:31,616
It would be unlucky

550
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:35,896
if something were to happen to her.

551
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,455
Someone is raiding the granary!

552
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:20,255
Come quickly!

553
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:20,816
Catch her!

554
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,175
You're quite skilled.

555
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,136
Are you trying

556
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:58,816
to raid the granary by yourself?

557
00:26:59,415 --> 00:26:59,896
Men!

558
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:01,735
Move it!

559
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:05,255
Walk!

560
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:12,735
If you dare to make a move,

561
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:15,175
I'll kill them immediately.

562
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:23,616
Do you want them

563
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:24,616
to die here?

564
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:32,695
Don't lose focus.

565
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:47,495
White robe with elegant demeanor?

566
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:48,655
It's the dragon slayer!

567
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,255
It's the Priest of Grand Preceptor
of Jiuyi Mountain

568
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:51,376
who has slain countless merfolk.

569
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:53,296
Don't be afraid, everyone!

570
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:54,896
We have the hostages.

571
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:57,856
The dragon slayer
can't do anything to us.

572
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:06,495
(What is Master trying to do?)

573
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:08,576
(It hasn't been two hours yet.)

574
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,576
(His power hasn't fully recovered.)

575
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:11,935
(He can't perform spells.)

576
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:14,415
(And he's taking his time)

577
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,376
(with the hand gestures.)

578
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:18,296
(Master is using a diversion.)

579
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,576
(He's attracting)

580
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,495
(the attention
of these merfolk to himself.)

581
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,376
(So I can follow his gestures)

582
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:25,695
(to perform the spell
and attack from the side.)

583
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:29,816
(By stone's firm nod.)

584
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:31,695
Archers, get ready!

585
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,096
(A flute's sweet tune.)

586
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:33,655
Release the arrows!

587
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,296
(By stone's firm nod,
a flute's sweet tune.)

588
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:55,175
(By stone's firm nod,
a flute's sweet tune.)

589
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:51,336
Dragon slayer!

590
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,536
I'll kill him now
to accompany you in death.

591
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:55,655
Kill them all!

592
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,415
Your leader is already dead.

593
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:20,136
Are you still going to resist?

594
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,975
Let's get out of here.

595
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:32,576
Were you scared?

596
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,576
Master,

597
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:54,415
how's your injury?

598
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:58,296
Master,

599
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,255
what reasons do you have this time

600
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:01,776
to distance yourself from me?

601
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:05,695
Are you trying
to avoid owing me a favor?

602
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,136
(The Evil Star is shining again.)

603
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:39,816
Princess Xuelu!

604
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:42,935
Please wait.

605
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:47,056
Princess Xuelu,

606
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:50,175
how have you been lately?

607
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:55,495
Things have been chaotic lately.

608
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,816
You must take care of yourself.

609
00:31:58,935 --> 00:31:59,695
I'm doing fine.

610
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,576
When you mentioned chaos,

611
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:03,415
are you referring

612
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,776
to the conflicts between our clans?

613
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,015
Previously, you worked for Consort Qing.

614
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:09,096
But now you no longer
have her protection.

615
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:11,655
The Priest of Grand Preceptor
won't do anything to you.

616
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,136
But the High Priest of Grand Preceptor

617
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:14,816
will not let it go that easily.

618
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:15,856
You've mistaken.

619
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,735
Now,

620
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:18,455
not only have I gained

621
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:19,296
the trust of the High Priest.

622
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,735
If the Priest of Grand Preceptor
regains his position as the Crown Prince,

623
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:23,336
the woman he marries

624
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:24,255
will be me.

625
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:27,415
But the Priest of Grand Preceptor

626
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,576
has no intention of returning
to the mortal world.

627
00:32:29,056 --> 00:32:29,655
Then why did he interfere

628
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:30,935
with the affairs of the Huotu Tribe?

629
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:32,735
The battle in Guwei City

630
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,255
and the reputation of being
a dragon slayer among the merfolk

631
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:36,336
were not his true intentions.

632
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,296
It was the circumstances
that made him a hero.

633
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:40,495
He has the ability to pacify the world.

634
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,415
When the time comes,
he won't have a choice.

635
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:45,056
General Qing,
you can simply wait and see.

636
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:47,455
Are you so attached

637
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,495
to that position?

638
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,536
No matter who occupies that position,

639
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:53,455
you're still willing to marry?

640
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:54,735
Please stop making

641
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:55,695
such rebellious remarks.

642
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:00,136
My mind is set.

643
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:01,455
I'm determined.

644
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:03,455
General Qing,

645
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:04,935
you should focus on your own affairs.

646
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,776
You're about to set out for battle.

647
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:08,816
There is no certainty
on the battlefield.

648
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,096
My brother is formidable.

649
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:13,576
If he sparred with you,

650
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,296
he wouldn't stop until he wins.

651
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,655
If he offers you a toast,

652
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,856
you better not touch a drop.

653
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:23,576
I wish you victory on the battlefield.

654
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:03,296
Master,

655
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:04,975
I have good news to share.

656
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:06,336
My father sent a letter saying

657
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:07,536
that the siege of Xia City
has been lifted.

658
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:09,615
The military supplies have arrived,
and the soldiers' morale is high.

659
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:11,376
Jialan has also sent troops to support.

660
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:12,535
The crisis in Extreme Wind City

661
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:13,615
has been alleviated.

662
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,216
He told us not to worry anymore.

663
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:18,176
Well,

664
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:19,935
I also have something

665
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:21,055
to share with you.

666
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:22,776
Master, please tell me.

667
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:25,296
I have important matters to attend to

668
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,696
and need to leave Western Huang.

669
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:29,415
And you're going back
to Extreme Wind City.

670
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:31,455
We've traveled together
all the way here.

671
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:32,776
I'm afraid

672
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:34,575
we'll have to part here.

673
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,415
I won't stop you

674
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:40,935
if you want to leave.

675
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:43,176
But are you truly healed

676
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:44,935
from your injuries?

677
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:46,495
Naturally.

678
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:48,736
Is that so?

679
00:34:54,015 --> 00:34:55,296
I was just stretching my muscles.

680
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:04,896
Where are you going?

681
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:08,015
I was tracking a nimbus.

682
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:09,656
But currently,

683
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,856
I've lost track of it.

684
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:12,816
So I'm heading to the mountaintop

685
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:14,336
to observe the stars.

686
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,455
(If Master
has truly regained his power,)

687
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,176
(he would have ridden with the wind
to the mountaintop.)

688
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:32,415
(But)

689
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:33,816
(Master)

690
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:35,176
(might want to take a walk.)

691
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:36,776
(No, I must test him.)

692
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:40,336
Are you all right?

693
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:44,575
It hurts.

694
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:53,376
Your muscle and bones are fine.

695
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:54,816
You'll be fine after some rest.

696
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,296
How about this?

697
00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:57,336
Wait here.

698
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,736
I'll be back soon.

699
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:06,495
Master,

700
00:36:06,975 --> 00:36:08,256
even if you've recovered your power,

701
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:09,856
you just recovered.

702
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,296
I'm worried if you go alone.

703
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:15,455
I'll carry you up to the mountaintop.

704
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:38,376
(Am I dreaming?)

705
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:43,336
Hold on tight.

706
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:44,256
Or else

707
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,415
you'll fall.

708
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:47,615
Yan,

709
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,296
did you hurt yourself

710
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,055
to test

711
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:54,095
if my power has recovered

712
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,055
and see if I can treat your injury?

713
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:04,256
Look below your feet.

714
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,015
Master,

715
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:10,535
did you do this?

716
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,376
That's awesome!

717
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,135
Silly.

718
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:20,575
If I didn't twist my ankle,

719
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:21,656
I'm afraid

720
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:22,975
you'll expose me like you did

721
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:24,415
in the Emperor Valley.

722
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:37,055
Master,

723
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:38,816
you've truly recovered.

724
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:44,656
You didn't blame me
even after you've recovered.

725
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,455
Of course, I have to blame you.

726
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,696
That's why I'm not treating your ankle

727
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,535
and punishing you to suffer for a while.

728
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,816
It's so beautiful.

729
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:10,615
Master, look at that.

730
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:12,615
This is incredible.

731
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:15,896
It's so beautiful.

732
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:18,095
Master, look!

733
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:23,455
(Luckily, I'm here.)

734
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,296
(Or else Ying)

735
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,055
(would have blown his cover.)

736
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:45,615
Since the appearance of the Evil Star,

737
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:47,696
it has been appearing periodically.

738
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,776
After it appeared in Xia City,

739
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:53,696
its whereabouts are still unknown.

740
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,696
I don't know what's the reason.

741
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,896
Could this be a hint

742
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:01,696
that the Evil Star's master

743
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:04,176
is on the brink of death?

744
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:07,176
Master,

745
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,975
did you descend the mountain

746
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:11,336
because of the presence of the Evil Star
in the mortal world?

747
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:12,656
Yes.

748
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:15,256
But

749
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,336
I'm also here because of you.

750
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,296
After all, you're my first disciple.

751
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:24,055
I can't

752
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:25,376
let you die

753
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:26,776
in Huotu Tribe in vain.

754
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:31,336
Like always, you're afraid

755
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,615
of admitting

756
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:33,535
that you're concerned about me.

757
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,135
In any case,

758
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:40,495
the appearance of the Evil Star

759
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
concerns the rise and fall of Kongsang.

760
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:44,736
So

761
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,656
I must investigate this.

762
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:49,935
If this star

763
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,736
is truly ominous,

764
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:53,696
I must take action

765
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:56,415
before the disaster happens.

766
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,696
I cannot let the world suffer

767
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:01,376
because of it.

768
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:03,015
Actually,

769
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:05,376
the world has been unfairly judging you

770
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:07,656
for what happened

771
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:08,935
to Lady Qiushui.

772
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:12,575
Why do you still care so much

773
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:13,816
about the people of the world?

774
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:17,535
Because you're among the people
of the world.

775
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:26,415
Master.

776
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:30,336
Not forgetting your parents,

777
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:31,856
your friends,

778
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,776
and my old acquaintances.

779
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:36,336
All of you

780
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,696
are innocent.

781
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:40,376
So

782
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:42,535
stop asking

783
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,015
such childish questions anymore.

784
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,216
I'll keep tracking

785
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:48,696
the whereabouts of the Evil Star.

786
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:50,535
But

787
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:52,415
I can't see the nimbus

788
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:54,336
with my naked eyes.

789
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:57,256
I must head

790
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:58,495
to Jialan's White Tower
to observe the stars.

791
00:41:59,495 --> 00:41:59,935
Tomorrow,

792
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,336
we'll part ways.

793
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:05,336
Master.

794
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:07,176
Yan'er,

795
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:09,975
you're an emotionally devoted person.

796
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,575
I made you cry in sadness

797
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,296
each time we separated.

798
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,495
But this time,

799
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:20,415
I don't want it to be the same.

800
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:22,455
So, tell me.

801
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:24,256
Do you have any other wishes?

802
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:25,296
You can tell me

803
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:26,856
and I'll do my best to fulfill it.

804
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,816
Can you play the flute for me

805
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,095
once again?

806
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:34,776
The flute?

807
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:38,296
Do you still remember you gave me

808
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,216
a jade flute before?

809
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:40,535
I thought

810
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:42,415
I would have another chance to hear it.

811
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:44,736
But

812
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:46,256
since the incident at Cangwu Abyss,

813
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:50,336
we were injured and recovering.

814
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,176
I didn't even have

815
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:52,856
that many opportunities

816
00:42:52,975 --> 00:42:54,015
to have a proper conversation with you

817
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,656
before I left the mountain.

818
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:00,935
And you promised me

819
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:02,455
that you would buy me a drink

820
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:03,975
after breaking through each stage.

821
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:05,935
Although

822
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:09,575
it seems unlikely to drink now,

823
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,336
I still want you

824
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:13,176
to play the flute for me.

825
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:14,615
Sure.

826
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,776
But I didn't bring it with me.

827
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:18,135
I did bring it.

828
00:44:29,495 --> 00:44:30,615
Physician Xu said

829
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:31,455
it takes three days

830
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:32,736
for your powers to fully recovered.

831
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:34,176
Why don't we wait until tomorrow?

832
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:35,055
Look at the current situation.

833
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,216
I can't even take you

834
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:36,856
to fly with me.

835
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:37,696
We had to ride the horses.

836
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,495
Just let her take care of you

837
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:40,656
for one more day.

838
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:41,376
What's there to fear?

839
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:43,736
I don't want to waste any more time.

840
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:44,376
Master!

841
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,176
I'll let you two talk.

842
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:57,256
I need to find a restroom.

843
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:00,376
Master,

844
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:01,935
you said

845
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:03,455
you don't want
to make me sad and cry again.

846
00:45:03,975 --> 00:45:04,736
But this time,

847
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:06,135
you lied to me again.

848
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:07,896
Those people

849
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:09,696
were falsely accusing you
of being a dragon slayer.

850
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:11,216
After the battle of Xia City,

851
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,216
you're making yourself a target

852
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,696
of the entire merfolk once again.

853
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:16,095
Now,

854
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,535
I'm afraid the Merfolk marine force
of the entire Western Huang

855
00:45:17,776 --> 00:45:18,736
is hunting you.

856
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:20,935
And you've also lost your power.

857
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:22,495
What are you going to do
if you run into them?

858
00:45:23,975 --> 00:45:24,856
Chong Ming can protect me.

859
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,015
Master, watch out!

860
00:45:31,256 --> 00:45:31,615
