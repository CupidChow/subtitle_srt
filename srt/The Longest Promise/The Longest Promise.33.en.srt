(Movement Information of Kongsong Army)

21
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:28,392
Who's out there?

22
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:29,512
It's me.

23
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,672
Am I not welcome here, General Qing?

24
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:38,191
Of course, not.

25
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:39,751
Come.

26
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,112
Please take a seat.

27
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,151
Why?

28
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:57,471
I'm the princess of the White Clan.

29
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,191
Can't I know about military affairs?

30
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,352
Didn't you tell me

31
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,191
that I should put my concerns
on the bigger picture

32
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,952
and not be obsessed
with something trivial?

33
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,151
I want to chip in for the military too.

34
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:09,151
You despised me because I'm a woman?

35
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:10,311
Certainly, not.

36
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:12,952
Zhu Yan was so helpful

37
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:13,711
in relieving Xia City from danger.

38
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,672
She has done justice to her heroic name
as Jiang Bead Flying Flame.

39
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:18,672
She dedicated herself to the nation
despite her gender.

40
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:19,792
Xuelu.

41
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:21,031
You can do this too.

42
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,191
Enough about Zhu Yan.

43
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,272
Both of you were always together

44
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,552
when you were in Jiuyi Mountain.

45
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,992
She has already rejected your proposal.

46
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,191
Why do you keep mentioning her?

47
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,272
Don't tell me

48
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,591
you can't get over her.

49
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:41,512
Honestly,

50
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,512
I've been recalling

51
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:49,112
what you said to me recently

52
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:50,832
and I've been studying books
on the art of war.

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,431
Can you tell me

54
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,792
what happened during the war
with the Merfolk Clan?

55
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,352
What are you interested in?

56
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,352
Let's start with this.

57
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:09,952
Why do you deploy defense

58
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,151
at the Dragon King Temple?

59
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:12,832
The river

60
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,751
was abruptly diverted.

61
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:16,511
And the Dragon King Temple
was built upon.

62
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:18,152
It must be something
suspicious going on.

63
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,191
When I got back that day,

64
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:04,352
I realized the moon in the sky

65
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:06,552
was as round as the one

66
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,511
we saw

67
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,552
at the foot of the Jiuyi Mountain.

68
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:17,912
General Qing.

69
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,271
Can I really choose another path?

70
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,152
Xuelu.

71
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,511
Is that what you think?

72
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,152
Answer me first.

73
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,232
Of course.

74
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,152
Of course, you can.

75
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:36,552
What if

76
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:38,951
I made a lot of mistakes

77
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,352
before?

78
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:43,672
Don't you mind it?

79
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:46,712
No.

80
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:53,792
Now close your eyes.

81
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:00,592
Xuelu.

82
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,751
I can't believe this is happening.

83
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,352
You're beautiful.

84
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,631
Thank you, General Qing.

85
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:26,191
I'll get going.

86
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:28,951
Hold on.

87
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:33,631
I have something for you.

88
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,232
This is my heirloom.

89
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:37,951
Please accept this.

90
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,592
The heirloom is precious.

91
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,112
General Qing,

92
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:47,472
you can't simply give it to anyone.

93
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,431
Please be prudent.

94
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,191
If I encounter dangers

95
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:57,871
on the battlefield,

96
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:00,871
I hope the last owner

97
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:01,712
of this jade pendant

98
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:03,391
can be you.

99
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,511
General Qing.

100
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,472
Priest wants to see you.

101
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:18,391
Xuelu,

102
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:20,751
once the war is settled down,

103
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:23,032
I'll go to your father
to propose a marriage.

104
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:50,192
Priest.

105
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:06,112
(Xuelu succeeded.)

106
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,751
This lady is the henchperson
of the Sea Emperor.

107
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,671
Take this drawing and
plaster it all over the city.

108
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:18,232
If we can find her,

109
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:20,352
we might lure the big fish out

110
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,871
and locate the Sea Emperor.

111
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:22,911
All right.

112
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,671
But you're already in a truce

113
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,712
with the Sea Emperor, right?

114
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:29,391
Why didn't you draw

115
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,671
the Sea Emperor's portrait?

116
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,151
(It seems that Shi Ying doesn't want us)

117
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,031
(to know the countenance of the Sea Emperor.)

118
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,511
(He must be hiding something.)

119
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,751
(I'm going to dig it out.)

120
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,791
(It'll surely be leverage against him.)

121
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:52,592
Do you know her?

122
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,192
How bold she is!

123
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,352
If she falls into my hand,

124
00:09:58,151 --> 00:09:59,232
I won't let her off the hook.

125
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:02,751
Priest.

126
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:05,312
I'll dispatch people to plaster
this notice all over

127
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,072
and search for this woman.

128
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:07,671
All right.

129
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:08,992
But

130
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,551
don't alert the enemy.

131
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,072
(How lucky.)

132
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,352
(Ruyi turns out to be
the subordinate of the Sea Emperor.)

133
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:22,712
(If I can seize the Sea Emperor...)

134
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,360
(Xinghaiyun Pleasure House, Ye City)

135
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,192
Out of my sight.

136
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:52,832
Why hasn't she shown up?

137
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:53,832
Listen to me carefully.

138
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:54,192
Mister.

139
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,511
I want Ruyi now.

140
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:56,151
Don't you brush me off

141
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,232
with such lowly jades.

142
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:58,992
Regardless of how precious she is,

143
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,551
she's merely a jade.

144
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,232
I'm loaded with wealth.

145
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,232
No one can snatch her from me.

146
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,992
I'm going to take a hard look

147
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,352
on how divine Ruyi is.

148
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,031
Qing.

149
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:14,631
Evacuate all the members

150
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,952
through the secret passage

151
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:16,871
in my room.

152
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,151
Here's the list for the first batch.

153
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:23,112
They've collected most information here

154
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,751
over the years

155
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:26,712
and are the most dangerous ones
if they stay.

156
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,112
27 people in total.

157
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,511
What about you?

158
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,312
After all of you leave here safely,

159
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,151
I'll set off.

160
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,911
After all, Ruyi is the icon

161
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,592
of Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

162
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:37,871
The Kongsang Army

163
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:38,631
will be alerted

164
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,712
if I disappear.

165
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:43,432
Go ahead.

166
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,232
Yes.

167
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:53,631
Brother.

168
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:55,992
Finally, we can

169
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:57,232
return to the Biluo Sea together.

170
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,151
Come on, come hither.

171
00:11:59,151 --> 00:11:59,551
Mr. Wang.

172
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,151
Come on.

173
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,232
Come on.

174
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:03,712
Faster. Come on in.

175
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:04,712
Come and visit us.

176
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,511
Master, come on.

177
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,192
Come on and visit us.

178
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,232
Let's have some brew inside.

179
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,072
Come on.

180
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:10,992
Master.

181
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:11,832
Come and let's play.

182
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:15,031
Isn't this Mr. Bai?

183
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,472
General Bai.

184
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:18,112
You...

185
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,592
What else can I do here?

186
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:20,472
Don't you know?

187
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,791
- No, Master.
- How dare you hit me!

188
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,271
No, Master.

189
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,511
How dare you snatch Ruyi from me!

190
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:31,871
Ruyi isn't going to meet

191
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,192
crude people like you.

192
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:34,712
I'll kill you.

193
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:35,871
Leave, everyone.

194
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:43,592
Please be careful.

195
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,232
I'm good. Go ahead.

196
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,192
Please come back safely.

197
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:46,592
I will.

198
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:48,952
Let's go. Ruyi.

199
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:49,712
Be good.

200
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,352
Miss Ruyi.

201
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:51,511
Bai Fenglin comes in.

202
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,072
And he has the army
to lay siege outside.

203
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:54,791
What do we do now?

204
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:57,352
It's fine.

205
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:58,312
Keep on moving.

206
00:12:58,391 --> 00:12:59,472
Don't get affected.

207
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:00,511
Go in now.

208
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:01,031
Go on.

209
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:02,511
Ruyi.

210
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,472
Ruyi is mine.

211
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:25,352
Yours?

212
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,192
What about me?

213
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:33,751
General Bai.

214
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,271
Are these enough?

215
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,271
Yes.

216
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:37,791
General Bai.

217
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,112
Please wait for a moment.

218
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,911
I'll invite Miss Ruyi here now.

219
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:41,712
No need.

220
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:42,832
I know where she is.

221
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,151
General Bai, no rush.

222
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:46,391
Miss Ruyi...

223
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:47,992
She...

224
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,952
She feels sick today.

225
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:51,992
I must go and check on her now.

226
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:14,192
- Ruyi!
- Ruyi!

227
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:15,511
I'm all right.

228
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,151
Sorry to keep you waiting.

229
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,312
Ruyi.

230
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,232
It's so crowded here.

231
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:22,472
Why don't we

232
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,671
go to your room for a catch-up?

233
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,911
Every master here

234
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:28,712
are of noble origins and influential,

235
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,472
and they came from afar.

236
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,712
Besides, they're willing
to contribute generously for my sake.

237
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,312
I'd like to present a song

238
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,112
as a token of gratitude.

239
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,112
General Bai is the Governor of Ye City.

240
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,871
I believe you're generous enough

241
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,592
to spare us some time.

242
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,352
Do as you wish.

243
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:34,671
Faster.

244
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:36,472
Faster.

245
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:38,271
Be quick.

246
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:40,271
Go in.

247
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:09,992
Faster.

248
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:14,151
Go in.

249
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,312
Hurry up.

250
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:16,911
Faster.

251
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:27,592
Hurry.

252
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:28,631
Faster.

253
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,832
Come on, keep on moving.

254
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:04,912
Good.

255
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,511
- Good!
- Good!

256
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:10,872
Bravo, Miss Ruyi.

257
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:11,672
Wonderful.

258
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,432
Beauty,

259
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:49,111
you're too good for a traitor.

260
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:51,271
Ruyi.

261
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,712
As long as you tell me

262
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:54,992
the whereabouts of the Sea Emperor,

263
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:58,192
I will keep you safe

264
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,831
concerning our good old times together.

265
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,071
Look at your dainty face.

266
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,791
I really can't

267
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,071
ruin it.

268
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,831
Good old times?

269
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:22,432
Staying with a scum

270
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,311
like you

271
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,712
in one room

272
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,632
makes me sick.

273
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,551
You undesirable and dirty

274
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,872
mermaid jade!

275
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:36,952
Who do you think you are?

276
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,031
Bai Fenglin.

277
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,591
If you don't take my life today,

278
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,152
I'll make

279
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:55,992
the evildoing

280
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:57,751
you've done all these years

281
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,111
known to the public.

282
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:03,831
Ruyi.

283
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,031
Since you're determined to die,

284
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:10,392
I will have myriad ways to torture you,

285
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,591
but I won't kill you.

286
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:23,071
Over the past years,

287
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:24,992
you've been struggling inside this mire

288
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,351
for the sake of the Merfolk Clan.

289
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,551
You're tired now.

290
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,432
Go on and reveal all the secrets.

291
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,472
Let go of everything,

292
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,551
and you'll be free.

293
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:41,791
Not telling?

294
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,712
Come clean.

295
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,472
Now.

296
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:49,232
Let go of her.

297
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,551
Bai Fenglin.

298
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,232
She's the wanted criminal
of the imperial court.

299
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,632
You shouldn't skip past Shi Ying

300
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,712
to interrogate her directly.

301
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:16,712
Also,

302
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:17,912
why did you pretend not to recognize her

303
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:18,912
when you saw her portrait

304
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:20,751
and come here?

305
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:22,791
I knew you were up to something.

306
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:25,672
At first, the portrait

307
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:26,632
did ring a bell,

308
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,232
but I didn't recognize her as Ruyi.

309
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,392
That was why I came here...

310
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:30,912
You may leave now.

311
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:51,912
Priest, you're benevolent.

312
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:54,232
If the Emperor of Kongsang

313
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,071
were to take the world
to his bosom like you do,

314
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,551
both of our clans wouldn't have ended up

315
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,232
in an endless desperate war.

316
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:01,872
How dare you make mischief here!

317
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:03,071
It was the Merfolk Clan

318
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:04,511
who turned against us.

319
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,392
Priest, you're like the immortal beyond.

320
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,791
How could you notice

321
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:13,071
scoundrels like Bai Fenglin

322
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,271
who keep pushing our clan

323
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,432
to death?

324
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,712
I won't comment on the war.

325
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:23,511
But you saved my life today.

326
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,031
By right,

327
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,672
I should return your favor.

328
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,031
So,

329
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,271
I'm going to tell

330
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,271
a huge secret.

331
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:34,831
Confess about the whereabouts

332
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:35,912
of the Sea Emperor now.

333
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,031
What I'm going to tell you

334
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,511
is about Lady Qiushui.

335
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:48,271
Qiushui.

336
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:51,392
I have an important task for you.

337
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:55,271
We must capture the leader.

338
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,432
Go undercover

339
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:58,632
beside Emperor Beimian

340
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:00,311
and beguile him

341
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:02,712
with your beauty.

342
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,311
But you should know

343
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:06,831
that you must stay
by Emperor Beimian's side

344
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,232
lifelong

345
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,712
until you die

346
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,672
before you're allowed
to return to Biluo Sea.

347
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,511
Rest assured, Elder.

348
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,152
I've prepared to dedicate myself

349
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,591
for the sake of the clan.

350
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:23,071
You will stay here.

351
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,432
Xinghaiyun Pleasure House is the huge
intelligence network of Sea Kingdom

352
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,111
that sits in Kongsang.

353
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:29,232
It has been providing us

354
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:30,311
with constant fund flow and intel

355
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:32,432
as to restore our kingdom.

356
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,751
The Kongsang people killed your father,

357
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:37,591
brother, and loved ones.

358
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:38,992
You'll stay here

359
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,311
to avenge them

360
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,192
in another way.

361
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,791
Can you do it?

362
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,152
I can.

363
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:06,632
Elder.

364
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:15,551
It's been a long while.

365
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,551
You never failed our expectations.

366
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:19,712
I, Qiushui, have fulfilled my mission.

367
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,271
Emperor Beimian has
been latching onto me.

368
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:23,031
Very good.

369
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:25,632
Now, you should

370
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,992
kill his elder son,

371
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:28,472
Shi Ying.

372
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:30,672
I...

373
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:32,872
Why?

374
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,952
Shi Ying is an unparalleled prodigy.

375
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,392
If he were to ascend to the throne
in the future,

376
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:38,751
our restoration mission

377
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,152
will be more difficult.

378
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,872
So, before he grows strong,

379
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,952
we should eliminate him
as soon as possible.

380
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:48,872
Why are you hesitant

381
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,031
to kill the Kongsang people?

382
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:53,111
If you fail to take his life,

383
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:54,432
figure something out

384
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:56,232
to let Emperor Beimian lose trust in him

385
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,551
and strip him of his position
as the Crown Prince.

386
00:23:58,432 --> 00:23:58,952
Remember this well.

387
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,111
This act is earthshaking.

388
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,192
You're not allowed to fail.

389
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:05,952
Yes.

390
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:14,912
Hence,

391
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:16,992
after years of being undercover

392
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,751
beside Emperor Beimian,

393
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:20,632
Qiushui dedicated her life

394
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:23,472
to her mission.

395
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:25,992
It turns out Lady Qiushui

396
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:28,432
is the spy planted
by the Merfolk marine force.

397
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:31,152
Qiushui's sacrifice was worthwhile.

398
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,392
If you were still the Crown Prince now,

399
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:36,712
Kongsang wouldn't have

400
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:39,031
rotten to its core now.

401
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,712
If it wasn't for Kongsang to reach
the brink of collapse,

402
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:45,751
the Sea Emperor wouldn't have returned

403
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,271
to rescue the Sea Kingdom.

404
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,271
I'll take you to the Emperor

405
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:50,912
and you confess everything to him.

406
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:54,992
Do you know

407
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,432
why I'd bring up this past

408
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:00,392
right now?

409
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:04,872
Priest.

410
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:08,672
When you were listening to me just now,

411
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:11,511
I've already used my dream realm

412
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:12,952
to cover

413
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:14,712
all my memories.

414
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:17,351
Priest.

415
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:20,351
Now,

416
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,912
I've forgotten everything.

417
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,712
If she were to end here,

418
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:43,632
that'd be her retribution.

419
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,271
How do you heal her heart meridian?

420
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:01,632
Over the years,

421
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:03,271
she's been in this mire

422
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:04,751
collecting intel.

423
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:06,992
She's just a pitiful soul

424
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:08,472
used by the Merfolk marine force.

425
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:09,591
Besides,

426
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,992
she's already forgotten everything.

427
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,511
She deserves to live on

428
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,232
if she manages to survive.

429
00:26:16,712 --> 00:26:17,511
Let her be.

430
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:20,992
You always put yourself
in others' shoes.

431
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,031
But now her mind is blank,

432
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,591
she can't prove you and

433
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:25,271
your mother's innocence

434
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:26,192
before the Emperor.

435
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:29,672
Innocence?

436
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,912
In fact, he's long known

437
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,472
the truth.

438
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:38,831
However,

439
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,071
for the sake

440
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:41,751
of his dignity

441
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,311
and his beloved woman,

442
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,511
he'd rather wrong us.

443
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:47,712
So,

444
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:49,712
the one who killed my mother

445
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,392
wasn't Qiushui,

446
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,271
but the Emperor Beimian.

447
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,311
With such a father

448
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:00,751
and emperor,

449
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,271
nothing much will change

450
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:05,031
even if I've found evidence.

451
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:07,271
I've been living for ten thousand years

452
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,591
and I've seen a lot of rulers

453
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:09,632
who fell prey

454
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,591
to honey trap.

455
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,791
Fortunately,

456
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,392
you're not like him in the slightest.

457
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,392
It's a shame that I'm not a woman.

458
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:18,672
Otherwise,

459
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,152
I could've defeated Lady Qiushui

460
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:22,791
and won over Emperor Beimian's heart,

461
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:23,751
telling him to take care of you.

462
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:27,311
Chong Ming.

463
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:29,152
I'm no longer the emotional boy

464
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,791
I was back then.

465
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,712
No need to comfort me.

466
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,311
Our priority now

467
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:36,751
is to capture the Sea Emperor.

468
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:38,232
Nothing is more important

469
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:39,511
than that.

470
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:42,192
But how can we capture him?

471
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:45,432
The Merfolk marine force
in Xinghaiyun Pleasure House

472
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,952
must be more than just Ruyi.

473
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,351
Besides, Ruyi is crucial

474
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:50,432
among the Merfolk.

475
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:51,591
I think

476
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:53,392
someone has already
informed the Sea Emperor

477
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:55,152
about our movements.

478
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:57,751
But I doubt Zhi Yuan

479
00:27:58,271 --> 00:27:59,831
will risk himself for her.

480
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:05,311
I've seen the way
Zhi Yuan looked at her.

481
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:07,591
Your Majesty.

482
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,232
I came here for the Sea Emperor.

483
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,111
He cares about her.

484
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,351
So,

485
00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:22,952
he will come.

486
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:26,672
Watch yourself well along the journey.

487
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:27,591
Yes.

488
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,071
Uncle Yuan, thank you.

489
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:42,432
Where's Ruyi?

490
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,632
Why hasn't she returned?

491
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:45,712
Your Majesty.

492
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,311
Miss Ruyi is trapped
in Xinghaiyun Pleasure House

493
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:49,432
by the Kongsang Army.

494
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:50,992
Xinghaiyun Pleasure House?

495
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:51,712
Yes.

496
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,152
Why did Ruyi...

497
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,111
Your Majesty.

498
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:58,071
Miss Ruyi has

499
00:28:58,392 --> 00:28:58,791
taken charge

500
00:28:58,992 --> 00:28:59,831
of Haihun Gorge

501
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:00,912
and collected intelligence
about Kongsang

502
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,271
in Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

503
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:03,591
Today,

504
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,311
she's helping the members

505
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:05,712
of Haihun Gorge to evacuate.

506
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:06,992
But I failed

507
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:07,992
to protect Miss Ruyi.

508
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:09,351
- Please punish me.
- No.

509
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:14,392
Speaking of which,

510
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,912
it's my fault

511
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,311
for not taking good care

512
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:19,511
of my sister all these years.

513
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:22,232
I'll bring her back.

514
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:23,551
Don't go there rashly, Your Majesty.

515
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:24,712
Your Majesty.

516
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,472
There's a secret passage

517
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:27,632
underneath Xinghaiyun Pleasure House,

518
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:29,232
which leads directly to Ruyi's room.

519
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:32,031
And that secret passage also connects

520
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,751
to Haihun Gorge,
the entrance to the Biluo Sea.

521
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:35,031
This is the reason

522
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:36,432
why Xinghaiyun Pleasure House

523
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:37,392
was built there.

524
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,952
(It's only been a few days.)

525
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,632
(The distance between Master and I)

526
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:06,192
(has grown apart.)

527
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:08,551
(Does he still hold onto
the misconception)

528
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,791
(about Yuan?)

529
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:15,831
Young Lady.

530
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:16,912
You tasked me

531
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:17,992
to scout for news.

532
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,672
I found this today.

533
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:20,992
This person

534
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:21,912
is on the wanted list
of the Kongsang Army.

535
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:24,031
This...

536
00:30:24,511 --> 00:30:25,751
Isn't this Yuan's younger sister?

537
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,751
Young Lady, do you know her?

538
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:31,071
Who's after her?

539
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:32,632
The Kongsang Army.

540
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,831
I suppose it should be Priest.

541
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:38,511
The current condition

542
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:39,992
is like from the frying pan

543
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,472
into the fire.

544
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:46,472
(If I encounter dangers
on the battlefield,)

545
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:48,551
(I hope the last owner)

546
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:49,551
(of this jade pendant)

547
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:51,392
(can be you.)

548
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,232
Qing Gang.

549
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:57,992
You're silly.

550
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,152
Would you still give me this

551
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:05,712
if you knew that I duped you?

552
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:11,672
For a woman who disregards

553
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:13,351
the interest of the nation like me,

554
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:16,551
General Qing couldn't care less

555
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:17,672
about me.

556
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:22,432
Princess.

557
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:23,952
Princess Zhu Yan is here.

558
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:26,672
Show her in.

559
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:28,751
Xuelu.

560
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,472
I need to see my Master
for something urgent.

561
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:36,432
What's it about?

562
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:37,672
I want to see him

563
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,031
not for something personal.

564
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:40,551
It's relevant

565
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,071
to the possibility of
a ceasefire of the war.

566
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:43,831
If you know his whereabouts,

567
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:45,152
please tell me.

568
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:50,392
(Zhu Yan was so helpful)

569
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:51,031
(in relieving Xia City from danger.)

570
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:53,831
She has done justice to her heroic name
as Jiang Bead Flying Flame.

571
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:55,751
She dedicated herself to the nation
despite her gender.

572
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:57,311
Xuelu.

573
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:58,751
You can do this too.

574
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:03,031
He went to Xinghaiyun Pleasure House

575
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,551
to seize the Sea Emperor.

576
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,071
Xinghaiyun Pleasure House?

577
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:09,952
Got it. Thank you.

578
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,831
(They are wearing armor)

579
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:40,192
(under the garment.)

580
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:42,751
(Are they soldiers?)

581
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:44,551
The atmosphere around
this pleasure house

582
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:46,831
feels weird, though.

583
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:50,392
Why is Princess here?

584
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
(Xinghaiyun Pleasure House, Ye City)

585
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:33,271
(As I thought,)

586
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:34,672
(these patrons
are disguised by soldiers.)

587
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:36,232
(The Kongsang Army has)

588
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:37,031
(secretly taken hold of this place.)

589
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:52,232
Zhu Yan.

590
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,031
Why are you here?

591
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,872
Qing Gang.

592
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:55,791
Help me, please.

593
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:56,952
I have something urgent

594
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:57,831
to talk to Master.

595
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:00,952
Princess Zhu Yan.

596
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:02,232
You really enjoy

597
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:03,831
making difficult requests.

598
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,392
Priest is in the middle of interrogating

599
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:08,671
the courtesan, Ruyi.

600
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:10,711
He instructed me

601
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:12,792
not to let anyone disturb him.

602
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:14,912
Qing Gang.

603
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:16,272
I really have something important

604
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:17,231
to tell Master.

605
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:19,992
Please.

606
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:25,551
General Qing and I

607
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,071
want to help you.

608
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:28,752
But maybe you have no idea

609
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:29,912
what interrogation looks like.

610
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:32,551
Severe punishment will be used.

611
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:34,511
After the interrogation,

612
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,551
the suspects are likely
to be covered by wounds.

613
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:37,872
Do you think

614
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:39,352
I can let you

615
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,551
disrupt this session?

616
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:42,912
Master

617
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:45,111
won't be so cruel.

618
00:34:48,992 --> 00:34:50,151
Whether he's cruel or not

619
00:34:50,832 --> 00:34:52,472
depends on how anxious Priest is.

620
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,711
As of now, Priest is eager

621
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:55,872
to find the Sea Emperor,

622
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,912
I'm afraid his cruelty

623
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:01,031
can be beyond belief.

624
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:02,872
Nonsense!

625
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:05,352
If you don't let me in,

626
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,031
I'll force my way in.

627
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:08,031
Zhu Yan.

628
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:10,031
Stay composed.

629
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:11,551
Don't interrupt Priest.

630
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:14,432
General Bai.

631
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:17,231
Does Priest really shut
anyone out for now?

632
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:20,392
I've already told you

633
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,352
what Priest means.

634
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:24,792
If you keep

635
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,031
pestering us,

636
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:27,352
is it because

637
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:28,591
you think you're someone special

638
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:30,472
to Priest?

639
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:33,272
Fine.

640
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:35,312
I'll leave.

641
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:36,272
Yan'er.

642
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:38,392
Come up.

643
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,671
(We're setting up
to lure the Sea Emperor,)

644
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:45,591
(but Zhu Yan came here anxiously)

645
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,151
(insisting on meeting Shi Ying.)

646
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,671
(Does anything go on between)

647
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:50,671
(the Sea Emperor and Zhu Yan?)

648
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,111
(Shi Ying didn't draw)

649
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,111
(the Sea Emperor's portrait.)

650
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,312
(Is it because he was trying
to protect Zhu Yan?)

651
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:00,231
Master.

652
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:01,231
Where's Ruyi?

653
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:02,671
Did you capture her?

654
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:03,872
Yan'er.

655
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:04,992
Did you come here

656
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:06,231
just for this?

657
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,151
Didn't I tell you

658
00:36:08,352 --> 00:36:08,952
to stay out of this

659
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:10,191
when we were in Jialan last time?

660
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,272
Master.

661
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:12,392
I can't allow

662
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:13,591
both you and Yuan
to go against each other.

663
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:20,912
Master.

664
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:25,591
Zhu Yan.

665
00:36:25,872 --> 00:36:26,432
Why are you here?

666
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:27,272
I'm on guard duty here.

667
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,071
No one comes in.

668
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,352
Master.

669
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,752
Just now, she was still here.

670
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:49,872
Chong Ming.

671
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:51,352
Inform Qing Gang and Bai Fenglin

672
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:52,832
that the Sea Emperor shows up.

673
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,792
Surround Xinghaiyun Pleasure House.

674
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:55,432
Zhu Yan.

675
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,151
Don't let them run off.

676
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:45,231
Ruyi.

677
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:48,312
It's my fault.

678
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:50,031
I failed to look after you.

679
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:52,832
I will never let you

680
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:53,832
suffer again.

681
00:37:57,832 --> 00:37:58,312
Sea Emperor.

682
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:13,472
Yuan.

683
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,231
Yuan.

684
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:18,872
Are you all right?

685
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:19,711
Yan'er.

686
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:21,312
Why are you here?

687
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:22,711
Don't step into this trouble.

688
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:26,671
Yuan, it's fine.

689
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,071
I'll explain to Master.

690
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:31,231
Zhu Yan.

691
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:33,472
Are you aware of what you're doing now?

692
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:34,912
Master.

693
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:35,631
Yan'er.

694
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,912
I know you lose your head in anger.

695
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,432
But you should realize

696
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:39,392
that it was Elder Jian

697
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:40,432
behind that incident.

698
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,151
Yuan has already killed Elder Jian

699
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,352
and he's trying

700
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:44,191
to withdraw the Merfolk marine force

701
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:45,031
from various places.

702
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:46,591
This is just a misunderstanding

703
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:48,231
between you two.

704
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:49,511
Misunderstanding?

705
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:50,792
How could you

706
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:51,872
make that conclusion

707
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:53,392
after so many Kongsang people
have sacrificed?

708
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:55,031
But

709
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,992
Yuan isn't the cause of all chaos.

710
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:58,631
Fine.

711
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:00,312
Today,

712
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:01,551
in front of the Sea Emperor,

713
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:02,591
I'll tell you

714
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:04,191
the rightful reason

715
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,551
why I must kill him.

716
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:09,671
And to clear your doubt too.

717
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:13,591
Ruyi committed herself to such a place

718
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:15,752
as to gather intelligence

719
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,671
and devoted herself
to the dignitaries of Kongsang.

720
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,312
Isn't she

721
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:20,312
ambitious enough?

722
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:21,952
She was willing to create a dream

723
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:23,711
to destroy her past

724
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:25,272
to stop me

725
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:25,912
from obtaining a slice of news

726
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:27,992
about the Sea Emperor.

727
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,472
Isn't she cruel to herself?

728
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:33,231
Besides, she's not the only one

729
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:34,992
who does this.

730
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:36,952
Ruyi told me

731
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,111
that Lady Qiushui

732
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:41,111
served the Merfolk marine force too.

733
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:42,792
Master.

734
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:45,671
Back then,

735
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:47,472
Lady Qiushui

736
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,472
was willing to enter the palace

737
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,111
to sow discord

738
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:53,071
just because of a prophecy
that the prodigy Crown Prince

739
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:54,312
of Kongsang was born.

740
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:55,952
Ultimately,

741
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:58,432
she even killed herself
to ruin the Crown Prince.

742
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:00,472
At that time,

743
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:02,992
she was already eight months pregnant.

744
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:05,312
I'll tell you about this

745
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:07,392
not because I'm holding
personal grudges.

746
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:09,432
Instead, I want you to know

747
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:11,792
that the death warriors of Sea Kingdom

748
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:13,711
are so much determined

749
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:15,191
for the goal of restoring their kingdom.

750
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,111
As long as the Sea Emperor doesn't die,

751
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:19,432
they won't give up

752
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:20,511
causing havoc to Kongsang.

753
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,992
Besides, as the Evil Star manifested,

754
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:25,191
the Sea Kingdom
will exterminate Kongsang

755
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:26,752
in seventy years.

756
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:29,392
So,

757
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,151
the Sea Emperor must die.

758
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:37,631
Once the war begins,

759
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:39,671
it's out of our hand

760
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:42,352
to stop it.

761
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,111
This is a war between two kingdoms.

762
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:45,792
Someone has to step forward

763
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:46,912
to take responsibility.

764
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,392
And this person

765
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:49,832
should be me,

766
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,031
the Sea Emperor.

767
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,231
The duel between Priest and me

768
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,111
is my duty to fulfill.

769
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:00,191
You should leave now.

770
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,752
The prophecy said that the Evil Star
would eliminate Kongsang.

771
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,151
But nothing is predictable.

772
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:05,432
Even the prophecy

773
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:06,511
may not necessarily come true.

774
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:07,631
How can we kill

775
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:08,631
an innocent person

776
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:10,472
for a disaster that hasn't happened yet?

777
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:11,992
Master.

778
00:42:13,111 --> 00:42:14,312
I believe

779
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,111
you know perfectly well how it feels

780
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:18,511
when the world turns against you

781
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:20,071
and you're misunderstood by everyone.

782
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:20,671
Shut it.

783
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:22,752
How could you compare me

784
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:24,952
with the Sea Emperor
of the Merfolk Clan?

785
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:26,832
Zhu Yan.

786
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,312
Are you aware of

787
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:29,511
how heavy sin your words

788
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,272
will bring to the Crimson Clan?

789
00:42:34,472 --> 00:42:34,992
Out of the way.

790
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:39,031
Out of the way!

791
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:41,591
No!

792
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,511
No!

793
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:52,231
Master.

794
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:53,952
Don't kill Yuan.

795
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:55,711
Please.

796
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:57,432
Move.

797
00:42:58,392 --> 00:42:58,912
I won't.

798
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:00,231
Yan'er, go.

799
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:01,031
No.

800
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:02,711
Master.

801
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,231
As long as I'm here,

802
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:06,272
I won't let you kill Yuan.

803
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:07,392
Zhu Yan.

804
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:09,312
Did you even listen to me?

805
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:10,031
I did!

806
00:43:10,832 --> 00:43:12,031
Then why are you still defending him?

807
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:13,352
Get out of the way!

808
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:15,071
Because...

809
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:16,392
Because...

810
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:19,952
Because I like Yuan.
