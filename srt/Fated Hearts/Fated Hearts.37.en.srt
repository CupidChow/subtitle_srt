[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,120
If you don't agree to my terms,

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
I'll die right here today

5
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,680
along with the child in my womb!

6
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,950
You're threatening me again!

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm just reminding you!

8
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,759
Fine.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,000
Xia Jingyan!

10
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,590
Don't.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,650
Alright.

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,740
Put the knife down.

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Didn't you say

14
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,870
what's between us is just a deal?

15
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,520
Then I will make

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,850
one final deal with you.

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,490
My birthday is coming soon.

18
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,320
Stay with me until my birthday is over,

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,910
and I will

20
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,880
give you a border pass

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
and let you all leave.

22
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,910
Is that all?

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,280
Good.

24
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,610
Then it's a deal.

25
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,590
But first of all,

26
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,450
I need to see my brother tomorrow.

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,030
Okay.

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,070
I'm going to visit
my ancestral residence tomorrow,

29
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,930
and I'll allow you to see him then.

30
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,750
However,

31
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,079
don't ever think about seeing your brother

32
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,960
and using that chance to flee away.

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,030
This is Jinxiu,

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,780
the city under my rule,

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,340
and you cannot escape.

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,190
Neither do I want to harm Feng Suige.

37
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,990
But if you do something foolish,

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
you know what I'm capable of.

39
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,040
Xia Jingyan made her

40
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,000
settle down

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
in a palace of the harem.

42
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,040
It's said...

43
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
It's said that Empress Dowager Jing

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,870
has had several fights

45
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,000
with Xia Jingyan
because of Princess Xiyang.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As far as I can see,

47
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,280
at least Xia Jingyan is

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,810
on Princess Xiyang's side.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
She should be safe for now.

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm going to kill Xia Jingshi.

51
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,470
Feng Suige,

52
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,440
you must stay calm.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,750
I was the one who handed

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,950
my sister over to him.

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
I've always known

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,030
that Xiyang wouldn't be happy
marrying him.

57
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,120
And I never expected

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,520
him to make Xiyang happy.

59
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,320
My sister cares for him so much.

60
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,120
For him, she was willing to abandon Susha

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
and betray her father and brother.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
She even threatened to commit suicide

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,980
just to help him out of his misery.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,780
But what about him?

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
He's ungrateful.

66
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,610
Xia Jingshi doesn't deserve
to be called human.

67
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,750
I will tear him to pieces.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes,

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,350
Xia Jingshi deserves to die.

70
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,310
But we're in Jinxiu,

71
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,159
not Susha.

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,870
Also, we're here

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,310
to rescue Princess Xiyang

74
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,310
from her predicament,

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,830
not to put you in danger.

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,530
Calm down first.

77
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,350
We can surely figure out a way.

78
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,920
Xia Jingyan refuses to see you

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,560
and must have

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,310
kept your arrival

81
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,570
in Jinxiu under wraps.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,610
But don't worry.

83
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,510
I've already told Pei

84
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,390
to inform Princess Xiyang

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,880
of your rescue plan.

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,160
Okay.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,950
Xiyang has led a luxurious life
since childhood.

88
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,610
She's never suffered
such humiliation before.

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,630
No one knows her better than I do.

90
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,070
She appears gentle on the surface,

91
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,950
but she's actually quite tough inside.

92
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,510
Having endured all this,

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
she must be planning
to take revenge for me.

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,390
That's why

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,250
you must trust her, too.

96
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,160
If she receives the message,

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
she'll surely find a way

98
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,800
to meet with us.

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,980
Your Highness.

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,220
Your Highness,

101
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,870
the Ministry of Rites told us

102
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,430
that the Princess

103
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,600
will come to see you tomorrow

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
right at the Yunlai Inn.

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,120
Princess Xiyang must have

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,430
received our message already.

107
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,190
Anyway,

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,610
let's meet with Xiyang first.

109
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,830
You've waited for so long.

110
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,430
Have a little more patience

111
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,030
and wait just one more night.

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Soon,

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,240
you will be able

114
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,300
to see your sister.

115
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,950
Can't believe you've been through so much.

116
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,750
But Yixiao,

117
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,940
no matter what,

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,940
you are still from Jinxiu.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,190
Jinxiu is your home.

120
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,870
If one day

121
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,070
Susha and Jinxiu go to war again,

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,310
how will you choose?

123
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,520
The former Fu Yixiao is already dead.

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,970
It was Feng Suige who kept me alive.

125
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
The old Fu Yixiao

126
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,970
risked her life for Jinxiu

127
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,210
with nothing to repent of.

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,080
Xiyang,

129
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,100
your brother has come to pick you up.

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,970
Tomorrow, I will take you home.

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,420
So it was all

132
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,510
my wishful thinking,

133
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,830
my one-sided love.

134
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
"Shi'an" is good.

135
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,000
"Shiyou" is better,

136
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,430
suitable for both princes and princesses.

137
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,750
Am I still

138
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,610
the Princess of Susha I used to be?

139
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,950
Brother,

140
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,120
am I still your younger sister?

141
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,430
Yixiao,

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,920
do you know

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
that I've been scheming all these years

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
just for this day?

145
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
Xiyang,

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
no matter how much you've suffered,

147
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,270
I will

148
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,360
settle the score for you one by one.

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,960
My hands are stained with blood.

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm no longer who I used to be.

151
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,270
Brother,

152
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,930
I don't deserve to be your sister anymore.

153
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,840
It's just a deal.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,430
I don't care about it either!

155
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,159
Feng Xiyang,

156
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,000
I have no concern for you at all!

157
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,790
Yixiao,

158
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,360
wait for me.

159
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,430
Wait until I finish all this,

160
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,850
and I will bring you back to my side.

161
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,780
From now on, I, Fu Yixiao,

162
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,090
will only live for myself.

163
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,310
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

164
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,070
The inn is closed.
We're not serving any guests.

165
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,510
And do you understand me?

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
I told you I'm not here to book any rooms.

167
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm looking for someone.

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,830
I'm looking for someone about this tall,

169
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,560
usually in red.

170
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
-Ning Fei.
-Or...

171
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,830
Yixiao.

172
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,980
Ning Fei, you're here.

173
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,090
Where are Xueying,

174
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,920
Fang, and the others?

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,510
How are they?

176
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,450
Are they all doing well?

177
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,650
Don't worry, Yixiao.

178
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
They're all fine.

179
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,640
By the way,

180
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,240
Xueying asked me to tell you

181
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,560
that she's tied up right now.

182
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,630
After you wrap things up,

183
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,030
you can go back to see her.

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,620
You scared me.

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,270
I'm glad they're all doing well.

186
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,480
That puts my mind at ease.

187
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,000
I was planning to settle down first,

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
then go to Yujing City to help you.

189
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,030
Fortunately, I received your reply

190
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,390
and learned that you'd come to Shengjing.

191
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,080
So I hurried here

192
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,030
without delay

193
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,090
to meet up with you.

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,530
Long time no see.

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,930
Long time no see.

196
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,030
When you meet your sister later,

197
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,200
remember not to act on impulse.

198
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,390
Talk things through calmly.

199
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,590
Don't make her worry.

200
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,250
Actually,

201
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,150
I haven't been
back to Shengjing for a while.

202
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,030
Ning Fei and I

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,610
will go out for a walk later.

204
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,510
You and your sister haven't

205
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,550
seen each other for a long time.

206
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,350
You must have a lot to catch up on.

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,820
I'll leave you two to talk.

208
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,300
Be careful when you hang out.

209
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,540
Stay safe.

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,930
Don't worry.

211
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,120
It's good
that Xiyang can come out to see you.

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,020
Make her stay,

213
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,200
and tomorrow morning,

214
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,330
we'll take her away.

215
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,440
All right.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Yixiao,

217
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,240
do you remember

218
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,000
when we came to Shengjing once before?

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes.

220
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,120
His Highness sent the three of us

221
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,510
to meet someone in Shengjing.

222
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:39,910
Right.

223
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,870
Right on this street,

224
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,510
the three of us

225
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,910
feasted on a roast lamb together.

226
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,710
It was so good.

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
I wonder

228
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,160
if that restaurant is still open here.

229
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Steamed buns.

230
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,870
Xiao Weiran?

231
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,770
Let's split up and search.

232
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,260
Okay.

233
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:43,850
[Yunlai Inn]

234
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,230
[Yunlai Inn]

235
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,460
Your Highness,

236
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
please.

237
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,000
[Yunlai Inn]

238
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,980
Your Highness.

239
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,290
Your Highness,

240
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,260
the Prince is waiting for you upstairs.

241
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,790
The Emperor of Jinxiu

242
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,150
has brought a squad of soldiers with him,

243
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,550
standing guard outside.

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,120
Ignore them.

245
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,750
Xiyang.

246
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,440
Brother!

247
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,720
I thought I would never see you again.

248
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,870
I missed you so much.

249
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,870
I thought I was

250
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,150
left all alone

251
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,790
in this world.

252
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Living that way was
more painful than dying.

253
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,660
I know.

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,270
I know, Xiyang.

255
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,790
It's all over now.

256
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,570
It's all behind us.

257
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,630
See? I'm standing here

258
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,090
safe and sound before you.

259
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,870
Xiyang.

260
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,480
I failed to well protect you.

261
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,150
No.

262
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,720
It was my fault.

263
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,840
Brother, it was my fault.

264
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,920
I was too headstrong, too foolish.

265
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,290
I didn't listen to you back then.

266
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,910
Everything that happened to me

267
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,150
was my own doing.

268
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,410
I brought it on myself.

269
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,580
This is the punishment I deserve.

270
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,020
Don't talk nonsense, Xiyang.

271
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,910
Since hearing that terrible news,

272
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,520
I've prayed to heaven every day.

273
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,390
I begged God

274
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,240
to show mercy and protect you.

275
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,800
I wished it had been me who died instead.

276
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,720
I would rather have

277
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,800
all the suffering fall upon me.

278
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't want you

279
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,330
to go through any danger again.

280
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,910
It must've been your sincerity and piety

281
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,120
that moved God.

282
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,810
Throughout my journey,

283
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,640
I escaped danger at every turn.

284
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,310
See, I'm perfectly fine.

285
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,910
I hate myself so much.

286
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,320
I hate that I made you worry so much.

287
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,200
I hate that I was so bewitched

288
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,730
that I fell for Xia Jingshi.

289
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
I hate that the last time I saw you,

290
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,680
I broke your heart.

291
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,750
Brother,

292
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,390
I've made

293
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,400
too many foolish mistakes.

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,960
Not even my death

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,550
can make up for them.

296
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,960
You tried to make me see Xia Jingshi
for who he was.

297
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,550
But I turned a deaf ear.

298
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,550
I was such a fool that I thought

299
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,960
I could change him.

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,390
But later I realized

301
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,870
how stupid I was.

302
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,000
But by the time I woke up,

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,670
it was already too late.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,860
If I had come to my senses earlier,

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
I could have come back to you.

306
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,120
At least when you

307
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,750
went through all those things,

308
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,620
I could have been by your side.

309
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,750
But all I did was make you angry.

310
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,200
I've never done anything for you.

311
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Listen to me.

312
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,790
I have never blamed you.

313
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,970
When you're with me,

314
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,000
you can be willful; you can make mistakes;

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,730
you can do anything as you like.

316
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,080
Even if you make all hell break loose,

317
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
I've still got your back.

318
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,220
So let bygones

319
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,790
be bygones.

320
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,720
What matters most to me now

321
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,840
is that you can come back to me

322
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840

380
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,880
don't do anything.

381
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,440
I don't want to get you

382
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
into any more danger.

383
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,640
Having seen you again,

384
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,480
nothing else matters to me now.

385
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,750
I'm missing home.

386
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,680
I didn't even get

387
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,400
to see Father one last time.

388
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,350
I know.

389
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,030
I know it all.

390
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,960
Rest for tonight.

391
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,080
When the city gates open at dawn tomorrow,

392
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,750
I'll take you home.

393
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,750
Don't worry, Xiyang.

394
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,310
Come what may,

395
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,880
I'll always be by your side.

396
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,550
You should cherish this second chance

397
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,010
at life you've been given.

398
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,810
Why were you tailing me?

399
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,940
Xiao Weiran,

400
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,880
are you going to kill me?

401
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,750
We were like brothers.

402
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,680
Don't force my hand.

403
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,000
So there's finally a day

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,310
when you, Xiao Weiran,
can't bring yourself to act.

405
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,840
You're not worthy of saying

406
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,030
"brother."

407
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,860
Do we, the Three Heroes of Jinxiu,

408
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,040
have to turn against each other?

409
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,730
How dare you mention
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu?

410
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,330
Weren't you the first to draw your blade?

411
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,240
What are you doing in Shengjing City?

412
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,500
None of your business.

413
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,510
Feng Suige is also here, right?

414
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,370
I guess it's for Princess Xiyang.

415
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,110
Though I don't know

416
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,570
what you've been through,

417
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,440
we grew up together,

418
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,270
and with just one look from you,
I can tell

419
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,930
that you're

420
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,060
no longer the Ning Fei I once knew.

421
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,880
But I can also tell

422
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,640
that you're still

423
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,370
the same Xiao Weiran as before,

424
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,510
still stubbornly

425
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,510
following your master, the Prince.

426
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,130
You're not

427
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,110
going to talk me out of this, are you?

428
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,500
You're overthinking.

429
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
You're hopeless

430
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,300
and beyond saving.

431
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,410
I won't waste my breath on you.

432
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,230
Where is Xia Jingshi?

433
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,870
Tell me where Xia Jingshi is.

434
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,680
What is he plotting?

435
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,560
I know him well.

436
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,200
Enduring all this
and staying in Shengjing,

437
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,660
he must be up to something.

438
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,070
You shouldn't have

439
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,400
come to Shengjing City.

440
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,210
But since you're already here,

441
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,780
just stay out of it and don't ask around.

442
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,070
Xiao Weiran, you're implying something.

443
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,600
You're concerned about us.

444
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,530
Don't read too much into it.

445
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,680
I just want to advise you

446
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
to stop going against His Highness.

447
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,160
You've all

448
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
died once before.

449
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,040
Don't court death again.

450
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,000
So in your heart,

451
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,360
we're always your enemies.

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
Isn't that the truth?

453
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,070
You may leave.

454
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,590
Your encounter with us today

455
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,050
was purely a coincidence.

456
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,640
There's no old bond to reminisce about.

457
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,860
Never mind.

458
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,590
From now on,

459
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,370
we'll split up like strangers.

460
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,770
What else do you want to say?

461
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,370
It's not safe in Shengjing City.

462
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,830
Leave as soon as possible.

463
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,050
Weiran...

464
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,620
Let's go.

465
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,120
Hurry back to find Feng Suige.

466
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,580
Something big is about to happen
in Shengjing City.

467
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,110
Alright.

468
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,640
Tong,

469
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,720
go get Xiyang

470
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,800
a new pillow.

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,220
She prefers soft ones.

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,630
Also,

473
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,090
go ask Yu Qi

474
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,330
for a sachet with turmeric fragrance

475
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,750
to put under her pillow.

476
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,200
Yes.

477
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,310
Your Highness, please rest assured,

478
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,440
I'll keep it in mind.

479
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,520
You may go.

480
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,550
Brother,

481
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,270
you actually remember all these details.

482
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,960
Of course.

483
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,310
Just stay here and take it easy.

484
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,440
Don't overthink things.

485
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,300
Just rest well.

486
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,760
Seeing you

487
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,160
just puts my mind at ease.

488
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,380
And I start to feel a bit tired.

489
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,580
Then get some good rest first.

490
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,790
I'll leave you alone.

491
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,030
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

492
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,430
[Hidden Dragon Mansion]

493
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,940
By order of the Empress Dowager,

494
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,470
withdraw all the soldiers.

495
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,930
Let's go.

496
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,830
I'll be in charge of security here.

497
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,230
You saw Xiao Weiran?

498
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
He was in a hurry,

499
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,550
definitely still working for Xia Jingshi.

500
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,310
I asked him on purpose

501
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,750
what Xia Jingshi was planning.

502
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,920
I knew he wouldn't tell me.

503
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
I just wanted to see his reaction.

504
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,330
When I asked him,

505
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,550
he unconsciously
avoided eye contact with me.

506
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,400
That's what he usually does when he's

507
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,460
hiding something.

508
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,400
In this case,

509
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,680
Xia Jingshi

510
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,410
is indeed planning something.

511
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,630
That's right.

512
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,590
And the Emperor of Jinxiu, Xia Jingyan,

513
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,070
takes pleasure in torturing Xia Jingshi.

514
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,250
If Xia Jingshi were

515
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,640
under his control,

516
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,940
he would have Xia Jingshi present

517
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,880
at his birthday celebration

518
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,140
just to humiliate him.

519
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,400
Xiao Weiran should be

520
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,880
by Xia Jingshi's side right now.

521
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,570
But today,

522
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,250
he appeared on the street.

523
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,440
If I'm not mistaken,

524
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,960
Xia Jingshi has now

525
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,880
broken loose

526
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,310
from Xia Jingyan's control.

527
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,890
Your analysis makes sense.

528
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,020
So what do you think

529
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,030
Xia Jingshi is planning?

530
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,640
What Xia Jingshi wants most

531
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,980
is to kill Xia Jingyan.

532
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,000
During the Qianqiu Festival,

533
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,680
Xia Jingyan will be
away from the imperial palace,

534
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
making it his perfect chance to strike.

535
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,110
Xiao Weiran told us

536
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,440
to leave Shengjing quickly.

537
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,070
He must know

538
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,200
something big is about to happen.

539
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,060
Your Highness!

540
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,110
I was sending food

541
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,850
to Princess Xiyang,

542
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,710
but she's gone.

543
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
The Princess said

544
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,110
she had an agreement with that person

545
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,640
that if she went to meet him,

546
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
she could safely leave with you,
Your Highness.

547
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,200
Hey, "that person"?

548
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,370
Who is that person?

549
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,750
Xia Jingyan.

550
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,380
If Xia Jingshi

551
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,650
plans to kill Xia Jingyan tonight...

552
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,900
This is bad.

553
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,690
Princess Xiyang is in danger.

554
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,310
I've kept my promise

555
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,810
to accompany you on your birthday.

556
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,740
If you dare

557
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,310
break our agreement,

558
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,010
I will personally lead troops to Susha

559
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,330
and get you back.

560
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
You cannot escape my grasp.

561
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I hope you'll also keep your promise

562
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,170
and let us leave.

563
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,170
I asked you to stay with me,

564
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,910
but I was just joking.

565
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,840
You actually took it seriously.

566
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,880
