The First Prince I knew

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,940
was a loyal and righteous man.

8
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,270
There's no way you'd ever plot treason.

9
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,229
You must have been framed.

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,370
So I secretly investigated

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,480
and found

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,010
the bodies of our brothers.

13
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,710
I buried them quietly.

all the tears and bitterness.

Our brothers are
still watching us from above.

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,280
Your Highness,

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,540
leave Murong Jie to me.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,079
I swear

22
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,810
I'll take his damn head myself!

23
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,150
Good.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,400
The Murong father and son
framed Feng Suige.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,860
They won't spare
the Feng Battalion either.

26
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,490
The Feng Battalion

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,190
has already been controlled by Murong Yao.

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,120
Impossible.

29
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,590
Everyone in the Feng Battalion
has fought side by side with us.

30
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,520
They'd never betray His Highness.

31
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,890
Anyone who refused to yield to Murong Yao

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,280
was killed by him.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,280
I pledged my loyalty to Your Highness

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,870
and refused to serve under Murong Yao,

35
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,680
so I

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
retired early.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
Now I'm just a commoner.

38

Your Highness,

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,360
we've been

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,420
searching for you.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,950
Such a huge upheaval in Susha

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,480
must have raised suspicions.

43
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,360
The entire court

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
is controlled by the Murong family.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,190
No one dares to question this matter.

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,110
However, during my investigation,

47
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,710
I found someone

48
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,310
secretly looking into this.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,280
It's Shen Wu,

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,840
the Minister of Rites.

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,020
Shen Wu is an opportunist.

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,590
He definitely didn't want
to investigate it himself.

53
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,650
Someone must be pulling his strings.

54
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,910
The Murong father and son
and Empress Zhuang

So what if I killed your dog in return?

94

Because I'm hypocritical enough.

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,650
don't tell me
you want me to turn back now?

193
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,890
Feng Xiyang,

194
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,840
no one in this world

195
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,150
understands what you're thinking

196
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,450
better than I do.

197
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,510
Because I've walked every step

198
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,040
of the path you're walking.

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Your facade,

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,610
your despair,

201
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,920
and your desperate gamble—
I understand them all.

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,710
After my father died,

203
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,150
I just wanted to survive.

204
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,200
Is it wrong for someone
to just want to live?

205
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,080
But if I wanted to survive,

206
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,210
I had to depend on the Empress Dowager—

207
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,200
just like how you are

208
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,460
using Xia Jingyan now.

209
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,710
Eventually,

210
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,670
driven by despair and revenge,

211
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,330
you'll follow in my footsteps

212
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
and become like me.

213
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,020
I've never been a good person,

214
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,800
but you are

215
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,610
the kindest person I've ever met.

216
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,870
Let go of all this.

217
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,150
Let go of revenge.

218
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,350
Live a peaceful life.

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,740
It's not too late.

220
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
Xia Jingshi,

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I've already fallen into the abyss,

222
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,770
and only now do you offer help.

223
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,730
I won't be grateful for this.

224
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,870
I only find it even more disgusting!

225
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
You might as well not help me at all.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,620
Just be the villain you are.

227
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,550
You've made me what I am today,

228
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,240
and now you want to save me?

229
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
You think I'm pitiful, don't you?

230
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,250
I don't need your sympathy!

231
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
You don't deserve it!

232
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,810
Since that's the case,

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,680
so be it.

234
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
Princess Xiyang,

235
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,840
His Majesty said you've been gone
for a while picking flowers,

236
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,370
so he sent me to check on you.

237
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,760
An enemy is an enemy.

238
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,380
Next time, don't pretend to be concerned

239
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,200
or convince me to turn back.

240
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,240
You just think killing me

241
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,100
would interfere with your plans.

242
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,130
Xia Jingshi,

243
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,840
no one knows better than I do

244
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,270
what's on your mind

245
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,500
in this very moment.

246
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,120
What's wrong with you?

247
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,490
Do you still want this job?

248
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,790
First Prince?

249
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,210
You…

250
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,400
you're still alive.

251
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,010
I didn't see anything.

252
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,120
I didn't see anything.

253
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,810
I know nothing!

254
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,800
You know nothing?

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Then there's no need for you to live.

256
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm still useful.

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,380
I'm still useful!

258
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,970
Your Highness, please don't kill me.

259
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
What do you need me to do?

260
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,390
I will do whatever you ask.

261
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,630
[Personal Guards: Li Jianxin,
Zhao Yunhai, Zhang Moying]

262
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,650
Just as you predicted,

263
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,670
the Empress Dowager

264
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,510
really did plant spies among Xia Jingyan's

265
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,510
personal guards.

266
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,080
That's just how she is.

267
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,320
She has to

268
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,240
have everything

269
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,750
under her control.

270
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,190
The Royal Guards
protect the imperial palace.

271
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,320
Military Commander Liang Pin was her man.

272
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,650
The personal guards protect Xia Jingyan.

273
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,840
So naturally,
she has her people there too.

274
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,700
She wants to control everything.

275
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,770
Yet Your Highness has seen through it all.

276
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,650
They're digging their own grave.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Where did this list come from?

278
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,490
Wang Encheng provided it.

279
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,720
Among the personal guards,

280
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
there's a team leader named Zhang Ming.

281
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
He's close to Wang Encheng.

282
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,480
[Personal Guards: Zhu Tieyi,
Chen Shuangjian, Zhong Jingsong]

283
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,200
Zhang Ming told him in private

284
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
that these particular personal guards

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
had reported secretly

286
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,810
to the Empress Dowager before.

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,370
Does Zhang Ming know

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Wang Encheng is

289
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,380
investigating for us?

290
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Rest assured.

291
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,000
Wang Encheng is tight-lipped.

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,400
He's never mentioned his connection to us.

293
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,220
Your Highness,

294
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
did you request this list

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,310
because you

296
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,510
already have a plan?

297
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,800
This is a gift for Xia Jingyan.

298
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,870
There's already a rift between Xia Jingyan
and the Empress Dowager,

299
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,000
but they haven't

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,530
completely fallen out yet.

301
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,030
So I'm going to

302
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,100
fan the flames.

303
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,520
Find a way

304
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,570
to get this list to Xia Jingyan.

305
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,710
Just make sure

306
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,390
no one realizes

307
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,220
it's from us.

308
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,080
Yes.

309
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,690
What did you say?

310
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,330
I really did

311
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,970
meet with the First Prince.

312
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,390
He wishes to meet with you in private.

313
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,470
Given the urgency,

314
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,360
I had no choice

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,660
but to agree

316
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,260
to relay the message to you first.

317
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,000
Please forgive me.

318
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
You did well.

319
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,590
Your Majesty,

320
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,210
are you going to meet him?

321
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,080
Of course.

322
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,490
Why wouldn't I?

323
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,760
You're my confidant.

324
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,540
Speak freely.

325
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,589
Then, allow me to be frank.

326
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Prime Minister Zhuang died

327
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,250
at the First Prince's hand.

328
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,000
If that

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,310
hadn't happened,

330
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
the throne

331
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,050
would have

332
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,760
belonged to him.

333
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,770
I've spoken out of turn.

334
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,550
Please forgive me.

335
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,250
You've only spoken the truth.

336
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,550
There's nothing to forgive.

337
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,000
Get up.

338
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,320
But I believe

339
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,430
Suige

340
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,760
would never harm me.

341
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,510
Go make arrangements immediately.

342
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,710
I'll set out tonight.

343
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,960
But you must

344
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,030
not tell anyone.

345
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,890
This must remain secret,

346
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,640
especially from my mother.

347
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,470
Minister Shen.

349
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,890
I've been watching you for some time.

350
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,920
You met His Majesty

351
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,450
in private again and again.

352
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,010
You seem to be in a hurry.

353
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,540
What is it about?

354
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,340
Just official business.

355
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,240
You understand

356
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,470
which way the wind blows.

357
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,860
Don't be misled into choosing

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,720
the wrong side.

359
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm giving you one last chance

360
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,760
to tell the truth.

361
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,350
What?

362
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,180
It's absolutely true.

363
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,350
The men we placed

364
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,080
among the personal guards

365
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,560
were just executed by His Majesty's order.

366
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,070
How did His Majesty discover them?

367
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,810
I secretly looked into it.

368
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,600
It's said that

369
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,240
after His Majesty
killed Military Commander Liang,

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,220
he searched his residence

371
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,330
and found that list.

372
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,350
Nonsense!

373
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,350
Liang Pin had nothing
to do with the personal guards.

374
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,400
How would he know?

375
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,070
Liang Pin is now dead.

376
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,500
Dead men tell no tales.

377
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,350
No one will ever know

378
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,590
where that list really came from.

379
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,530
I doubt

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,130
His Majesty had any real evidence,

381
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,460
but he had them executed all the same.

382
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,270
When does His Majesty

383
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,200
ever need evidence to kill anyone?

384
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,010
Summon the Prince of Zhennan to see me.

385
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes.

386
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,090
[Yangyue Palace, Yuxiu Palace,
Hehuan Hall]

387
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,170
Are you troubled by something?

388
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,680
Come, come.

389
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,550
I thought all you did was play around

390
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,410
without a care for state affairs.

391
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,000
But you're

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,730
actually diligent sometimes.

393
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,500
State affairs?

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,000
What state affairs?

395
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,590
If I had to

396
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,200
handle state affairs myself,

397
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,920
then what's the point

398
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,650
of paying all those officials?

399
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,510
Come.

400
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,270
Sit.

401
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,040
Look at this.

402
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,420
[Jiyue Hall, Linhua Palace,
Pixiang Hall, Shuhua Palace]

403
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,240
I ordered the palace staff

404
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,590
to pick some new residences for you:

405
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,120
Jiyue Hall, Linhua Palace,
and Pixiang Hall.

406
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,750
I have no idea

407
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,210
which one you'd prefer.

408
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,450
How about this?

409
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,500
You take a look.

410
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,120
Choose whichever you like.

411
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,510
So this is what you were studying?

412
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,110
Yes.

413
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,850
If you like them all,

414
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,160
I'll give them all to you.

415
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,200
I guess a few

416
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,920
pedantic old officials

417
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
will object.

418
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,090
But don't worry.

419
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Whoever dares to object,

420
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,590
I'll have them beheaded.

421
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,190
I don't need a new residence.

422
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,100
I can just stay in the Mirror Room.

423
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,590
The Mirror Room is too shabby.

424
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,790
Just a place to sleep!

425
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,000
If you ask me,

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the Mirror Room is no different

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,330
from all these palaces.

428
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,070
Feng Xiyang!

429
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
I have so many palaces,

430
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,340
and you don't like any of them?

431
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,500
If you continue to be so unappreciative…

432
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,750
I'll build you a new palace.

433
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,610
How about that?

434
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,420
Xia Jingyan,

435
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,680
instead of thinking about these things,

436
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,350
why don't you help me figure out

437
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,410
how to kill the Murong father and son?

438
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,090
What's the rush?

439
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
Once they're killed

440
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,590
and you get your revenge,

441
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,820
you'll want to leave.

442
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,410
You want to go back on your word?

443
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,720
You're the ruler of a kingdom.

444
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,640
A king's word is law.

445
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,570
You can't break your promise to me!

446
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,340
I am a ruler, that's true,

447
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,570
but I'm also a man.

448
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,570
Isn't it normal for a man

449
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,680
to lie to a woman?

450
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,200
You…

451
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,920
Wait, wait.

452
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't get upset.

453
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,700
I was just joking with you.

454
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,240
Alright.

455
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,270
I never lie to women,

456
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,810
especially not to you.

457
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,530
It was you who used that...

458
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,510
that bet

459
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,160
to stop me from attacking Susha.

460
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,350
You have to give me some time

461
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,680
to come up with a new plan

462
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,650
to kill the Murong father and son.

463
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,200
Alright. Be patient.

464
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,780
You just want me to stay.

465
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,720
You want this imperial palace

466
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
to become my cage!

467
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,720
Your cage?

468
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
What a great idea!

469
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,050
Why didn't I think of that?

470
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll immediately

471
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
build you a new palace

472
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,550
that looks like a cage!

473
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,280
You're sick!

474
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,310
Don't go yet!

475
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,830
I have a gift for you.

[Fuxin Pavilion]

477
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,050
I asked you to kill the Princess of Susha,

478
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,860
yet you still haven't done it.

479
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,390
You've really let me down.

480
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,400
Forgive me, Mother.

481
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,040
His Majesty has

482
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,400
assigned personal guards

483
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,260
to protect her.

484
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,000
I really haven't found the chance.

485
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,820
Mother,

486
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,610
could you temporarily

487
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,820
remove the personal guards

488
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,110
so that I can…

489
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,100
I only gave you this one task,

490
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,350
and you still need my help?

491
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,570
Calm down, Mother.

492
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,420
Forgive my incompetence.

493
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,200
Forget it.

494
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
You have the will but lack the means.

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,640
After all, this is

496
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,970
not your Pingling City.

497
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,100
It's Mother's Pingling City.

498
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,010
I was away for so many years

499
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,240
guarding Pingling for you.

500
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,770
All land under heaven
belongs to the Emperor.

501
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,130
It's His Majesty's Pingling City.

502
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,240
You weren't guarding it for me.

503
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,070
Don't say such foolish words

504
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,110
ever again.

505
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,110
Get up.

506
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,000
His Majesty has become

507
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,750
increasingly difficult to understand.

508
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,880
Officials proposed attacking Susha,

509
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
but he refused.

510
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
It must be Feng Xiyang interfering.

511
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,030
I planned to restore

512
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,360
your military command,

513
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,630
but it keeps getting postponed.

514
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,560
After all these years outside,

515
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,200
being able to return

516
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,130
and serve you with filial devotion

517
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,750
isn't such a bad thing.

518
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,590
Rather than a filial son,

519
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
what I truly need

520
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,930
is the Prince of Zhennan
who lets me rest easy.

521
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,000
Mother, you mean...

522
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,880
You fool,

523
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,140
you're in real danger
without realizing it.

524
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,110
His Majesty has always wanted you dead.

525
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,970
In the past, I could hold him back,

526
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,240
but now,

527
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,470
with Feng Xiyang messing with his mind,

528
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,400
he barely even

529
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,130
acknowledges me as his mother.

530
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,110
If he ever insists on killing you,

531
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,640
I may not be able to stop him.

532
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,900
Please enlighten me, Mother.

533
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,720
How can I protect myself?

534
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,200
Right now,
with peace between the two kingdoms,

535
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,660
he thinks you're useless.

536
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,100
But when war breaks out,
it'll be different.

537
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,350
That's why Feng Xiyang must die,

538
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,030
and Susa must be attacked.

539
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,160
However, I don't want

540
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,030
this matter

541
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,990
to create a rift
between His Majesty and me.

542
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,110
I understand.

543
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,350
I'll first kill Feng Xiyang

544
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,920
and frame Susha for it.

545
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,510
Then I'll provoke His Majesty

546
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,240
into waging war against Susha.

547
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,270
Since I can't go after

548
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,070
Feng Xiyang in the palace,

549
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,780
I might as well…

550
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,030
try something outside.

551
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,590
How could His Majesty

552
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,480
possibly let her leave the palace?

553
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,280
The opportunity will come soon.

554
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,110
Mother,

555
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,330
the Qianqiu Festival is approaching.

556
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,100
Will your brother stand with you?

557
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,480
Chengyang and I

558
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,220
may not be brothers from the same mother,

559
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,350
but I watched him grow up

560
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,590
all these years.

561
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,150
I've always treated him

562
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,690
like my own brother.

563
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,940
I know his character well.

564
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,570
He might be completely in the dark,

565
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,030
unaware of the truth,

566
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,550
believing what his mother has told him.

567
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,200
No matter

568
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,750
what Empress Zhuang told him,

569
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,470
it must be full of loopholes.

570
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,920
In such a just world,

571
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,050
no one can truly turn black into white.

572
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,090
Chengyang can tell right from wrong.

573
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,030
I trust him.

574
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,680
Although I've never met Feng Chengyang,

575
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
after hearing what you've said,

576
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,070
he sounds like

577
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,270
a reasonable person.

578
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,670
To maintain a kind heart,

579
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
even with blood ties to the Zhuangs—

580
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,640
that's really not easy.

581
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,640
I was worried

582
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,940
that you brothers would become enemies.

583
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So many royal siblings

584
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
like you would fight

585
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,960
to the bitter end

586
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,300
for the throne.

587
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,820
Surprisingly,

588
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,980
you two are the opposite.

589
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,540
That's truly rare.

590
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,030
If it weren't for the throne,

591
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,750
my buddies like Gu Yu

592
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,100
wouldn't have ended up like that.

593
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,230
You are the most important person to me.

594
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,260
After everything,

595
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,570
I still have you by my side,

596
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,240
and Lu Ke, Yun Fang, and Yun Qing,

597
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,590
who are not blood relatives

598
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,920
but are more than family,

599
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,590
by my side.

600
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,940
I'm already very content.

601
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,060
I didn't expect

602
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,310
His Highness to suffer so much

603
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,570
in the Storm Alliance.

604
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,030
Thankfully, Miss Yixiao was

605
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,490
by his side through it all,

606
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,240
pulling His Highness

607
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
back from the brink of death.

608
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,420
Let's not talk about that.

609
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,070
How are you?

610
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,510
Let me see if it's healed.

611
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,830
Just superficial wounds.
They're all healed.

612
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,440
Don't bother.

613
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,640
Why are you acting shy like a girl?

614
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,550
Just let me check.

615
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,590
What's wrong with you?

616
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,790
You wanna fight?

617
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,920
Never mind.

618
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,110
I won't fight you.

619
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,270
You're still recovering

620
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,200
from your injuries.

621
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,080
If I beat you,

622
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,590
it wouldn't be honorable.

623
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,750
You beat me?

624
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,790
Have you ever beaten me?

625
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,650
Have I ever fought you seriously?

626
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,550
Didn't I kill

627
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,310
20 more enemies than you

628
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,030
on the battlefield?

629
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,750
Fine, fine.

630
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,010
You're the best, okay?

631
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,550
Just you wait.

632
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,790
After I avenge His Highness

633
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,120
by killing the Murongs,

634
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,160
we can

635
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,290
have a proper match.

636
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,510
I'll always be

637
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,880
one step ahead of you on the battlefield.

638
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,480
Fine.

639
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,090
I'd like to see

640
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,080
who will really come out on top.

641
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,960
It's a deal then.

642
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,620
It's a deal.

643
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,720
This is a bow
with a draw weight of over two piculs.

644
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,350
Yes.

645
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,680
I thought Your Highness had died

646
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
and planned to assassinate the Murongs

647
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,730
to avenge you.

648
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,750
But they always have

649
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,070
guards protecting them.

650
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,350
I can only shoot

651
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,480
from 150 paces away.

652
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,860
At that distance,

653
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,170
you can hit six or seven out of ten.

654
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,830
They're both military commanders.

655
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,630
They wear armor when they go out.

656
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,680
From 150 paces away,

657
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
a kill shot is extremely difficult.

658
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,130
At best, you could hit a vital spot.

659
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,590
But regular bows and arrows

660
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,750
can't penetrate armor

661
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,890
even if you hit,

662
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,110
so you have to use

663
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,830
a heavy-tipped arrow and a strong bow.

664
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,350
Yes.

665
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,830
A few days ago,

666
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,210
I secretly got this bow.

667
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,240
If my brother found out,

668
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
he'd stop me from taking risks,

669
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,480
so I kept it stashed outside.

670
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,240
However, I've only

671
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,700
ever used a two-picul bow,

672
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,960
so I can't guarantee

673
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,350
a kill shot with this one.

674
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,070
I can try it.

675
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,750
The Moon-Shooting Bow I used before

676
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,000
had a draw weight of over two piculs.

677
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,480
No.

678
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,140
Lord Ling said

679
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,920
you can't draw a strong bow.

680
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,520
I've completely recovered.

681
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,790
Look.

682
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,710
Yixiao.

683
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,390
With this bow,

684
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,880
I can lend you a hand

685
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,790
and help you deal with the Murongs.

686
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,270
But if you hurt yourself again

687
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,640
just to kill them,

688
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,270
it's simply not worth it.

689
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,150
Don't worry,

690
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,240
I know my limits.

691
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,630
Don't forget,

692
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,440
I'm Fu Yixiao after all.

693
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,540
Mind your step.

694
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,960
Someone's coming.

695
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,480
These are

696
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,610
Song's scout bells.

697
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,920
Once someone gets near this area,

698
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,890
the bells will be

699
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,020
triggered to ring.

700
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,640
Your Highness,

701
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,510
someone is coming this way

702
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,270
with guards.

703
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,370
It's Chengyang.

704
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,290
Greetings, Your Majesty.

705
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,030
Your Majesty,

706
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,310
I'll wait outside

707
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
for you.

708
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,240
Who are you?

709
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,030
Your brother is waiting for you inside.

710
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Let me see

711
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,720
what Chengyang looks like

712
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,200
as an emperor.

713
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,680
Suige,

714
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,040
it's so wonderful

715
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,480
to see you again.

716
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,360
You also thought I was dead?

717
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,550
In the past, every time you returned

718
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,880
from a victorious campaign,

719
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,210
I'd go welcome you back.

720
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,590
Once, you didn't come back with the army.

721
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,190
They said you died in battle.

722
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,240
I was devastated.

723
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,400
Later, I told you

724
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,600
that unless you saw my body,

725
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,010
you shouldn't believe

726
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,360
any rumors from anyone.

727
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,840
Because your brother

728
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,630
is the invincible God of War.

729
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,500
Murong Yao said

730
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,270
your body was left in the wilderness

731
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,530
and couldn't be found.

732
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,400
I didn't see it with my own eyes,

733
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,660
so I didn't believe it.

734
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,720
Come.

735
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,880
Sit.

736
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,880
Brother,

737
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,670
actually,

738
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,570
ascending to the throne

739
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,970
was not my wish.

740
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:35,960
I know.

741
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,480
I already learned about

742
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,440
what happened between you

743
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,040
and Grandfather in the past.

744
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,590
Suige,

745
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,130
why didn't you tell me?

746
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,790
Telling you would only have worried you

747
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,640
needlessly.

748
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,310
There's a perpetrator for every injustice.

749
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,880
None of this should have come

750
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,440
between us brothers.

751
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,310
Why trouble yourself?

752
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,730
Chengyang,

753
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,270
I've heard

754
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,880
you've been secretly investigating

755
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,510
the truth behind Father's assassination.

756
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,840
The fact
that you came to see me today means

757
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,750
that you still

758
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,410
care about me as your brother.

759
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,350
Brother,

760
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,110
how did Father really die?

761
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,640
And who set you up?

762
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,560
The Murong father and son.

763
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,680
They forged an imperial edict

764
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,140
to lure me into the palace.

765
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,400
By the time I saw Father,

766
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,970
he had already passed away.

767
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,690
Who else was involved?

768
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,880
An event this big…

769
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,030
I don't believe the Murongs did it

770
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,400
all on their own.

771
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
You're asking me this…

772
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,790
because you already

773
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,050
have an answer, right?

774
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,440
Brother,

775
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,570
I want to hear it from you directly.

776
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,980
Was my mother involved

777
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,480
in the attempt to murder you?

778
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,480
I have no proof,

779
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,840
but she must have been involved.

780
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,630
Chengyang,

781
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,969
I called you here today

782
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,030
because I hope

783
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,000
you can prepare yourself in advance.

784
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,840
And I hope you can understand me.

785
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,080
Because what I'm about to do

786
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,929
is to kill my enemies with my own hands.

787
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,230
Brother,

788
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,290
I'll return the throne to you.

789
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,480
But may I ask you one thing?

790
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,730
Spare my mother.

791
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,760
I will take her away from Yujing

792
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,929
and never come back.

793
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,460
I'm the only family

794
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,880
my mother has now.

795
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,110
All her mistakes were for my sake.

796
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,320
Her sins are my sins.

797
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,560
Let me pay the price for her.

798
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,320
What have you done wrong?

799
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,590
You and I are merely

800
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,990
pawns of circumstances.

801
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,370
Chengyang.

802
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,550
I promise you:

803
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,400
I will not kill your mother.

804
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,130
Qianqiu Festival?

805
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,230
Xia Jingyan's Daily Chronicle says

806
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,280
that every year at the Qianqiu Festival,

807
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,920
he leaves the palace
to visit his ancestral home.

808
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,120
If we want to kill him,

809
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,840
that's the best chance.

810
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,590
But for such occasions,

811
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,050
security is always tight.

812
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,960
There will be countless guards
protecting him,

813
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,420
both openly and secretly.

814
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,960
That's why we need
to use the Empress Dowager.

815
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,670
When Xia Jingyan leaves the palace,

816
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,060
he'll certainly bring
Feng Xiyang with him.

817
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,000
No one wants Feng Xiyang dead

818
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,730
more than the Empress Dowager.

819
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,030
She will secretly

820
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,960
help us reassign most of

821
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,320
Xia Jingyan's guards.

822
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,170
If that's the case,

823
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,590
our chances of success

824
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,790
will be much greater.

825
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,840
But will the Empress Dowager agree?

826
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,070
She definitely will.

827
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
She's eager

828
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
to provoke a war between the two kingdoms.

829
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
Only then

830
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,290
will Xia Jingyan
need to rely on her again.

831
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,980
We need to prepare in advance.

832
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,480
It's time to send word to Pingling City

833
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,810
and call in more people.

834
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,840
Understood.

835
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,940
What are you doing?

836
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,710
Prince of Zhennan,

837
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,110
His Majesty summons you.

838
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,120
You're angry?

839
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,510
Who's the fool

840
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,910
that upset Her Highness?

841
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,040
It couldn't be me, could it?

842
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,510
Why would I be angry?

843
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,240
Xia Jingyan,

844
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,440
don't think I can't

845
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,900
take revenge without you.

846
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,430
Interesting.

847
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,480
Then tell me,

848
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,110
what's your plan?

849
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,590
Did you

850
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,990
just come here to mock me?

851
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,070
I came to help you.

852
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,070
Get out.

853
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,630
The more ungrateful you are,

854
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,980
the more I like you.

855
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,090
Bring him in!

856
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,200
Why did you bring him here?

857
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,810
I don't want to see him!

858
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

859
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,400
May I ask why

860
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,720
you've summoned me?

861
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,340
You tried to kill my woman,

862
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,160
and you still don't know
why I summoned you?

863
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,830
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

864
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,450
I don't understand.

865
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,400
You forgot quite quickly.

866
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,070
Why did you

867
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,080
go to the Flower Hall?

868
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
You've been visiting

869
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,260
the Empress Dowager repeatedly.

870
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,880
What task did

871
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
she assign you?

872
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,810
The same as Liang Pin's?

873
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,580
To kill her?

874
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,280
I was merely paying

875
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,740
my regular respects
to the Empress Dowager.

876
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
Still won't admit it?

877
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,550
Good.

878
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,280
You pay your respects more often
than I do.

879
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,140
You're filial.

880
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm not.

881
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,870
Is that what you mean?

882
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,840
You misunderstand.

883
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,590
Then what were you doing

884
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,650
at the Flower Hall?

885
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,040
Were you perhaps rekindling a romance?

886
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,110
I...

887
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,880
Think carefully about your answer.

888
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,960
If you were rekindling a romance

889
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,760
with my woman,

890
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,090
I'd be very displeased.

891
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,210
If not,

892
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,040
I'd be even more displeased.

893
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
You don't find my woman attractive?

894
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,940
If I'm displeased,

895
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,670
someone's head will roll.

896
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,830
Tell me.

897
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,150
Tell me, why did you go to her?

898
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,750
Was it to rekindle a romance?

899
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,420
If you want me dead, Your Majesty,

900
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,280
why bother with finding excuses?

901
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,710
Who do you think you are?

902
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,860
Do I need an excuse to kill you?

903
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,360
At the Flower Hall,

904
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
I had something to say to him.

905
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,710
Prince of Zhennan, have you forgotten?

906
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,310
I was the one who stopped you
at the Flower Hall.

907
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,930
I asked if you had ever,

908
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,320
even for a moment,

909
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,880
imagined growing old with me.

910
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,280
I...

911
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:01,960
You...

912
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,840
You were rekindling a romance with him?

913
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,070
Don't say that again!

914
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,480
He and I broke ties long ago.

915
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,610
There's no romance!

916
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,070
I just

917
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,620
wanted an answer.

918
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,560
What was your answer?

919
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,190
Never.

Listen to me!

00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,340
You're from Susha.

bring him to see me?

944
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,800
I just wanted to humiliate him

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,320
I was

00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,920
never joking about revenge.

950
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,920
If you dare toy with me again,

951
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,590
I won't let you off!

952
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,800
You crazy woman.

953
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,730
What did you say?

954
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,870
I said I'll remember!

955
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,450
You've seen your brother,

956
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,490
but why are you even more upset?

957
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,560
He came to see me today

958
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,240
because he cares for me as his brother.

959
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,400
But I told him terrible news.

960
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,310
Chengyang has already lost his father.

961
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,190
How will he face

962
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,670
his mother from now on?

963
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,290
Usually at times like this,

964
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,800
wouldn't you offer me

965
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
words of comfort?

966
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,480
Why are you silent this time?

967
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,760
I was just thinking:

968
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,670
how can there be someone

969
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,200
as kind as you in this world?

970
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,440
His mother

971
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,170
caused you to lose your mother,

972
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,210
yet you're still worried about

973
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,070
how he will

974
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,530
get along with his mother.

975
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,210
After all you've been through,

976
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,400
I'm really glad

977
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
you still have a younger brother
like Chengyang.
