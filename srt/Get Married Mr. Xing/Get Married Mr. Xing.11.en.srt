1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,700
Come on, be careful.

2
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,900
Are you okay?

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Xing Ge?

4
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,766
Xing Ge!

5
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,166
I want to ask you...

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,333
What?

7
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,466
You and Xing Yi-

8
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,166
It's so hot here.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,233
Did you drink

10
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,266
the wine other people gave you?

11
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,866
I don't quite remember.

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,766
I don’t know if I take it or no.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
Are you okay?

14
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,300
I-

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,466
Are you okay?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
Lu Wenxi?

17
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,466
Feel better now?

18
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,266
Good morning.

19
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,533
Morning.

20
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:15,833
How about marring me?

21
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,433
Wenxi,

22
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
marry me.

23
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,000
Why are you sighing?

24
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,800
I proposed to him today.

25
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,466
He just ignored me.

26
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,200
How about you?

27
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,833
He proposed to me.

28
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
Oh, how good!

29
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,733
Not at all.

30
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,366
It’s not like you don’t know that

31
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,233
I don't want to get married at all now.

32
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,900
Dating is okay,

33
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,200
but marriage

34
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,533
will kill me!

35
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Is it that scary?

36
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,800
There is a famous saying-

37
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,100
anyway a famous guy said,

38
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,566
let a man and a woman

39
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,100
live together continuously for a long time,

40
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,100
from a biological perspective

41
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,133
this is totally

42
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,600
extremely unnatural state.

43
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,966
Is it necessary to make it that grand?

44
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,266
Yes.

45
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,000
Marriage is a relationship

46
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,666
with responsibility in law and morals.

47
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm used to freedom and afraid of responsibility.

48
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,933
I don't want to be bound by marriage.

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,833
I don't want to spend my time and energy

50
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,033
on all the quarrels in marriage.

51
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:08,033
You don't quarrel with your boyfriend?

52
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,466
I do.

53
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,366
But I can break up with him when dating.

54
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,500
But you can't just get a divorce, right?

55
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,266
It seems to make sense.

56
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:23,500
So you still want to get married?

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,633
Yes, why not?

58
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,133
I can only get the shares if I get married

59
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,900
and then can I inherit the company.

60
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,966
Congratulations.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,333
You have reached

62
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,166
a state of confusion and clarity.

63
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,033
Wish you get married soon.

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,400
Thank you.

65
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:45,066
But what if I got the wrong person?

66
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,433
How about asking my parents to adopt you?

67
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,766
You can be my dad's another daughter.

68
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,900
Sacrifice yourself for me, your sister.

69
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,966
Don't.

70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,633
It shouldn't matter even if you got the wrong one.

71
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,266
They are all sons of the Xing family,

72
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,133
I think they are all the same.

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,733
What do you think?

74
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,766
I don't know either.

75
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,300
What did you say?

76
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,100
You will say yes?

77
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,200
What about the Xing family?

78
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,833
Will you go back?

79
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,300
I will never go back.

80
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,633
Listen carefully,

81
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,866
you said it yourself that

82
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,100
she tried to marry you

83
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,766
just for Xing family's share.

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,333
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

85
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Didn’t she lie to you before

86
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:32,666
and make up so many stories?

87
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,533
You are willing to marry her?

88
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,866
It smells so good.

89
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,566
One, two, three, four...

90
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:00,800
Hello?

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,333
Miss Su, bad news.

92
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,433
You're chasing the wrong person.

93
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,033
What do you mean?

94
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,533
The one you should get is Xing Yi, not Xing Ge.

95
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:10,266
Xing Ge

96
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,333
is Mr. Xing and his first wife's kid.

97
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,566
I heard that

98
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,166
because of his mom,

99
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,866
Xing Ge hated his dad.

100
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,600
He basically has nothing to do with the Xing family.

101
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,600
Are you sure?

102
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,533
Ye-yeah, I'm sure.

103
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,600
Miss Su, don't propose to him.

104
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,666
I'm back.

105
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,100
Niannian? Niannian?

106
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,133
Su Nian!

107
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Hello,

108
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,266
the user you called is temporarily unavailable...

109
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Where has she been?

110
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
It's so late. Where has she been?

111
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,100
Wenxi broke up with her boyfriend.

112
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,900
I need to go stay with her.

113
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,100
Go after having dinner, see how many dishes  you made.
