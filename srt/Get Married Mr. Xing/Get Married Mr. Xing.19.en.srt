1
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,333
Wenxi?

2
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,866
Wenxi, you are so drunk!

3
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,566
Wenxi, wake up.

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,933
Niannian, here you are.

5
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,733
What's going on?

6
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,533
Niannian, have some drinks with me.

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,166
What's wrong, Wenxi?

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,933
Niannian,

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,033
I'm so sorry.

10
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,733
What's that for?

11
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:13,000
Niannian,

12
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,366
I didn't expect that he lied to me.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,633
Who lied to you?

14
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,066
That bastard Xing Yi.

15
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,066
He promised me to not mention marriage,

16
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,500
and took me back home

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
with excuse of convincing his parents,

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,700
but he just wanted me to know

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,000
the conflict between his brother and the Xing family.

20
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,500
He wanted me to see him in need,

21
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,366
to use me to convince you.

22
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,666
And

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,400
you mistook Xing Ge and him also because of him.

24
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,633
It's okay, it's okay.

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,233
You didn't do anything wrong.

26
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,366
It's not your fault.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,700
The one who should be blamed is Xing Yi.

28
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,933
Actually,

29
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:56,466
you didn't force me to do anything.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,433
The conflict between them

31
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,766
is not something we can solve with just a few words.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,066
Really, Niannian?

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Don't worry.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
I have already told Xing Ge

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,666
to ask Xing Yi to come over and pick you up.

36
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:13,766
No.

37
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,366
I broke up with him.

38
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,500
Broke up?

39
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,766
Niannian,

40
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,333
I was deceived by him,

41
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,600
this is what I deserve, right?

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,833
Don't say that, Wenxi!

43
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,333
Stop drinking.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,266
Wenxi...

45
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,633
That's what I deserve.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Is Wenxi okay?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
I think we need to have a talk.

48
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,333
Okay.

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,433
Take care of Wenxi for me.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
I heard from Wenxi that

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,300
you didn't say anything

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
after knowing that I mistook you and him.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,500
Why?

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,100
A long time ago,

55
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:17,933
I knew by accident that

56
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:18,866
my brother has been looking for a girl.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
But he didn't get name and address.

58
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,433
He only knew that she has a nickname

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,533
called Little Su.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,700
Just with a surname,

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,900
you can be sure that is me?

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,233
No.

63
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,700
I didn't know that when I investigated you.

64
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,000
But when I saw

65
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,066
the photos of you and my brother,

66
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,000
I began to doubt.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
You two lived in the same community back then,

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,433
I don't believe this is a coincidence.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,666
Later my father fell ill.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,066
Although he didn't say anything,

71
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,466
I know his biggest wish

72
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,733
is that my brother can come back home.

73
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,300
So,

74
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,700
you knew earlier than anyone that

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,533
you father got a cancer?

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,833
At that time, I just thought he was in poor health.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,733
I didn't know that much earlier than yours.

78
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,633
What about Wenxi?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,266
She was an accident.

80
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,166
When I met her,

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,666
I don't know about the relationship between you two.

82
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,900
And after you knew,

83
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,666
you just used her.

84
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:19,899
If I say,

85
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,733
I've thought about it but never did it,

86
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,300
you won't believe that, will you?

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,666
It doesn't matter

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,833
whether I believe it or not.

89
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,533
What matters is whether Wenxi believes it or not.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,600
She seems to be

91
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,433
fickle in love,

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,833
but I know her,

93
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,366
she has never fell in love with others.

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,766
For you, this time,

95
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,966
she let go

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,233
a lot of worries.

97
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:52,033
So I really hope you to

98
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,000
pay back her sincerity with sincerity.

99
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:55,933
I know

100
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,166
I was wrong.

101
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,066
I will find a way to make her forgive me.

102
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,433
I send Wenxi here to you,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
but what next

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,600
is up to you two.

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,900
Wenxi, sorry.

106
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,633
I know you don't want to see me now.

107
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
I will wait for you, waiting for you to forgive me.

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,133
Wenxi,

109
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:14,733
today I-

110
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:15,933
Goodbye.

111
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,266
Wenxi,

112
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm going on a business trip today.

113
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,266
And...

114
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,766
sorry.

115
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,566
What does your business trip have to do with me?

116
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,833
Forget to tell you,

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,266
Xing Yi, we are done.

118
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,200
I've always put a clear end to my relationships.

119
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,133
It's good to leave.

120
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,733
We won't be embarrassed like today as neighbors anymore.

121
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,266
But future what-

122
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,466
My future has nothing to do with you, doesn’t it?

123
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,400
You are too concerned about passer by.

124
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:59,566
Mr. Xing is really nosy.

125
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:19,666
Miss Su,

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,233
tomorrow is the bidding for projects in the Xincheng District.

127
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,833
The project department is ready.

128
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,766
Will you go to the bidding or-

129
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,233
Tomorrow is the meeting of shareholders,

130
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,766
you go to the bidding on behalf of me.

131
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,833
Okay.

132
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,366
Miss. Su, what's going on with the Xing family now?

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,033
The one who should be worried most now is Cao Sipeng.

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,633
Cao Sipeng doesn't know

135
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,566
the relationship between Xing Ge and the Xing family is getting better?

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
The news he receives now should be

137
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,300
Xing Ge went back home,

138
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,833
had a big fight with Chairman Xing,

139
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,333
and left angrily.

140
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,933
Xing Ge, have some fruits.

141
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,733
How are you doing now after chemotherapy?

142
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,000
Much better.

143
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,200
If you want to tell me something, say it now.

144
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,833
I'm not used to you being like this.

145
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,300
Right.

146
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,900
We are not suitable for warm and touching conversations.

147
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:11,966
Make long story short.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,033
I have two things.

149
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,133
First,

150
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,433
I will work in the company,

151
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,566
but I won't go back Xing family.

152
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,333
The shares you promised to the Su family must be given to them.

153
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,600
Second,

154
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,766
Xing Yi

155
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,600
can do whatever he wants to do.

156
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Today I come here

157
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,033
to tell you my decision,

158
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:30,866
no matter you agree or not.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,232
I'm here to inform you that.

160
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,532
Xing Ge, I’m not dead yet.

161
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,666
I know.

162
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,033
Otherwise, who would try hard to

163
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:38,700
get me back home?

164
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
You hate me, don't you?

165
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,233
Why should you come back?

166
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,199
Of course I hate you.

167
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,366
So now I will get the company

168
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,266
you worked so hard to build.

169
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,866
How do you think about this way?

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,533
Okay, good.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,033
That's it.

172
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,933
I will get an assistant to

173
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,633
do all the paper works.

174
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,300
It’s not difficult to manage a company.

175
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
I will try not to be bankrupt.

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,933
Go, go away!

177
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,000
Get out of here!

178
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay, calm down.

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,633
He left. Who are you pretending being mad at now?

180
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,333
Mr. Cao,

181
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,433
the one who monitors Xing Ge

182
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,300
saw him and Chairman Xing had a fight.

183
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,000
He seemed to be angry when he left.

184
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,833
Keep a close eye on him for me.

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,533
This is a critical moment,

186
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,266
I don't need any accident.

187
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:32,066
Okay,

188
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,566
go ahead.

189
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,166
Lao Su,

190
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,866
I gave you an opportunity,

191
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:48,633
but you couldn't let the past go.

192
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,400
You can't blame me now.

193
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,633
After tomorrow, Nianqiao will be mine.

194
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,166
I'm back.

195
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,400
Here you are.

196
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,666
Didn't you make Uncle Xing angry today?

197
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,933
I think I didn't.

198
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,066
I asked you to act being mad,

199
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,666
not really being mad at him.

200
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,500
From acting to being real,

201
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,966
isn't it what happened to us?

202
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,666
I'm going to take shower, come with me?

203
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,600
No!

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,500
All ready?

205
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,533
Yes.

206
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,333
Then I will wait for good news from you.

207
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:36,466
Sure, Miss Su.
