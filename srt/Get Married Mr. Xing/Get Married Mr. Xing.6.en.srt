1
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,500
Won't it be

2
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,966
Breakfast on the table. Enjoy.

3
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,666
OK.

4
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,333
This is really beautiful and delicious.

5
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,533
You have so many empty rooms.

6
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,233
Can I rend one room?

7
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,600
No.

8
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,133
Go after eating.

9
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,733
Don't forget your luggage.

10
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,233
It doesn't matter.

11
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:00,000
I can definitely come here again.

12
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,166
This is information I recently searched.

13
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,333
They've been together a lot lately.

14
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:48,800
Thanks.

15
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,633
You are welcome.

16
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,733
A glass of lemonade, thanks.

17
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,600
Brother.

18
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:25,800
What are you here for?

19
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,466
Brother, don't worry.

20
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,966
I'm not here to persuade you to go home.

21
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,066
Xing family plans to arrange marriage with Su family.

22
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,533
This is the other party's information.

23
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,966
Xing family has nothing to do with me.

24
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,133
Is marriage something I need to consider?

25
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:43,466
But this person has something to do with you.

26
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,733
Leave if you have nothing.

27
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,733
Brother. I

28
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,466
Come to the bar without drinking.

29
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,066
Just drink lemonade.

30
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,000
Why is it you again?

31
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,566
My name is Lu Wenxi.

32
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,033
Thank you for the water last time.

33
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:16,966
No need.

34
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
It's really from you.

35
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,300
May I have your name?

36
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,333
Excuse me.

37
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,666
I have something. I go first.

38
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,633
Twenty-first?

39
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,233
Wenxi.

40
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,866
She is so great.

41
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,800
But I

42
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,500
Su Nian.

43
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,433
General Manager of Nianqiao Group.

44
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,200
Chairman's only daughter.

45
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,266
What's up?

46
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:28,266
Can't you find your way home?

47
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
My name is Xiao Xiaosu. What about you?

48
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,466
Why don't you answer me?

49
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
You can't speak?

50
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't cry.

51
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,766
I treat you to some sweets.

52
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,266
I'll take you to my secret garden again.

53
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,666
How about it？

54
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,066
Let's go.

55
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,066
It turned out to be you.

56
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,133
Why are you following me?

57
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,933
I am not.

58
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,200
I go home too.

59
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
I just told you my name.

60
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,533
You haven't told me what your name is yet.

61
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,700
Xing Yi.

62
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,133
Miss Lu, please weigh your behaviors.

63
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,766
I weigh eighty-five pounds

64
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,466
Do you think I'm heavy?

65
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,733
Miss Lu.

66
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Our relationship is not that familiar?

67
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
I hope we keep our distance.

68
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Just say straight to the point.

69
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,300
I quite like you.

70
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,266
Then I might disappoint you.

71
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,733
I'm not the casual kind of person.

72
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,866
You didn't refuse.

73
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,000
You're tacitly agreeing.

74
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
If nothing,

75
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,700
I'll take my leave now.

76
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:05,800
Xing Yi.

77
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
If we meet again next time.

78
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,466
Just give me your contact information.

79
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Xing Ge, you are off work.

80
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,233
Why are you still here?

81
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm waiting for you here.

82
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
My things are still at your place.

83
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,733
I am afraid of disturbing you.

84
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,766
So I waited at the door.

85
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,466
Am I considerate?

86
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,866
Let's go.

87
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:47,800
OK.
