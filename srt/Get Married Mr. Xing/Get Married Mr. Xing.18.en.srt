1
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,100
Dad! See who is here!

2
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,266
Auntie, is Uncle Xing okay?

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,066
It's not as serious as Xing Yi said.

4
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,433
Xing Yi knows his brother’s temper,

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
even if his father fell ill,

6
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,366
he would be too proud to be here.

7
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,633
After all, there is still a wound in his heart.

8
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,533
So we asked you to take him here,

9
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,166
for building a bridge for them.

10
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,966
I understand, auntie.

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
It's good to hear that uncle Xing is okay.

12
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,300
Su Nian,

13
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,166
thank you for bringing my brother here.

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,633
Nothing.

15
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,966
I also hope that

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
they can clarify the misunderstanding in person.

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,366
Why are they so quiet?

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,733
Aunt,

19
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,466
don't worry.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Maybe it's a good thing to be quiet.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
At least they are not quarreling.

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,033
Right.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,333
I'm fine.

24
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,033
They are just making a fuss.

25
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:04,700
Good.

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,833
Then I'm leaving.

27
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:06,666
Xing Ge!

28
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,600
Stay in hospital to treat.

29
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:11,666
Xing Yi is not a kid anymore.

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,166
He can run the company properly.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,533
Don't be stubborn, after all you are getting old.

32
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,600
I know myself very well.

33
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,700
Don't leave in a hurry. Just hear me out.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,633
Your little brother doesn't want to run the company.

35
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:25,866
He refused to take over it.

36
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,600
And I'm like this now.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,100
Since you are together with Su Nian,

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,433
you take over the company.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,533
No.

40
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,366
The conflict between you and me is just between us.

41
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,666
The company is business.

42
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,200
Why can't you distinguish between business and family affairs?

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,333
You are the one who can't distinguish between business and family.

44
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,000
I know you hate me,

45
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,133
so you don't care about the company.

46
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,533
But don't forget,

47
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,733
your mom also put energy and efforts to the company.

48
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,433
Don't mention my mom.

49
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,333
So many years passed,

50
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,133
do you still hate me?

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,900
I hated you.

52
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,000
And-

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
And now?

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,233
Will you believe me if I say no?

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
I've tried to understand you over the years.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,133
But that's useless.

57
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,166
The only person who can forgive you

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,733
had already died.

59
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,700
Son...

60
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,733
Take care.

61
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,100
I need to go.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,433


63
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,333
Let's go.

64
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,900
Auntie, we are leaving.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,133
Goodbye.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,700
Xing Ge,

67
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,133
can I talk to you privately?

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
I can wait for you

69
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,366
over there.

70
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:18,466
What's up?

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,833
Sorry,

72
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,500
for getting you here in this way.

73
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,966
I will teach Xing Yi a lesson for what he did.

74
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,666
You don't need to apologize for him.

75
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,566
Actually, I'm very happy that you can come to see Lao Xing.

76
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,466
He's never mentioned

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,566
but actually he's always thought about you.

78
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,633
Thank you for taking care of him in these years.

79
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,933
We are families, you don't need to say that.

80
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,633
And there is one more thing

81
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,500
I want to tell you.

82
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:50,933
Okay, say it.

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,200
After your mom died,

84
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,866
he planed to bring you up alone.

85
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,866
But fate allows us

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,400
to meet at work.

87
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,366
He originally didn't want to get married again,

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,666
but I has a crush on him, so...

89
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,766
Don't blame him, blame me.

90
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,866
Why are you telling me this?

91
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,566
I just hope that

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,833
you can come to visit him more

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,500
when he is alive,

94
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,100
now that you know he is not that bad as you thought.

95
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,766
After we got married,

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
you became more isolate,

97
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,833
unwilling to get close to anyone.

98
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,333
When you fell asleep,

99
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,066
you've always held your mother’s diary.

100
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,233
Do you know that

101
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,733
every time when you fall asleep,

102
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,733
he would be by your side watching you.

103
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,066
Only at this time,

104
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,266
you wouldn't hide from him.

105
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,566
He knows you've hated him,

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,333
so he's never gone to see you all over those years.

107
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,633
If it weren't for his disease,

108
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,166
he won't force you like that.

109
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,233
Now that you are willing to visit him here,

110
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,333
I hope you can go back home.

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,333
Your dad

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,900
has dreamed that our whole family could be reunited.

113
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,233
Take care of him.

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,133
Okay.

115
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,133
Let's go home.

116
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:58,966
My phone is in my pocket.

117
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,333
Your mom.

118
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,533
Just pick it up.

119
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,466
Hello, mom?

120
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,766
Today my wish is finally fulfilled.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,033
Xiao Su and Xing Yi are good.

122
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,833
You and Wenxi should take care of each other in the future.

123
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,966
I know, mom.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,700
You told me before that

125
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,933
you wanted to use Wenxi to ask Su Nian to help us,

126
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:16,866
I've always felt that this method wouldn't work...

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,733
Mom, mom!

128
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,633
Well, I-I need to go.

129
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,466
I'm busy with working.

130
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:20,100
Goodbye!

131
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,433
You used me?

132
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,166
Do explain to me.

133
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,233
Xing Yi did that

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,733
for your and your dad's good.

135
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,866
Although I have also wavered

136
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,266
about persuading you go back home,

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,233
I don't want you to be upset.

138
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,500
No matter what you are going to do,

139
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,333
I will support you.

140
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,432
Okay if you don't want to say that,

141
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,166
let me ask you.

142
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,700
When did you know

143
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,033
the relationship between Su Nian and me?

144
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,233
After knowing that I would marry the girl from the Su family,

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,033
I asked someone to investigate Su Nian,

146
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:03,666
I knew it after seeing the information.

147
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,833
I've always been thinking,

148
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,100
Su Nian is not a fool,

149
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,566
how could she chase after the wrong person?

150
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,766
So,

151
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
you must have done something.

152
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,466
It seems that I deserved all these.

153
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,366
I deserved be used by others.

154
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,700
So you rejected me in the beginning

155
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,333
just because-

156
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,066
No!

157
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,833
Let me speak.

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
Why are you so impatient?

159
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm the one who is fooled,

160
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,200
not you.

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800
So that day the drug thing in the bar

162
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,666
is also you.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,500
No.

164
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,133
Wenxi, I admit that

165
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,066
at first I thought about asking you to help me,

166
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,766
but I didn't do that.

167
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,533
Yes.

168
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
You didn't do that.

169
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:03,833
It's me who is that stupid

170
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,933
to do that for you by my own.

171
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,700
That day, you took me to visit your parents

172
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,000
just for that, right?

173
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,866
Such a coincidence,

174
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,133
letting me know about your dad's illness.

175
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:22,633
Xing Yi, you are really smart

176
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,433
to make such a good plan.

177
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:26,566
No,

178
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,866
Wenxi, listen to me,

179
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,200
I only knew about his illness

180
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,933
back then.

181
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,833
Wenxi, please believe me.

182
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,000
Except this,

183
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,366
everything else I said to you is true.

184
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,333
I'm sincere to you.

185
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,433
Xing Yi,

186
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,066
how can you make it?

187
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,533
After using me,

188
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,466
you can still say you are sincere to me?

189
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,000
