1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,033
Brother, you want to see me?

2
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,833
When you gave me Su Nian's information,

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
why didn't you tell me

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
she thought I were you?

5
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,566
I wanted to tell you,

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,800
but then I saw

7
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,233
you two were that sweet.

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,966
So I decided to not tell you.

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,133
Why did you give me her information?

10
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,533
I just want you to know the Su family's difficulties.

11
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:12,966
Just that simple?

12
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:15,866
You wanted to use to marriage to

13
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,333
let me go back to Xing family.

14
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,066
Did he ask you to do this?

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,233
No.

16
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,166
Dad doesn't know about this at all.

17
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,133
It's because I don’t want to take over the company.

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Sorry brother.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,033
I did that without telling you.

20
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,233
You don't want to take over the company,

21
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,300
and you think I want to?

22
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,766
Tell him,

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,866
stop using Su Nian to get me back.

24
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,200
To be honest, I really like him.

25
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,266
It would be better if he didn't mention marriage.

26
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,600
I can have a beautiful relationship.

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Dating is beautiful,

28
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,900
and marriage not?

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,133
Can that be the same?

30
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,366
When you are dating,

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,100
you can say anything sweet and nice.

32
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,500
You don't need to take responsibility for what you say.

33
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,566
It's different when you get married.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
You see, my parents are the best example.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,433
Wenxi, you are too pessimistic.

36
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,600
Don't mention him anymore.

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,033
If he won't work,

38
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,566
I can get another one.

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,400
How about you?

40
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,300
Did Xing Ge forgive you?

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,266
I have no idea.

42
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,300
Maybe he is still mad at me.

43
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,366
Let me review it for you?

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,933
Okay.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,733
Tell me then.

46
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,300
Well, after what happened that day,

47
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,966
all the people will think you lied to him.

48
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,900
Niannian? Niannian?

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,833
When you wake up,

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,666
you have to thank me properly.

51
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,900
Xing Ge.

52
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:29,633
why don't you just tell me who you are?

53
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,633
You have to let me guess?

54
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,333
Why are you so petty?

55
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,966
Xing Ge...

56
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,100
Xing Ge...

57
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:04,833
Xing Ge...

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,233
This is my secret base.

59
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,300
How is it? Does it look good?

60
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
Now you can tell me

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,133
about your secret.

62
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,366
Don't worry.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I won't tell anyone else.

64
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,266
Pinky swear.

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,733
I, Little Su, won't lie to you.

66
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,400
You want to give it to me?

67
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,966
Thank you for staying with me.

68
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,100
So you can speak?

69
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,900
I thought you were mute.

70
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,166
It's him!

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,000
How could I not recognize him?

72
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,600
Xing Ge!

73
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,633
Xing Ge!

74
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,366
Thank you very much.

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,100
Okay, no problem.

76
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,566
If you have any questions, contact me again.

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Okay, okay.

78
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,366
Byebye.

79
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,733
Wenxi, I've been waiting for you for a long time

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,500
Didn't I say that clearly?

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,900
Clearly enough.

82
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,833
But, Wenxi,

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,466
you like me,

84
00:05:58,466 --> 00:05:59,666
and I like you.

85
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,166
Based on this,

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,066
we have a closer relationship,

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,633
then next step,

88
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,566
shouldn't we establish a stable relationship

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,066
to learn more about each other?

90
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,300
But this stable relationship does not include marriage.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
If you reject marriage and family now,

92
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,700
let’s not mention those for now.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,333
Xing Yi, do you know that

94
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,666
you don't know me at all?

95
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,966
I have done all these for you.

96
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,266
What on earth do you want me to do

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,433
and you will think I understand you enough?

98
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,500
You want to know me?

99
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,433
Yeah.

100
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,933
Okay.

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,133
Tomorrow I will take you to learn more about my life.

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

103
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,766
Boss, here you are.

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Good morning, Miss Lu.

105
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Not bad.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,333
Let me see.

107
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,766
This look is quite good.

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Suitable for luxury goods.

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,233
Isn't it?

110
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,166
And here.

111
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,800
The shirt underneath it,

112
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,900
change another one.

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,333
Replace all the green ones.

114
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,800
It's good overall.

115
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,666
Miss Lu, do you miss me?

116
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
Of course I miss you!

117
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,800
Come on!

118
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,166
How about me?

119
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,700
Not bad today,

120
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,733
but you makeup,

121
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,633
who did that for you?

122
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
Who is this?

123
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,533
You brought me here just to show me these?

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,566
What's wrong?

125
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,633
You can't stand these?

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,933
This is my life.

127
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Okay, go on.

128
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,566
Alvin,

129
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,000
get him something.

130
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,666
Okay boss.

131
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,033
Good.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,933
If you can't stand it anymore, you can leave at any time.

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,233
I won't, Miss Lu.

134
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

135
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,166
Let me do it.

136
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,033
Are you ready?

137
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,800
Then I'm going to start.

138
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,366
Another one.

139
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:13,666
One more.

140
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,733
Another one.

141
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,000
Another one.

142
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,333
Another one.

143
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,233
Another one.

144
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,033
Do you know how to work? Another one.

145
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:37,833
Not enough.

146
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,133
Another one.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,633
Don't you know

148
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,566
how to behave when taking photos?

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,900
Can't you behave?

150
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,600
Miss Lu, you are jealous?

151
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not.

152
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
I just can't see you

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
being unprofessional.

154
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,900
Same as you,

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,666
I felt the same way

156
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,300
when saw you

157
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,700
standing with another man?

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,633
So what?

159
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,166
I just want to tell you,

160
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,433
this is me.

161
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,266
If you can't accept it, stay away from me.

162
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,666
Forgot to tell you,

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,433
all these male models in our company

164
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,733
were my ex-boyfriends.
