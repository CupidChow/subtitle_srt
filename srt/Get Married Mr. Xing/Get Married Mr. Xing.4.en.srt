1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
No. I really can't run anymore.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm exhausted.

3
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,666
Where are they?

4
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,366
Over there.

5
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:53,100
Follow me.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,633
Where are you going?

7
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,066
Nothing.

8
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:05,466
Where are they?

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,333
Go over there and have a look.

10
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,233
Go. Over there.

11
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,533
They are crafty.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Sorry.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,433
Mr. Xing.

14
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,166
For the sake of running with you

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,433
can you explain to me?

16
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,300
Besides,

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,433
I just saw it.

18
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,700
To protect your girlfriend,

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,300
you took me to attract their attention.

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,366
You've gone too far, right?

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Not girlfriend.

22
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,466
What?

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
Where are they?

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,666
They were here just now.

25
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,566
They are gone now.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,933
Go look over there?

27
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,933
Let's go. Take a look over there.

28
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,700
Miss Su.

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,966
They should have left already.

30
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:00,066
Isn't she really your girlfriend?

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,166
No.

32
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,066
So what's your relationship?

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,200
Why do you ask so many questions?

34
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,699
Didn't you say she was short of money?

35
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,833
I can lend money to her

36
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,266
without interest.

37
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:15,466
Miss Su.

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,333
Not everything can be solved with money.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,033
Does it hurt?

40
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:30,966
Go to the hospital.

41
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,366
It's okay. It'll be fine in a few days.

42
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,566
Are you sure?

43
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,733
Why are you like this?

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,766
Why not give me a princess hug?

45
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,933
So my brother took out a loan shark

46
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,533
because there is no money to develop the software.

47
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,100
He had to borrow.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,300
He still had no money to pay back after maturity.

49
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,300
The other party just found me.

50
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,333
What is the relationship

51
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,166
between your brother and Xing Ge?

52
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,166
Stop.

53
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,366
Friend.

54
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,300
This matter

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,566
I can help you solve it fundamentally.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,966
But I have a request.

57
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:34,966
I want your WeChat and contact information.

58
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,500
Pass it.

59
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,166
Wait a moment, I'll make a call.

60
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,566
Hello. Si Jue.

61
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,866
I remember our company before

62
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,066
invested in a software company.

63
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,733
Go get in touch it.

64
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,333
Tomorrow afternoon

65
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,766
I made an appointment with a software company.

66
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,166
Take you and your brother

67
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,166
go there together.

68
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,600
Thank you so much.

69
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,700
In fact, this matter in the end is up to

70
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,833
whether your brother's software

71
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,333
is worth their investment.

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,600
It's good to have hope.

73
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,966
Thank you. Miss Su.

74
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:32,800
Never mind.

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,966
Damn it. How could I forget her?

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,166
Remember to reply to WeChat.

77
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,066
I'm leaving first.

78
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Bye bye.

79
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,866
You actually abandoned me for

80
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,333
a man you didn't even get.

81
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,966
I must teach you a lesson today.

82
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,566
After much searching,

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,266
it's finally found with ease.

84
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,533
My twenty-first man.

85
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,600
You bumped into me yourself.

86
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,833
Wenxi, I finally found you.

87
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,133
Why don't you answer my call?

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,066
Don't be angry.

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,466
Su Nian.

90
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,200
Don't stop me.

91
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,700
We will still be sisters in the next life.

92
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,633
What next life?

93
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,866
We are good friends in this life.

94
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,400
I'll treat you to your favorite restaurant.

95
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,166
OK?

96
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:51,633
Is it yours?

97
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,766
we meet again.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,666
Aren't you face blind?

99
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,133
You remember me?

100
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:00,833
I remember your glasses.

101
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:03,100
Take your phone and don't forget it.

102
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,366
Thank you.

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,066
If not for you

104
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,266
I will lose my phone.

105
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,066
Let's add a sandwich.

106
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,133
I treat you to WeChat.

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,366
No. Thanks.

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,833
You are great.

109
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,366
Teach me another trick.

110
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,500
Nian.

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,700
He is so handsome.

112
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,966
I will definitely chase him down.

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,100
A sense of first love.

114
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
What is it like?

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,033
What are you doing?

116
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,433
Hello.

117
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,233
Have you got a meal yet?

118
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:27,433
Hello.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,833
I sent you so many messages.

120
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,533
Why don't you reply to me?

121
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,633
Have you forgotten that I helped Xiaoye?

122
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,233
You can't repay me like this.

123
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,600
I was busy and didn't look at my phone.

124
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,300
All right.

125
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,233
If you see it later, please reply to my message.

126
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,566
Try your best.

127
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,033
Well, treat you to dinner another day.

128
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,700
Then I'll take it as your promise.

129
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:54,733
Time and place will be sent to you later.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,333
Miss. Su.

131
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,933
Are you ready for tomorrow's activities?

132
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:08,500
No problem.

133
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,833
Mr. Su, don't worry.

134
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:31,900
Hello

135
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,133
The equity acquisition must be done quickly.

136
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,399
Su Nian has already begun to doubt me.

137
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,466
When you are dating your girlfriend,

138
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,600
what do your girlfriends usually wear?

139
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,533
Miss. Su, don't worry.

140
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:56,800
I have been single for twenty-seven years.

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
In the future I will also spend all my time

142
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,266
dedicated to the company and you.

143
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,500
It's not necessary.

144
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,233
No.

145
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:06,066
You're single, what kind of advisor can you be to me.

146
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,366
Although I have no practical experience.

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,100
I have rich theoretical knowledge.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,066
Nonsense.
