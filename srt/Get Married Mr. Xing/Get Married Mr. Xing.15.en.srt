1
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,066
Here you are.

2
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,166
You've been waiting here for me?

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,433
You didn't reply me on WeChat,

4
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,900
and didn't answer my call.

5
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,266
I don't know how to do.

6
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,333
So I can only want you here.

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,433
But it's okay,

8
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
I know why you are mad.

9
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,333
So,

10
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,466
can you forgive me now?

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,700
You did this

12
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,100
for the shares?

13
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,033
For you.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,933
So will you forgive me or not?

15
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,933
I knew it!

16
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,633
You are smiling, so you can't regret.

17
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,600
Smilling means that you forgive me.

18
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,699
So you forgive me, right?

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,133
One more.

20
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:27,900
Come on.

21
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,833
Do you know why I left Xing family?

22
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
After my mom gave birth to me,

23
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,766
she suffered from very severe postpartum depression.

24
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,866
During that time, he went out early and came back late every day,

25
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
with different perfumes.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,133
Later,

27
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,533
my mother couldn't help but asked him,

28
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,833
he just told my mother indifferently

29
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:09,866
that stop overthinking.

30
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,566
And then, my mother's illness became more and more serious.

31
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:20,433
Died in front of me when I was six.

32
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,533
Then how did you know about this?

33
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
My mother has the habit of keeping a diary.

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,100
I recognized many words for the first time

35
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
from her diary.

36
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,400
Those unfamiliar words

37
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,366
are full of pain and despair,

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,466
and the struggle of having to persevere

39
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,733
for me.

40
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,400
If it weren't for him,

41
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,066
my mom wouldn't have died.

42
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,866
Su Nian, I can help you get your shares back.

43
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:06,533
Don't.

44
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,666
But you-

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,866
I will come up with other ideas.

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Wenxi,

47
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,333
come on, watch out.

48
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,100
Come on.

49
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,766
I'm funny like this, right?

50
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,933
Wenxi,

51
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,366
are you happy?

52
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm happy. Of course I'm happy.

53
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Except happiness,

54
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,033
I have nothing else.

55
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,566
With all those handsome guys around me,

56
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,733
of course I'm happy,

57
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,966
so happy.

58
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,633
I'm used to freedom and don't want to be restrained.

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,733
Xing Yi, is it dating enough for you?

60
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,600
Why do you have to get married?

61
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,366
I can tell you clearly that

62
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,233
I'm not a good partner to marry.

63
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,233
Wenxi,

64
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,600
actually,

65
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,666
I'm not a good marriage partner either.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,900
Miss Su, please sit down.

67
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,466
Mr. Xing, why did you come to see me today?

68
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,666
I know there are some misunderstandings between us.

69
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,300
But I really like Wenxi.

70
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,700
So what do you want

71
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:36,933
from me?

72
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,200
I want to ask something about Wenxi.

73
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,066
Why Wenxi

74
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,400
so opposed to marriage?

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,266
Her parents got married soon after they met,

76
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,800
because her mom got pregnant.

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,533
Her mom's first marriage

78
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,866
only brought to her mother and her

79
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,666
domestic violence.

80
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,500
And her mom's second marriage

81
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,200
brought countless quarrels and calculations.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,066
So do you think she will long for marriage?

83
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:20,100
Xing Yi, if you really like her,

84
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,133
I hope you to understand her

85
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,066
rather than forcing her.

86
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:32,900
Are you sure?

87
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,732
The base price of new project,

88
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,599
in finance department, only Xiao Zhao knows.

89
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,466
And he and Director Cao are relatives.

90
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
Zhao resigned at this time,

91
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,600
if I'm not wrong,

92
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,933
he will most likely reveal the true base price.

93
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,833
Miss. Su, they were fooled.

94
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,400
What should we do next?

95
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,300
Keep an eye on Xiao Zhao,

96
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,000
you must grasp the evidence they give us.

97
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,100
Cao Sipeng wants to get Xing family's support,

98
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,400
then we need to turn the Xing family into a competitor.

99
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,433
Okay.

100
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,300
Got it.

101
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,000
Miss. Su, Cao Sipeng went to the hospital.

102
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,433
He should have gone to visit your father.

103
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:17,733
Then let's go there too.

104
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:18,266
Okay.

105
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,900
Lao Su, I know,

106
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,000
it was my fault.

107
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,366
I was too greedy back then,

108
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,466
and I did something bad to Nianqiao.

109
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,533
I think

110
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,700
all over those years,

111
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,566
I've never owed you anything.

112
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,300
When did you

113
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,966
came up with this idea?

114
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,466
Nianqiao was built by us together.

115
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,266
And you can just ruin it?

116
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:53,233
I know you're blaming me,

117
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,133
blaming me for showing your son

118
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,666
no mercy.

119
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,500
But a mistake is a mistake.

120
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,766
If he didn't get punishment

121
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
for sexual harassment,

122
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,600
he would make a bigger mistake.

123
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,666
I can't just cover up him,

124
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,666
just because he is your son.

125
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,233
Yeah.

126
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,400
Mr. Su, you did the right thing.

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,566
If the person who discovered it was me,

128
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,666
not to mention detention,

129
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,400
I'll definitely break his legs.

130
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,566
Okay, don't mention that anymore.

131
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,833
It has passed.

132
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
During these years,

133
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:34,766
you've used Nianqiao to strengthen your own Bo'an company.

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,733
I knew but I didn't mention it.

135
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,100
As for now,

136
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,700
let's just put it an end.

137
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,166
You want to drive me out of Nianqiao?

138
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,533
Nianqiao needs a chairman who is dedicated to it.

139
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,900
Just leave.

140
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,700
Those things you did,

141
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,766
I won’t report to the board of directors.

142
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,133
But I-

143
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:05,066
Stop talking. I'm tired.

144
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,833
Okay, have a good rest,

145
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll come over to see you another day.
