1
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Oh, it's Su Nian.

2
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
There are some work in company, I need to go.

3
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,000
Dad.

4
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,066
Here you are.

5
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,633
Sit down.

6
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,500
Dad, how are you feeling now?

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,666
I'm okay.

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,000
You met Cao Sipeng?

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,633
Yes.

10
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,300
Dad, after you woke up,

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,566
you have never settle accounts with Cao Sipeng,

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
why?

13
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,633
I guess

14
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,666
you don't want to alert him,

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,800
and then give me time to solve this matter.

16
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,133
I taught you how to do business myself.

17
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,066
I know you very well.

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,300
You will find a way to stop him.

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,700
What about the marriage with Xing family?

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,033
You have known uncle Xing for so long,

21
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,466
why did you mention that suddenly?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,233
Is it also related to Cao Sipeng?

23
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,833
Yes,

24
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,200
and no.

25
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,733
You've devoted yourself to your work,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,133
and had no plans to build a family at all.

27
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,066
How could your mother and I not be anxious?

28
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,900
By the way,

29
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,900
how are you and that boy going?

30
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,000
Dad,

31
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,866
I don't want him

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,733
to do what he doesn't want to do for me.

33
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,966
Don't you want Xing family’s share?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I do.

35
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,466
So I decided to try another way.

36
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,266
But don't go too far.

37
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,400
I know.

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,166
It's hard to make that boy let it go.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,333
Niannian,

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,666
we don’t ask for much as parents,

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,300
as long as you are happy.

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,133
I know.

43
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:40,633
Dad, so you have to stay with us all the time.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,600
Okay.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,033
Wenxi,

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I-

47
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,233
I've thought about it for a long time.

48
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,366
Let's be together.

49
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,633
Just dating, no marriage.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,833
From now on I will never mention marriage.

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,733
If I can be with you,

52
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,033
I promise you,

53
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,033
I won't quarrel with you,

54
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,533
I won't use emotional abuse toward you.

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,566
You can do whatever you want.

56
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,233
I will try to understand everything about you.

57
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,366
What if something goes wrong?

58
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:25,933
If we can't communicate face to face,

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
we can write letters to each other, okay?

60
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,866
Such an ancient way.

61
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,200
Are you sure there won't be communication problems?

62
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:37,133
You won't know if it works until you give it a try.

63
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,700
Dating and no marriage.

64
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,800
If you never plan to get married in your whole life,

65
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,266
we can date in our whole life.

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,166
Deal?

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Deal.

68
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,733
You said it yourself.

69
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,066
I didn't force you.

70
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,533
You-

71
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,566
you agreed?

72
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,366
I'll take you somewhere in a while.

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,500
Where?

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,733
You'll know when you go there.

75
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,633
Xiaonian, have it yourself.

76
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,733
Thank you, aunt.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,733
Uncle Xing,

78
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,766
I know people from Bo'an came to see you,

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,533
they want to develop the new project

80
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,966
with Xingshi Group.

81
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,866
Xiao Nian,

82
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,100
your father and I have been friends for many years.

83
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,000
But cooperation

84
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,666
needs to be suitable, doesn't it?

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,533
Yes.

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
Cooperation is all about win-win.

87
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,233
This plan will surely satisfy you.

88
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,400
This plan

89
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,566
is really tempting.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,566
But why did you give up all the profits?

91
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,533
You also know that

92
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,200
Nianqiao Group has had a mole

93
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,666
for so many years,

94
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,866
it's time to get rid of him.

95
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,633
Instead of letting others get the profit,

96
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,366
it's better you to give it to you.

97
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,366
Anyway, the result is the same to me.

98
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,500
Cooperation is no problem,

99
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,800
but I have a condition.

100
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,533
What's it?

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,933
I want you to persuade Xing Ge to go home.

102
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,066
Uncle Xing,

103
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,366
it has nothing to do with Xing Ge.

104
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:08,666
Except that,

105
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,766
as long as I can do, and Nianqiao can do,

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,700
I can promise you anything.

107
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,133
I know these two things can't be mixed,

108
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,700
but when you first got close to Xing Ge,

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,566
didn't you do that for shares?

110
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,200
I can promise you to cooperate with Nianqiao Group,

111
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:25,066
but I also hope Xing Ge can go home.

112
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,966
Uncle Xing,

113
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,833
I don’t want to do anything to make Xing Ge unhappy.

114
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,000
Lao Xing!

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,766
Well, then,

116
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,033
let’s put this cooperation aside for now.

117
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,966
I hope you can

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,033
think these things through when you go back.

119
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:50,166
Are you taking me to meet my parents?

120
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,700
Yes.

121
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,233
I promised you that I can do anything except get married.

122
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,900
But it doesn’t include meeting your parents.

123
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,100
Wenxi,

124
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,566
I did promise you I won't mention marriage anymore,

125
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:01,733
but

126
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,200
no marriage in my whole life,

127
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,933
I have to explain it to my parents.

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,433
I-I...er...

129
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,566
You are afraid?

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,700
How could it be?

131
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:11,900
Okay, then,

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Don't blame me if you get scolded for a while.

133
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,066
Don't worry, they won't hit me.

134
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,400
One more thing.

135
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,366
If you want them to agree,

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,333
no matter what I say for a while, don’t say anything.

137
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:24,933
Understand?

138
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:29,200
Why do I feel like I'm falling into a trap?

139
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,566
Xiao Yi.

140
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:34,800
Mom,

141
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,533
Wenxi, why are you here?

142
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,133
This is...?

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,933
Mom, let’s go in first.

144
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:44,966
Okay.

145
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,433
Aunt, go in first.

146
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,000
I need to go.

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,100
Okay, then drive tight.

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,833
Okay.

149
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,066
Let's go inside.

150
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Dad, mom,

151
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:10,666
let me introduce,

152
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,433
this is my girlfriend Lu Wenxi.

153
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,033
Nice to meet you, uncle, aunt.

154
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,400
Good, you got a girlfriend.

155
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,100
Now you and your brother both got beloved ones,

156
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,733
we are happy now.

157
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,866
But, mom,

158
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,733
Wenxi and I don’t plan to get married.

159
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,266
Of course, we understand,

160
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,266
you two just met.

161
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,700
As for marriage,

162
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,933
we can talk about it in a year or two.

163
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,100
Mom,

164
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,733
that's not what I meant.

165
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,600
Wenxi and I are not getting married now,

166
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
and we will never get married in the future.

167
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,466
What are you talking about?

168
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,533
He's kidding.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
It's an important event in life,

170
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,633
how could you not get married?

171
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,166
I'm not kidding.

172
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
This is my decision after consideration.

173
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,600
I hope you can respect my decision.

174
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,033
Xing Yi, what do you think you are doing?

175
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,466
It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not,

176
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:04,933
I've already made this decision.

177
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,166
And I'm just here to tell you.

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,866
Xing Yi!

179
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:11,833
Dad,

180
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,333
are you-

181
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:12,766
Go away.

182
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,566
No, dad.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Go to rest.

184
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,533
Dad!

185
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,966
Lao Xing, come to the room and have a rest.

186
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Shut up.

187
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,700
Lao Xing, be careful.

188
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,033
Don't be mad at kid.

189
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,833
I don’t want to do anything to make Xing Ge unhappy.

190
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,432
I can promise you to cooperate with Nian Qiao,

191
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:43,866
but I also hope Xing Ge can go home.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,033
Thank you.

193
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,933
Why are you so upset?

194
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,066
Any problem about the company?

195
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:02,133
No.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,066
I have set traps for Cao Sipeng,

197
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,700
just waiting for him to bite the bait.

198
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:09,866
Then what's wrong?

199
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
I just have to work overtime,

200
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,733
and can't stay with you tonight.

201
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,733
It's okay, go ahead.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Mom, how is my dad?

203
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,166
Mom! How is my dad?

204
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,633
It's okay, it's just high blood pressure.

205
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,333
Now he is napping after taking pills.

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,033
Xiao Lu,

207
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,866
his father has a bad temper,

208
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,366
it's hard to accept it now.

209
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,666
We as parents

210
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,166
can't force you to do anything.

211
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,066
But marriage is a major event in life,

212
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,166
you still need to think about it carefully.

213
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,533
Okay, let's call it a day.

214
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I won’t keep you either.

215
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,100
Mom,

216
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,966
let me send Wenxi back.

217
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:24,766
Just wait for me

218
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,366
<A diagnose of liver cancer of Mr. Xing>

219
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
When did you know this?
