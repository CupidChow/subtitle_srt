1
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,400
There you are.

2
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,233
You must haven't aten anything.

3
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,566
Come here, sit down.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,900
Come on.

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,133
Sit down here.

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,100
Wh-what are you doing?

7
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:06,366
I just want to apologize to you

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,666
for what I did that day.

9
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,733
These are some of the new dishes I have learned recently.

10
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,033
Try them.

11
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,066
Don’t eat those takeaways anymore.

12
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,366
Those things are not healthy enough.

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,933
From now on, I will cover all your three meals a day.

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,133
I'm not hungry now.

15
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,666
But you can eat some even if you are not hungry.

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,600
Just a little.

17
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,566
Let me feed you.

18
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,066
Try it.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,866
Just try it, please.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,866
Okay.

21
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,733
Let's get married.

22
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,133
I've never thought about marriage.

23
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,466
How could you do this?

24
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,566
After kissing me,

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
you are not planning to take responsibility?

26
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,266
Why do you want to get married that much?

27
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,566
Of course I want to.

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,933
I am in my twenties.

29
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,466
It’s time to get married.

30
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,800
You don't want you career anymore?

31
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,033
I want it.

32
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,133
I need to get married to getp

33
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,433
Get what?

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,433
Get the qualification to build my career.

35
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,766
People always said get married and start a career is necessary for adults.

36
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,766
Then you must first get married and then start a career.

37
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,333
Yeah?

38
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:19,333
Of course.

39
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,800
Do you agree?

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,933
How do you say?

41
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,300
No.

42
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,433
Didn't you make a bet with me

43
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,233
on whether I would fall in love with you within a month?

44
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,233
You haven't won the bet yet.

45
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,600
That is to say,

46
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,533
as long as you fall in love with me,

47
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,566
you will marry me.

48
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,600
We will see.

49
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,566
That means you agreed.

50
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,666
It means you agreed right?

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,266
I'll just assume you agree.

52
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,266
Hello?

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,666
Niannian, you dad woke up!

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,066
Really? Great!

55
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,166
I'll go there tomorrow.

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Okay, see you tomorrow.

57
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,133
Okay, bye.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,933
What's the matter?

59
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,866
My da-

60
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:06,600
Your dad...?

61
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,066
I told him that

62
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,100
I don't have a good relationship with my family, right?

63
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,133
If I tell him the truth now,

64
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,966
he may find that I lied to him.

65
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:20,066
I mean my dearest cat

66
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,266
was sent to vet.

67
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,300
And

68
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,666
the vet called me that

69
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,133
my cat got better now.

70
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,300
I can go to see it tomorrow.

71
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:30,800
Where is the vet?

72
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,666
Do you want me to take you there?

73
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:32,733
No.

74
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,200
On my way to the interview tomorrow.

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,700
You are going for an interview?

76
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,566
Yes, I have an interview tomorrow.

77
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,866
Then I wish you success in advance.

78
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,333
Okay.

79
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,266
Cheers.

80
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,533
Dad! Mom!

81
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,066
There you are.

82
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,466
Uncle Xing.

83
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,300
Why are you here so early?

84
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,133
I heard that my dad woke up.

85
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,600
So I come here earlier.

86
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,533
Why? Don't you want to see me?

87
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:11,700
Oh come on.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Doctor said that it's okay.

89
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:17,266
I can be discharged after a further period of observation.

90
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,166
Go back to work.

91
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,600
Lao Su, we are all at this age now.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
You don't need worry too much about work.

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,933
Pay more attention to your health.

94
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,066
Uncle Xing,

95
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,366
I made an appointment with your secretary before

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
to talk with you.

97
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I didn't expect to see you in the hospital today.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,666
You are that busy now.

99
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,800
What do you want to talk with me?

100
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,233
I mainly want to ask about something in company.

101
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,033
I want to know your opinion.

102
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,533
Dad,

103
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:46,666
I knew the promise of marriage between two families.

104
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:48,833
This promise

105
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,966
was made

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,833
by your uncle Xing

107
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,100
to help Nianqiao Group to get through crisis.

108
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,933
Didn't you refuse that back then?

109
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,600
You changed your mind now?

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,266
I met a guy,

111
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,200
and we've got along with each other.

112
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,133
Guess who is that guy?

113
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,866
He is Uncle Xing's son.

114
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:11,966
Really?

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
You two are seeing each other?

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,433
How can I lie to you about this?

117
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:19,300
Lao Su, we are going to become a family.

118
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,233
Yeah.

119
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,066
How about this?

120
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,100
Our two families

121
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,633
should have a dinner together.

122
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,066
Okay, sure.

123
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,866
Xiao Su, don't worry.

124
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,266
I know the difficulties Nianqiao Group is facing now.

125
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,766
If it weren't for your father

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,300
insisting on this engagement,

127
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,233
I would have given the shares back to him a long time ago.

128
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,133
Now it's perfect.

129
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,033
We can have it both ways.

130
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,866
Thank you, uncle Xing.

131
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,900
Lao Su, you have raised a good daughter.

132
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,966
Are you sure that

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,000
this is the guy Su Nian has got close?

134
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,433
This man seems to be named Xing Ge.

136
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,433
Xing Ge?

137
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,500
Are you sure he is Xing Ge, not Xing Yi?

138
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:05,700
Got it.

139
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,333
Huh, Su Nian,

140
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,333
you are not that clever all the time.

141
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,600
Mr. Cao, what do you mean?

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
I got the news that

143
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:20,066
Xing family wants Su Nian to marry Xing Yi.

144
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,500
But now Su Nian is getting close

145
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,600
to the other son that refused to go back home.

146
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,700
What a scene it will be?

147
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,733
Since they will make a scene,

148
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,233
I need to help them.

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
By the way, Miss Su,

150
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,166
Mr. Cao has taken some moves recently.

151
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,233
He seemed to send someone to monitor you.

152
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,333
Let him be.

153
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,800
Hurry up to collect evidence about his mistake.

154
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,700
Be sure to complete it before the bidding for the project of Xincheng Disctrict.

155
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,300
Okay.

156
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,666
Well, send me to him bar.

157
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,666
You are going to see him?

158
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,266
What? I'm going to see Wenxi.

159
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,233
Do you know

160
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:18,500
how can I let him marry me?

161
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,200
Make him love you.

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,833
Can't we get married first and learn to love each other later?

163
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,633
No.

164
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,900
If my boyfriend propose to me now,

165
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
I will dump him immediately.

166
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,200
It's okay to date,

167
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,433
marriage,

168
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,066
abosolutely no!

169
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,566
Xing Ge is not you.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,866
But this is what most people think too.

171
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,300
You are too impatient.

172
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,200
I can't help being anxious.

173
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,233
The meeting of shareholders will be held in next month.

174
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,333
If I can't get

175
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,733
Xing family's shares,

176
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,533
Nianqiao Group is really about to be controlled by Cao Sipeng.

177
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,333
By then,

178
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,233
not only chairman will be changed,

179
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,666
but the whole Group

180
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,866
will become his.

181
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,800
But a watched pot never boils.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,833
Mr. Cao.

183
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,600
I will ask him one more time tonight.

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,433
If he agrees, we will get married.

185
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,133
If he doesn't, I will force him to marry me.

186
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,100
So that's why you have a lot drinks today?

187
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,166
Because you need some Dutch courage?

188
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,400
No, I don't!

189
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,100
Isn't it your 21 guy?

190
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,333
Right! It's him.

191
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,732
He doesn't drink alcohol at all.

192
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:40,765
What is he doing here?

193
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Xing Ge?

194
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,766
They know each other?

195
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,300
Wait a moment!

196
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,233
Do you think they look like each other?

197
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,800
What's your 21 guy's name?

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Xing Yi.

199
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,633
Which Yi?

200
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,300
Like this.

201
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:21,966
<Ge as Xing Ge>

202
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,033
Stop overthinking.

203
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,966
Maybe it's a coincidence.

204
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,366
How many sons does Xing family have, check it for me.

205
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,033
And,

206
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,100
who on earth my dad wants me to marry?

207
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,733
No, I'm going to ask them.

208
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,633
I need to go,

209
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,366
please go with me.

210
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:13,133
What's the relationship between you two?
