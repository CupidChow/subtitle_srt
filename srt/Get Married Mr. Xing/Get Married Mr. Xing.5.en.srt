1
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,333
Matchmaker sandwich.

2
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,733
Please help me see him again.

3
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,733
Please!

4
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,166
Thank you, sandwich!

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,133
Thank you! Thank you!

6
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,633
What a coincidence!

7
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,500
You are here to buy sandwich?

8
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,833
I didn't thank you properly for the phone thing last time.

9
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,066
Which one do you want?

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,200
Pick whatever you like.

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,466
No need.

12
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,266
I'm going to another store to buy sandwich.

13
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,800
I bought a lot.

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,700
It will be a waste if you refuse me.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,900
How much are these? I will transfer it to you.

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,700
Okay.

17
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,166
Payment code, thank you.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Friend me on WeChat.

19
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:51,933
And then transfer to me.

20
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,166
Sorry, I don't friend strangers on WeChat.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm not a stranger.

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,433
This is the third time we have met.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,733
How can strangers have such a deep bond?

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,066
Thank you. Keep the change.

25
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,966
Beside, think about the hard work of farmers,

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,933
don't waste these.

27
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,366
Good,

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,133
you make me want you more.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
What's wrong?

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,333
Oh I'm so careless.

31
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,200
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:37,866
Thank you, miss.

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,733
It's okay, it's okay.

34
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,833
I can't believe that

35
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,233
I didn't do this properly.

36
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,466
Okay, okay, just leave it there.

37
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,800
Leave it there.

38
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,300
Just give it to me.

39
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:51,033
I know there are still many good people in the world

40
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,300
Here, come on.

41
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,566
Such a young girl like you,

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,966
I- well, I don't know what to do.

43
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,266
Here?

44
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,466
Put it here, just put it here.

45
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,600
Sorry.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,133
Thank you, thanks.

47
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:08,733
Byebye! Byebye!

48
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,466
It's okay. Be careful.

49
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:25,900
It's him.

50
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,033
What should I choose?

51
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,800
Steak?

52
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,933
No, it's too formal.

53
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,633
Barbecue.

54
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,566
Nice, this one is good.

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,566
What are you doing?

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,700
You scared the shit out of me! Why are you here?

57
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,433
I'm here to take care of you.

58
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,833
I think you came here

59
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,833
because you didn't meet that 21 guy.

60
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,833
That Mr. Xing of yours,

61
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,633
did you get him?

62
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:08,733
Almost.

63
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,433
Got it.

64
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,266
You didn't get him yet.

65
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,600
Who said that?

66
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,300
We're going on a date soon.

67
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,899
I'm faster than you this time, right?

68
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,399
You sure that's a date?

69
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,633
Doesn't a thank-you meal count as a date?

70
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,233
I think

71
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,200
that guy is not ordinary person.

72
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,166
Since he wants to play a role

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,666
in a script about a rich boy experiencing life of ordinary people.

74
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,066
You might as well play with him.

75
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,300
What?

76
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,533
See.

77
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,133
These are the scripts I found for you.

78
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,200
Different genres, pick whatever you like.

79
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,333
As long as you do as it says,

80
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,766
you can definitely get him.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,933
You mean acting in front him?

82
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,900
But that is equal to lie to him.

83
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,566
No, no, no.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,300
Then what other options do you have?

85
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,400
Are you sure?

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,400
Daughter True and Fake.

87
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,166
True rich girl runs away from home,

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,800
The fake one becomes a Cinderella-like girl.

89
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,733
What's this, Lu Wenxi?

90
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,066
I didn’t expect you actually like this kind of things.

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,333
Just for entertainment.

92
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,366
It's funny, okay?

93
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,733
This has nothing to do with reality.

94
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,166
This is too exaggerated.

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,633
Exaggerated?

96
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,033
But it is same with those dramas.

97
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,300
You also said

98
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,033
those are TV dramas.

99
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,033
If this one doesn't work, then choose another one.

100
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,200
How about this?

101
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:51,133
Love you, spoil you and care about you.

102
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,233
Sounds nice.

103
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,300
There are twins

104
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,833
in which one got heart disease.

105
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:01,133
And their parents asked to the other one transplant her heart to the sick one.

106
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,966
And then their parents just abandon them.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,066
Lu Wenxi, I seriously doubt that

108
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,500
you are trying to kill me.

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,233
I asked Siyu to print these for me.

110
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,766
This must be his interest.

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Wait a moment, let me choose one.

112
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,766
This one.

113
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,200
This one suits you.

114
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,000
Top secret.

115
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,566
Believe me,

116
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,133
when I met the 21 guy the third time,

117
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,666
I got a gift from him.

118
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,366
Go ahead, boss!

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,533
A relationship virgin.

120
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,033
A fake love rat.

121
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,233
Will that work?

122
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,666
Never mind.

123
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,366
What are you doing?

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,266
No-nothing.

125
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,300
Have you done something wrong?

126
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,066
No.

127
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,166
What are you planning?

128
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,433
Pretend to be homeless and stay with me?

129
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,666
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,833
You agreed to have dinner with me!

131
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,866
Let's go.

132
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,666
Whether the script works

133
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,933
depends on whether I can get in his home

134
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,166
this time.

135
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,566
Hello, a box of beer.

136
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,533
Here you are.

137
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,466
You don't even care about why I got drunk?

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,266
Because of you!

139
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,800
I helped Xiao Ye connect with software companies behind my boss’s back.

140
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,300
I lost my job.

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,000
My boss thought I was going to get a new one.

142
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,033
So what?

143
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,133
How can you be that careless?

144
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,766
My house was assigned by my company.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,666
Now I have nowhere to go.

146
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,933
The house is taken back.

147
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,466
I'm homeless now!

148
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,132
Homeless?

149
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,299
The company fired you without reason,

150
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,365
you can claim compensation.

151
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,365
Do you need a lawyer?

152
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,133
You-

153
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,166
I'm telling you.

154
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,533
My bestie is super unreliable.

155
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,033
She got me a script,

156
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,066
and te-tell me,

157
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,933
you need to be like a cat.

158
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,533
Do I look like a cat?

159
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,066
Do I?

160
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,366
And you! You are really-

161
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm telling you, you are really a bastard.

162
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,400
I sent you so many messages,

163
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,633
you'd never replied me.

164
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,633
Do you think I'd like to do that?

165
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,933
How do you guys think?

166
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't you think he is such a bastard?

167
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,266
He's never replied my messages.

168
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,700
And never answered my call.

169
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,500
He's always been like that.

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,533
And today he even...

171
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
You are drunk.

172
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,866
Your head is on fire.
