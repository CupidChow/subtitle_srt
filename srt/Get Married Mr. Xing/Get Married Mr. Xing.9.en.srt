1
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,300
Miss Su, he won't come back so soon right?

2
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,400
He just went out, he won't be back that soon.

3
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,500
Hello, Zhiyuan?

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,566
I left my something at home.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,433
I will be back right now.

6
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't rush me, I know!

7
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:53,733
What should we do?

8
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:54,333
Why does he come back?

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,066
I don't know.

10
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,500
Put it away.

11
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,100
Hide!

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,700
What are you doing?

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
The sofa is full of dirt.

14
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,100
I'm cleaning it.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,233
Why are you back?

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,000
I forgot something.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
Go get it then.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,333
Okay, go now.

19
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,633
What did you say?

20
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,166
Never mind, just go.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,166
Why are you still here?

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,500
Now is the time of traffic jam.

23
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,666
Why are you so weird?

24
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,000
Am I?

25
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,566
I'm not.

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,433
Wh-what are you doing?

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,133
I-

28
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,600
Su Nian,

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,400
I advise you not to challenge my control.

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,533
I know what you are up to.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,866
Miss Su,

32
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,000
what are you thinking?

33
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:59,666
Under what circumstances

34
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,766
would a man

35
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,333
be that indifferent to a hottie

36
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,066
that tried to get him?

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,633
With ED?

38
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,500
No way!

39
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,500
He doesn't seem like that has ED.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,200
Miss Su,

41
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,400
you can tell me more details,

42
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,566
and I will analyze his behaviors for you.

43
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:25,933
Come on.

44
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,966
Don't think I don't know that

45
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,633
you just like gossiping.

46
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,666
Miss Su, no matter what happened,

47
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,333
as long as he is a healthy man,

48
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,000
there are two reasons.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,333
First, he doesn’t like you.

50
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,200
He already has someone he likes.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,800
He is loyal to that girl.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,333
But there isn't even a female mosquito around him.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,100
So there is only one reason.

54
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,566
No way!

55
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,400
Maybe.

56
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,733
Miss Su, think about that.

57
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,666
Does he have a particularly good relationship with some boy?

58
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,366
Xing Ge, see this.

59
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,366
Go away!

60
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,266
I think so.

61
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,866
No, I have to go back and confirm,

62
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,533
before losing nothing.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,266
I need to go.

64
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,166
I have something else to do this afternoon.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm tired.

66
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,166
Have some drinks?

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,133
That's good.

68
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,166
How many people will there be?

69
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,900
Okay, I will be there on time.

70
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,600
It's dry, drink some water.

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,533
Wait, let me get something.

72
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,400
Which one will you choose?

73
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,400
What do you mean?

74
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,233
Just choose one.

75
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:38,800
This one.

76
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,933
So you are g-

77
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,066
It doesn't matter.

78
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:54,833
This society is more exclusive now.

79
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,333
Don't worry about that.

80
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,800
If you don't want others to know,

81
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,133
I promise you I won't tell anyone.

82
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,966
If you need to get a boy,

83
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,800
I can help you.

84
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,900
Su Nian.

85
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,933
Okay I need to go.

86
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,466
Wh-what are you doing?

87
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:28,266
You tried your best to get close to me.

88
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,966
Now I can give you a chance,

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
but you are not satisfied?

90
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,500
You don't have to do this.

91
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm willing to.

92
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,933
I'm not.

93
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,500
Su Nian, I'm straight.

94
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,733
Really? I don’t believe that.

95
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,333
You kissed me, it means you like me.

96
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,366
Now we like each other,

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,933
how about getting married

98
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,200
this afternoon?

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,933
Don't even think about that.

100
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,600
Brother, what's up?

101
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,000
What happened to the Su family?

102
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,433
Why they want to marry their daughter to me?

103
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,733
Chairman Su suffered a cerebral hemorrhage some time ago.

104
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,633
He is still in a coma now in the hospital.

105
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,733
And?

106
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,800
It is said that there is some problem in the company.

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,300
It seems to be related to Cao Sipeng,

108
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,266
he is the second largest shareholder of Nianqiao.

109
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:39,466
Brother, why do you want to know this?

110
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,700
No wonder she suddenly got close to me.

111
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,666
Does she know about my relationship with dad now?

112
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,800
Just tell me.

113
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,133
She doesn't.

114
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,500
Brother, Su Nian is in a very difficult situation now.

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Someone is coveting her father's company

116
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,900
Her father is still in a coma,

117
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,733
and no one knows when he will wake up.

118
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,000
The only thing she can do now

119
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,100
is to keep the company.

120
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Brother, when I was investigating her,

121
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,966
I found out that someone wanted to hurt her.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,300
That Cao Sipeng?

123
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,366
Yes, that guy.

124
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,900
He also tried to ask dad to work with him

125
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,666
to get more shares.

126
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,265
Hello,

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,400
this is my gift to new neighbor.

128
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:40,765
Nice to meet you.

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,833
I don't eat desserts.

130
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,666
This is sugar free.

131
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,100
I'm good, thank you.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,400
I accidentally closed my door

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,700
when I got out.

134
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,066
If you don't mind,

135
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,533
can I go in

136
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,166
waiting for my friend to send me the key?

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,700
That's a combination lock.

138
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,466
I-I forgot the password.

139
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,733
Need a key to get in.

140
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,000
What on earth do you want to do?

141
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,200
We agreed last time we met,

142
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,100
if we could meet again,

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,633
you will friend me on WeChat.

144
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,000
This is already the fifth time we have met.

145
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
Isn’t it destined enough?

146
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,800
Come on, sit down here.

147
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,866
Mom, what are you doing?

148
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,533
Xiaoyi, have you hanged out with Xiao Su?

149
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,833
Tell me, how are you two doing?

150
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:37,600
Mom-

151
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,166
Your dad often said that

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
if you can marry Su family's daughter,

153
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,033
your career will be up to the next level.

154
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,700
By the way, when are you going to-

155
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Mom! Don't say that.

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,133
Give me the phone.

157
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,000
Now that we are friends now,

158
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
you probably don't mind if I come in?

159
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,133
Hold on.

160
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,833
You can wait here.

161
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,666
give it back to me.

162
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,900
Give me the stool again

163
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,700
Interesting.
