1
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,166
Hello. Mr. Xing.

2
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,033
Where's Xing Yi?

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,800
Resting in the room.

4
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,100
He just came back and adjusted to the jet lag.

5
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:56,666
What's wrong?

6
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,000
Something happened to the Su family.

7
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,300
The Elder Su is sick.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,465
He mentioned before cooperation projects

9
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,533
in the new urban business district.

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,633
Although he is sick now,

11
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,500
Su Nian's ability

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,100
make me not worried.

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,800
Do you remember that Lao Su once mentioned

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,733
marriage ofwe two families ?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,133
By this collaborative project

16
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,966
let them get along with each other.

17
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,533
Mr. Xing, you get off work so late.

18
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:45,966
I'll take you back.

19
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm not used to taking in others' cars.

20
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,466
Then let's get to know each other.

21
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:52,466
My name is Su

22
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,366
What do you want to do?

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,633
I just want to ask Mr. Xing.

24
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,533
If you have a chance

25
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,566
to start a new life again,

26
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,566
would you like it?

27
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,300
There's 60,000 in this card.

28
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,166
If Mr. Xing

29
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,866
shows up when I need him

30
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,459
all the money here is yours.

31
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:15,626
So

32
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,926
The way you talk about changing life

33
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:18,726
is just like this.

34
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,826
Your bar business is average.

35
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,059
You work is day and night are reversed.

36
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:22,993
Come to me.

37
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,493
I guarantee you a 9-to-5 job

38
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,526
with weekends off and all holidays covered.

39
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,793
Plus, there's an annual bonus.

40
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,026
The most important thing is

41
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,493
600,000 is just a monthly salary.

42
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,093
Xing Ge.

43
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,559
Hello. Lady.

44
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,659
Introduce myself.

45
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,193
I'm Xing Ge's partner.

46
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,293
My name is Sun Zhiyuan.

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,393
Xing Ge.

48
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:44,826
After all, she offered you ten times your salary.

49
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,593
People always strive for higher positions.

50
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,026
I really don't want to let you go.

51
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,359
But

52
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,793
Xing Ge owes me money.

53
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:00,026
How about you give me this card?

54
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,693
I'll come to work for him.

55
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:03,959
No thanks.

56
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,159
Then I'll leave first.

57
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,126
Think about it again?

58
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,826
I have something to do. I'm leaving first.

59
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:31,459
Hello.

60
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,326
The information in Su Nian's hands

61
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:34,626
has been replaced with your brother's.

62
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,259
OK.

63
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:54,259
No wonder I tempted him with money.

64
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,759
He remained unmoved.

65
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:57,593
He's a second-generation rich man.

66
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:59,526
how could he possibly be short of money?

67
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:00,559
But Sun Zhiyuan say

68
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,893
he owed money.

69
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,393
It is just an excuse.

70
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,326
If he is really short of money,

71
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,759
will he open a bar?

72
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,426
Are you sure, Miss. Su?

73
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:12,293
He doesn't look like he's in need of love.

74
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,493
Does a stupid person have "stupid" written on his face?

75
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,893
So does to someone who lacks love have.

76
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,893
It makes sense.

77
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,393
But Miss. Su.

78
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:23,793
You have insulted with money

79
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,026
his yearning for love.

80
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,726
How do you plan to remedy this?

81
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,059
I will ask for a professional.

82
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,159
I am arriving.

83
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,893
Don't arrange dates for me again.

84
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,526
I do this for you.

85
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:39,659
Sorry.

86
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,159
Look how old you are.

87
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,426
If you keep unmarried

88
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:43,826
you will be an old girl.

89
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,193
Be gentle when speaking.

90
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:47,793
Don't judge people by their appearance.

91
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,059
Wenxi.

92
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,093
Wenxi, are you there?

93
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:52,559
Mom.

94
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,559
I see.

95
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,893
Be gentle.

96
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:58,926
Don't judge people by their appearance.

97
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:06,026
Mom, I will hang up.

98
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,626
So handsome.

99
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,526
OK. I will.

100
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:28,926
Hello.

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,426
Hello. Mr. Li

102
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,526
I'm temporarily unable to leave my work.

103
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,059
I'm afraid I won't be able to come.

104
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,193
Let's meet up next time.

105
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,459
No.

106
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:39,826
I've arrived here.

107
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,293
I'm really sorry.

108
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:42,359
Next time.

109
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,193
OK. OK.

110
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,226
Oh my god.

111
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,526
Stand me up.

112
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:14,259
Sorry.

113
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,993
I am late.

114
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,026
Please forgive me.

115
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:18,626
Do we know each other?

116
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,326
Aren't you Mr. Li?

117
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,526
Sorry, let me confirm.

118
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:28,993
Isn't this you?

119
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:30,293
No.

120
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,559
Sorry.

121
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,759
I have face blindness and can't tell people apart.

122
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,393
Can you help me find out where he is?

123
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,326
He just left.

124
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,793
Just because I'm two minutes late

125
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:46,526
he even leave unhappily.

126
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,093
Then don't be late next time.

127
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:49,959
All right.

128
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,859
Would you mind if I sit here for a while?

129
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:55,593
I don't mind.

130
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,493
Hey.

131
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,426
Think about what happened last night.

132
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:11,993
I am not interested.

133
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:14,893
She must be a pampered girl from a wealthy family.

134
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:15,993
Rich with money to burn.

135
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:17,859
That's great.

136
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:21,026
She is beautiful and rich.

137
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:21,893
What's wrong?

138
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,426
Our boss Xing doesn't like her.

139
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,626
Are you attracted?

140
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,359
How about you go?

141
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,026
I don't have time to play with her.

142
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:32,926
Hurry.

143
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:39,359
Then don't be late next time.

144
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,193
OK.

145
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,526
Wenxi, what's wrong with you?

146
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,959
Su Nian.

147
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,893
I feel like I've met my Mr. Right.

148
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,026
Lu Wenxi. You are a love expert.

149
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,093
Teach me.

150
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:04,259
How did you chase

151
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,426
your twenty ex-boyfriends?

152
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:07,226
Do you want to learn?

153
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:16,593
Of course.

154
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:17,626
Of course.

155
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,326
The tricks he's using now are all leftovers from me.

156
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:22,993
There's only one way to deal with him.

157
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,026
That's to be stubborn and persistent.

158
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,359
Then let him see your persistence

159
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:30,059
As long as you can get close to him,

160
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,559
his heart will be yours sooner or later.

161
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,126
Then

162
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:38,993
wish you success.

163
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,825
I hope you can get

164
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,659
Your twenty-first Mr. Right.

165
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,158
21th.

166
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,626
How's it going with Cao Sipeng?

167
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:52,893
I sent people to keep an eye.

168
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,793
I suspect Director Su's matter that day

169
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,926
is related to Cao Sipeng.

170
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,659
The day when Director Su had an accident.

171
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,693
He was seen coming out of Director's office.

172
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,459
Not long after

173
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,093
Su was found fainted on the ground.

174
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,193
Miss. Su.

175
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,893
My father brought up an arranged marriage before.

176
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,593
There must be a reason.

177
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:18,859
The matter of marriage.

178
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,759
it's something that existed

179
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,259
when they were young.

180
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,793
It hasn't been mentioned for so many years,

181
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,459
but now it's being brought up.

182
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,726
That must mean

183
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,826
there's a big problem in the company.

184
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:35,059
Only the arranged marriage can solve it.

185
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,426
Xing Ge, are you serious?

186
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,226
Cheer up.

187
00:09:58,226 --> 00:10:02,159
Look at that girl.

188
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:07,659
Mr. Xing.

189
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:10,193
I forgot to introduce myself last time.

190
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,726
Let's get to know each other formally.

191
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,826
My name is Su Nian.

192
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,993
You came to see me again and again.

193
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,426
Just to let me work next to you?

194
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:27,393
No, I'm for you.

195
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:34,293
It turns out you have another intention.

196
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,726
I'm afraid this time.

197
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:37,559
Miss Su has to make another trip in vain.
