1
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,993
Marry me, Mr. Xing

2
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,168
Hi handsome.

3
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,167
What's the matter, gorgeous?

4
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,134
What can I help you?

5
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,034
Is that guy Xing Ge?

6
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,267
No.

7
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,634
Over there,

8
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,867
that guy is Xing Ge.

9
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,134
Brother, I'm back.

10
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:28,067
Dad asked me to develop my career in China.

11
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,401
Good.

12
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:34,701
When will you come back home?

13
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:35,901
If you have nothing else to say,

14
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,334
I need to go.

15
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:39,234
Okay.

16
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:40,901
I won't keep you any longer.

17
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,267
Let's talk later.

18
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,301
Gorgeous, try to get him?

19
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,034
Is this how his name written?

20
00:01:59,501 --> 00:01:59,967
Yeah.

21
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,834
But I have to remind you,

22
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,967
he is very hard to get.

23
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,934
Give me the strongest liquor here.

24
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:08,901
Good luck.

25
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:21,701
Handsome.

26
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,301
What's up?

27
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,734
Give me a chance to know you.

28
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,101
I'm not interested.

29
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:30,701
I heard that you are the boss of this bar.

30
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,501
Yeah.

31
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,901
So,

32
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,501
shouldn't the boss here

33
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,034
take care of your customer?

34
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,201
You will satisfy

35
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,967
your customer's need, won't you?

36
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,134
Er-well,

37
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,601
can you drink this?

38
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,167
Miss Su, no, no!

39
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,534
You have to do what I said.

40
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,734
You are afraid that I may put something in it?

41
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,634
Don't dare to drink it?

42
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:10,301
Let me drink it first.

43
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:25,067
No way! He bites the bait so soon.

44
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,434
Even kids won't use this trick.

45
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,334
You may die alone if you are such a boring person.

46
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,601
Are you sure he is Xing Ge,

47
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:51,634
but not a blind bear?

48
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,901
I'm sure, Miss Su.

49
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,134
Don't worry, I'll help you.

50
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,267
Gorgeous, you are alone here.

51
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,401
What are you doing? Go away.

52
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,501
Come on, let's have some drinks.

53
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,301
Leave me alone.

54
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,701
You are upset?

55
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,434
I can comfort you.

56
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,667
What are you doing? Let me go.

57
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,001
Gorgeous, wait for me a moment.

58
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,334
Hurts! It hurts!

59
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,234
Let me play with you.

60
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,701
If you don't let go, I will scream now.

61
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:14,434
I-

62
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,600
Brother Xing Brother Xing Brother Xing

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Go away.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes, yes, sir.

65
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,134
Xing Ge,

66
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,301
now we can get to know each other, right?

67
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,134
Don't get me wrong.

68
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,934
I will help everyone in need.

69
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,567
After all, you helped me.

70
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,734
Let's go grab some midnight snacks.

71
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,367
Although I don't know why you tried to get close to me,

72
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,401
this method is low, don't bother to do that again.

73
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,001
What the hell?

74
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:43,567
Wait and see,

75
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,834
one day I will get you.

76
00:04:57,234 --> 00:05:00,434
Doctor, how is my father doing?

77
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,167
The patient's condition is currently stable.

78
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,067
He need a good rest after this.

79
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:05,701
Thank you, doctor.

80
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,801
You're welcome.

81
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,167
Mom, don't worry.

82
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,934
Dad will be fine.

83
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:19,834
Miss Su.

84
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,067
What's going on in company?

85
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,801
Board of directors

86
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,101
has already known

87
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,401
you father got brain hemorrhage.

88
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,234
Now they are electing

89
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,367
an acting chairman.

90
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,101
They are so impatient.

91
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,334
Someone is adding fuel to the fire.

92
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:41,034
the person should be Cao Sipeng.

93
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,034
It should be Cao Sipeng

94
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,234
He is ambitious,

95
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,167
coveting Nianqiao Group for many years.

96
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:53,467
But my father's company must not fall into his hands.

97
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,067
Miss Su,

98
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,234
but your father Chairman Su also thought

99
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,667
Mr. Cao is a suitable candidate.

100
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,601
If you try to stop him,

101
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,101
you may offend many people.

102
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,034
Besides,

103
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,634
don't you remember your father's requirement for you?

104
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,234
I have my own solution for that.

105
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:09,701
Okay.

106
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:22,901
Morning, Miss Su.

107
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,234
Good morning, Miss Su.

108
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,267
How many times have I told you do not make my cringy!

109
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,301
I'm tired of it.

110
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,834
Okay, go back to work.

111
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,134
Xiao Nian, how is your father?

112
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:39,934
Thank you Uncle Cao for your concerns.

113
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,334
My father is fine.

114
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,234
He has received the best treatment in hospital.

115
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,434
Oh, that's good.

116
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,867
Tell your father stay at home to have a good rest.

117
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,401
And don't worry about the company.

118
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,367
I'm here to take care of our business.

119
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,301
Uncle Cao, you don't have to.

120
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,701
After all Nianqiao Group belongs to Su family.

121
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,567
I don't want to bother others.

122
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,967
I need to go, goodbye.

123
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,667
Miss Su, maybe you shouldn't

124
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:10,734
be that aggressive to him now?

125
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:11,601
Last month,

126
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,567
he lined his pockets from the project in Dongcheng district.

127
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,134
I think I'm tolerate enough.

128
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,067
Doesn’t he want to be the chairman of Nianqiao Group?

129
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,901
As long as my shares can be an absolute majority,

130
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,834
he can't get what he covets.

131
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,367
So you are going to

132
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,234
marry the guy your father asked you to marry?

133
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,134
Xing family doesn't have many shares,

134
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,201
but that part can play an play a decisive role.

135
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,634
How about the guy I asked you to investigate?

136
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,767
Miss Su, I tried my best.

137
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,534
And that's all you got?

138
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,434
Actually I only got three things about him.

139
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,667
I think it's unnecessary to write it down,

140
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,234
I can just tell you directly.

141
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,567
But-but I promise

142
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:04,867
I really tried my best.

143
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,834
This Mr. Xing has studied abroad since he was a kid,

144
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,534
so no one except his family knows about him.

145
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:10,934
Tell me then.

146
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,386
The man you need to marry is Xing-

147
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,889
Xing-Xing...

148
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,689
Xing Ge!

149
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:20,889
Yeah, Xing Ge.

150
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,309
185 cm,

151
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,397
fit,

152
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,130
handsome and charming.

153
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,397
That's all?

154
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,963
There is also another important thing.

155
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,530
After coming back China,

156
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,230
he has run a bar called Tingfeng.

157
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,563
A bar?

158
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,630
Xing Ge...

159
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,530
Which Ge is that in his name?

160
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,997
This is definitely not Ge.

161
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,230
This is Ge!

162
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:00,130
Can you really read and write?
