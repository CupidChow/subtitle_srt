00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,166
Hello, Miss Lu.

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,700
Look where I am.

3
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,266
Nian. Did you

4
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,000
live in his house?

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,533
But what should I do next?

6
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,266
I have never lived with a man

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,000
in one house together.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
From now on, just be yourself.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,465
Are you sure?

10
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,300
Didn't you ask me to be like a cat?

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,133
I just meowed like a cat in front of him.

12
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:12,000
As a result, he didn't have any reaction.

13
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,266
Please come in.

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Are you busy?

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,133
No.

16
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,266
I want to talk to you about sharing a flat.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,700
OK.

18
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,866
If any objections, you can raise.

19
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:29,933
No objection.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,433
Good night.

21
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,600
Xiao Xiaosu

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
I don't know to let you live in

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,866
is for fun or for trouble of myself.

24
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,033
You

25
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,733
What's wrong?

26
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:15,766
Nothing.

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
I want to ask you what you want for breakfast.

28
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:19,966
Breakfast.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,066
Just leave it to me.

30
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:21,966
I am good at it.

31
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,500
OK, come on.

32
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,933
OK. OK.

33
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,600
I didn't look very bad.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,633
You come early in the morning

35
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,566
Just to give me this.

36
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,533
Yes.

37
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,333
This is the help I prepared for you.

38
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,866
How is the progress so far?

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,300
Not bad.

40
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:09,500
And you?

41
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,533
I suspect I have met a master this time.

42
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,166
He knows all my tricks.

43
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,466
How to say?

44
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
I found out where he lives.

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
and successfully became his neighbor.

46
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,366
Everything is ready.

47
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,500
Cockroach.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,966
Piles of express delivery.

49
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,700
And I

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,733
A weak woman who is afraid of cockroaches.

51
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,366
I friendly asked for neighborly assistance.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Guess what?

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
He just gave me a bottle of insecticide.

54
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,233
As a result, your efforts

55
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,533
was killed by a bottle of insecticide.

56
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,800
Exactly.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,566
Don't think too much.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Maybe it really is he doesn't

59
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,733
understand your tricks.

60
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,466
He just simply

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,566
want to keep distance from strange women.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,466
If that's the case,

63
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,733
I have to get him.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
Such a rare quality young man.

65
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,800
How can I let him go?

66
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,900
Just let a good young man go.

67
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,333
Stop talking.

68
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,333
Remember to open when back.

69
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,733
There is a surprise inside.

70
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,600
Mysterious.

71
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:17,933
Miss. Su.

72
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,433
Contracts that you need to sign.

73
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,400
How's it going with Cao Sipeng?

74
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,533
Cao Sipeng's people are thinking of ways to obtain the

75
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,766
bidding document from project department

76
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,466
for the new urban area.

77
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,333
Besides

78
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,566
they are inquiring about the marriage.

79
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:35,766
As I suspected.

80
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,333
So how should we fight back next?

81
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,733
Cao Sipeng wants to get the project.

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,833
Then we use their tactics against them.

83
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,000
OK.

84
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,333
Miss. Su.

85
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,566
What's going on with the Xing family now?

86
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,466
If you use the project as a bait,

87
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,266
the marriage alliance must be successful.

88
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,966
Otherwise, the board will have opinions about you.

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,500
Don't worry, it's coming soon.

90
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,566
An Americano. Thank you.

91
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,933
Xing Ge.

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,600
Why is he here?

93
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,100
No, I'm a homeless person now.

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,433
Quickly.

95
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,933
Squat. Squat.

96
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,633
Why are you here?

97
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,266
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm here for an interview.

99
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,733
But the interview failed.

100
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:51,066
It's over. It's  definitely discovered.

101
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,966
What do you want to eat tonight?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,900
Wait. Xing Ge hasn't seen me before.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,533
Can I wear this?

104
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,733
Is Wenxi reliable?

105
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,100
Wear more so you don't catch a cold.

106
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,733
Why am I not attractive at all?

107
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,633
What are you doing?

108
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,500
Your carpet is so soft.

109
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll go to the bar.

110
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,900
Pay attention to safety.

111
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,033
This is too embarrassing.

112
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Hello.

113
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:22,933
Miss. Su.

114
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,066
I forgot a document for you to sign.

115
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,333
I must send to partner tomorrow.

116
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,400
Come here now.

117
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,366
Xing Ge is not at home.

118
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,400
OK.

119
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:42,100
Miss Su, will he come back suddenly?

120
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,166
He just went out. Don't worry.

121
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,166
Right.

122
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,900
Project base price in new urban area.

123
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,500
We have already given it to Cao Sipeng.

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,433
Follow the clues,

125
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,566
we found the person he met that day.

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,633
He is the project leader of Bo'an.

127
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,733
So many years,

128
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,500
The one who has been secretly and overtly

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,466
targeting us is Bo'an.

130
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,800
I followed that person and looked inside.

131
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,333
And found that the legal representative of Bo'an

132
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,566
Has a connection with Cao Sipeng.

133
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:14,866
Relatives?

134
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
After that

135
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,233
I investigated again

136
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,466
the history of Bo'an.

137
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,000
It was founded six years ago.

138
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,500
At that time, they secured a

139
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,633
Development projects in old town

140
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,533
and became famous after that battle.

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,800
I didn't expect Cao Sipeng to be so ambitious.

142
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,533
So what should we do next?

143
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,200
We'll use their own tactics against them.

144
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,866
Make an appointment with

145
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,033
Chairman Xing tomorrow.

146
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,133
Hello. Zhiyuan.

147
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,533
I left my things at home.

148
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,033
I go back immediately.

149
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,666
Don't rush me, I know.
