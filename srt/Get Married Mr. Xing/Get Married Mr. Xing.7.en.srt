1
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:51,766
Su Nian,

2
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,833
why on earth do you get close to me?

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,333
To get the thing in your home.

4
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,433
What else could it be?

5
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,366
I want to hear the truth.

6
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,700
The truth is

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,433
I like you.

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,066
Do you like me or not?

9
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,400
Can you tell me that?

10
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,033
If you don't like me,

11
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:11,733
I will-

12
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,666
What will you do?

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,400
I will try again.

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,633
Su Nian, I'm serious now.

15
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,266
Do you really have nowhere to go?

16
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:27,100
This one.

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,200
You just need to do as it says.

18
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,300
You can definitely get him.

19
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,133
No.

20
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,966
Since I was a kid,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,666
they've told me girls are useless.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,833
Later I had a younger brother,

23
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,066
they said,

24
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,500
kids from poor family should support family earlier.

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,566
My brother can get everything he wants.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,666
I can get nothing.

27
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,700
And now I have to lose myself.

28
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,633
Poor family?

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,200
Yes.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,333
I'm just pretending

31
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,033
to be a rich girl,

32
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,700
to get what I need.

33
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,266
So you lied to me.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,533
What? No!

35
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,066
So,

36
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,400
to get what you want,

37
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,366
you can lie to others?

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,333
Did I lie?

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,066
Who did I lie to?

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,300
What do you want to do?

41
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,033
I just want to tell you,

42
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,566
I can get whatever I want

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,900
as long as I really want that.

44
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,133
Go down.

45
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,066
No.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
What do you mean?

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Where are you taking me?

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,466
I will sell you.

49
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,166
Let me go!

50
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,533
Little Su.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,766
Okay, I will wait for good news from you.

52
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,766
I'm going to hold a shareholders' meeting.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,833
I will contact you when I have a decision.

54
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,766
Okay, okay.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,533
Let's call it a day.

56
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay.

57
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,633
Goodbye.

58
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,300
What does he want from Mr. Xing?

59
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:15,866
Hello?

60
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,400
He didn't want to tell us any truth.

61
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,733
I can't see what he is thinking.

62
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,466
This way may not work.

63
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,166
Get the support of other people in the board.

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
If this way not works to me,

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,233
I won't let it work to other people.

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,366
Miss Su,

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,700
I saw Cao Sipeng went to see Mr. Xing privately.

68
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,133
Although I couldn't hear what they talked about,

69
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,333
they seemed...

70
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, I got it.

71
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:04,400
No matter what, I will take a step further today.

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,133
What are you here for?

73
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,733
I'm here to get my thing back.

74
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,266
Wait a moment.

75
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,333
Xing Ge, just tell me

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
what do you want to allow me

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,133
live in here and be together with you?

78
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,933
Anything you want, as long as I can give you.

79
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:30,733
I don't want anything.

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,266
Xing Ge,

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,533
you must have fallen in love with me, right?

82
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,600
Nice try, but no.

83
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,333
How will you know if you don't try?

84
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,366
I don't want to try that.

85
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,566
What's the matter with you?

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
What can I do to let you say yes?

87
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,233
Su Nian,

88
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,433
you like me that much?

89
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:01,700
Of course.

90
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,300
You and only you.

91
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:04,966
How about this?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,433
Let's make a bet.

93
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,366
On what?

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
On whether I can

95
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,633
make you like me or not.

96
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,733
Childish.

97
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,766
Why does this guy never follow the script?

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,033
I can rent this room to you with lower price.

99
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,600
Really? Really?

100
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,266
If you don't want to, then never mind.

101
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,333
I want that!

102
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,066
I'm going to pack my luggage right now.

103
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,400
Cockroach!

104
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,700
It's you?

105
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,533
What a coincidence!

106
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,766
So we are neighbors, right?

107
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:11,466
Xing Yi, please help me.

108
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,400
There are cockroaches in my home.

109
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,766
I'm most afraid of these things.

110
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,033
Hold on.

111
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:29,933
Take that.

112
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,700
Xing Yi.

113
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,566
Just like this?

114
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,433
I don't believe I can't get you.

115
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,100
An Americano, take away.

116
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,933
Okay, wait a moment.

117
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:49,766
Mr. Zhang,

118
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,600
how do you think about

119
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,500
the development of our company?

120
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,733
Su Nian is now isolated and helpless.

121
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,800
Chairman Su was seriously ill again and did not wake up yet.

122
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,833
Of course I support you.

123
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,066
I really don't want to see

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,700
such a big company

125
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,933
will be managed by a young lady.

126
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,766
If she doesn't agree,

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
I can only teach her a lesson.

128
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,700
Yes, teach her a lesson.

129
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:14,666
Your coffee.

130
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,566
Thanks.

131
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,200
The bed is so soft.

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,533
It's up to you now.

133
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Do what it does.

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,066
So I'm going to meow at Xing Ge?

135
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,566
No way!

136
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,800
Sorry.

137
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,500
I'm not used to someone else in my home.

138
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,500
Isn't it a bit late

139
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,833
to be defensive?

140
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm not defensive.
