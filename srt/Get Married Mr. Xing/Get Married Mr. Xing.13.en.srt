1
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,366
Dad, I know that

2
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
you've been worried about my brother.

3
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,133
It's a good opportunity to make him come back home

4
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,800
by his marriage with Su Nian.

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,466
Isn't it good?

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
How do you know Su Nian can do it?

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,033
If Su Nian can't,

8
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,466
nobody else can.

9
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,633
Dad, I can see that

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,133
my brother likes Su Nian.

11
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:04,665
No.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,466
Dad, I just don't know

13
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,766
when should I tell you all these.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,133
If Su Nian and Xing Ge can get married,

15
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,233
I will be very happy.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,433
If that can work,

17
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,700
then the promise can still be fulfilled.

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,966
But your brother-

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,933
I believe Su Nian.

20
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,500
Marriage is serious.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,766
I hope you guys won't be kidding.

22
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,100
I got it, dad.

23
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,833
Dad, take care.

24
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,066
Don't worry.

25
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,733
Xing Ge is a good boy.

26
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:56,200
You two can be together.

27
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,233
If you get the chance, try to tell Xing Ge

28
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,466
go back home, it's time to do so.

29
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,133
Dad, you know Xing Ge?

30
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,533
When he was a kid,

31
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,366
I've seen him several times.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,466
This kid is stubborn.

33
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,433
How stubborn could he be?

34
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,100
Once he decided,

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,800
no one could persuade him to change.

36
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:18,133
Otherwise the relationship betwee him

37
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,400
and your uncle Xing wouldn't be that bad.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,866
And he ran away from home in the end.

39
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,866
Why did he run away home?

40
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:30,133
He thought your uncle Xing cheated on his mom,

41
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,633
and then his mom commited suicide with depress.

42
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,333
So did uncle Xing...

43
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,666
As I said, he thought.

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,000
I trust your Uncle Xing’s personality.

45
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,400
So

46
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,866
if you have chance, just try to appease him.

47
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,366
It's been so long.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
It's time to let it go.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,666
What are you here for?

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,633
I-I'm here to apologize to you.

51
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,600
Didn't you just leave that day?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,666
Didn't you say that you need to stop the loss in time?

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,033
This is how you cut your loss?

54
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,900
Xing Ge, I-

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,633
Come in first.

56
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,400
Okay, why are you here?

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
It's about

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,733
that day I told you I mistook you.

59
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,666
You thought I was Xing Yi, right?

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
You knew it.

61
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,666
Now that you mistook,

62
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,500
what are you doing here?

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,233
I admit that

64
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,466
at the begining I got close to you,

65
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,800
because I thought you were Xing Yi,

66
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,366
and also because of shares.

67
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,533
But after this period we being together,

68
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,766
I really like you.

69
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,200
Like me?

70
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,533
So you need to stop your loss in time?

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,233
What I said that day is out of anxiety.

72
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,400
I know that's hurt.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,700
You should be mad at me.

74
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,266
But as long as you can forgive me,

75
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,200
I can do anything.

76
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,633
To get the shares,

77
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,266
Miss Su really could do anything.

78
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,700
No.

79
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,866
We knew each other by a wrong way,

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,966
then we should stop it timely.

81
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,033
I want to be with you as myself.

82
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,666
You really want to be together with me?

83
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,766
Yes.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,533
I'll consider it.

85
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,400
So what do you say?

86
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,600
Miss Su, please go back.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,066
I'll tell you after I think about it.

88
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,266
Actually,

89
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,766
when you moved in my house,

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,566
I already knew who you are.

91
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,100
I also knew your purpose.

92
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,266
I never care about you lying to me.

93
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,700
But you immediately left me,

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,933
after knowing who am I,

95
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,066
it's hard for me to believe you now.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,300
I didn't.

97
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I can tell you clearly that

98
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,000
I have nothing to do with the Xing family anymore.

99
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,666
Being together with me,

100
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,666
maybe you won't get what you want,

101
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,766
even so,

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,300
are you still willing to be with me?

103
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:37,133
I-

104
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,400
You'd better calm down and think about it.

105
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,333
And-

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,333
you really forget who I am?

107
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,100
What do you mean?

108
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:55,066
Who did I forget?

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,800
Bro?

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Of course we have a table for you.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,666
I will keep a table for you, for sure.

112
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:02,766
Yeah, right.

113
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:03,666
Hurry up.

114
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,733
Okay, don't worry.

115
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,100
Wait a minute, bro.

116
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,200
Miss Su, Xing Ge said

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
he doesn't want you to get in.

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm a customer.

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,133
Why can't I get in

120
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,233
Miss Su,

121
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,866
Xing Ge is my boss.

122
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,766
I can't be too defiant.

123
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't make things too difficult for me, please?

124
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:26,700
Okay.

125
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,300
Goodbye, Miss Su.

126
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,833
Miss Su, aren't you?

127
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,366
Miss Su,

128
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,366
now matter how good your disguise is,

129
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,666
I can't let you in either.

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,366
Although this is not

131
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,366
my problem.

132
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
I really know I was wrong.

133
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,233
Can you tell him that I'm here?

134
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:56,966
What exactly is it?

135
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,700
Can't he give me any hint?

136
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,766
Xing Ge said

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,666
you need to

138
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,333
figure it out by yourself.

139
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,266
A reminder for you.

140
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,400
He is actually

141
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,233
petty.

142
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,533
Okay, tell him wait for me.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,233
Xing Ge, nice,

144
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,533
Pretend to be angry,

145
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,866
and then go back to her.

146
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,200
You are really smart.

147
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,800
Who told you I'm not mad?

148
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:37,200
If you are mad,

149
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,933
why should you did these things?

150
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,866
Be careful,

151
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,933
or maybe you need to beg for her forgiveness.

152
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,700
How long will you try to avoid me?

153
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:06,966
I didn't avoid you.

154
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,233
So why are you sneaking?

155
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,333
I-I-

156
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,666
I always do things openly and honestly.

157
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,766
Then why don't you want to admit it?

158
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,200
Admit what?

159
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Didn't you say you like me?

160
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,400
Why don't you agree to my proposal?

161
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,866
Yes, I do like you, Xing Yi.

162
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
But I don't want to get married.

163
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Xing Yi,

164
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
if you want to date me,

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,300
I'm also willing to.

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,733
But marriage, no.

167
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,033
Why?

168
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,166
No reason.

169
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,533
I am a person who longs for freedom,

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
I don't want to be bound by marriage.

171
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,466
How do you know that marriage will bind you

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,733
or protect you?

173
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,333
Xing Yi,

174
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,800
you don't understand me.

175
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,633
Wenxi!

176
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:12,633
Xing Ge!

177
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,233
Xing Ge! Xing-

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,866
It's you? Where is Xing Ge?

179
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Xing Ge is not here.

180
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,933
Miss Su, please don't.

181
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:32,866
He is not here, really.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
You know where he is, don't you?

183
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,666
I don't know.

184
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,066
Tell him,

185
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
I know why I'm wrong.

186
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:41,866
Why?

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,866
Tell him to see me.

188
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,966
And I will tell him.

189
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,033
Xing Ge-

190
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,866
Miss Su, are you playing trick with me?

191
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,866
Of course not.

192
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,166
Actually,

193
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,466
you don't have to talk to him now.

194
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,100
Just do what he told you.

195
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Calm down.

196
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,200
Think about the relationship between you two.

197
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,866
Do you like him more,

198
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,600
or those shares more?

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,333
How do you say?

200
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,533
Of course he is more important.

201
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,000
Anything else?

202
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,766
Think about it, is there anything

203
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:13,633
is a gift from an old friend,

204
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,166
but you ignored it?

205
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Old friend you said?

206
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,433
What old friend?

207
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,733
Miss Su,

208
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,400
just stop tring to get news from me, okay?

209
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,300
I'll definitely know the reason.

210
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,200
Tell him,

211
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,700
