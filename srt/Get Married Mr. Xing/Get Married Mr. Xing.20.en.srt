1
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,966
All the directors are here?

2
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,900
I think everyone knows

3
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,733
what is the purpose of today's meeting?

4
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,400
It's about voting to decide new chairman.

5
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,933
Now, I would like to ask all the directors here to

6
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,266
raise hand to vote.

7
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:12,900
Anyone supports Miss Su, raise your hand.

8
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,933
Three.

9
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,633
Anyone supports me, raise your hand.

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,733
Four.

11
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,833
Before we announce the result,

12
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,133
I have something to show all of you.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,900
I think everyone has obligation

14
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,633
and rights to know.

15
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,266
Mr. Cao,

16
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,866
I think you need to explain to us

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,433
why the project in Dongcheng district

18
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,766
was got by Bo'an?

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,533
In the past six years,

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,733
why should Bo'an

21
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,400
can snatch projects from Nianqiao?

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,133
Also,

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,400
during all these years,

24
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,900
how much capital you used your power in Nianqiao

25
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,400
to steal and transfer to Bo'an?

26
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,433
I think all the directors here

27
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,900
should be all curious.

28
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,966
Ridiculous, these are slanders.

29
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,866
Su Nian,

30
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,233
even if you want to get the company,

31
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,933
you shouldn't use such despicable means

32
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,166
to slander me.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,466
Don’t forget that I am still an elder.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,733
Indeed.

35
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,166
I should respect an elder.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,266
But some elders are disrespectful.

37
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,000
Slander or not,

38
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,266
I think Director Cao knows best.

39
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,700
You probably don't mind if I invite a witness here, do you?

40
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,466
What's wrong?

41
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,000
Miss Su, Bo'an's people didn't go there.

42
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:02,933
They gave up directly.

43
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:03,966
I asked guards

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,533
to keep the person in charge of the project downstairs their company,

45
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,633
but he just denied

46
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
that he is related to Cao Sipeng.

47
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,600
What about that Xiao Zhao?

48
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,733
He is a true witness.

49
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,400
That person in charge said

50
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,133
he got all the information about our projects from Xiao Zhao.

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,400
Su Nian,

52
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,066
can't you raise your voice,

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
let everyone listen to you.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
I think you said that

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,333
you have witness?

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,066
Where is your witness?

57
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,033
Isn't your witness this assistant?

58
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,300
Miss. Su, can Xing Ge arrive in time?

59
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,400
He should still be in the Xing family at this time.

60
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:51,466
He will be here soon.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Su Nian,

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,666
if nothing else,

63
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,300
let's announce the result.

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,466
How do you think?

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,733
Why should Mr. Cao so impatient?

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,766
There is one last director is not here.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,733
How could we announce the result now?

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,500
You are waiting for Xing family?

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,166
Xing family has always been neutral.

70
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,132
They  abstained from voting at the last meeting.

71
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:24,133
Besides, you failed to marry Xing family's son.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,533
Does it make any difference whether Xing family be here or not?

73
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,566
Who said there is no difference?

74
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,866
Am I not one of Xing family?

75
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,533
Did-didn't you-

76
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,633
Didn’t I cut off my relationship

77
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,566
with Xing family?

78
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,400
What I want to do now,

79
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,033
is what Mr. Cao likes most, right?

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,333
What?

81
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,333
The best way to get revenge on someone,

82
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,266
is to take away the thing he cares about most.

83
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,866
Now all the directors are here.

84
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,700
All directors present here need to vote by raising hands.

85
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
If you support Miss Su, please raise your hands.

86
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,733
Four.

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,366
If you support Mr. Cao, please raise your hands.

88
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:31,966
Four.

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,433
Mr. Cao, that's a even.

90
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,066
Otherwise,

91
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:39,300
let's compare who has the more shares in the company.

92
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,766
Mr. Cao,

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,700
given that as a shareholder,

94
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,133
you failed to reasonably perform your obligations,

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
and did things that harmed the interests of the Group.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,633
Your qualification as a shareholder will be cancelled forcibly.

97
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,700
The relevant evidence

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,600
will be sent via corporate email

99
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,500
to everyone in the Group.

100
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,866
If the directors present have no objections,

101
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,900
the resolution will be implemented immediately.

102
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,366
Uncle Cao,

103
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
goodbye, hope we won't meet again.

104
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,666
Chairwoman Su, congratulations.

105
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,366
You get what you want.

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,433
I heard from Si Yu that

107
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,866
in the meeting of shareholders,

108
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,566
you didn't be euphemistic to Cao Sipeng,

109
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,533
and showed everyone evidence of what he did.

110
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,233
He is not a shareholder anymore,

111
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,533
and all his shares were recovered.

112
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:28,266
You are now the absolute controlling shareholder of Nianqiao.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,266
and the youngest chairwoman of Nianqiao

114
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,533
Well, I am.

115
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,533
Don't talk about that.

116
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,566
Come on, have a look.

117
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,333
Which day you think it better?

118
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,566
What are you going to do?

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,866
Get the marriage certificate.

120
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,966
I think this one is good.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,933
Tomorrow.

122
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,000
These ones left

123
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:46,966
are too far away.

124
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,500
If I am busy at that time,

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,300
I won't have time to get married.

126
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,500
Why do you have to do it in a hurry?

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
You don't understand.

128
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,900
Though the meeting of directors ends,

129
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,133
the procedures haven't been completely processed yet.

130
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,933
I'm afraid that my dad

131
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,033
would set a barrier for me with excuse of marriage.

132
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,166
Then I will just be a acting chairwoman.

133
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,500
This is too risky!

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,166
Better not risk.

135
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,666
Fine.

136
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
I really don't understand you.

137
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,600
Why should you just enter the cage of marriage?

138
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,600
Cage or not,

139
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,500
you need to give it a try.

140
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,166
You and Xing Yi are still not good?

141
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,200
When have you seen

142
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,333
I couldn't move on from an ex?

143
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,733
What a coincidence, I've seen it 20 times.

144
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,766
They don't count.

145
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
I just want to get them work for me

146
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,533
with the pretext of dating.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
so

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,866
Do you still want to reconcile with Xing Yi?

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,033
No.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,733
But...

151
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,533
I think that

152
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,733
someone doesn't think so.

153
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:55,933
Who?

154
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,133
Wenxi,

155
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,433
I'm afraid that you were drunk that day and didn't hear me.

156
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,466
So I want to tell you again

157
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,666
what I said that day.

158
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,000
I've never thought

159
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,266
you had forced me

160
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,666
to do anything I didn't want to.

161
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,500
Xing Ge wouldn’t think so either.

162
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,733
So stop thinking

163
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,000
that's your fault.

164
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,500
It's not your fault.

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,533
As for Xing Yi,

166
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
he did make mistakes

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
but out of good intentions.

168
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,433
So I think he is not that bad.

169
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
And even though he will soon be my brother-in-law,

170
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,566
no matter what,

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,433
you will always be my best friend.

172
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,665
I will support whatever decision you make.

173
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,000
Where are you going?

174
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,533
I'm going on a date with Xing Ge, bye.

175
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,600
I-Wenxi!

176
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,366
Wenxi!

177
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Mr. Xing, please behave yourself.

178
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,400
We are in public now.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,866
Wenxi, I-

180
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,366
Every time Mr. Xing sees me,

182
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,133
you always apologize to me.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,900
If that's all you want to say,

184
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,833
I accept your apology.

185
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,400
I forgive you too.

186
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,600
Can I leave now?

187
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,666
Wenxi, I...

188
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,400
What on earth do you want to do?

189
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,200
Can't we just have a decent breakup?

190
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,033
Wenxi,

191
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,766
except for the part in the beginning,

192
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,100
I didn't lie to you about other things.

193
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,133
I really like you.

194
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,933
All the promises I made to you are true.

195
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,733
Let's make up, okay?

196
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm used to being free,

197
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,733
I don't like be told what to do.

198
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,933
I won't do that to you.

199
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,100
You can do what ever you want.

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,666
No one can know what will happen in the future,

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,333
but I will try my best.

202
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,233
No matter what will happen,

203
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:03,266
I will discuss with you first.

204
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
I promise you that

205
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,300
I won't quarrel with you, won't lie to you, won't hide anything from you.

206
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,566
You are just saying.

207
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,100
And you can give it a try.

208
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,033
Think it as probation period.

209
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,066
How do you think?

210
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,833
You mean it?

211
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:19,500
Yes.

212
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:26,300
Then let's give it a try.

213
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,233
Wenxi!

214
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,000
Wenxi, we are going to get married,

215
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,233
why are you so nervous?

216
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,533
Are you sure you want to get a marriage certificate?

217
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
I'm telling you

218
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
once you get the certificate, there is no room for regret.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,133
In the future,

220
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,566
if you get divorced,

221
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,933
you will be a second-hand woman.

222
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,700
Lu Wenxi!

223
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,066
Brother, stop scaring her.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,366
Xing Yi, since you are here now,

225
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,300
why don't you get a certificate by the way?

226
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,733
Xing Ge, what are you doing?

227
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,233
Go get yourself married,

228
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,366
don't force others to do so.

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Wenxi, come in with me and feel it.

230
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:14,966
Come on.

231
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,700
Don’t you envy them?

232
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,900
Even if I envy them,

233
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,966
will you marry me?

234
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,800
It's okay, you don't need to think about that.

235
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,100
You don’t have to answer me if you haven’t thought about it yet.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,433
Xing Yi, if one day

237
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,633
I dare to go in,

238
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,533
you will be the first to know.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,900
Okay.

240
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,433
My daughter is really married.

241
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,900
Of course, could this be fake?

242
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,366
I'm not that bored.

243
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:00,400
You won't regret?

244
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,566
I won't.

245
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,066
Anyway, I have never thought about divorce.

246
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,566
Okay.

247
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,000
When will you go home to have a dinner?

248
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,933
When will you hold the wedding?

249
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,266
Xing Ge and I

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
plan to go on honeymoon first.

251
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,866
Anyway, the last appointment letter hasn’t signed yet.

252
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,700
You can run the company for me.

253
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,500
Honeymoon?

254
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,533
You didn't even hold a wedding.

255
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,600
Where are you going?

256
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,233
How long will you go?

257
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,433
Well...

258
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,633
Maybe one month,

259
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,700
maybe three months.

260
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:33,766
You know

261
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,000
since I joined Nianqiao,

262
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,500
I'd never had time to take a vacation.

263
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,166
Now that I have time now,

264
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,233
I can use all my leaves now.

265
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:41,300
That long?

266
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:42,866
No.

267
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,400
My old friend and I were agreed to

268
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,500
go on vacation abroad together next month.

269
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,966
We've already booked the tickets.

270
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,466
What should I do? I still want to take a vacation.

271
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,766
You are still young,

272
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:52,600
don't take vacation now,

273
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:55,133
wait until you are as old as me.

274
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,500
Xiao Si, bring the letter of appointment here,

275
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,000
I want to sign it now.

276
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:10,966
Here!

277
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,133
You bastard!

278
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,300
Niannian,

279
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,733
you're afraid that I won't hand over the company to you.

280
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:27,233
I just want you to go on the vacation happily.

281
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,533
You stinky girl.

282
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,800
Disappear from my eyes.

283
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,966
I don't want to see you again.

284
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,300
Okay.

285
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:41,766
Let's go.

286
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:42,666
Goodbye sir.

287
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:47,666
Niannian, remember to take Xing Ge home for dinner.

288
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,466
Take it for me.

289
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:12,866
How about it?

290
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:14,300
Of course I got it.

291
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,266
How could I not got it?

292
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,366
Let's go celebrate.

293
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:19,066
Okay.
