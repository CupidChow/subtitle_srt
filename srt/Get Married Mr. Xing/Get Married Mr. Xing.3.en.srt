1
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:55,866
Miss Su,

2
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,900
I thought you would

3
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,766
learn the lesson of a kid in kindergarten.

4
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:00,966
What do you mean?

5
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:01,966
You can't just enter here.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Even kids know this.

7
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,333
Miss Su,

8
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,166
can't you read?

9
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,633
I can.

10
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,500
It says locker.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,133
Wait a moment.

12
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:17,766
What do you want to do?

13
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,500
Marry me.

14
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,333
No.

15
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,200
Be my bodyguard then.

16
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,266
At least say yes to this one.

17
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,866
Otherwise,

18
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,200
Mr. Xing, you don't want me to pester you more, do you?

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,400
Now we are in a boxing club,

20
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,233
come one, let's have a fight.

21
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,633
If I win,

22
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,033
fulfill one wish of me.

23
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,833
If you win,

24
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,833
I won't pester you anymore.

25
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,333
How do you say?

26
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,266
Okay.

27
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,700
How to wear the gloves?

28
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,666
Like this.

29
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:29,666
Just give up.

30
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:31,600
No.

31
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,166
What's the matter with you?

32
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,300
You can't be gentle to girls?

33
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,100
You lose.

34
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,200
Lose-

35
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:03,233
You lose.

36
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,500
I lost.

37
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,700
Then you have to be my bodyguard.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Now that Miss Sue can defeat me,

39
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,700
I believe that

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,166
even if I’m not with you,

41
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,700
you can protect yourself.

42
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,566
No!

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
Then I fought with you in vain?

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,633
What do you mean?

45
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:31,700
Brother, here you are.

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,766
Get in the car.

47
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,600
So he has a girlfriend already?

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,933
Miss Su, why are you here?

49
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:56,666
Here,

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,133
this is the specific document for the bidding.

51
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,466
It will begin two months later.

52
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:05,866
Miss Su,

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,100
aren't you supposed to chase Xing Ge?

54
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,133
Why did you come to the company suddenly?

55
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
Because I plan to get a new assistant.

56
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,799
Miss Su, sorry.

57
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,333
I won't tell your father

58
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,133
about what have you done.

59
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,333
What did you say?

60
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,166
Everything, literally everything.

61
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,233
Did you tell him that

62
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,133
I suspected Cao Sipeng acquired shares secretly?

63
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,733
No wonder

64
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,233
old man wants me to marry Xing Ge

65
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,733
that much.

66
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,400
I thought

67
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,266
he just worried that I couldn't marry anyone

68
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,166
and no one would take care of me when I get old.

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,600
That is to say,

70
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,366
there is another reason why

71
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,700
my old man want me to marry Xing Ge.

72
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,600
To acquire shares.

73
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,100
So he just blew smoke

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,300
to assign Cao Sipeng

75
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,700
to be next chairman?

76
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,133
If Cao Sipeng knows that

77
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,000
your father decided to hand over the company to him,

78
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:24,033
he wouldn't be in a hurry to acquire shares.

79
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:25,566
That is to say,

80
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:29,700
Mr. Su did this to delay him.

81
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,200
Makes sense.

82
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,933
Keep an eye on Cao Sipeng during this period.

83
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,666
Okay.

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Miss Su,

85
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,800
even your father did that for you with his illness,

86
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,866
what are you waiting for?

87
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,333
Go get him.

88
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,133
Back off!

89
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,133
Yes.

90
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,633
You heard it with your own ears?

91
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,166
I saw it with my own eyes.

92
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,200
But that's not necessarily true.

93
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:58,966
I'm not sure.

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,100
If you want to know,

95
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,433
ask him directly.

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,500
How to ask him?

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,200
WeChat, or call him.

98
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,800
Wait,

99
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,266
Miss Su, you didn't get

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,133
his number or WeChat code right?

101
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:14,666
If I can

102
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,766
friend him on WeChat,

103
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,466
that will be weird, okay?

104
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,333
Girl, you are hopeless.

105
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,133
I think I'd better give up.

106
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,433
No!

107
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,800
I will use all my experience

108
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,066
to make a plan for you especially.

109
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,500
I will make sure you will get him.

110
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,600
Do you want to know?

111
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,266
You know why

112
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:40,200
cat is one of the most popular pets?

113
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,300
What does this have to do with cats?

114
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
Of course it has.

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,133
You yourself have a cat, don't you?

116
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:46,966
Imagine yourself as a cat,

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,000
and Xing Ge as cat's owner.

118
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,300
You can get him immediately.

119
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,966
He may even struggle to get your attention!

120
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,266
Get my attention?

121
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,500
Really?

122
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,766
Don't believe me?

123
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:01,966
You question me?

124
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,933
I didn't question you.

125
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,733
How dare I question you?

126
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,066
Look! Them!

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't worry.

128
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,433
That's not his girlfriend.

129
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,766
How do you know?

130
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,866
The intimate distance between two people

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,333
is 44 cm.

132
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,766
There's still a little distance between these two.

133
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:26,766
Really?

134
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,733
Don't believe me?

135
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,133
If you don't believe me, let's go to check!

136
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:31,666
Let's go!

137
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,566
No!

138
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,500
Come on!

139
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,633
Hurry! Hurry up!

140
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,133
No!

141
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:46,966
What's wrong?

142
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,000
Those people are coming here?

143
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,033
No, let's go.

144
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,366
I have to show him that

145
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,266
this is the true face of his son-in-law.

146
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,166
Cao Sipeng?

147
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,366
Why is he here?

148
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:16,233
Where are you going?

149
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300
I saw Cao Sipeng.

150
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,366
Wait for me.

151
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,433
I don't care what way you use,

152
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,800
keep him here.

153
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,000
What a coincidence!

154
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,866
What are you doing here?

155
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:42,299
If I say that I'm not stalking you,

156
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,899
will you believe me?

157
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,133
Are those two people running toward here?

158
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:45,933
I think so.

159
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:48,933
Over there!

160
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,000
Xing Ge, I can’t run anymore.

161
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,566
Take off your high heels.

162
00:08:58,566 --> 00:08:59,700
Running for so long,

163
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,366
you didn't even tell me who they are!

164
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,166
Xing Ge!

165
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,433
That woman is over there! Come on!

166
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,066
Stop!

167
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:06,633
Run!

168
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:07,400
Stop!
