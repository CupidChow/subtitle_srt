1
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,500
I didn't want to tell you that.

2
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,366
But I don't want him to have any regrets.

3
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,100
When did you know this?

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,566
Last month your dad suddenly felt unwell,

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,933
so we went to hospital.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,333
Neither of us expected it is liver cancer.

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,433
How could it be?

8
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,400
Mom, I will send dad to hospital,

9
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,333
the best hospital.

10
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,500
It's useless.

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
We have gone to many hospitals.

12
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,400
The result is the same.

13
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:30,033
People have to face aging, illness and death.

14
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,166
Xiao Yi,

15
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,766
your dad has always worried about your brother.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,266
But you know,

17
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,566
your brother is too stubborn.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,933
All over these years,

19
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,700
he's never come back home.

20
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,066
We can't

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,966
let your dad leave with regrets.

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,833
Wenxi, you are Xiao Su's friend.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,400
Can you do me a favor,

24
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,466
trying to talk to them.

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,833
I-I...

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,700
Don't worry, I will find a way to do this.

27
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,300
Er...Xing Yi,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,733
if you feel upset,

29
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,366
I can stay with you.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,266
You father will be fine

31
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,500
after treatment.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,100
Niannian has her way to do things.

33
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,466
I can talk to her but it may not work.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,433
Even if I can convince her,

35
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,133
Xing Ge

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,900
may not agree.

37
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,066
Wenxi,

38
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,066
about this,

39
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,266
I don't want to put too much pressure on you.

40
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,333
Why are you here?

41
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,633
Su Nian,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I hope you can help me persuade my brother to go home.

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,833
No way.

44
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,233
Xing Yi,

45
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,233
who are you to

46
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,566
say that to me?

47
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,466
If it weren't for your mother,

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,300
Xing Ge’s mother wouldn’t have committed suicide,

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,766
and he would not run away from home at a young age.

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,766
Wait.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,133
Niannian, you must be misunderstanding.

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
Xing Yi’s mother didn’t do such a thing

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,200
How did you know?

54
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,633
I just knew about this too.

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,166
My brother has always misunderstood dad.

56
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,966
My dad didn't cheat on me

57
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,466
The company was in crisis and faced bankruptcy.

58
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,233
My dad was under great pressure,

59
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,433
that's why he neglected Xing Ge's mother,

60
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,633
and caused tragedy.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,133
His mom suffered from postpartum depression,

62
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,666
that is the result that no one wants to see.

63
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:05,833
Niannian,

64
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,600
since there is a misunderstanding,

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,633
how about telling Xing Ge the truth?

66
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,233
Misunderstanding or not,

67
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,366
Xing Ge's mom's death is related to him.

68
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,333
I can promise you to

69
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,566
tell Xing Ge what happened.

70
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,566
But I won't make decision for him.

71
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,200
Okay.

72
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,466
One more thing that

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,500
I hope you can tell my brother.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,633
My dad

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,566
was diagnosed with liver cancer.

76
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,100
In late stage.

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Whether he wants to go back home or not,

78
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,500
I hope he can go to see my dad.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Liver cancer?

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Uncle Xing, why are you here?

81
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,433
Er-Xing Yi told me Xing Ge lives here.

82
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,366
So I want to

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,433
come over and take a look.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,066
Now that you are back,

85
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,166
I won't bother you.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,333
Uncle Xing,

87
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,733
if you are not busy,

88
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
do you want to come in?

89
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,933
Won't it bother you?

90
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,433
Don't you want to see

91
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,333
the place Xing Ge has been living?

92
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,333
Yes.

93
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,933
Come in.

94
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,500
Okay.

95
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
Uncle, have some water.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,666
Okay, thank you.

97
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,366
Uncle, Xing Yi told me

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
About your illness.

99
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,466
Can you not tell Xing Ge?

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,266
Really? You mean it?

101
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,433
He won't care even if you tell him.

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,133
Uncle,

103
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,100
I don’t know what’s going on between your elders.

104
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,766
I dare not comment.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,666
But you can be part of the problem or part of the solution.

106
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,866
The misunderstanding between you two

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,500
needs you to tell him in person.

108
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,566
I know that

109
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,266
there is a wound

110
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,033
in his heart that has never healed.

111
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,533
I just want to use my remaining time to make up for it.

112
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:41,900
I understand.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,566
So I hope

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,533
you can communicate to resolve the conflicts.

115
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:50,666
Xing Ge?

116
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,766
Xing Ge, why are you back so early?

117
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,400
Su Nian, have you forgotten something?

118
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,900
If you have something to do, I can leave now.

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,800
I am together with Su Nian,

120
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,566
but that doesn't mean that I will come back home.

121
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,166
If you ask her to

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,433
do something for you because of this,

123
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,466
it can only make me hate you more.

124
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:19,600
Okay.

125
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,400
Niannian,

126
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,266
let's have lunch.

127
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,200
Xing Ge,

128
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
he is sick.

129
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,966
Everyone may get sick, that's normal.

130
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,333
He got liver cancer.

131
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,566
Xing Ge,

132
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,000
actually about what happened back then,

133
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,266
you mom misunderstood,

134
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,433
you dad didn't cheated on her.

135
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,500
I know,

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
even so,

137
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,233
you mom's death is still related to him.

138
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,833
But you have lost your mom,

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,266
don't let yourself regret again.

140
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,466
What?

141
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,300
What did you say?

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,933
You father is sick.

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,166
Liver cancer.

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,700
You can choose not to forgive him.

145
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,400
But

146
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,565
at least go to see him.

147
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,465
Don't leave yourself any regrets.

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,266
Let's have dinner first.

149
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,466
Don't you want to know about his situation?

150
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,133
You saw him.

151
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,166
He can come here.

152
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,600
It means he is fine.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,933
Xing Ge,

154
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,633
that's not a cold,

155
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,800
that's liver cancer.

156
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Let me get you some rice.

157
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,100
What's wrong, Boss?

158
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,433
Had a quarrel with your Miss Su?

159
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,733
What's wrong then?

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,933
Lao Xing is sick.

161
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:55,866
Liver cancer.

162
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,600
What?

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,666
Er-you...

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,066
Su Nian told me that

165
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,900
I blamed him wrongly ,

166
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,466
and he didn't cheat on my mom.

167
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,966
Now he is about to die,

168
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,900
doesn't he just want me to go back home to see him?

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,833
How do you think?

170
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,833
Do I have any choice?

171
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,166
I did hate him.

172
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,400
All over those years,

173
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,666
many people told me that

174
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,933
he didn't cheat on my mom.

175
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,666
He was a good husband and a good father.

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Now matter how many people

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
said that to me,

178
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,100
that is meaningless.

179
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,633
Cheated or not,

180
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,866
my mom

181
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,266
died in front of me

182
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,700
because of him.

183
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,333
This can't be changed.

184
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,400
Well, I'm not quite good at comforting people.

185
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,700
So what are you going to do?

186
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,633
Please leave me alone for now.

187
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,000
Hello?

188
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,266
Su Nian, are you and my brother together?

189
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,433
He didn't answer my call.

190
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,666
No, what's wrong?

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,533

00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,966
Suddenly?
