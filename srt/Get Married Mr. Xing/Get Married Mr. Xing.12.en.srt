1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,033
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,700
Wenxi, I want to

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,133
take responsibility for what happened that day.

4
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:54,466
I like you.

5
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,566
So,

6
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,000
let's get married.

7
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:10,766
Wenxi,

8
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,133
I'm too direct, right?

9
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,866
I really think that after what happened that day,

10
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,166
I should be responsible for you.

11
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,366
And I really like you.

12
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,100
So let's get married.

13
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,100
Wenxi!

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,533
Wenxi!

15
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:30,800
Well...

16
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,733
Xing Yi, I think you may have misunderstood.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Yes, when I'm with you,

18
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
I'm quite happy.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,200
I believe you are too.

20
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,133
But that's all we can...

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,700
Let's put it this way,

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,600
if you want to be responsible for me

23
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:46,833
for what happened that day,

24
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:47,966
I don't need that.

25
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:53,533
Lu Wenxi, I’m serious.

26
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,366
I'll give you time to think about it.

27
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,766
Please think about it and then reply to me.

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,533
What day is it today?

29
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,600
So many dishes.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,500
It's weekend now.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,133
I want to have dinner with you.

32
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,800
You actually have sense of ritual?

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,733
In fact, I also prepared a gift for you.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,633
Xing Ge.

35
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,466
What?

36
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,666
I have something to tell you.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,733
Very important thing.

38
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,900
I made a mistake.

39
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,366
I mistook you with the one I should get married with.

40
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,533
You mistook?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,300
I have always told you that

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,166
my family is poor

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,033
and I lost my job.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,833
These are all lies to get your sympathy.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,233
So you are telling me these now,

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,833
because you mistook and

47
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:31,466
you want to stop your loss in time?

48
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,033
Anything else?

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,200
Sorry.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,233
Since Ms. Su wants to stop the loss in time,

51
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,766
goodbye.

52
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,833
I really got the wrong person.

53
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,700
So do you like him?

54
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,433
That doesn't matter at all.

55
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:21,000
The person I should marry is Xing Yi.

56
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,500
What should we do now?

57
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,966
Actually, Niannian,

58
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,933
you should learn about

59
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,233
what happened between Xing Ge and his father.

60
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,366
If it wasn’t severe problem,

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,900
there should still be a chance to make up.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,266
Right.

63
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,766
Father and son won't really hate each other.

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
I should try to learn more about the situation.

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm really a fool.

66
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,800
Why didn't I

67
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,933
leave myself a way out just now.

68
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
It's okay.

69
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,900
We will have solutions.

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,166
You will be fine.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,100
I will go back home to ask my dad.

72
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,733
He must know what happened.

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Okay, stop talking about me.

74
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,266
You can't just avoid Xing Yi

75
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,333
by not going back home.

76
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,066
I don't know what happened to him.

77
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,933
Suddenly he is like a different person.

78
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,133
Could it be just because we

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,233
well, did that?

80
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,200
Nowadays, people are more open than before,

81
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,266
but some people are still conservative.

82
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,133
Maybe he's that kind of person.

83
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,700
Don't people always say

84
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,400
for a woman,

85
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,433
marriage is like the second life.

86
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,066
And I've never seen

87
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,500
a good second life.

88
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,666
Think about my mom.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,133
She has second life twice.

90
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,333
And that almost killed her.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,433
To save my life,

92
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,166
I will never get married.

93
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,033
What about Xing Yi?

94
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,666
I will find a time to explain it to him.

95
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,333
Come on.

96
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,166
Hurry! Hurry!

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,066
Wenxi, what are you doing?

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
What's going on?

99
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Get in first.

100
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,133
Wenxi, are you okay?

101
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,233
No.

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,033
You don't understand.

103
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,500
The way he proposed

104
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,733
is like a teacher

105
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:55,966
asks you do you want to study hard

106
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,900
with a ferule in his hand.

107
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:02,866
Isn't it scary?

108
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:16,966
Hello?

109
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,433
Okay I see.

110
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:23,566
We'll go back right away.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,733
Come on, go to my home with me.

112
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:28,800
What's wrong?

113
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,166
Xing Yi went to see my dad.

114
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,700
Uncle Xing is also there.

115
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,800
We need to get there right now.

116
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,666
I don't need to appear right?

117
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,232
My future sister-in-law, you won't come with me?

118
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,232
Okay, okay!

119
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:40,932
Let's go.

120
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,400
Dad, Uncle Xing.

121
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,933
Hello, uncles.

122
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,400
Come here.

123
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,066
Dad, this is the person I want to marry.

124
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,333
Don't make such a joke.

125
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,866
It's a misunderstanding.

126
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,733
Su Nian,

127
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,133
what's going on?

128
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,466
Didn't you say that

129
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,600
you has been with Xing Yi?

130
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:09,533
I-

131
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,166
Xiao Su,

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,533
if Xing Yi didn't treat you nice,

133
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,033
tell me.

134
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,466
I will teach him a lesson for you.

135
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,233
It's not like that, uncle Xing.

136
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,533
Please listen to me.

137
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,133
Actually...

138
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,666
Dad, uncle Su,

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,433
the one dating Su Nian is my brother.

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,400
What did you say?

141
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:24,833
The one dating Su Nian is my brother,

142
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,033
your another son, Xing Ge.

143
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,333
Lao Xing,

144
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,733
didn’t Xing Ge leave home long ago?

145
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,233
How do you know that's him?

146
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,033
When I knew that I need to marry Su Nian,

147
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,900
I tried to get to know her,

148
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,933
so I asked someone to investigate her.

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,200
Sorry,

150
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,666
when I knew,

151
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,100
Su Nian has already been with my brother.

152
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,266
I need to talk to you privately.

153
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,566
He won't beat Xing Yi, will he?

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,233
That's his son,

155
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,733
of course he won't.

156
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,133
No,

157
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,133
why do you care about him so much?

158
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,166
I don't care about him.
