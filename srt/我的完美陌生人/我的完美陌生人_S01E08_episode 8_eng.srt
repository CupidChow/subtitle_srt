1
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,575

2
00:01:56,152 --> 00:02:00,606

3
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:02,546

4
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:35,877

5
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:39,977

6
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:46,993
 In your opinion,

7
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,220
 when do you think people become most dangerous?

8
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,380
 The hopes of correcting all wrongs.

9
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:45,493
 The illusion that all mistakes can be covered up as if nothing happened.

10
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:12,333
 They fall into that pitiful sweet dream, and then...

11
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:16,433
 at one point they realize...

12
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:22,533
 there's no such thing as a reversible sin in the world.

13
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,603
But by the time they realize that,

14
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:42,173
they've already been crushed under the wheel of fate.

15
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,853
The important thing is...

16
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,223
the direction.

17
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,823

18
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:37,973

19
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,893

20
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,203
What happened?

21
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,773
You need to explain.

22
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,713
There must be a reason why you called me.

23
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,213
Why are you here at this time?

24
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:19,263
What did you see, and what did you do?

25
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:22,733
You need to explain everything from beginning to end!

26
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,663
Why can't you talk?

27
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,613
- Did you kill her? 
 - No.

28
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,863
I didn't, Mr. Yoon.

29
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,813
Why did you kill her, you punk! Why in the hell!

30
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:44,393
I was wrong. Please help me, Mr. Yoon.

31
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:47,243
You're alive and well.

32
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:49,623
You're alive and well!

33
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,273
Why the hell did you kill her?

34
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:55,533
I really didn't do it! I didn't do it!

35
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,953
Hello.

36
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,623
Where is the ring?

37
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,323
Huh?

38
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,763
Why is her ring missing?

39
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,413
Mr. Yoon, t-this really is nothing.

40
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:44,603
She gave it to me yesterday when I ran into her in town during the day.

41
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:49,333
But that has nothing to do with what happened here, Mr. Yoon.

42
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,793
We just happened to run into each other again and talked for a little while.

43
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,343
Then I left first.

44
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:59,323
But when I returned, I found her like this.

45
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,353
Mr. Yoon, it's true.

46
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:05,243
When did you say?

47
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,393
Pardon?

48
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:09,273
When did you get that?

49
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,623
Yesterday during the day.

50
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:17,063
Then that means all the police might know now, Mr. Yoon.

51
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,773
They say she's a commie.

52
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:25,083
If they find out that I saw her twice and didn't even report it...

53
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,513
That's what you're afraid of?

54
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,693
Yes.

55
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:52,433
She didn't leave?

56
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,633
Mr. Yoon.

57
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,953
You called the police already?

58
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,433
- Please tell us. 
 - Oh, my gosh!

59
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:15,663
- Please move away. 
 - Oh, my goodness!

60
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:18,893
- Please stop that! 
 - I can't see!

61
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:23,363

62
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,373

63
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:07,193

64
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,903
Oh, my goodness!

65
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:34,393
I knew something like this would happen one day.

66
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,763
She was just all over the place!

67
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:43,733
But even still, how could anyone from our town do anything like this?

68
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,593
The sight was so hideous that

69
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:51,703
Soon Cheon, who found her first, frothed at the mouth.

70
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,203
By any chance, do you know who the dead person is?

71
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:59,583
Yes, there's this girl who wears these tiny skirts.

72
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,783
She drank and stayed out late every night.

73
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:07,703
I think she was the eldest of Mr. Lee, who runs the Bus Station and Village Office.

74
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:22,753
Oh my god.

75
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:31,993
Oh, no. What to do. What to do.

76
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:59,773
 Lee Soon Ae! Lee Kyeong Ae! Hurry up and come out!

77
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:08,783
These doggone wenches...

78
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:12,073
How many times do I have to call you when breakfast is ready?

79
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:15,733
You don't even help me, but you just sleep in!

80
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,133
Is Kyeong Ae still sleeping?

81
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,003
Well, um...

82
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,703
Oh, geez. Lee Kyoung Ae snuck out again at night.

83
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,293
What? Really?

84
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:31,383
She said she'd come home early for sure.

85
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:36,243
You still don't know your sister? You believed that and let her leave?

86
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:40,613
This wench. She's probably drunk and sleeping on the street somewhere.

87
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:45,183
Goodness, only our daughter would make me go around and get her every day.

88
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,373
Let's take a few bites and go look for your sister.

89
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:49,673
 - Hyungnim! 
 - Hyeong Man!

90
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,573
Yes.

91
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,453
Yes, we're coming.

92
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,853
We were going to come anyway. Where is she today?

93
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,993
Look here, Hyeong Man!

94
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,887

95
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:25,173
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Come this way.

96
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,283
Coming through!

97
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,463
Let's go. We have to go.

98
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:42,043
Dong Shik! Dong Shik!

99
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:46,753
D-Dong Shik! Dong Shik!

100
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,103
Dong Shik!

101
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:53,773
I heard our Kyeong Ae... was here, so I came to get her...

102
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,583
Hyungnim...

103
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:03,493
W-Why are there so many people? Where's our Kyeong Ae?

104
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:08,693
W-Why did she come all the way here?

105
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:12,083
- That... 
 - Oh, Dad!

106
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:17,283
Y-You know... when she was younger...

107
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:21,343
Kyeong Ae! Dad's here! Dad's here!

108
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:25,453
Dad! Hey, I came here to pick up my Kyeong Ae!

109
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:27,913
Kyeong Ae! Kyeong...

110
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:31,523
- Let's go. 
 - Hey! Kyeong...

111
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,773
Kyeong Ae! Kyeong Ae!

112
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:42,153
Hey, you asshole! Kyeong Ae! I'm taking Kyeong Ae, asshole!

113
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:45,023
Let go! I'm here to take my daughter home, asshole!

114
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,883
Sister! Kyeong Ae...

115
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,233
Kyeong Ae! Come over here, you assholes!

116
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:55,503
Let go of me! I came to take my daughter, you asshole! Kyeong Ae!

117
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:57,113
 Let go!

118
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,303
 Dad is here! Hey, you assholes!

119
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:02,103
- Hyungnim! Dong Shik! 
  - Kyeong Ae!

120
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:04,733
Let go of me, you assholes! Let go!

121
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,073
- What? 
 - I came to take my daughter, asshole!

122
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,263
Kyeong Ae!

123
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:22,623
We both need to return. To our original places.

124
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,563
Did you say return?

125
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:31,883
Then, what about my mom?

126
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,393
And what about you?

127
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:39,573
What's happening to everything?

128
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:45,593
Whatever is meant to happen will happen no matter what we do.

129
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:48,113
You saw it yourself.

130
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:51,733
The time and place changed, but the person still died.

131
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:55,913
That's not it. The abandoned house where Lee Kyeong Ae was found...

132
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,533
was a new place.

133
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,303
She never died in a place like that.

134
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:05,713
There is nothing I can do to change the future...

135
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:10,003
based on what I know.

136
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:13,123
Everything is back to square one, and this is our end.

137
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,663
I'll fix the car somehow, so just wait until then.

138
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,933
- Oh, my goodness. 
 - Let's go quickly!

139
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:14,193
- What in the world is happening? 
 - What happened?

140
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,343
- Oh, Mi Sook! 
 - Mi Sook!

141
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:21,243
- Mi Sook! 
 - Did you come hearing the news?

142
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,763
Isn't it scary?

143
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:26,173
Yeah. I mean, what's going on...

144
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:29,193
What kind of psycho did such a thing?

145
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:32,293
It's horrible. How could this happen in our neighborhood?

146
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:37,423
Right? I'm too scared to go around now.

147
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,873
Anyway, let's hurry up and go.

148
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:47,253
Why do you look so serious?

149
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,283
What?

150
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:56,313
If anyone sees you, they'd think you killed her.

151
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:01,413
Relax your face. It looks so obvious.

152
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:11,273
Let's go. It'll be fun.

153
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,363
Let's go.

154
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,163
Isn't this her?

155
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:22,773
The one who ran away from Seoul after protesting?

156
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:27,573
Geez, she's not even from our town. Why did she have to die here?

157
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,333
It's just more headache for us.

158
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,113
What's going on all of a sudden?

159
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:36,763
From the way he tied her up, it seems like the same guy. Right?

160
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,133
Where did it go?

161
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:41,843
I don't know who he is, but killing two people in one night...

162
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:46,273
Chief, this won't affect your candidacy for police commissioner. Right?

163
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:49,963
Of course, it will! How come no one has matches!

164
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,753
Make sure to carry some.

165
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,137
Can't believe a girl even smoked, geez...

166
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,533

167
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:19,713
Wasn't this in Lee Kyeong Ae's belongings earlier, too?

168
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:24,323
Hey, while you're holding it, just take one out.

169
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,453
I don't hear...

170
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:45,433
"A woman who reads is dangerous."

171
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,793
What kind of shit is that?

172
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:53,603
Forget it! Catch this psycho fast and close the case.

173
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,123
Anyone so much as to brush past Lee Joo Young and Lee Kyeong Ae.

174
00:21:56,123 --> 00:22:02,953
And guys with criminal records, the neighborhood bully, and anyone with anything suspicious. Bring them all to me.

175
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,553
- Right now, you punks! Move it! 
 - Yes.

176
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:08,063
- Hurry! 
 - Yes, yes. I'm going that way.

177
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:10,153
Geez! Damn it...

178
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:14,183
My god, that idiot. Geez!

179
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:17,973
- Can't you hear me? 
 - Yes?

180
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,933
Don't think about running off by yourself again and move, Baek Dong Shik!

181
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:23,113
Move it!

182
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,083
Oh, man, what a spectacle for everyone...

183
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,003
 What is the meaning of this?

184
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,903
 Yoon Young!

185
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:04,393
 Yoon Young!

186
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,773
 Mr. Yoon!

187
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,263
 Is anyone there?

188
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:12,263
 Can someone please help?

189
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:14,513
 Can someone...

190
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:18,243
 Can someone please help...

191
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:24,003
Yoon Young.

192
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:27,603
My sister...

193
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:32,363
My sister...

194
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,373
Sister...

195
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,723
I know. I know.

196
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:50,983
I know...

197
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:53,093
I'm sorry.

198
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,983
My mom is acting strange, Yoon Young.

199
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:13,643
I always told her...

200
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:19,583
it's dangerous, and it's a scary world.

201
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:23,963
But she never listened to her mom.

202
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:28,503
- Mom... 
 - Why the heck did she go there at that hour?

203
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:34,863
Why the heck did she go there at that hour?

204
00:25:34,863 --> 00:25:37,113
That bitch.

205
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:40,773
Geez. Stupid bitch.

206
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:45,733
So obvious what people would say...

207
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:50,313
I told you to stop the phone from ringing!

208
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:02,933
Those sons of bitches.

209
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:06,023
Gossiping behind my back since it's not their concern.

210
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,713
All they want to do is watch the spectacle...

211
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:13,373
Why the hell do they keep calling!

212
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:16,723
Mom!

213
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:22,123
Mom...

214
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,177
Mom!

215
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,307

216
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,443
 Hey...

217
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,953
 C-Can I...

218
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:53,063
 Can I ask you something?

219
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,293
Please.

220
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:03,803
Can you open this and see me?

221
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,753
Do you by any chance know...

222
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:17,463
when and how my grandma passes away?

223
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:19,563
 I only heard that she died

224
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:23,403
 long before I was born, but I never heard how she died.

225
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,473
 By any chance...

226
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:32,983
By any chance, is that related to what happened today?

227
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:43,423
 If it is related to what happened, let me at least save my grandma!

228
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:47,703
 Can you please just tell me what I need to do?

229
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:54,893
I'm terrified that something changed because of me

230
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:59,373
and everything will just end like this.

231
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:21,693
 I saw it all though.

232
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:27,783
 All the hours you went around trying to save those people.

233
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:34,763
I saw... all your efforts.

234
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:38,543
Was that all for nothing?

235
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:43,093
 You're saying this is the end?

236
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,153
 Back to square one?

237
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,053
No way.

238
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:58,403
Unless we can return to where we don't know each other,

239
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:02,713
nowhere else can we be at square one.

240
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:23,946
Now, you must choose whether to move forward or step back.

241
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:27,466
The choice is up to you. What will you do?

242
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,376
Go.

243
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:32,666
Good. Let's count one more time.

244
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,646
Let's...

245
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,626
- Go! 
 - Five,

246
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:40,636
four, three,

247
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,546
two,

248
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:43,936
one.

249
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:45,806
Yes!

250
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,756
A bet is a bet.

251
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:54,656
You know, don't you?

252
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:56,856
Here.

253
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:04,046
Yeon Woo!

254
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:08,046
- Son! 
 - Dad!

255
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:10,976
Goodness! My child! Goodness, my son.

256
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,876
I missed you, Dad.

257
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:16,266
Goodness, let's look at you. Looking good.

258
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,506
- Is this yours? 
 - Yes, yes.

259
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:18,956
Let's go, let's go.

260
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:22,236
- Have you been well, Dad? 
 - Yeah.

261
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:32,556
- I'll wear out, Dad. 
 - Hey, come on!

262
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:35,716
I waited three years to see you.

263
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:39,426
Just staring at you for only 30 minutes will wear you out?

264
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:42,136
I was so busy with school. I'm sorry.

265
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:46,686
Man, your grades were amazing!

266
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:50,596
Yoons must have good brains, for sure.

267
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:54,976
You, me, and there's a teacher I really like these days.

268
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,576
Mr. Yoon Hae Joon. He's a Yoon, too!

269
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:03,256
- Hae Joon? 
 - Yes. Why?

270
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:05,496
It's a name I like very much.

271
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,416
Really?

272
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:11,006
I told him I'd introduce you when you came.

273
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:13,136
He said he needed to fix something.

274
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:18,186
My son is an expert in that area. In all of Korea, right?

275
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,416
Gosh, I'm so happy!

276
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:36,770
 - Geez! 
 - Come on!

277
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:40,536
 - Let go! 
 - Get in!

278
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:42,156
What's going on in the neighborhood?

279
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:45,476
I wonder. Stay in the car.

280
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,436
Let go of me!

281
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:53,886
What the heck is going on...

282
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,416
It's "Welcome to Korea."

283
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:30,316
Is this Hae Joon's house?

284
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:50,406
Who are you?

285
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:55,676
I was told something needed to get fixed here.

286
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:02,976
Maybe today is not a good day.

287
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,796
Then, would you give this to him?

288
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:11,996
If he succeeds in five seconds, I will fix everything for him.

289
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:17,166
If he fails, I'll have to think about it.

290
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,806
I like smart people.

291
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,026
Well then, bye!

292
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,856
 In a Gyeonggi town,

293
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:41,996
 two women's corpses were found in one day,

294
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:43,936
 causing residents to be in a state of anxiety.

295
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,096
 Reporter Woo In Seong on this incident.

296
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:47,516
 Today around 6:00 a.m.

297
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:51,246
 in an abandoned house on a mountain in Woojeong Village in Gyeonggi Province.

298
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,846
 A 22-year-old resident, Miss Lee, was found dead, bloodied.

299
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:58,196
 A local resident discovered her and reported it to the police.

300
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:02,406
 Based on the trace that Miss Lee was struck on the back of her head,

301
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:06,136
 the police suspect that she was assaulted and then murdered.

302
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:10,046
 In another incident, this morning around 6:00 a.m. near Woojeong Village River,

303
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:12,726
 a corpse of a 24-year-old student teacher

304
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:16,686
 at the local high school was discovered.

305
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:19,846

As a crime-free town for five consecutive years...

306
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,816
 I'm telling you.

307
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:42,896
 If only I become Miss Korea, I'll buy you a nice mink coat.

308
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:46,646
 Geez! This is the kind of child I have!

309
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,016
 You think it's that easy to buy a mink coat?

310
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:54,016
 What the heck? I'm not asking you to buy it. I'm telling you I'll buy you one!

311
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:57,956
 Don't take us for a ride. Just quit drinking, you mess.

312
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,096
 Talking about Miss Korea...

313
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,176
 How dare you be so rude to your older sister...

314
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:04,276
 Why are you all treating me this way?

315
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,946
 They told me I definitely have potential.

316
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:12,676
 You're not meeting strange people and doing shady things, are you?

317
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,196
 Mom, you don't know anything.

318
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:21,616
 But can you help me out a little bit?

319
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:23,616
 Are you crazy?

320
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:27,216
 Nothing! Even if I want to eat and die, I have nothing!

321
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,606
 - I'll go now. 
 - Yes.

322
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:43,956
 Oh Bok's mom, I'll get going.

323
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:46,026
 - I'll see you later. 
 - Mom! Mom!

324
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:48,306
 - Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! 
 - My gosh...

325
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:51,406
 - Mom! 
 - What do you want now?

326
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:55,416
 Mom, I wasn't joking, you know.

327
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:58,426
 - This time when I become Miss Korea... 
 - Miss...

328
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:01,286
 No, no, even if I don't become Miss Korea,

329
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,966
 I'll make lots of money and buy you a mink coat for sure. Okay?

330
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:09,686
 What's gotten into you this morning that you keep talking about mink coats?

331
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,676
 You know, remember...

332
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:15,666
 Who was it? When our next-door neighbor Seung Jin's mom wore a mink coat,

333
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,576
 you were really envious of her.

334
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,316
 - Seung Jin's? 
 - Yes.

335
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:22,486
 Seung Jin's family who moved away when you were nine?

336
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:24,706
 Right.

337
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:29,226
 Since then, my dream has been to buy my mom one exactly...

338
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:34,986
 No, buy you one that's much prettier than that one someday.

339
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:37,856
 But now, I think it will really come true soon.

340
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:42,776
 So, please wait just a little while longer, our Madam Ok Ja!

341
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,816
 Should I give you a big kiss?

342
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:48,276
 - Mother, I'll get going. 
 - Don't be gross. Let go.

343
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,936
 You didn't forget anything?

344
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:52,696
 Get going.

345
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,896
Cold bitch.

346
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:10,346
Why didn't I... just give her a hug?

347
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:15,586
I could have just hugged her once.

348
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:21,636
While I still could...

349
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:26,676
I should've hugged her as much as I want.

350
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,640
 Let's continue.

351
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,666
 Number 30! Miss Daegu first runner-up, Kang Eun Joo!

352
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:52,166
 Congratulations!

353
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:58,056
 Continuing, we will announce the next winner.

354
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:08,236
Mom.

355
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,156
Mom!

356
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,666
Mom!

357
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,216
What's wrong?

358
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,206
Where's your mom?

359
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:49,706
 - Oh Bok's mom! 
 - Mom!

360
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:50,876
 - Mom! 
 - Oh Bok's mom!

361
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,296
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

362
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,736
Hey, Ok Ja! Oh Bok's mom!

363
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:57,826
- Mom! 
 - Ok Ja!

364
00:38:57,826 --> 00:39:01,646
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

365
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:03,656
 Ok Ja!

366
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,476
Don't do it!

367
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,166
Don't. Please, Ma'am. Please.

368
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,816
Please don't do that. Please.

369
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,096
You must get through this.

370
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,706
I know it must be unbearably difficult.

371
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:15,696
But if you don't endure this moment,

372
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:19,706
your remaining children, Soon Ae and Oh Bok...

373
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:22,456
For those two people...

374
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:25,006
their lives without a mother...

375
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:31,256
will last at least 40 years, no, even longer than that!

376
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:43,476
Will you be at peace knowing you've left them behind like that?

377
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:52,976
Many things depend on your choice, Ma'am.

378
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:59,026
So please tell me you can survive this. Please say so.

379
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:00,756
Please?

380
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:34,926
Here.

381
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:39,716
Be careful.

382
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:43,046
Ok Ja!

383
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,676
- Ok Ja! 
 - Mom!

384
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,126
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

385
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:51,706
What the heck are you doing?

386
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:55,116
You fool!

387
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,456
Mom!

388
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:44,786
Shall we briefly hug each other?

389
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:53,416
Too many things happened today.

390
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,656
So, let's just...

391
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,986
We'll keep trying, right?

392
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:50,016
The culprit... and the third victim...

393
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,996
We can't stop now.

394
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:56,916
Since I don't want us to become strangers.

395
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,786
Oh, someone came by earlier.

396
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:12,516
He was a little strange.

397
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,656
What did he say?

398
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,726
He said he'd help only if you succeeded in five seconds...

399
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:27,116
Wow, what the heck.

400
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:33,246
You'll really ask him to fix it for you?

401
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,486
He's capable of that.

402
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:39,206
We have to return at some point, even if not now.

403
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:41,686
Who is he?

404
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:47,336
Can you show that to him?

405
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:50,276
I know how to handle him very well.

406
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:53,106
He's my father.

407
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,338
What?

408
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:17,306
You said you weren't hiding anything else, but you had the biggest secret.

409
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:22,496
I mean, you have family here. How could you not mention them until now?

410
00:45:22,496 --> 00:45:26,186
I was looking for the right timing. Like now.

411
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:31,246
Then, the principle we see every day is...

412
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,836
No wonder. You have the same last name.

413
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,206
First off, we can exclude a few guys.

414
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:42,966
Both of them?

415
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:48,286
Based on what I saw, it would've been impossible with that hand yesterday.

416
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,266
 I-I-I think it's broken!

417
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:55,256
 Looks like you can't tie up strings for a while, then.

418
00:45:55,256 --> 00:46:01,096
The two victims were both discovered bound with red wool strings.

419
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:11,686
Besides his fingers, he wasn't really in good shape.

420
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,446
Go Min Soo.

421
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:18,156
What Yoo Beom Ryong feared wasn't about the murder.

422
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:20,436
 They say she's a commie.

423
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:25,030
 If they find out that I saw her twice and didn't even report it...

424
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:28,446
 That's what you're afraid of?

425
00:46:28,446 --> 00:46:29,666
 Yes.

426
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:32,596
 Unless he gave an amazing performance,

427
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:37,206
he seemed oblivious that there was another murder.

428
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,550

429
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:52,246
I can't think of any more excuses.

430
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:57,386
Including the one with the blue cap, Baek Yoo Seop.

431
00:46:58,086 --> 00:47:00,986
Now, there's one more person.

432
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:05,906
The person who told the biggest lie.

433
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,106
Go Mi Sook.

434
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:13,016
 Mi Sook!

435
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:17,556
 I think I can understand why she lied about that.

436
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:19,776
 You know my brother?

437
00:47:20,476 --> 00:47:25,076
 Do you think I would like what happened to him...

438
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,186
 or the opposite?

439
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:28,806
 Let me know if you need any help.

440
00:47:28,806 --> 00:47:32,506
 I like what you've done so far.

441
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:35,916
She liked how things turned out for Go Min Soo.

442
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:39,616
Considering what he did to me,

443
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:43,456
I'm sure he couldn't have been a good brother to her.

444
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:47,726
The important thing is how much does she know?

445
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:54,566
How much did she know that she could frame Go Min Soo?

446
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:57,066
And how did she know?

447
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:59,986
The circumstances are important.

448
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:04,736
She knew enough to at least detail the events in her novel.

449
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:06,586
Yes, it seems so.

450
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:11,956
For now, let's head to Baek Hee Seop.

451
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:18,856
In about 30 minutes, the police will name him as the first suspect.

452
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:50,116
What kind of home visit is this? Huh?

453
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:55,726
Where is your brother now?

454
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,896
When was the last time you saw him?

455
00:48:57,896 --> 00:49:03,506
I guess you guys don't know, but my uncle is a cop.

456
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:08,870
Even if you're a teacher, you can't do this...

457
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:14,346
That uncle of yours will come to arrest you in about five minutes.

458
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,943
What is this?

459
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:34,486
Why are you hiding this here?

460
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,980
 In your opinion,

461
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,110
 when do you think people become the most dangerous?

462
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,970

463
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,400
 The hopes of correcting all wrongs.

464
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,680
 The illusion that all mistakes can be covered up as if nothing happened.

465
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,270
 They fall into that pitiful sweet dream frantically, and then

466
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,610
 they realize at one point.

467
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,150
 "Oh,

468
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,990
 there's no such thing as a reversible sin in the world."

469
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,470
 But by the time they realize that,

470
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:35,030
 they've already been crushed under the wheel of fate.

471
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,100
 The important thing is...

472
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,370
 the direction.

473
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,450
 What kind of ridiculous nonsense is this?

474
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,150
 Stop talking nonsense and just get to the point.

475
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,620
 Why did you want to see me?

476
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,610
 I think I can...

477
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,070
 take care of your weakness.

478
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,090
 What weakness?

479
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:16,390
 If you were going to throw it out, you should have done it right.

480
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,030
 What is this, like an idiot?

481
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,550
 You want to protect someone, and...

482
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,120
 I want to throw someone out.

483
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,530
 We can help each other out if we work well together.

484
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:49,020
 What are you trying to suggest?

485
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,040
 I'm talking about what your brother did.

486
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,260
That stupid girl.

487
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,820
She doesn't even know what she's talking about.

488
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,360
I don't know how you found out and came here, but...

489
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,180
this is mine.

490
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,200
I did everything.

491
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:13,217
 No, no, I swear it's not me!

492
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:16,817
 - Why are you here? 
 - Geez!

493
00:53:18,347 --> 00:53:20,747
- No, that's not true! 
 - I told you to be quiet!

494
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:24,517
- Hey, say it right! 
 - What do you mean...

495
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:32,427
 - No, it really isn't true! 
 - What do you mean no?

496
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:36,687

497
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,717
This is mine.

498
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:29,547
I did everything.

499
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:33,187
 Who am I?

500
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,987
 And where is this place?

501
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:43,457
 I came across a long span of time, and yet...

502
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:47,757
 is this all you could say to me?

503
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:55,868
 Finally, everything is becoming clearer.

504
00:54:55,868 --> 00:54:58,138
 To me, from start to end,

505
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:02,181
 you were someone I couldn't understand...

506
00:55:02,658 --> 00:55:05,258
 I mean, someone I didn't want to understand.

507
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:10,148
 You were just a pathetic human being.

508
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:20,128
 My poor child...

509
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:22,128
 My pitiful child...

510
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:25,214
 What could I do...

511
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:34,428
 The two of you must stay together...

512
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:37,178
 You have to live a good life...

513
00:55:37,178 --> 00:55:41,238
 You have to be good. Okay?

514
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:47,778
Come on, Baek Hee Seop! Get a hold of yourself!

515
00:55:48,568 --> 00:55:50,918
I'm dying here...

516
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:56,028
Pull yourself together! Look at me!

517
00:55:59,158 --> 00:56:00,938
Listen carefully.

518
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:06,188
This is... something that could change...

519
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:09,968
your entire life and your family's future.

520
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:13,258
If you're lying...

521
00:56:15,728 --> 00:56:19,278
I know better than anyone what will happen.

522
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:22,918
So mind your own business and go away.

523
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:29,398
If you don't want to see blood while you drag your feet.

524
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:32,708
Let's go.

525
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:36,658
We don't need to hear anything more. He said he did it.

526
00:56:36,658 --> 00:56:39,298
Let him face the consequences.

527
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:42,718
Although I don't know if that's possible.

528
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,948
Wait—

529
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:11,678
Uncle.

530
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:18,328
What I just heard,

531
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:20,478
is it all true?

532
00:57:23,348 --> 00:57:25,138
I'm sorry.

533
00:57:26,188 --> 00:57:28,458
I'm sorry, Uncle.

534
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:42,658
You...

535
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:50,108
Come out, you punk.

536
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,358
Come out, you punk!

537
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:04,298
Nothing good will come out for you...

538
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:07,498
if you keep running into me like this.

539
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:11,908
Mark my words. Understand?

540
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,458
Go!

541
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:21,048
Go, you punk!

542
00:59:00,108 --> 00:59:02,078
I'm sorry.

543
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:07,408
I'm sorry.

544
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,248
I'm sorry.

545
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:12,298
I'm sorry.

546
00:59:28,718 --> 00:59:31,458
You're thinking of other people again.

547
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:37,768
My dad had done everything...

548
00:59:38,728 --> 00:59:41,948
You coming all the way here...

549
00:59:43,158 --> 00:59:47,454
and of all people, me following you all the way here...

550
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:50,484
It might all be because of that!

551
00:59:54,528 --> 00:59:58,918
I don't know how I could beg for forgiveness.

552
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,338
I don't know if this will be any consolation, but...

553
01:00:19,418 --> 01:00:21,098
I will...

554
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:25,518
never have a good life.

555
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:28,198
I mean...

556
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,678
I won't be able to.

557
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:39,988
This time, the police heard my dad's confession

558
01:00:39,988 --> 01:00:42,928
so he will receive the proper punishment.

559
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:46,898
And my mom will find out soon.

560
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:52,718
Then, of course, they will never get married.

561
01:00:55,088 --> 01:00:58,118
- Then, I... 
 - You will disappear.

562
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:02,208
So you think that will console me?

563
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:15,668
I'm sorry, but... something that could change...

564
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:21,348
Because I don't think your dad Baek Hee Seop is the culprit anyway.

565
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:36,071

566
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:48,258
♫  During night while dawn enters  ♫

567
01:01:48,258 --> 01:01:54,548
♫  I think of your face  ♫

568
01:01:54,548 --> 01:02:02,438
♫  I remember your clear smile  ♫

569
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:05,368
♫  I ended up staying up all night  ♫

570
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:07,368

571
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:11,278
 Is this true? How could you kill someone, you punk!

572
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:12,798
 What I asked you earlier...

573
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:15,348
 What is this? Why did you hide this here?

574
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:18,568
 When I asked him why, he abruptly said it was his.

575
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,308
 About the object that was found in his room.

576
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:24,458
 I'm sure. Ever since I was little, Uncle wouldn't even let me touch it.

577
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:28,578
 Hee Seop! This. This is Yoo Seop's. Right?

578
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,628
 This is mine.

579
01:02:29,628 --> 01:02:32,828
 Even when his younger brother was arrested in his place, he looked the other way and hid.

580
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:37,508
 We were wrong. Baek Hee Seop was trying to cover up...
