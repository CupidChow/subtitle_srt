1
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,502

2
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,979

3
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,439
What did you mean just now?

4
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,800
That how we met here is not a coincidence?

5
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,930

6
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:09,883
If this is all true, tonight...

7
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:13,203
that is, two nights before the student teacher dies,

8
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,163
there was an incident where she suddenly disappeared.

9
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:19,023
Thankfully, a townsperson found her.

10
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,663
It was revealed that she simply lost her way

11
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:25,173
so it ended as a small happening. But actually,

12
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:28,313
she looked like she was being chased by someone.

13
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:39,763
Do you know where they found her?

14
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:42,413
 By the river.

15
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:46,273
If it's the closest place from the bus station and village office, it should be about here.

16
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,040
What the—?

17
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:57,593
Ms. Lee Joo Young!

18
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:04,943
- Ms. Lee Joo Young... 
 - No, it's not! It's not me!

19
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,530

20
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:43,733
What the hell are you guys doing? You all want to die?

21
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:49,383
Mr. Yoon Hae Joon, it's you again!

22
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:51,233
Shit.

23
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:56,673
It's not enough that you failed once. You want to repeat it two or three more times!

24
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:14,653
 You released Go Min Soo?

25
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,133
 Why?

26
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:20,793
 I just followed orders.

27
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:25,893
 That's a very responsible thing to say.

28
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,663
 Since this is the way you conduct things...

29
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:39,883
 This one mistake must end now, Detective Baek Dong Shik.

30
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,903
 If we're not lucky,

31
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:46,993
 someone's life is in danger again because of the punk you released tonight.

32
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,563
Was it Go Min Soo just now?

33
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,023
No way. Could he have again...

34
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,813
No matter what he does, you guys have nothing to say. Right?

35
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:01,833
It drives me crazy that I had to do such a stupid thing!

36
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,453
Just answer my questions straight.

37
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,793
Was it Go Min Soo just now?

38
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,733
I don't know.

39
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,993
- What? You don't know? 
 - I could've found out

40
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:13,253
who it was and what he was going to do if we caught him, but

41
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,113
we don't know anything, thanks to you-know-who.

42
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:21,513
Of course, even if I knew, I had no intention of sharing it with irresponsible police.

43
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:27,453
So please, let's not run into each other again.

44
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,573
You just...

45
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,983
lost your way?

46
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:47,323
Yeah, that's right. I can't see very well at night.

47
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,943
I was scared for no reason.

48
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:51,563
But you weren't scared for no reason. Right?

49
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,303
There was someone.

50
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,363
He even ran away.

51
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:01,293
Well, I didn't even know there was anyone.

52
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:05,563
For someone who didn't know, wasn't that a very specific reaction?

53
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,483
Don't you remember?

54
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,603
You yelled out earlier that it wasn't you.

55
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:18,123
 No, it's not! It's not me!

56
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:21,123
What's not you?

57
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,553
Has anyone questioned you about anything?

58
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,193
The one who escaped?

59
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,223
Do you know who that was?

60
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:31,723
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

61
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,883
Ms. Lee Joo Young,

62
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:41,533
I know it's hard to believe, but I'm trying to help you right now.

63
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,683
We can only prevent what's to come if you tell me honestly.

64
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:50,453
If you're being chased or threatened by someone, you have to share everything, whatever it is.

65
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:02,373
- Ms. Lee Joo Young. 
 - Thank you...

66
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,043
Thank you for your concern, but...

67
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,413
you have a misunderstanding.

68
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:13,093
I was not chased...

69
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,853
or threatened by anyone ever.

70
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:22,503
My relatives will be worried. Can I head home now, Mr. Yoon?

71
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,863
Wait a minute.

72
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:28,683
All right, you should go home for now.

73
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:30,973
We should go, too, Yoon Young.

74
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:33,393
Then I'll see you at school tomorrow.

75
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,473
But it's dangerous right now...

76
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,223
Let's get some twisted breadsticks you like.

77
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,863
Why are you talking about twisted bread sticks?

78
00:08:55,263 --> 00:09:00,003
You can tell she's hiding something just by looking at her. How can we send her away like that?

79
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:05,603
On top of that, she doesn't seem to realize what's going to happen to her in two days.

80
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:08,603
Wait, but is this the way home?

81
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,050

82
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,330

83
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,823

84
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:40,953
You wanted to make sure she got home all right.

85
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:44,873
In case something else happens that I don't know about.

86
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:47,943
Would there be?

87
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:52,493
If it's according to what I know, nothing else will happen tonight.

88
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,173
But I don't know if it's the right answer.

89
00:09:56,173 --> 00:10:00,203
Since I don't know what you know and what you don't know.

90
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,723
Although you may feel the same.

91
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:07,323
Shall we find out? From now on?

92
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:12,260
Let's go. There's an appropriate place for that.

93
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,000

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500

95
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,543
Raise it together.

96
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:27,263
- Raise it. 
 - This way.

97
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:30,863

98
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,543
To the left. This way. This way.

99
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,033
Here, here. To the left side.

100
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,723
They say the letters fell off last year by lightning.

101
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:39,503
But seeing how they're only fixing it now,

102
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:43,333
you can tell how indifferent and irresponsible the boss is.

103
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,243
So it wasn't spelled with "H."  (ㅎ)

104
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:49,393
That name is already familiar to you.

105
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:52,573
It's like a hometown for those damn matchboxes.

106
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,223
Done. Turn it on.

107
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,493

108
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:57,703
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

109
00:10:57,703 --> 00:11:00,443
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

110
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:06,263
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

111
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:11,673
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

112
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:17,853
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

113
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:23,493
♫  Please hear me out for a little while  ♫

114
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:34,463
♫  Your gaze that is like the starlight has stolen my heart  ♫

115
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:40,683
♫  Your love that is like destiny  ♫

116
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,673
I don't know if you already know, but here...

117
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:52,893
there was a serial murder case in Woojeong Village in 1987.

118
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,443
As you might have guessed, I have been following those cases.

119
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:59,163
Were you a detective?

120
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:09,533
If you happened to watch the news on weekend evenings, you'd recognize me.

121
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,823
Were you a criminal?

122
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:17,363
Perhaps like standing in photo line-ups...

123
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:20,013
Isn't it reasonable to assume I was an anchorman?

124
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,303
Oh, is that it?

125
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:28,933
Oh, you were on television. I don't really watch the news. Sorry.

126
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:33,143
So that's how you viewed me?

127
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:36,553
Oh, no... It's not like that.

128
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,633
I just have various imaginations.

129
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:43,773
As someone living off of you, I also want to be safe.

130
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:48,553
So, because of interviews or something?

131
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:53,453
Well, something like that.

132
00:12:57,283 --> 00:13:01,163
When will the incident take place?

133
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,703
Two days later, on the 14th.

134
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:12,133
And then two days after that, on the 16th.

135
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,373
Two women's lives were lost in total and

136
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:19,113
- on the 20th... 
 - One person disappeared.

137
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:22,413
She left a note, so it was treated as a runaway case.

138
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,833
But she actually died.

139
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,673
What did you say just now?

140
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,033
She died.

141
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,953
There were three victims in total.

142
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:44,033
For more than 30 years, there was no body or any trace whatsoever.

143
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,823
The police, victim, and family all don't know. But how do you...

144
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:52,283
I know it must be hard to believe, but I...

145
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:56,193
just told you what was written here.

146
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:03,003

147
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,963
It's a novel.

148
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,363
Written by Go Mi Sook.

149
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:15,533
 Ms. Go, can't you share a small spoiler from the novel you're currently writing?

150
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,163
 Should I say it's a kind of confession?

151
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,863
 Confession?

152
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:25,173
 The main character...

153
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:30,993
 reveals everything about a perfect crime that someone committed over 30 years ago.

154
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:35,193
 It was kind of a shame to keep something like that

155
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:38,393
 - to himself all his life. 
 - Whoa...

156
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:44,963
 But if it was 30 years ago, it must have taken place around the same time as this.

157
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,863
 This time, I really wanted to tell my story.

158
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,273
 I'm joking. It's all made up.

159
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,703
 I wrote the truth all in there.

160
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:59,683
 Oh, of course. Gosh, Ms. Go...

161
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:07,603
I was the editor in charge of Go Mi Sook's works for a long time.

162
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,293
Go Mi Sook?

163
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:20,503
That's why I had Go Mi Sook's new novel that hasn't been released to the world yet.

164
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,783
I had completely forgotten about it since I came here.

165
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:29,733
But ever since I saw the student teacher, I felt a strange familiarity.

166
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:34,733
So you opened it up again, and the descriptions are the same as the novel?

167
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:40,533
I never imagined she would write about events that actually took place in real life.

168
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,233
Anyway, that's what it said.

169
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:48,103
Starting with that student teacher, three women died, and

170
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:51,763
the real culprit was never caught.

171
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:54,003
There's mention of a real criminal?

172
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:58,483
Check the second page. Last sentence of the last paragraph.

173
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:27,053
"In the end, the truth was never revealed.

174
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,413
The person who made all these deaths happen...

175
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,733
 was me.

176
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,773
 Not even that delightful truth."

177
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,723
Now that you're not here in this house...

178
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:11,813
it feels really good.

179
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,133

180
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,683
Do you really think Go Mi Sook did this?

181
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:49,303
The culprit was never caught in real life, either. Right?

182
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,943
They did catch him.

183
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:55,930
The culprit denied it until the end, but we can't know the truth.

184
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:00,863
 Right. That's why she said that.

185
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,253
 She stole my mom's work for her first novel.

186
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:07,313
 And this was really her story.

187
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:12,143
Then, this could be considered as new evidence.

188
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,143
We can't make that conclusion.

189
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,123
In any case, this is a novel.

190
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:21,583
Even if it's based on true events, you can add to it with more imagination.

191
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,783
And here, when she says "I," there's no guarantee she is talking about herself.

192
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:29,223
But there's no guarantee it's fake, either.

193
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:35,213
You saw it earlier. She even wrote where the missing student teacher was.

194
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:40,453
Someone who knows more than you do.

195
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,693
Wouldn't that be the culprit?

196
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:46,043
Since she lived in the same town,

197
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,213
she could've written down what she heard and saw at the time.

198
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:53,763
Even if I had investigated, those are all official records.

199
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:56,103
Why do you keep saying it's not her?

200
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,463
Why do you keep pushing her to be the culprit?

201
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:09,173
Do you want Go Mi Sook to be the culprit?

202
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,643
You said you knew each other, so why—

203
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,823
That's why I'm suspicious of her.

204
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:21,643
Go Mi Sook that I know is more than capable of doing that.

205
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,913
 What did you just say?

206
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,873
You want to marry me?

207
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,273
What?

208
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,503
When did I...

209
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,483
What? You again?

210
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,663
What? Get married?

211
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,733
You didn't even date each other yet. You're still kids!

212
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,323
No wonder you caused trouble so early on!

213
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,823
When did you even call her out to meet alone?

214
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,363
Yoon Young! What's wrong with you? Why?

215
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:56,143
What trouble did I cause, you dummy? Seriously!

216
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:58,253
I never said anything like that!

217
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,713
You said let's have a son and a daughter and live happily ever after!

218
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,393
What?

219
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:07,583
Soon Ae, do you have a hard time understanding?

220
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,223
When did I say "let's live"? I said I "want to live."

221
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:15,123
You asked me what my dream is, so...

222
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:19,603
I said I would like to have a family!

223
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:24,773
I'm sorry, but I'm already dating someone, so I can't accept your feelings.

224
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,843
- You have what? 
 - What do you have?

225
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,973
Actually, we are supposed to meet in front in a bit.

226
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:33,163
Oh! He's there.

227
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:49,043
That guy is really... your boyfriend?

228
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:57,183
You said Dad was your first love...

229
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:05,523
It's true. That's why I came out to tell you.

230
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:07,403
Then, I'll get going.

231
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:19,073
And I don't like flowers.

232
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:21,273
Have a good evening.

233
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,940

234
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:29,783
Soon Ae!

235
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,773
Shit! Soon Ae!

236
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:33,990

237
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:41,893
You need to explain what I just saw.

238
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:47,863
I was going to tell you eventually.

239
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:49,913
By chance...

240
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,923
is it your family?

241
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,393
Earlier, when they said "a son and a daughter,"

242
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:02,453
I'm the one playing the daughter's role.

243
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,783
 You are the suspect Baek Hee Seop's daughter?

244
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,513
 I'm so scared.

245
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,753
How can I report it?

246
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,253
I cannot get involved with the police!

247
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,253
I don't think I can stay here long, either.

248
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,753
Yeah.

249
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,973
Who could it be that knows who I am?

250
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,203
Oh, okay.

251
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:22,903

252
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,743
I understand you're very flustered.

253
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,803
I felt like that, too.

254
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:40,163
It was crazy enough that I was sent back 30 years after a car accident.

255
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,323
But the man who hit me is a time traveler,

256
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:45,903
my mother's family lives right across from where he lives...

257
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,973
Wow!

258
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,573
So why did you get into school?

259
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:55,633
And why were you behaving that way at the cafe?

260
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,693
That's a bit complicated.

261
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,733
I was trying to separate my mom and dad at the cafe.

262
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,793
What are you trying to separate?

263
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:16,193
I was only trying to make sure Mom and Dad never meet, but

264
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,323
the longer I stayed, it became...

265
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,563
- By chance, are you an idiot? 
 - What?

266
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:24,083
Fine. Let's say everything is a coincidence.

267
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:30,163
Let's say you woke up after a car accident and saw your young parents in front of you.

268
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:33,493
And you thought of separating them?

269
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:38,153
Did you think about what kind of result that would bring? You may disappear—

270
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,890
So what?

271
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,013
What did you say?

272
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,873
So what if that happened?

273
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,323
You think I don't know that?

274
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,773
One small act can completely change another person's future. You told me on the first day I arrived here.

275
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,503
So what if that happened?

276
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,653
You asked me...

277
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,113
what I was doing by that river before I came here, didn't you?

278
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,283
 That day by the river, my mom left us behind.

279
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,613
 I didn't have the right to be resentful.

280
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:35,923
 Because maybe we were the ones who abandoned her first.

281
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,323
 Loving us without receiving love back like a fool.

282
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,510

283
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,113
 She became a name who could be deleted like a fool.

284
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,173
 Maybe one day she suddenly realized it.

285
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,213
 There were too many moments she couldn't turn back.

286
00:25:57,213 --> 00:26:01,293
 It was already too late.

287
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,723
I thought earnestly that day by the river.

288
00:26:05,723 --> 00:26:09,063
If I were given one chance...

289
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,483
It'd be so nice if I could change just one moment in time.

290
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,103
Maybe I just look like an idiot.

291
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,983
But I really don't care what happens to me.

292
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,823
Thinking about the things my mom didn't get to do before she reached that river,

293
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,683
I couldn't bear anything else anyway.

294
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,523
I'm sorry. I wasn't going to tell you all this.

295
00:26:55,523 --> 00:27:00,373
Let's go inside. I think it's best to get some rest tonight.

296
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,403
Yes.

297
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,143
I should have asked him about this.

298
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,463
No way. No way.

299
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:42,613
 That day by the river, my mom left us behind.

300
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,103

301
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,220
 You picked it up, by chance?

302
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,983
 Exactly when and where?

303
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:02,753
 I just saw it floating in this town's river.

304
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,333
 I just picked it up without thinking.

305
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,083
Then, why was that there?

306
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,523

307
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,603

308
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,343
Where did you come from?

309
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,963
There's something you should know.

310
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,370

311
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:37,933
If it's because of what I said last night, don't worry.

312
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,053
That's just my personal situation. I won't interfere with your work.

313
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,543
For me, "Mom" is not a loving name.

314
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:55,420
My so-called mom left

315
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,933
without holding me once after giving birth to me.

316
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:03,363
So I don't really understand a mothers' feelings.

317
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:08,463
I don't know if there's anything special or loving like others talk about.

318
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:11,463
I never really wanted to know.

319
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:14,183
But no matter who it is,

320
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:18,483
I know there's no way the person receiving love wouldn't know.

321
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,513
You love your mom so much to the point where you don't care what happens to you.

322
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,733
Do you think your mom didn't know that?

323
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,473
- What do you mean... 
 - Do you think she chose to do that knowing that?

324
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,200
What are you saying...

325
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,480
Listen carefully.

326
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,303
At the first murder scene tomorrow night, an item familiar to you will show up.

327
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,403

A matchbox.

328
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:13,273
And the note inside.

329
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:20,113
This...

330
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:24,493
The police determined it was an indication that the suspect planted it on purpose at the time.

331
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:29,563
Because the same item was found in the second victim's belongings.

332
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,373
An indication?

333
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:36,443
Then why was this...

334
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:40,363
Why was an item used by the suspect from 34 years ago

335
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:43,803
discovered again in the year 2021?

336
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:51,360
And why, of all places, was it at the river where your mom died?

337
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:55,593
Can't be...

338
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:58,693
There's no definite answer.

339
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:02,653
All right, so let's just say maybe your mom didn't know

340
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,960
about your feelings and sincerity. But what if...

341
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:09,953
What if...

342
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:23,283
your mom ran into someone else by that river that night?

343
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:28,373
And what if it was the culprit who was never caught 34 years ago?

344
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:34,123
Then you're making a mistake right now.

345
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:38,423
You carelessly hated yourself and tried to give up on your life.

346
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:41,093
Aren't you the one who has to save your mom...

347
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,193
until the very end?

348
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:17,243
Yoon Young.

349
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:27,983
You were very surprised yesterday, right? Sorry.

350
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:34,363
I really wasn't trying to deceive you on purpose and meet Baek Hee Seop.

351
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:39,163
 That's right.

352
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,633
 How did I miss this?

353
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:47,323
 I want to play with you forever until I'm an old grandma.

354
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,633
 WIth love, Mom.

355
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:53,003
 That wasn't a suicide note. It was a letter.

356
00:34:53,003 --> 00:35:00,210
 She was making a promise to me that she'd always be by my side as usual.

357
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:05,453
 How could I have misunderstood that?

358
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:07,733
 How did I...

359
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:11,843
 not realize that even until the end?

360
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,453
Yoon Young.

361
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:17,463
Are you that disappointed in me?

362
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:22,573
I'm sorry.

363
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:29,413
Why are you always sorry when I'm the one who didn't understand you?

364
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:33,363
No, no, that's not it. I really didn't know.

365
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:38,383
He had left a note inside the matchbox, asking to meet at Bong Bong Cafe.

366
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,080

367
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,533
Don't worry.

368
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,503
I will make sure...

369
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:55,893
I'll make sure you never experience something terrible like that ever again.

370
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:59,283
No matter what. I will protect you.

371
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:05,563
Thank you, but... is that really that terrible?

372
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,993
I can at least meet to drink juice with him, right?

373
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:13,033
It's not like I'm going to marry Yoo Beom Ryong.

374
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,163
Ji Eun,

375
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:24,743
what are they doing?

376
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:26,243
I don't know.

377
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:30,343
The grades just came out. Maybe Soon Ae's ranking dropped?

378
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,723
- Thank you. 
 - You worked hard.

379
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,593
- Mr. Choi. 
 - Yes.

380
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:47,673
- Take this and go eat something. 
 - Yes, thank you!

381
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,583
Yes.

382
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,433
- Yes. 
 - My son sent this for me from America.

383
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,603
Oh, from America?

384
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,743
- How is it? Doesn't it look luxurious? 
 - Wow, yes!

385
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:00,973
Wow, maybe because it's from America, it seems different!

386
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:03,053
- You can touch it. 
 - Thank you!

387
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,373
 Then you're making a mistake right now.

388
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:10,853
 You carelessly hated yourself and tried to give up on your life.

389
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,793
Geez! My goodness.

390
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:21,853
I didn't have to confront her so harshly. I should've said it nicely.

391
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,043
Oh, gosh.

392
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,683
 Yes, that's right. It's truly a large country.

393
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:28,173
 Since it's a large country, the clothes are large...

394
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,363
 and it looks very good.

395
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:33,853
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

396
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,893
 Why would you throw that out?

397
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:43,923
Ms. Lee, come here.

398
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:48,013
I'll give you these precious gummies that traveled 14 hours in a plane.

399
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,623
- Come over. 
 - Yes.

400
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:55,483
I didn't tell anyone about last night's incident.

401
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:01,623
Bring me some while you're there.

402
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:03,773
Excuse me?

403
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,863
The gummies from America.

404
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:11,873
I will.

405
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:15,433
Thank you.

406
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:19,063
- Isn't that better? 
 - Definitely, American ones are different.

407
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,523
Here, here. Try one.

408
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,803
Thank you.

409
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,453
- Wow, look at that. 
 - Is that maybe...

410
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,933
- What's the rank? 
 - Let me see.

411
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,583

412
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:34,633

First place?

413
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:36,663
First place.

414
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:41,683
Oh, my gosh!

415
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:44,123
You did this well in school?

416
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:47,473
Gosh, I'm so proud of you!

417
00:38:48,323 --> 00:38:52,363
How do you place first? Wow, first place!

418
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,693
First place in the entire grade! First place in the entire grade!

419
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:58,923
- First place in the entire grade! 
 - Oh, yeah!

420
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:03,033
Oh my gosh! What happened?

421
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,963
First place!

422
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:19,853
Hey.

423
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:28,273

424
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:31,143
I'm so proud of you!

425
00:39:33,513 --> 00:39:36,323
Wow! What is this?

426
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,883
People who didn't do well would be too sad to go on.

427
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:50,123
Hey, move.

428
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,100

429
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,523
You pretended as if you did badly on your exam.

430
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:07,323
Lee Soon Ae always does this, though, doesn't she?

431
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,863
Are you that happy?

432
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:11,393
Do you want me to write it huge on your forehead?

433
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:12,683
Are you crazy...

434
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:15,083
You crazy Kim Hae Kyeong!

435
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:19,473
- Oh, geez. 
 - Hey, let's go.

436
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,093
Kim Hae Kyeong!

437
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,253
Hurry up and go inside!

438
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,913
Let's go.

439
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:39,763
 Bring it back!

440
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:52,683
This school, interestingly... must post only the lower rankings.

441
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:06,223
Why would she like that punk?

442
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,383
What does she see in him?

443
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:16,483
Oh, I see.

444
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:20,953
So this is how the equation works.

445
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:23,063
This is so fun!

446
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,823
 The last place in the entire grade, Yoo Beom Ryong!

447
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,533
 Please get a hold of yourself!

448
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,148
Oh, geez.

449
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:34,538
What do I do with this idiot?

450
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:38,723
What's wrong?

451
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:45,843
Good god!

452
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:51,753
No, it's nothing. That's fine.

453
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,643
I don't want to lose our friendship.

454
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,803
No way.

455
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,703
Things didn't go well yesterday?

456
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,393
Even the flower I gave you didn't work?

457
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:10,303
 What's that?

458
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,963
 Why did you go through so much to pick those?

459
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:16,313
 The bought ones are much prettier.

460
00:42:16,313 --> 00:42:19,143
 Gosh! Seriously.

461
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:22,533
 Take it.

462
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:27,543
 Girls don't like ones that look pathetic.

463
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,093
 Is that so?

464
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:37,673
 But you're really not going to tell me who you're confessing to?

465
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:45,133
 I said I'll tell you if it goes well!

466
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,913
 Okay. Fighting!

467
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:48,763
 Thank you.

468
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:52,773
 Hee Seop. Fighting.

469
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,603
Never mind the flower.

470
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:58,743
So what about you?

471
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:04,843
Did your girlfriend like it?

472
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:10,733
Of course! She always says she doesn't like them, but that means she likes them!

473
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,193
Just being coy.

474
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:16,153
If she says she doesn't like it, it means she doesn't like it.

475
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:21,273
But didn't you say you're giving her only one?

476
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:24,173
And you gave me one. What did you do with the other one?

477
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:27,573
Oh, that?

478
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:33,443
Well, I used it... for something good.

479
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,333
Hello.

480
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:28,613
 Why are you saying it's not Go Mi Sook?

481
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:37,123
 What if the suspect from this time commits another crime 34 years later

482
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:40,303
 and that was the reason my mom died?

483
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:44,083
 Then I think the more the reason it could be Go Mi Sook.

484
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,933
 Yes, that is more than likely.

485
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:52,683
 But then, who is the man who ran away after sneaking a look at the student teacher?

486
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:57,713
 I think that's the guy I've been waiting for.

487
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:03,503
 I've been waiting, thinking the answer lies in Lee Joo Young's route.

488
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:06,750
 Lee Joo Young's movement on the night she was murdered.

489
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,120
​

490
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:13,703
 That night, Lee Joo Young left the school at 10:00 p.m.

491
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:19,093

492
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:25,403
 She went straight to the Bong Bong Cafe we went to last night.

493
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,883
Welcome.

494
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:46,633
 She came out at 10:30 p.m. after spending 20 minutes inside.

495
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:51,083
 The next destination was, of course, Motel Woojeong.

496
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:05,153
 But that night, Lee Joo Young did not arrive at the motel.

497
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,770

498
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,573

499
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:18,833

500
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:25,363
 Even at a slow pace, it only takes three minutes from the cafe to the motel.

501
00:46:25,363 --> 00:46:28,103
 She disappeared within that short distance.

502
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:31,063
 Until she was found dead the next day.

503
00:46:31,063 --> 00:46:35,003
 The suspect was not there within that short distance?

504
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:38,843
 No one saw who she ran into within that distance.

505
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:42,983
 That's why I plan to see that for myself tomorrow.

506
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:47,193
 Same time, same place, and same route.

507
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:49,813
 I'll be right behind Lee Joo Young.

508
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:53,523
 Then I would see that man in the blue cap again.

509
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:55,163
 Blue cap?

510
00:46:55,163 --> 00:47:01,153
 The only person Lee Joo Young met during the 20 minutes in the cafe.

511
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,250

512
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:16,693
 She was arguing with someone?

513
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:23,563
 He was a very suspicious character, but the police weren't able to figure it out in the end.

514
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:28,523
 But the guy I followed last night had a blue cap on.

515
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:37,393
 I'm not saying I'm completely eliminating Go Mi Sook.

516
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:40,163
 I'm going to fully consider and watch her.

517
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:44,693
 But it's too early to say anything about Go Mi Sook.

518
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:50,373
 I will definitely catch them here.

519
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:58,243
 That person will not be able to kill anyone both in the years 1987 and 2021.

520
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,763
 That's why I came here.

521
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:05,483
 So just have a little faith in me and wait.

522
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,010

523
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:30,983
That Yoo Beom Ryong, I said I don't like it...

524
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:41,410

525
00:48:44,113 --> 00:48:46,653
I'll just check if she gets home safe.

526
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:47,833
Should I go with you?

527
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,673
It's something I should do. It's no big deal.

528
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:54,963
And... take this.

529
00:48:54,963 --> 00:48:59,103
Don't go alone. Go with your mom and uncle.

530
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,420

531
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,323
Yoon Young, let's go together.

532
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:10,413
Wow, these are American gummies!

533
00:49:24,973 --> 00:49:26,403
 You have a misunderstanding.

534
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:30,443
 I was not chased or threatened by anyone ever.

535
00:49:30,443 --> 00:49:34,333
 Her face said she was definitely hiding something.

536
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,943
 Let's get some twisted bread sticks you like.

537
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:42,233
 He knew I was following and deliberately made me hear that.

538
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:47,183
 As though he knew that woman would be in danger.

539
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:50,633
Where are you going, Hyungnim?

540
00:49:54,013 --> 00:49:55,713
Hey, Baek Dong Shik!

541
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:58,613
Where are you going by yourself?

542
00:50:02,143 --> 00:50:04,493
Yes, there's something I wanted to check.

543
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:06,253
What are you trying to check?

544
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:11,163
If you'd bring a scoundrel like the hospital director's son again, please stop. Okay?

545
00:50:11,163 --> 00:50:13,533
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

546
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,863
There's a new student teacher at Woojeong High, but her situation is a little strange.

547
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,013
I'll go check it out.

548
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,513
Hey!

549
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:23,383
What's strange?

550
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:27,483
You didn't know who she was, Hyungnim?

551
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:31,603

552
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:48,230

553
00:50:56,963 --> 00:51:00,043
 That student teacher has three prior convictions.

554
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:05,793
We were all pretending not to know. But she's no ordinary person.

555
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,473
It's going to be tonight.

556
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,043
If there's no other variable, it will be tonight.

557
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,973
Is there really nothing I can help with?

558
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:24,833
This is related to me, too. I can do anything.

559
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,713
I'm used to doing things on my own.

560
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:39,593
What if there is a variable?

561
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:41,813
You go ahead.

562
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,333
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

563
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,063
- Hello. 
  - Hello.

564
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:53,183
Don't forget your name tags.

565
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:56,643
 - Hello. 
 - Over there.

566
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:59,203
 - Hello. 
 - Hello.

567
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:25,773
I just asked you what's going on.

568
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:29,233
I also told you to move.

569
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:39,313
I wanted to give you a chance to do your part with the little conscience you have left.

570
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:42,493
But you didn't come here to help Lee Joo Young, did you?

571
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:49,023
You want me to help someone like that?

572
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:54,963
Mr. Yoon, you could have been killed because of that woman.

573
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,663
Did you know that?

574
00:52:58,203 --> 00:53:00,703
Hey! Go get her! Don't let her get away.

575
00:53:00,703 --> 00:53:03,443
- Yes! 
 - Let's go.

576
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,583
Oh, my gosh. My foot.

577
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,733
How is she so fast?

578
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,933
I should have exercised more.

579
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:44,983
Dad, they really said they'd make me Miss Korea if I just paid 500,000 won!

580
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:49,703
What kind of crazy talk is that!

581
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:55,043
Even if you donate 5 million won, there's no way you can be Miss Korea, dummy!

582
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:58,643
W-Why? What's wrong with me?

583
00:53:58,643 --> 00:54:03,033
Dad, I'm Woojeong Village's Kim Wan Sun. 
  (Popular, sexy Korean pop singer from the mid-80s to 90s)

584
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,643
I look the same, don't I?

585
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:06,503
What?

586
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,853
Even the melon is laughing!

587
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:17,273
So annoying!

588
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:20,633
Which is the fastest bus to Seoul?

589
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,223
It will be here in five minutes.

590
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:24,393
- Please give me a token. 
 - Token?

591
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:26,593
Wait a bit.

592
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,633
- Hurry, please. 
 - Why is everyone sweating early in the day?

593
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:33,393
What?

594
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:38,143
Shit. Just a moment!

595
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:39,993
Hey, catch her!

596
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:42,803
How dare that ugly weasel orders me around!

597
00:54:42,803 --> 00:54:45,383
But since I saw you once before, I'll listen to you, wench!

598
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,063
- Oh, gosh. 
 - Let go!

599
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:49,323
- Let go! 
 - Hey, Ms. Lee.

600
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:51,213
- Let go! 
 - Wait a minute.

601
00:54:51,213 --> 00:54:53,163
Let go!

602
00:54:55,453 --> 00:55:01,343
I don't know why you're doing this, but you have to stay here tonight. Okay?

603
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,763
That's how we can catch him.

604
00:55:04,553 --> 00:55:06,483
Probably so.

605
00:55:09,813 --> 00:55:12,013
That Korean teacher is coming, too!

606
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,883
- It was you guys. 
 - Lee Joo Young.

607
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:26,023
You think I didn't know you were watching me every night outside my motel?

608
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:30,903
Even finding me below the bridge that night wasn't a coincidence!

609
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:34,203
You were planning to hand me over to the police from the start!

610
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:36,303
You have a misunderstanding.

611
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:39,463
Please calm down and put down the knife.

612
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:41,883
I can't trust anyone.

613
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,483
You dirty little moles!

614
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:45,593
Please, believe me!

615
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:50,193
We are trying to help you, Lee Joo Young!

616
00:55:57,473 --> 00:55:58,923
Let me go!

617
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,753
Let go!

618
00:56:00,753 --> 00:56:03,623
Lee Joo Young, please!

619
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:08,673
The police are on their way, so please lower your voice.

620
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:11,943
Isn't there anywhere we can hide?

621
00:56:11,943 --> 00:56:14,283
Oh, yes! In here!

622
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:16,313
Go, go.

623
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,563
Are you all right? You're not hurt anywhere?

624
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:36,593
I'm okay.

625
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,593
Is everything going to be okay?

626
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:40,243
Yes.

627
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:48,983
Well, the bus already left, and I don't know who you're talking about.

628
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:54,993
Yeah. We were here talking about Miss Korea the whole time.

629
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:59,263
Hello!

630
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:02,603
I told you, you can't be Miss Korea!

631
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:07,103
Dad, I told you I'm Woojeong Village's Kim Wan Sun.

632
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,950
- Let's try the motel again. 
 - Yes.

633
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,770
Yes, sir.

634
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:22,303
Your dad peeled it for you, little wench!

635
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:24,373
Geez!

636
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,663
It's all because of me.

637
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:37,223
An unexpected occurrence happened because of my wrong judgment.

638
00:57:38,143 --> 00:57:43,473
In any case, it will be dangerous to send her to the cafe tonight.

639
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:47,993
Yes, let's take her somewhere safe for now.

640
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:58,963
I thought I was alone...

641
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:03,863
and I was so scared.

642
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:06,843
I'm sorry.

643
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:09,353
I'm sorry.

644
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,603
 Will you really be okay going alone?

645
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:28,783
 I'm only going to see his face and come back.

646
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:32,683

647
00:58:54,453 --> 00:58:59,243
 If luck is on my side, even if Lee Joo Young is not there,

648
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:03,723
 he may appear at the same time and same place.

649
00:59:27,603 --> 00:59:30,993

650
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:40,673
 If luck is on your side, please look at the face carefully.

651
00:59:40,673 --> 00:59:47,033
 That person will be the suspect who kills my mom 34 years later.

652
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:12,193
This is nuts.

653
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:20,630

654
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:24,593
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

655
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:27,433
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

656
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:32,773
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

657
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:38,433
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

658
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:42,963
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

659
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:44,833

660
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:48,053
 The mysterious man in the blue cap, one of the suspects.

661
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:52,533
 Baek Hee Seop, the one most likely the culprit whose route matches.

662
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:58,523
 If the one with the blue cap really is the suspect, it means he killed her mother and his wife.

663
01:01:58,523 --> 01:02:01,633
 - The blue cap is your-
- I know.

664
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,373
 I saw him myself.

665
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:05,923
 I never thought he was that kind of a person.

666
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,723
 He's just one of the suspects.

667
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:10,516
 Are you saying my dad is the one with the blue cap?

668
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:12,466
 What did you say?

669
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,493

No way.

670
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:20,743
How could this be...

671
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:28,933
How could you do something like that and just...

672
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:32,603
Don't come near me!

673
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,993
Don't come any closer!

674
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:47,583
