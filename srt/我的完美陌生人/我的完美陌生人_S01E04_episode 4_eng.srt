1
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,900

2
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,577

3
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,318

Who are you?

4
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,698
And why are you here?

5
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,448
What does that mean...

6
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,948

7
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,558
How do you have this?

8
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:15,548
I just happened to pick it up off the floor.

9
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,251
It's a pity if you were trying to hide it.

10
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:22,301
Why would I need to hide something you picked up?

11
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:27,538
No, I mean, I picked it up here.

12
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,378
I happened to pick it up, too, by chance.

13
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,948
You picked that up by chance?

14
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,378
Exactly when and where?

15
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,058
Before it dropped here...

16
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:45,468
I mean, an hour before we met.

17
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:48,498
By the river in this town.

18
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:51,228
I kept it without thinking much about it.

19
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:54,128
River?

20
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:57,908
What were you doing there at that time?

21
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,628
At that place...

22
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:06,758

23
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,530

24
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,348
There...

25
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,438
You can't tell me that, either?

26
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:43,648
Like how you can't explain why you had to meet Go Min Soo?

27
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:50,518
There were some things I wanted to ask him.

28
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:55,728
This is all I can tell you right now.

29
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,528
All right.

30
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:05,718
Then that's all we can discuss now.

31
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,338
I don't think you answered my question, though.

32
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:18,838
I asked how you found me, but you responded only by

33
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,028
giving me this.

34
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,638
What is this?

35
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,768
What exactly is this?

36
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,718
It's what made me come all the way here.

37
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,678
And what I will need to keep looking for.

38
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:37,758
The reason and result behind all these situations.

39
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:42,508
That's all I can tell you for now.

40
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:48,448
Regretfully, it seems we still can't be open with each other.

41
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,998
Yeah, it seems that way.

42
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,638
 May 11th, 1987.

43
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:25,448
 Three days before the first murder takes place.

44
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,128
 At such an important point in time,

45
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,628
 the past that I knew was changing.

46
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:38,978
 An incident that never occurred happened.

47
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,078
 The prime suspect. No, actually,

48
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:47,058
 the one identified as the culprit, Go Min Soo,

49
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:49,438
 was already arrested by the police.

50
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:51,838
 Then what's happening now?

51
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,838
 You picked this up?

52
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,078
 This, by chance?

53
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:59,488

54
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:02,818
 What exactly is she hiding...

55
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,848
 that she's making that face?

56
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:14,088

57
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,168
This is all we can tell you.

58
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,708
All right for now.

59
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,128
You can go home now.

60
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,790

61
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:38,978
He's not opening his mouth at all.

62
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,808
That's good news.

63
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,578
Since he's dragging out time on his own.

64
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:45,818
What does that mean?

65
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:53,718
Guys like him should stay in there as long as possible for this town to be safe.

66
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,418
You never know what else he might do. Right?

67
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:16,998
So continue to not say or do anything like that.

68
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:22,898
Stay in there, just breathing and enduring quietly for just one more week.

69
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:29,078
If nothing else happens until then, it will become certain that you committed the murders.

70
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:33,288
Otherwise, your innocence will be proven.

71
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,188
Murder?

72
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:38,188
What the hell are you saying?

73
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:40,988
Be quiet, you punk!

74
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:47,218
Thank you for your service, Detective.

75
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,798
What exactly is this?

76
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:26,228
No, it's okay.

77
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:30,158
It's all over now. It's okay.

78
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,778
I really don't have an appetite.

79
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,068
You've not eaten anything.

80
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,818
You have to eat something to sleep well.

81
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,958
We don't have a relationship where we eat together...

82
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,638

83
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,778

84
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:56,568
Did he mean drinking coffee on an empty stomach?

85
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,058

86
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,018
It's called Ha Ha?

87
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:03,708
How unusual.

88
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,030

89
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,568
Excuse me.

90
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:16,498
Could you close 30 minutes later than usual, please?

91
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:19,078
Since all the restaurants are closed.

92
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,748
I can't let you starve your date.

93
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:29,008
What, who said...

94
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,328
Geez.

95
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:48,688
Here.

96
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,838
What kind of cafe sells these?

97
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,618
It's up to the owner.

98
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:57,628
She's an unusual person. Open-minded, too.

99
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:03,558
But during this period, did they dip this in soy sauce?

100
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,988
Well, I guess...

101
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,748
since they didn't have anything salty.

102
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:15,918
At least, just try it. See how the pastries are here.

103
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:24,878
Well, I really don't have an appetite, but since you already bought them...

104
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:56,098
Do you really like sweet and salty that much?

105
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,618
Don't you know it's a requirement for modern people?

106
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,788
Getting off work as the sun rises to meet a deadline for a whole month.

107
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:07,308
When I want to rest on the weekends, the writer calls you out to

108
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:10,358
complain about her fountain pen ink.

109
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:14,088
While I'm losing my will to live,

110
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:19,058
these sweet and salty things save me.

111
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,818
You worked at a publishing company?

112
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,668
An editor?

113
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,128
What about you?

114
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,048
Jobless.

115
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,638
That's right.

116
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,888
There's no way you would tell me.

117
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:37,838
Once again, only I have told the truth.

118
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,468
That's not entirely true.

119
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,398
Oh, my gosh, this is the worst!

120
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,018
I'm sorry.

121
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,818
There's no need to apologize. We just have different tastes.

122
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:18,478
I had agreed not to make your life difficult.

123
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:24,198
You had to go down to the police station because of me.

124
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,868
I'm really sorry.

125
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:36,518
This isn't a problem you created.

126
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,978
Whether you had things to ask or there was another problem,

127
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:43,108
even if you had followed Go Min Soo for another reason,

128
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:46,278
something like that should never have happened.

129
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,218
He caused this problem. Not you.

130
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:58,218
So there's no need to apologize and don't be afraid.

131
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:03,698
I'll make sure nothing like that happens again.

132
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:13,058
I'll fix the light soon. Okay?

133
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:40,848

134
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,198
Will you be able to run?

135
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,988
Of course.

136
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:55,938
♫  One day, by your side  ♫

137
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:01,780
♫  If a long, long night falls on you  ♫

138
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,100

139
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:11,208
♫  Without saying a word, I'll sit close to you  ♫

140
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:16,108
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

141
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:24,608
♫  When everything seems far away  ♫

142
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,518
♫  When it feel so empty  ♫

143
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,158
Are they crazy?

144
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,910
Why dip the twisted bread stick in soy sauce?

145
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,198
M-Mom.

146
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:52,998
Go inside and clean up quietly.

147
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:56,138
And don't tell anyone.

148
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,648
Yes.

149
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,008

150
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,758

151
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:56,658
What could be the story?

152
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,118
 Something came up, so I'm leaving first.

153
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:27,708
 Eat your breakfast, take your lunch box, and go to Soon Ae's house in front.

154
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,168
 I told them already, so they'll know.

155
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,018
 Make sure you apply ointment on your cut.

156
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,368
 You don't need to do the dishes so just put the dishes in the sink.

157
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,248
 Absolutely don't be late for school.

158
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:40,368
He sounds just like Mom.

159
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,158

160
00:17:56,638 --> 00:18:00,618
♫  All the loving memories  ♫

161
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,598
Mom!

162
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,238
- Mom! 
 - What?

163
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:05,878
Didn't you see my sparkly stockings?

164
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,788
I'll be late to the hair salon.

165
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,618
Geez, you flip out at night drunk.

166
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:11,908
During the day, you flip out for no reason.

167
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,098
I need to make Oh Bok's fried egg, too.

168
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,458
- Ok Ja! 
 - Yeah?

169
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,518
How come all the socks have holes?

170
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:21,148
You didn't grab them from the closet but from the basket, right?

171
00:18:21,148 --> 00:18:25,098
I told you that's where I keep the sewn socks. Why do you always...

172
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,958
Mom! There's no toilet paper!

173
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,338
Oh, yeah, okay. Toilet paper. Here!

174
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,258
Mom, my stocking first.

175
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,398
Oh, what did I do with my wallet?

176
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,648
Right. I changed my pants, too. Where's my wallet?

177
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:40,098
I didn't see it.

178
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,528
- Are the fried eggs ready, Mom? 
 - Huh? Fried...

179
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:44,248
Oh, my gosh.

180
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,898
How can the kimbap have no taste?

181
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,858
- I know. 
 - What did she put in it?

182
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:52,264
- Just eat it, Dad. This isn't the first time. 
 - You eat it, too.

183
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:57,120
♫  And shine on you only  ♫

184
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800

185
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,258
Geez!

186
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,968
That stupid book, book, book!

187
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,178
You know?

188
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:18,268
You could've folded all this and made fried eggs for your brother instead of doing this!

189
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:23,288
Here! Stop folding... and go make Oh Bok's fried eggs.

190
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,061
Hurry!

191
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,598
Yes.

192
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,758
Is anyone home?

193
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:46,518
I'm going now!

194
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:57,088
By chance, are you Oh Bok?

195
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,768
What is this?

196
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:04,398
 It's me, Uncle. Yoon Young.

197
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,718
What's going on?

198
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:12,768
Goodness, who are you? And why are you at someone else's house staring?

199
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,258
 Grandpa?

200
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,898
 It's me, Yoon Young.

201
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,598
Geez, I won't have time to change my socks at this rate!

202
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,618
Hurry up and bring my socks!

203
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,798
- Ok Ja! 
  - Coming, coming...

204
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,558
Stop calling me! Stop calling!

205
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:58,988
Geez...

206
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,208
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

207
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:08,888
The matchbox you had in the hallway yesterday. Give it to me.

208
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,318
Oh, you.

209
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:17,848
Who are you? You're so pretty.

210
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,718
- Mom! 
 - What do you mean, pretty?

211
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,908
She looks like a drowning weasel.

212
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,328
Aren't you going to be late? Just be quiet and go.

213
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,938
You little drunkard!

214
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,968
All right!

215
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:33,878
What?

216
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:37,728
Hey, wait up!

217
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:40,328
- See you later. 
 - Bye.

218
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:45,708
Are you Mr. Yoon's in-laws' third cousin's...

219
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,588
Oh, are you Mr. Yoon's relative?

220
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:50,568
Why didn't you say so earlier?

221
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:51,768
Nice to meet you!

222
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,718
Is it because you resemble Mr. Yoon?

223
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:57,668
You look smart. You look smart!

224
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:06,528
Mr. Yoon said since he can't go with you, he earnestly requested that you go with Soon Ae.

225
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,668
Here. While making lunches for everyone, I made yours and Mr. Yoon's, too.

226
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,858
Take it and enjoy it.

227
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,628
- Oh, I have mine too. 
 - Gosh...

228
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:16,998
That's that, and this is this.

229
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:19,168
Make sure you chew your food well.

230
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:22,548
And come by whenever you want to eat more.

231
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:26,318
Oh, my gosh. Come over often, dear.

232
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:28,918
Okay. Thank you.

233
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,048
My goodness...

234
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,028
My gosh...

235
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,578

236
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:43,368
- Love letter? 
 - Yes!

237
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:48,378
You're supposed to put a note inside it and give it to a girl you like or are interested in.

238
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:51,028
I'm sure the kids in other classes all have one.

239
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:54,838
Because it's a trend at our school these days.

240
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,488
Things became more complicated because of that damn trend.

241
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:01,818
What?

242
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,928
Love?

243
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,448
What do you love?

244
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,118
When did you see her to say it's love?

245
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:12,908
I have a different one for the transfer student. That's for someone else.

246
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:16,918
If there's someone else, why are you giving her one, too?

247
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,688
Why are you dodging? Dodging?

248
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,008
Fine! I won't give it to her then!

249
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,698
Why are you hitting me?

250
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:24,668
Get back here!

251
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:32,458
 What do I do?

252
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,798
 What's taking so long?

253
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:59,998
Okay, I'll be right there.

254
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:31,488
 At the time, the decisive reason Yoo Beom Ryong became a suspect was

255
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,838
 because of the things he kept hidden.

256
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:19,658
You don't have anything yet. Is that it?

257
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:38,168
What's this?

258
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:43,518
I'm sorry about yesterday.

259
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:49,318
You were just trying to help me, but I spoke too harshly.

260
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:54,058
It bothered me, so I couldn't sleep all night.

261
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:56,248
That's why.

262
00:25:56,248 --> 00:26:00,718
You always wrote letters like this even though you'd end up telling me about it.

263
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,518
You used to do that every time we fought from a long time ago.

264
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:06,108
I did?

265
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:08,508
When?

266
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:13,838
Oh, I meant my mom.

267
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,998
I suddenly thought of her.

268
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,838
She must have really liked writing.

269
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:25,938
I guess so.

270
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:36,268
I'm only realizing now... that must've been the reason.

271
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,658
 - Hello.  
 - Hi.

272
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:51,508
Second skull?

273
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,878
Mr. Yoon, yes.

274
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:58,688
That matchbox you're holding. Hand it over.

275
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,308
Excuse me?

276
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:04,518
I have a matchbox in my school bag? Where?

277
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:09,788
Geez, you can't just search through someone's bag.

278
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:14,238
Oh, my gosh! It's really in there.

279
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:18,198
You couldn't have known the trend at this school since you transferred yesterday.

280
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:21,798
So, what's this cafe matchbox doing in a student's bag?

281
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:25,078
What is it?

282
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,558
Oh, yeah! That's it!

283
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,938
On Sunday, my hyung came and let me have a taste of coffee.

284
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:34,838
So we went to a cafe in town and built a tower with these.

285
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:37,688
It was so much fun! And he also...

286
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,798
You still have the lock?

287
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:42,018
Yes, of course.

288
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:45,368
L-Lock?

289
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,138
Why is your bag so light?

290
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:50,928
Then would I bring books to a picnic?

291
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:54,118
Your aunt didn't pack you lunch?

292
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:55,788
Oh, no. It's not like that.

293
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:59,708
She packed me lunch, but I just forgot to bring it.

294
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,828
Tell the kids to look for my bag.

295
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,558
Since I searched your bag, you can search mine.

296
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,071
You can have the lunch box that's in my bag.

297
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:09,281
Buy a drink for yourself...

298
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:17,448
Buy some for kids in the next class, too.

299
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,638
I'm sending you on an errand.

300
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,148
Yes.

301
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:29,108
There was a fire in Rochester's room so Jane put it out with the water bucket.

302
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:33,238
Then he held her hand like this and said, "You saved my life."

303
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,928
So how could I not read what follows next?

304
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:40,268
That's how I got hit by my mom in the end.

305
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:43,628
But you were reading. What's wrong with that?

306
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:46,218
She doesn't like me reading books.

307
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:51,298
She says that I'm into useless things, wasting my time instead of doing housework.

308
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,118
Oh, gosh.

309
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:59,658
I would love to read as many books as I'd like, listen to all the music, and sip on hot coffee.

310
00:28:59,658 --> 00:29:01,778
I'd love to live like that.

311
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:07,148
 In the end,

312
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:09,758
 Mom's dream came true.

313
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,718
 Through me.

314
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,758
 What?

315
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:29,688
 I'm just happy.

316
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,238
 If you're finished, give me the cup.

317
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:33,198
 I can do it when I'm done.

318
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,398
 Just give it to me. I'll do stuff like this.

319
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,488
 My daughter should just read as much as she wants.

320
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:50,758
♫  I wish that my heart could reach you  ♫

321
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:55,368
♫  No longer, no longer, no longer selfishly  ♫

322
00:29:55,368 --> 00:30:02,728
♫  I will be able to look at you  ♫

323
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:04,528
 Why?

324
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:06,588
 Gosh...

325
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:11,508
 Oh, just... I was just curious about what you were listening to.

326
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,048
 Give it to me. I'll do it.

327
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,378
 Goodness! It's all right.

328
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:21,638
 When you get married later, you'll do it until you get sick of it.

329
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:25,438
 I won't disturb you. Just keep listening.

330
00:30:25,438 --> 00:30:27,108
 Geez, talking about marriage.

331
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:29,558
 I keep telling you I won't get married.

332
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:32,718
 Mom...

333
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:38,518
 had given me the time that wasn't given to her.

334
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:42,688
What are you doing?

335
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,438
 Now, I'll return them to you, Mom.

336
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:51,288
 The time you lost and everything you gave up.

337
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:54,938
 I will make sure to return everything to you.

338
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,688
We're going to be late! We have to run!

339
00:30:58,688 --> 00:31:01,228
But why are you going that way? Isn't school this way?

340
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:05,978
Didn't you hear at the end of class yesterday? We're going on a picnic today.

341
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:14,938
Oh, yeah.

342
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,568
Wait for me!

343
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,478
- Kim Hae Kyeong. 
 - Yes.

344
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,548
- Lee Eun Ha. 
 - Yes.

345
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,468
- Park Yoo Ri. 
 - Yes.

346
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:24,558
- Seo Ji Yoon. 
 - Yes.

347
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,258
- Yoon Young. 
 - Yes.

348
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:28,818
- Won Soo Kyeong. 
 - Yes.

349
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:30,658
- Dae Kyeon. 
 - Geez.

350
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,750
Geez.

351
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,788
Mr. Yoon.

352
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:41,128
- Mr. Yoon. 
 - Yes, what?

353
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:43,498
Why are you standing here like this?

354
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:46,088
Aren't you checking the kids in your class?

355
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:48,208
Look! Just look at them!

356
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,728
- Let's go! 
 - I got it!

357
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:56,648
Just look at them! What a mess!

358
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,528
Those who don't study always make a fuss.

359
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:04,568
I clearly wrote down not to be late, and... she's making me nervous!

360
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:07,058
Wait! Why are you going that way?

361
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,178
Hey, you!

362
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,768
 Do it lightly!

363
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:21,558
Man, why did the principal put our classes together?

364
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:23,778
Geez!

365
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:29,588
Cotton candies, get away from them! You punks.

366
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,058
Seon Jeong Sook!

367
00:32:56,918 --> 00:33:02,318
How does the second skull know that I'm friends with the padlock?

368
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:35,768
♫  Susan, the chilly winds are blowing  ♫

369
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:42,058
♫  Susan, as dusk approaches  ♫

370
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:44,898
♫  Where are you right now, all lonely?  ♫

371
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,768
Soon Ae!

372
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:49,868
At the bus terminal?

373
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:54,908
♫  Why don't you come to me?  ♫

374
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,348
Seeing as we meet here again, destiny must be...

375
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,938
Cut the crap about destiny!

376
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,308
Soon Ae, listen carefully.

377
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:16,298
This... This is what you call a real waste of time.

378
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,088
What kind of bullshit is this?

379
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:23,828
This guy will not... help your life in any way in the future.

380
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,998
She seems really tired.

381
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,848
Should we go ahead first?

382
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,208
Oh, yeah. But...

383
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,058
Where do you think you're going?

384
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:36,038
She's having a hard time, so she should rest.

385
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:38,928
Come after you rest awhile.

386
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,068
Hey!

387
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:45,338
Hey! Soon Ae!

388
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:46,978
Soon Ae!

389
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:48,858
Geez!

390
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,158
Oh, my gosh!

391
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:13,118
Because the sky is so beautiful.

392
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,348
- Geez. 
 - Oh, gosh.

393
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:30,168
Why are there so many uphills? Why have a picnic in a place like this?

394
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:35,648
It's a very difficult trail for someone born in 1965.

395
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:42,158
There, there! When it's time to play, you should just play.

396
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:47,398
You shouldn't be worrying about your college exams here and secretly looking through your textbooks.

397
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:50,958
- Hey, Beom Ryong! 
 - Beom Ryong!

398
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:55,398
Okay, okay. Play as much as you want today.

399
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,328
On one condition. Just within this area.

400
00:35:57,328 --> 00:35:59,698
- You got that? 
  - Yes!

401
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:02,148
Activity Moderator, come out.

402
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:05,328
Now, now! Hey, guys! You know who I am. Right?

403
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:08,368
 - Yes, we do!  
 - What's the highlight of a picnic?

404
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:12,028
 - Talent show!  
 - That's right. We'll have a talent show.

405
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:16,108
At this critical time, how did you bring something so valuable?

406
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:20,068
I stole it, especially for you. It's my dad's.

407
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,908
- Hey. 
 - But could you do it?

408
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:27,298
You said you've never even touched a real guitar.

409
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,908
I've practiced like this many times before, so I'm just going for it!

410
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,468
No, no!

411
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:42,078
Wouldn't it be better to practice a little bit first?

412
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:46,128
You might make a fool out of yourself in front of the girls!

413
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:50,448
That's right. We will have a talent show. Applause!

414
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:54,258
All right. Who wants to go first?

415
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,908
No one?

416
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:59,708
Geez, is this all we have in our class?

417
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:05,428
I practiced until I got sick of it.

418
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:12,228
All right, if you play while others are playing, you fall behind.

419
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:15,378
 - Oh, come on!  
 - You guys are in 12th grade!

420
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:20,248
Don't get excited and always think about your exams.

421
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:29,838
Look over here! I was talking!

422
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,538
Always think about your exams.

423
00:37:31,538 --> 00:37:33,438
- Teacher, could you please be quiet? 
 - What?

424
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:35,148
We can't hear the music.

425
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:36,738
- Yes! 
 - Let's go!

426
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,268
- Come, let's go! 
 - Let's go together!

427
00:37:39,268 --> 00:37:41,058
- Me too, me too. 
 - Let's see!

428
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:45,198
What a mess.

429
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:49,508
So nothing really happened?

430
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,578
Yeah, that's right.

431
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:53,918
We said like two words.

432
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,648
We ran into our teacher.

433
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,078
He got dragged away by his ears.

434
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,348
What were those two words?

435
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:05,338
He just asked me what kind of guy I like.

436
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:08,508
So I said someone who sings well.

437
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,138
Let's go.

438
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,798
Oh, hey!

439
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,098
- It's okay, Hee Seop! 
 - Fighting!

440
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:21,188
He knew how to play the guitar?

 May 12th. Two days before the first incident occurs.

455
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:22,948
 One of the three suspects is already arrested by the police.

456
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:28,078
 The other two don't have anything standing out in particular.

457
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:31,398
 The mark of the suspect, the matchbox,

458
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:33,688
 can be found anywhere.

459
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:36,508
Gosh. It's driving me crazy.

460
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:45,168
 Just when everything was swept into a foggy state,

461
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:48,748
 she arrived.

462
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:55,318
 The woman who was the first victim of the Woojeong Village serial murder case.

463
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:02,408
 Do you remember these people?

464
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:05,368

465
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:24,278
- Hello, Principal. 
 - Hi.

466
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:27,018
Everyone, hurry up and get up!

467
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,678
No, no, it's all right.

468
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:31,258
Everyone, sit down comfortably.

469
00:41:33,718 --> 00:41:39,138
We have a student teacher who will be with us for a month. Ms. Lee Joo Young.

470
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:43,028
She is currently a senior at Seoul National University's Korean language and literature department.

471
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:45,608
Originally, she was supposed to start tomorrow

472
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:49,268
but I wanted to introduce her to you on a fun day like this.

473
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:51,191
Okay, a round of applause!

474
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,401
 Where did I see her before?

475
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:02,228
Teacher, could you please sing for us too?

476
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,108
 - Yes! 
 - Sing for us! Sing for us!

477
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,098
 Sing for us! Sing for us!

478
00:42:07,098 --> 00:42:09,808
 Sing for us! Sing for us!

479
00:42:09,808 --> 00:42:11,868
Hey, be quiet! Quiet!

480
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:15,188
- Quiet! 
 - Yes, should I give it a try?

481
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:18,508
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

482
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:24,598

I've never heard the song before.

490
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:59,218
She's really bringing down the mood.

491
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:04,248
♪  For the freedom, brandishing...  ♪

492
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,888
She's charming.

493
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,218
Don't you think?

494
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,608
What kind of song is it that it's so sad?

495
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:14,528
"Sora, Sora, blue Sora..."

496
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:17,618
Do you know this song?

497
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,448
No.

498
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:24,808
But why does it sound so familiar?

499
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,988
♪  Under the prison bars where I'm tied  ♪

500
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:34,300
♪  I will meet you by staying alive  ♪

501
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:50,658
 Why does she look so familiar?

502
00:43:50,658 --> 00:43:53,408
 She can't be familiar.

503
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:08,348
Oh, my gosh.

504
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:10,138
Prince Five...

505
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:13,638
I mean, our Korean teacher made this himself?

506
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:15,058
Yes.

507
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:16,598
It's so good!

508
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:19,168
Right? My grandma—

509
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:24,508
The kimbap your mom made is so good, too!

510
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,568
You talk to me more casually after the science lab incident yesterday.

511
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:38,478
Since we are friends now.

512
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:45,258
That's right. We're friends. You can just call me by my name.

513
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,268
Baek Yoon Young?

514
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:51,778
The one who'll connect with love.

515
00:44:51,778 --> 00:44:55,358
This love letter is from one of the gentlemen over there.

516
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,728
Here.

517
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:59,008
Soon Ae, too.

518
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:03,290
Please take good care of the gentlemen's hearts.

519
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,928
Thank you!

520
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:12,138

521
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,558
 This matchbox.

522
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:16,658

523
00:45:40,778 --> 00:45:42,448

524
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,308

525
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:47,928

526
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:56,628
 This is not a common item.

527
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:03,018
 But then, it doesn't make sense that I picked up something from 34 years ago at that location.

528
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:06,618
 You picked it up? By chance?

529
00:46:06,618 --> 00:46:10,448
 Exactly when and where? By the river?

530
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:13,738
 What were you doing there that night?

531
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:25,548
 That man knows something.

532
00:46:34,848 --> 00:46:37,178

533
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:45,558
Hurry up.

534
00:46:45,558 --> 00:46:48,178
- Take it. 
 - I told you I don't want to.

535
00:46:48,178 --> 00:46:51,158
She said she didn't want to! Just go!

536
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,958
Geez, okay then.

537
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:03,078
What's going on?

538
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:16,618
 - We are going now. 
 - Goodbye!

539
00:47:16,618 --> 00:47:19,688
- Goodbye. 
 - Go straight home.

540
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:24,368
Have you found a place to stay for a month?

541
00:47:24,368 --> 00:47:27,788
Yes, my relative lives in this town.

542
00:47:27,788 --> 00:47:29,478
 That's a lie.

543
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:34,018
 She doesn't have any family or relatives.

544
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,118
 Why is she lying about this?

545
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,578
Oh, I see.

546
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:42,128
But just in case...

547
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:47,188
here's my phone number.

548
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:51,498
Here.

549
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:58,538
Oh, I have all the students memorize my phone number, too.

550
00:47:58,538 --> 00:48:00,948
Just for emergencies.

551
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,378
If anything happens, feel free to call me anytime.

552
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:09,798
Even the smallest things are fine.

553
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:11,738
Thank you.

554
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:15,638
But since I have my relatives, I'm sure I'll be fine.

555
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:19,958
But don't crumple and toss it.

556
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,228
Yes.

557
00:48:21,228 --> 00:48:24,558
Get home safely, and I'll see you tomorrow.

558
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:38,318
Oh, my thermos.

559
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,148
I must have left it back there.

560
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:41,978
- I'll go with you. 
 - No, no.

561
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:43,688
It's right there. I'll be right back.

562
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,768
Wait just a moment.

563
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:48,448
Don't run! Be careful!

564
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:49,808
Okay!

565
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:04,528
Are you the reason my brother is in jail?

566
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:08,498
That's not me. It's your brother.

567
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:11,918
What he did got himself locked up.

568
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:15,658
Okay.

569
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:20,888
So what's my weakness that you found?

570
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:27,458
The button that gets my reaction.

571
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:30,427
Secret cards to use against me.

572
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:32,497
You know, don't you?

573
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:36,528
It was too easy. I didn't even have to look for it.

574
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,928
Soon Ae?

575
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:44,338
Lee Soon Ae is your weakness.

576
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:48,618
It's still a mystery as to why she is your weakness, though.

577
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:56,518
If you know, then don't forget it.

578
00:49:56,518 --> 00:49:59,528
My warning from yesterday is still valid.

579
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,818
You know my brother?

580
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:12,188
Do you think I would like what happened to him...

581
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:14,928
or the opposite?

582
00:50:17,258 --> 00:50:19,208
"Like"?

583
00:50:22,748 --> 00:50:25,428
That word itself is unexpected, but

584
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:27,478
do I need to know that?

585
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:32,048
You'll have to.

586
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:37,558
That's how you'll know whether I'll use

587
00:50:37,558 --> 00:50:39,568
your weakness or not.

588
00:50:43,788 --> 00:50:45,968
I'll see you tomorrow, Yoon Young.

589
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,818
- I... 
 - Well...

590
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:02,018
You can go first.

591
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:04,108
I'll wash my hands first.

592
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:06,368
We have plenty of time.

593
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:10,408
Right. We have plenty of time.

594
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:34,348
 If, by any chance, she doesn't know what's going to take place here,

595
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:36,588
 I need to let her know now.

596
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:40,778
 Since we don't know what will happen from now on.

597
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:57,788
Something's strange.

598
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:01,538
There's definitely something going on.

599
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:17,208
That can't be.

600
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,828
What happened?

601
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,578
The principal just called.

602
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:25,168
He was supposed to meet Ms. Lee Joo Young, but he couldn't reach her.

603
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:27,168
I'll be right back.

604
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,528
- Wait... 
 - Oh, yeah.

605
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,658
Don't go anywhere and stay home. You must.

606
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:34,798
I'll be right back.

607
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:42,088
Lee Joo Young.

608
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:44,418
That student teacher earlier...

609
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,378
 Strange.

610
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:04,238
This is also a situation I know.

611
00:53:19,928 --> 00:53:21,568

612
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:24,428
 That doesn't make any sense.

613
00:53:24,428 --> 00:53:26,228
 No way.

614
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:38,458

615
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:43,578
Why is this in Go Mi Sook's novel...

616
00:53:46,288 --> 00:53:48,438
No, it can't be.

617
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:53,108
It could be a description of a scene she actually saw in the past.

618
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:58,168
 There was something peculiar...

619
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:01,688
 about her first impression.

620
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:07,448
 Two dark eyebrows that contrast against her pale and soft face.

621
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:12,728
 Or a unique wooden ring on her thin index finger.

622
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:19,828
 Or worn-out sneakers that didn't match her neat outfit.

623
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:35,448
That's why she seemed familiar.

624
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:48,218
Excuse me.

625
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,628
Where is Go Min Soo right now?

626
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,498
Where is he?

627
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,548
Go Min Soo!

628
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,318
Go Min Soo!

629
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:31,288
 Na Mi, Kim Wan Seon, Min Hae Kyeong.

630
00:55:31,288 --> 00:55:34,828
 The song that was sung in a quiet and strong voice

631
00:55:34,828 --> 00:55:39,798
 in front of kids who were expecting a Fire Truck song. 
 (Korean pop group from the 80s)

632
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:47,178
 All these things made her look special.

633
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:49,318
 I...

634
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:51,438
 I...

635
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:11,058

636
00:56:11,908 --> 00:56:13,838
Why are you here?

637
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:18,698
Why did you come out here?

638
00:56:19,748 --> 00:56:21,598
That woman...

639
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,208
is she going to die?

640
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:31,908
What did you say?

641
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:39,258
 That's how I picked her at first sight.

642
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:42,418
 As my beautiful...

643
00:56:42,418 --> 00:56:44,418
 first death.

644
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,058
It's not true, right?

645
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:53,088
Not to that extent, right?

646
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:06,358
Did you come here knowing something?

647
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:13,148
How did you know that?

648
00:57:14,888 --> 00:57:17,438
It's something that hasn't happened here yet.

649
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:20,988
But how did you know that?

650
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:39,478
Now the time has come...

651
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:44,248
where we need to be honest with each other.

652
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,538
Because of how we met here...

653
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,858
is probably not a coincidence.

654
00:57:56,398 --> 00:58:00,398

655
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:05,988
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

656
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:08,778
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,808
 It's a novel by Go Mi Sook.

662
00:58:28,808 --> 00:58:32,148
 After I saw the student teacher, I felt a weird sense of deja vu.

663
00:58:32,148 --> 00:58:34,948
 You opened it up again and realized it was the same story.

664
00:58:34,948 --> 00:58:36,668
 Do you want Go Mi Sook to be the culprit?

665
00:58:36,668 --> 00:58:39,908
 The Go Mi Sook I know is more than capable of such a thing.

666
00:58:39,908 --> 00:58:41,458
 You released Go Min Soo?

667
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,418
 I only followed orders.

668
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,408
 I don't think I can stay here long, either.

669
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:47,358
 I wonder who knows me.

670
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,091

671
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:50,791

672
00:58:56,858 --> 00:59:02,358

Do you know that there was a witness at your crime scene, Go Min Soo?

673
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:13,088
By chance, do you also know who that is?

674
00:59:56,698 --> 00:59:59,818
See, I told you.

675
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:03,428
When you look at one place and rush toward it,

676
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:08,718
you fall into many traps.

677
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:17,660
