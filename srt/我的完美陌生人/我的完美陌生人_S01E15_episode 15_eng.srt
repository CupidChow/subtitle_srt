1
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,436

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,740

3
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,756

4
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:54,516

5
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,096
 Hae Joon!

6
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,156
 Dad!

7
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,676
 Dad.

8
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:06,806
 You being like this won't bring Hae Joon back.

9
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,506
 You should have been good to him while he was around.

10
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:17,046
 Just because you're waiting for him like a fool...

11
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,066
 how will this bring my son back?

12
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,756
How annoying! Shit...

13
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,096
What the hell, huh?

14
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:33,726
What the hell is this, huh, you bastard?

15
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:40,616
Who do you think you are by coming here looking for me, huh?

16
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,406

17
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,740

18
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:19,096
I saw Mr. Yoon on the news.

19
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,236
He said he saw the face of the culprit.

20
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,506
Is that true?

21
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:41,786
I came by your place during the day, too.

22
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,166
My plans were already ruined anyway.

23
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,926
Since you were dying to hear who it was,

24
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:52,016
I thought maybe I should just let you know.

25
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:55,026
But someone else was here instead of you.

26
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,726
The culprit.

27
00:04:58,846 --> 00:04:59,886
What?

28
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:03,786
They say it's easier to miss the ones closest to you.

29
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:10,256
But to think that you came asking me when you had let him into your home.

30
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:13,126
What do you want me to do about that...

31
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:16,226
What are you talking about right now?

32
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:18,796
You really didn't know, huh?

33
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,296
Yeon Woo.

34
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:26,326
The principal's son.

35
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,726
He's the culprit.

36
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,596
How dare you chase after me!

37
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,596
Yoon Young.

38
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:35,610
I know where to go.

39
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:21,086
For the charges of murdering Lee Joo Young, Lee Kyeong Ae, Yoo Beom Ryong,

40
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:24,886
and attempted murder against Lee Soon Ae and Yoon Hae Joon...

41
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,556
Yoon Yeon Woo has been apprehended.

42
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:33,946
We'll start a search and seizure now to secure evidence.

43
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,216
Let's go!

44
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:46,446
Director Yoon, are you all right?

45
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:53,536
I mean, how could this have happened?

46
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:57,666
Dong Shik, what's going on here?

47
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:03,166
Mr. Yoon has currently been transported to the hospital.

48
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,446
He still remains unconscious.

49
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,086
Hae Joon.

50
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,416
Hae Joon.

51
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:44,316
What is this? How could this be?

52
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,096
My goodness...

53
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,756
Hae Joon.

54
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,826
Hae Joon.

55
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,746
Hae Joon...

56
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:37,146
What happens to the culprit now?

57
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:42,716
We will complete the investigation and make him pay for the crimes.

58
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,276
That's what...

59
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:48,476
Mr. Yoon would want, too.

60
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,006
I thought everything would end once he was caught.

61
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:06,466
For those people... who died horribly without doing anything wrong...

62
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:14,336
I don't know if it's possible to pay for such a horrendous crime, but still...

63
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,946
But for him now...

64
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:36,016
I wonder if it has become something that'd never end for him. I'm afraid of that.

65
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:45,036
How could this be the answer for him? I feel so sorry for him.

66
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,756
Did he...

67
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:07,796
Did he really do that to Hae Joon?

68
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:26,726
When Yeon Woo returned, I personally went to the airport to pick him up.

69
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:31,456
I drove over four hours back and forth in my car and he sat next to me the whole time!

70
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,186
And someone had already been killed in the town at that time.

71
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:39,586
We saw all the commotion on our way back together. So how could that be?

72
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:43,816
Director Yoon, did you check his passport?

73
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,616
Passport?

74
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,446

75
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:02,986

The first time Yeon Woo came to this town was

76
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:07,166
way before than you think, Director Yoon.

77
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:12,256
That's why he couldn't be a suspect in the first place.

78
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:17,136
Yeon Woo deceived everyone from the start.

79
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:19,966
Even the date he returned to this town.

80
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:38,996
Now, speak for yourself. When, where, and how you committed the crimes.

81
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,156
It hurts.

82
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,836
Don't waste my time. Damn it!

83
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,086
Answer me straight!

84
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm telling you, it hurts.

85
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:54,096
This arm that you shot... It hurts.

86
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,736
I think I have to receive more treatment.

87
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,736
Can you please call my dad?

88
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,036
Don't you know where this is right now?

89
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:11,146
Don't you know why you're here?

90
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,766
I'm not sure.

91
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:20,236
Could you maybe explain it to me?

92
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,586
- What? 
 - Like evidence.

93
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,326
If you show me things like that...

94
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,266
Why?

95
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,196
You don't have stuff like that?

96
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:51,386
By now, you would have searched...

97
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:54,866
my house and my room. Right?

98
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:04,226
But why weren't they there?

99
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,196
Of course, they're not there.

100
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,586
Since I didn't do it.

101
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,386
Right?

102
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,946
Are you all right?

103
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,046
Are you awake now?

104
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:40,846
What happened to the culprit?

105
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,546
It's all finished now.

106
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:48,326
Detective Baek Dong Shik took him away and is investigating.

107
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,606
Are you going to keep avoiding looking at me?

108
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,946
I'm sorry.

109
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:26,986
My dad was the one who hurt your family...

110
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,636
and took them away from you.

111
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:35,236
And my life started with that horrible person, too.

112
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:40,476
That horrible person hurt you, too.

113
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,916
So, why are you sorry?

114
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:51,856
None of what you and I... or our family had to experience was...

115
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:56,136
your fault at all.

116
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:04,676
So don't ever say or think these things again.

117
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:11,706
Wherever you started from,

118
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:17,036
nothing changes for me.

119
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,476
Thank you for waking up.

120
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,356
Director Yoon.

121
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,880

122
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:07,996
 In my gut, I feel 100% it's him.

123
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:12,516
He fell into our trap and ran away as soon as he realized I was there.

124
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:16,646
He even stole your car to escape, and...

125
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,716
made you that way in the process.

126
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:23,186
Considering he even lied about his date of entry,

127
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:26,016
there are more than one or two suspicious things.

128
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:31,096
But it's just that... there's not one single clear piece of evidence.

129
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,266
Yeon Woo knows that, too, so he's quite relaxed.

130
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:38,596
It seems he hid them so well that he won't get caught.

131
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,696
Seeing how he's talking about evidence to me.

132
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,476
What about the handwriting?

133
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:45,856
Did you check if his handwriting is the same as the one on the note?

134
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,386
What is this?

135
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,206
These are...

136
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:05,336
letters that Yeon Woo wrote me every week from America.

137
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:10,326
I'm the only one who has these.

138
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:23,146
This looks...

139
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:27,136
different from Yeon Woo's handwriting that I know of.

140
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:30,206
Since only I know this handwriting.

141
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,156
It was...

142
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,856
the handwriting that...

143
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,266
only I knew, especially in this world.

144
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:46,316
Other people may recognize it, too, now.

145
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:51,586
Since it's the same handwriting as the ones on the notes

146
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,906
that the culprit...

147
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,456
left the victims.

148
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,356
But handwritings aren't something one can hide easily.

149
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,536
That's why it's frustrating.

150
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:12,356
If it was like Go Min Soo where there were items with his handwriting,

151
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,626
we could compare the two.

152
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:18,206
But we can't find anything, no matter how much we look.

153
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:24,006
That woman who came to see you after the news.

154
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:26,006
The owner of Bong Bong Cafe.

155
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,096
She's the one who told you Yeon Woo is the culprit. Right?

156
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:36,646
I'm still looking for her, hoping something will turn up from her end.

157
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:41,316
But I don't know where she disappeared after shutting down the coffee shop.

158
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:44,486
She had probably left town by now.

159
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:48,776
That's what she wanted to do.

160
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,716
W-What do you mean?

161
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,386
He said he would write me in a special way...

162
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:03,296
different from the way he writes to other people.

163
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,556
He said he would use a different handwriting...

164
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,846
only when he's writing me letters.

165
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:14,646
I thought it was romantic.

166
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:17,756
And because he knew how to think of those things,

167
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,136
I liked him even more.

168
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:27,226
But then, one day, the detectives came and...

169
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,506
showed me a note in the matchbox.

170
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:38,496
Since it was the matchbox from my cafe, they said I might recognize a regular customer's handwriting.

171
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:40,856
Of course, I recognized it right away.

172
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,506
Since only I knew that handwriting.

173
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,546
Then...

174
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:52,266
why didn't you say anything right away?

175
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,126
By chance, are you...

176
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,926
I wanted to run away.

177
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,286
I just...

178
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:26,076
I just wanted to run away.

179
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:29,356
I really was planning to do that.

180
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:32,126
Yoon Hae Joon.

181
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:38,606
I ended up telling him everything.

182
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,966
But I'm sure there is no evidence.

183
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:47,776
Yeon Woo is a smart person.

184
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,926
He probably didn't make any mistakes.

185
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,066
Except this.

186
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,766
- So that's why... 
 - Listen.

187
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:05,416
What's the real reason you came to see me?

188
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,256
Detective.

189
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:25,926
Well... is there anything I can do

190
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:29,656
to help you find the Bong Bong Cafe owner?

191
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:31,126
What?

192
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:36,446
It seems she's an important person.

193
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:42,076
She is important to us right now, but even more so to him.

194
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:48,246
You can't mean...

195
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:59,296
If she left town, she might've gone through the terminal store.

196
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:05,506
I'll see if I can find out anything from my grandpa.

197
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,216
Thank you, Yoon Young.

198
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:16,416
The owner of Bong Bong Cafe? Yes, I saw her.

199
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:20,986
She was sitting in front of our bus terminal for a long while.

200
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,536
I was concerned since a woman was sitting there like that alone.

201
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:28,336
So I stayed a little longer to see her get on the bus.

202
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:32,966
Then you must know which bus she took and where she went?

203
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,466
Well, I'm not sure.

204
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,446
I don't really remember...

205
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,856
Thank you.

206
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,186
Are you all right?

207
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,356
What do you mean?

208
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:56,256
Because of Director Yoon's son?

209
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,126
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

210
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:07,206
Director Yoon is a really good person.

211
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:12,866
How could the son of such a good person...

212
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:15,016
How could that be...

213
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:22,136
On the one hand, I really hope he's the culprit.

214
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:24,166
Why do you say that?

215
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:29,276
If that's the case, then he's caught.

216
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,376
Then it means it's all finished.

217
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:38,486
It means other people won't have to experience the agony that my children did.

218
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:43,376
I hope no one, no other family,

219
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:49,706
ever experiences...

220
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:53,246
what I'm feeling now.

221
00:26:54,306 --> 00:27:00,396
Please let Mr. Yoon know once again how grateful I am.

222
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:07,650
Please thank him for catching the culprit, and thank you so much for putting an end to it.

223
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:11,326
Yes.

224
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:16,276
 There's no evidence?

225
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:18,276
 How can that be?

226
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:21,246
 I don't have any recollections of...

227
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:24,006
 my dad's handwriting.

228
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,756
 I don't remember seeing Dad's writing.

229
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:40,076
 Grandpa!

230
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,106
 What's that?

231
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:44,176
 Now that I told him I could read,

232
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:48,066
 Dad sent me a letter, Grandpa.

233
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:50,436

234
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:55,316

235
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:59,546
 That horrific punk!

236
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,496
He knew it!

237
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:15,186
He knew it all even back then!

238
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:44,805
Hae Joon.

239
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:47,533

240
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:50,803
How did you get here?

241
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:53,712
What are you doing right now?

242
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:56,022
Well, the thing is...

243
00:28:57,532 --> 00:29:00,192
This is a piece of evidence with the culprit's handwriting.

244
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:03,932
Why? You'll burn everything and get rid of it all?

245
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,742
I know.

246
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:09,902
I know it's a crazy thing to do.

247
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,442
I know I'll be punished for it. But...

248
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:14,232
But what?

249
00:29:14,932 --> 00:29:17,442
This affects the rest of your life.

250
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:20,782
This determines your future. So there was no other way.

251
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:24,242
This was my best choice for protecting you.

252
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:29,892
That baby in your mom's belly right now. You.

253
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:33,342
How can I let you be born as the son of a murderer who killed three people!

254
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:37,362
How could I just stand by and watch that happen?

255
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,032
Hae Joon.

256
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,489
I will receive all punishment.

257
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:45,089
I will go to hell and be punished if I need to.

258
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:50,429
But can't you just pretend you don't know and live a normal life like everyone else?

259
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:56,009
Hae Joon, I'll make sure that bastard doesn't do any other horrible thing to you.

260
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,049
Were you like this back then, too?

261
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,419
Even back then?

262
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:07,829
Because you even covered up everything,

263
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:10,799
everything was buried just as they were.

264
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,679
If you do this...

265
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,119
After you bury everything like this,

266
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,549
do you think I'd live well as you wish?

267
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,679
Don't make excuses that this is for my future.

268
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,519
You couldn't even live in peace after covering up everything.

269
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,059
You lived a life ignoring even your son's son!

270
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:37,259
I lived my life...

271
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,069
looking at your cold back turned toward me.

272
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,989
No, no, no!

273
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:53,399
Knowing such a future like that,

274
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,379
will you still make this choice?

275
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:35,579
He saw her get on the express bus but didn't know where she...

276
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,529
 Oh, it's okay. You don't have to search anymore.

277
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:40,649
Why?

278
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,309
Mr. Yoon just came by a little while ago.

279
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:46,749
What are you talking about? Isn't he at the hospital?

280
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:48,239
 Yeon Woo...

281
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,999
He came by to drop off the evidence with the culprit's handwriting.

282
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,259
You're saying he found the evidence?

283
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,059
Yes. We'll definitely be able to wrap up the case with this.

284
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,499
Thanks to him, we can arrest him once and for all.

285
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,269
Aren't you going to ask me where I went?

286
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:28,529
I heard everything.

287
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,719
I'm all right now. Can't I leave the hospital?

288
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,769
Of course, you can't yet.

289
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,609
I want to return home now.

290
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:50,219
Grandpa asked me to thank you.

291
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,729
He said he saw the Bong Bong Cafe owner in front of the bus terminal earlier.

292
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,459
But he didn't know which bus she was planning to take...

293
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:09,839
and even if a bus came in, she didn't think of getting on the bus

294
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:14,169
and kept staring down at something.

295
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,899
 Are you traveling somewhere far?

296
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:24,819
 Yes.

297
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:29,589
 It'll be a while until the first bus of the day. So early in the morning.

298
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,179
 I'll open the door, so wait inside.

299
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,129
 It's all right.

300
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,699
 I'm all right, too.

301
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:42,439
 After losing my daughter, I've become afraid of so many things in this world.

302
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:47,779
 But what a relief that the culprit was caught. Right?

303
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:51,529
 Yes.

304
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:57,839
 Goodness, that's very pretty.

305
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:05,169
He said she kept touching the baby's socks for a while and then

306
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,769
she finally left.

307
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,529
Your mom.

308
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:19,499
You knew?

309
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,169
Shall we find out where she went?

310
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:28,909
No.

311
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:31,119
I'm all right.

312
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:42,460

313
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:52,249
 The suspect in the Woojeong Village serial murder case has been arrested.

314
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:55,049
 Could you please brief us on the current situation?

315
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:01,899
Yes.

316
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:10,109
The police successfully arrested the culprit in the three murder cases, and

317
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,909
two attempted murders that began in May in the village of Woojeong.

318
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:20,369
The culprit, Yoon, is a student in his mid-20s who has studied abroad for a long time.

319
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:25,309
According to the charges, we will follow the protocol and arrest Yoon.

320
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:29,849
We will thoroughly investigate his motive and conduct, and then plan to hand him over to the prosecutors.

321
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,429
Gosh! Oh, my goodness!

322
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:36,669
Are they saying that the precious only son of Director Yoon...

323
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:39,859
Are you saying he is really the culprit?

324
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,309
Goodness! He's smart, his family is wealthy, and he has so much going for him.

325
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,919
Why would someone who lacks nothing commit something so horrendous? Geez...

326
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,239
So if you're not smart and don't have much, it's okay to do that?

327
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,359
- No, no, that's not what we meant. 
 - Soon Ae's dad, that's not what we're saying.

328
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,739
I raised my precious daughter with devotion, too.

329
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,819
So tired of all the gossiping.

330
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,269
 Geez, come on now.

331
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,329
 Geez...

332
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:16,719
 After a month-long search, the suspect of the Woojeong Village serial murder case has finally been arrested.

333
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,369
 The nightmare of the nervous townspeople finally ended.

334
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,879
 Reporter Kim relays the events.

335
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:27,549
 Yoon, the suspect behind the month-long serial murder cases in Woojeong Village

336
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:31,039
 has been apprehended and is now entering the police station.

337
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,089
 Surrounded by swarming cameras, Yoon was transported to the police interrogation room.

338
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:38,299
 The suspect, Yoon, denied the murder charges, but

339
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,639
 the police confirmed that they have the evidence that proves

340
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,539
 the handwriting on the note found at the crime scene matches Yoon's handwriting.

341
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,449
Now it really feels like everything is over.

342
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:57,559
We caught the culprit, and I think I did everything I could here.

343
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,839
The car is fixed, too, and now...

344
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,069
we should take time to return.

345
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,189
You mean, we should leave?

346
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:12,329
We can't continue living like nonexistent people.

347
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,699
We also have to check the changed future.

348
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:25,389
You need some time to say goodbye to your mom, dad, and other family members.

349
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:30,890
So how about we leave tomorrow night?

350
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,939
All right.

351
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:40,869
Let's do that.

352
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,849
Do you want that?

353
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:10,976
I told you I don't want to see anyone!

354
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,279
Is there still no news from my dad?

355
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:34,389
I'll trust you and leave you alone, so come out after you're done talking.

356
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,299
Yes.

357
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,129
I was wondering who the owner of this good fortune would be.

358
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,859
But it's ultimately you, Hee Seop.

359
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:59,259
You drooled looking at it every day and said you didn't have any money.

360
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:01,849
Lucky you! Receiving such a gift from your girlfriend!

361
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,129
- What do you mean, "girlfriend"? 
 - What do you mean, "girlfriend"?

362
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,799
- No, really. 
 - This isn't it.

363
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,369
- I'm not going to buy it! 
 - Stay still!

364
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:21,329
Are you crazy? Is 200,000 won a joke?

365
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,759
Why would you give this to me?

366
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:26,529
This probably isn't even your money!

367
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:32,319
You stole from Mr. Yoon, didn't you?

368
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,089
- If you get caught, then only I'll get in— 
 - Hey!

369
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,379
I'll pay him back later, so just grab it and come out!

370
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,729
So annoying!

371
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,479
Here! It's really yours now!

372
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,989
- Thank you, customer. 
 - Goodness.

373
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,749

374
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,509
Wow!

375
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,079
You don't, by any chance...

376
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:38,009
like me or anything...

377
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,379
It's a bribe!

378
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:03,919
Going forward, be good to my best friend Soon Ae for the rest of your life.

379
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:08,259
If you make Soon Ae tear up even once,

380
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,029
I won't sit still.

381
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:14,559
Is this a bribe or a threat?

382
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,909
I'll take care of all that myself. Why do you care?

383
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,929
No matter how difficult situations may get,

384
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:27,279
don't ever break up and stay by each other's side.

385
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:34,709
Only then... will I be able to see you guys again.

386
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,279
Are you going somewhere?

387
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:46,479
We'll probably see each other again soon.

388
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,909
Although it might take a little longer for you.

389
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:55,789
What are you talking about?

390
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:59,350
By chance, does your head hurt again?

391
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,679
You don't seem to have a fever...

392
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,789
That's enough! Go!

393
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,890

394
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:22,099
Oh, it feels a little weird.

395
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:47,649
Dad, lead a good life this time.

396
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,319
Don't get sick.

397
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,659
Without getting hurt...

398
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:59,609
Do whatever you wish to do.

399
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:12,979
Why would you kill me?

400
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:17,119
That's the one thing I really wanted to ask you.

401
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:22,539
I guess I'll never find out.

402
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:26,469
Since the future where you could kill me is gone.

403
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,760

404
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:42,959
How fun.

405
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:11,439

406
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:44,199

407
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,939
Was that it?

408
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:00,219
Because I had killed you, you came to take revenge for that?

409
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:04,529
If you were that curious, why didn't you just leave it alone?

410
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,529
So that I don't get caught this time, either.

411
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:13,149
So that I can kill you one more time.

412
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:20,099
Even though you lived so far away, who knew you would be such a different person?

413
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:22,519
What?

414
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,849
The conclusive evidence.

415
00:46:25,939 --> 00:46:31,279
After finding the love letters, I became curious about one thing.

416
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:38,239
 Hae Joon.

417
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,719

418
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:44,359
You're a smart guy.

419
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,989
You didn't leave behind any mistakes at the crime scenes.

420
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:51,769
Why did you miss that?

421
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:55,289
You must have known that the letters could be used as evidence.

422
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:01,669
You must have known that she could end everything for you with those letters.

423
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:06,369
Why did you leave her alone?

424
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,579
Did you actually love her?

425
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,379
You're really asking me an unexpected question.

426
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:29,579
I thought you'd ask me questions like why or how I killed them.

427
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,659
Love?

428
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:40,049
I did.

429
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:43,219
I did love her.

430
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:46,609
I believed she was a woman who could make my dreams come true.

431
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,569
I thought that woman would be different.

432
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:54,419
Different from the...

433
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,139
terrible woman I knew.

434
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:05,489
The woman I remember mostly was reading books.

435
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:13,509
I have no memory of her giving me a warm look. Not even once.

436
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:17,349
Then one day, when I was seven years old,

437
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,190

438
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,979
she left our home.

439
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:26,179
Supposedly, she no longer wanted to live as someone's mother.

440
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:35,589
 Should I...

441
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:39,279
 meet my mom once?

442
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,299
 Mom?

443
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:46,589
 You know what your mom is up to?

444
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,939
Being abandoned by the person...

445
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:18,159
who should love me unconditionally in this world.

446
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,029
Do you know how horrible that feels?

447
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:24,189
While longing for the person who abandoned me,

448
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:28,219
I cried and cried all night.

449
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:33,019
I promised myself during that endless agony.

450
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:39,839
If I ever have a son someday...

451
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,619
My son.

452
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:49,539
I will never let my child live the way I did.

453
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,839
I will meet a woman who loves him more than anyone else.

454
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,749
We will live happily ever after.

455
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,759
That's why I met that kind of woman.

456
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,439
She was...

457
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,529
an orphan.

458
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:13,619
She really wanted to have a family of her own.

459
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:18,269
Did you know you almost made that happen?

460
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:23,969
- What? 
 - That family you so longed for.

461
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:27,899
The perfect happiness. The perfect family.

462
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:31,809
Do you know you ruined it all by yourself?

463
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,919
What are you saying?

464
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:37,049
But what a relief.

465
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:42,779
That my mom could escape a bastard like you.

466
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:00,669
You...

467
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,479
You're not by any chance...

468
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:14,179
That's nonsense...

469
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,400
If you're really my son, you couldn't do this to me.

470
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,199
No...

471
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,999
How could I even kill you?

472
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,309
Thanks to having a terrible father like you,

473
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:33,359
I'll explain it to you as an abandoned child from birth.

474
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,389
All the things you rattled on about up until now...

475
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:43,679
is nothing but silly self-pity from a killer with a victim mindset.

476
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:49,909
So for the rest of your life, all the remaining time you have,

477
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:53,749
stay locked up and rot away in agony.

478
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:00,609
This is the last wish of the son you desperately longed to have.

479
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:55,564
Mr. Yoon!

480
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:57,764
- Oh, goodness. 
 - Yes?

481
00:52:57,764 --> 00:53:00,074
Why are you all out here? Is something wrong?

482
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:02,204
What do you think?

483
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:04,914
We heard you're moving! On top of that, tonight!

484
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,284
How could you leave suddenly, without a word in advance?

485
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:10,984
I'm really disappointed. You know?

486
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:12,164
Yes.

487
00:53:12,164 --> 00:53:14,154
I'm really sad, Mr. Yoon.

488
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:17,384
I consider you as family. But how could you...

489
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:35,384
I'm telling you, we really will see each other again.

490
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:37,024
When?

491
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,074
Where?

492
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:44,764
About 34 years later.

493
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,814
In your home.

494
00:53:48,384 --> 00:53:51,014
I really hate you.

495
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:56,544
Just say we'll never see each other again.

496
00:53:56,544 --> 00:54:00,024
Say, we'll never see each other again!

497
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:04,524
So that I don't wait for you any longer.

498
00:54:10,654 --> 00:54:13,024
By that time,

499
00:54:14,814 --> 00:54:18,414
we will look a little different.

500
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:24,724
But I really like that face, too.

501
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:32,344
I miss... that face so much, too.

502
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:41,104
I'm so glad that I was able to come here.

503
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:44,504
Because I...

504
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:49,254
Because I was able to meet you as you are now,

505
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:53,804
and find you again...

506
00:54:55,934 --> 00:54:58,674
I'm so glad.

507
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:10,714
Me, too.

508
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,934
Me, too.

509
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:24,574
I was so happy... that I had met you.

510
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:54,334
Thank you.

511
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:00,834
Thank you very much, Mr. Yoon.

512
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:05,014
Thank you very much for being our neighbor, Mr. Yoon.

513
00:56:05,014 --> 00:56:06,634
Oh, yes.

514
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,424
Thank you for saying that.

515
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:12,184
Oh, gosh.

516
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:16,874
Thank you so much for helping my sisters, Mr. Yoon!

517
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,464
Yes.

518
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:22,514
Could you just tell us where you're going?

519
00:56:22,514 --> 00:56:26,424
So that we can think, "Oh, he must be there by now..."

520
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,644
Just the place.

521
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:33,704
Well, it's very far.

522
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,214
Please stay healthy and live a long life.

523
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:40,674
I'll be sure to come and visit.

524
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,844
We're really leaving now, aren't we?

525
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:03,534
Yeah, we are.

526
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:08,434
Since it's been so long since I time-traveled, I feel a little nervous.

527
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:16,104
Aren't you sad?

528
00:57:16,104 --> 00:57:17,574
About what?

529
00:57:17,574 --> 00:57:20,814
Leaving without saying goodbye.

530
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:24,054
To your grandpa and mom.

531
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:28,904
Especially your mom, this place might really be the last time you ever see her again.

532
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:32,754
I didn't come here to see them.

533
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:36,024
I've seen them plenty.

534
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:38,334
That's enough.

535
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:46,774
What will you do first when you return?

536
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:48,894
What do you want to do?

537
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:52,534
Iced caramel macchiato! Let's have a super sweet one.

538
00:57:52,534 --> 00:57:56,354
Do you know how yummy it is to have that and salt bread together?

539
00:57:56,354 --> 00:58:00,164
I knew it. That sweet and salty.

540
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:40,594
You're right. I do feel a little nervous.

541
00:58:40,594 --> 00:58:42,494
Don't worry.

542
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:45,614
It'll be over in a blink of an eye.

543
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:52,524
As soon as we pass the overpass, we will reach our home ground as if we never left.

544
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:55,644
We will arrive in 2021.

545
00:58:57,054 --> 00:59:00,234
Sounds good. Let's go.

546
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:43,524
Have we arrived?

547
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:45,354
Are we here?

548
00:59:49,074 --> 00:59:51,144
Is it 2021?

549
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:54,024
It was smoother than I thought it'd be.

550
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,644
It's confusing coming here after such a long time.

551
00:59:57,644 --> 01:00:00,184
Is it 2021?

552
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,574
Aren't we in trouble if it isn't?

553
01:00:10,164 --> 01:00:12,314
 - Mr. Yoon! 
 - Yes, yes!

554
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:15,664
 Hey! Mr. Yoon!

555
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:25,874
Didn't you say you were a news anchor in 2021?

556
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:34,294
♫  I found the meaning of life. Come to me, darling.  ♫

557
01:00:34,294 --> 01:00:39,884
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

558
01:00:39,884 --> 01:00:45,284
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

559
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:51,654
 The year is 1987. 10:40 p.m. on June 14th.

560
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:55,544
 We were trying to leave here after completing everything.

561
01:00:55,544 --> 01:00:59,904
 But we found ourselves still remaining in this place.

562
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:05,814
 Maybe it's our fate to be stuck here forever.

563
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:14,054
♫  Your love that is like destiny  ♫

564
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:29,015

565
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:40,354
