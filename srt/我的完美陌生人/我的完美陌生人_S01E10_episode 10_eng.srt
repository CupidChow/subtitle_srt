1
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,030

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,081

3
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:50,291

4
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,110

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,820

6
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,671
 Some truths...

7
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,851
 may be bound to arrive in the end.

8
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:07,811
 Even if they've traveled far and for a long time,

9
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:11,601
 they will still reach the person.

10
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,761
Do you think you can walk?

11
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:47,774
Let's go to the hospital.

12
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,744
I don't want to.

13
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,784
How much more shameless would that be

14
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:59,034
to get treatment after getting out by myself like this?

15
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:02,034
I can't go anywhere...

16
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:05,294
until my brother comes out.

17
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,564
Yes, you would have thought that.

18
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,974
You probably left your leg like that.

19
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:26,924
When you were alone in this alley.

20
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:31,314
But it won't be that way now.

21
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:33,574
I won't let that happen.

22
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,790

23
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:45,054
Geez! Be careful!

24
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,584
Please just go.

25
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,244
I told you to leave me alone.

26
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:56,154
I have to go to my brother.

27
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:14,284
 If Hee Seop is released, please take good care of him.

28
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:25,404
 Actually, when Baek Hee Seop was dragged in there, I called my seniors right away.

29
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:28,994
 They said they would arrive in 50 minutes, so they'll be here soon.

30
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:33,114
- It's this way, right? 
 - Yes, that's right!

31
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,424
What the heck!

32
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,434
Geez, what the heck!

33
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,934
- Take care of it! 
 - I'm sorry!

34
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,314
It's Room 204!

35
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,334
Shit!

36
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:44,684
Of course, I'm aware of the current state of affairs.

37
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,554
But...

38
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,774
Oh, no. I'm sorry!

39
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:14,794
 As you said, there may be no good way in this situation.

40
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:18,784
 However, there's something even those guys can never beat.

41
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,434
 Someone who knows the future.

42
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:26,244
 The reporters will arrive soon after receiving a news tip.

43
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,324
 Fifteen minutes from now on,

44
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:32,494
 you'll be the only one who knows that everything will be over

45
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,184
 if you can last that long in that room.

46
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:43,274
 Send out your brother first, and try not to get hurt the rest of the time.

47
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:47,284
 Stay safe just for fifteen minutes.

48
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,954
 For your family.

49
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:02,344
Yes, I'll do that.

50
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,614
Evacuate.

51
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,554
 Was there any torture?

52
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,804
 There was torture, wasn't there?

53
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,644
Let's get out.

54
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:21,624
- Can you tell us what's going on? 
 - A few words, please.

55
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:24,674
There was torture, right? You tortured kids, didn't you?

56
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:27,904
Why did you bring in a high schooler? A civilian?

57
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,704
- Say a few words! 
 - Tell us!

58
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:35,094
Why did you bring students here to the motel room?

59
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:48,364
Thank you for creating the future that I know about.

60
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:55,664

61
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:18,434
Did your seniors return all right?

62
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,974
Since they finished a great show,

63
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,404
they're probably enjoying a fun after-party at a makgeolli restaurant by now.

64
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,854
In the year of 1987,

65
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:31,284
there is no way it could've been broadcast.

66
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:38,084
They came knowing that already, and I know the direct numbers of those connections.

67
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:44,044
So all that falling and rolling around was a show, too.

68
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:48,464
Oh, that was part of the performance, too. Wasn't it?

69
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,604
So, you saw.

70
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:57,354
He was cute.

71
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:00,434
Reminded me of when I was a new recruit.

72
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:03,274
I hope he will survive...

73
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,924
this horrible world all right. I worry for him.

74
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:10,774
Goodness. Not only did he survive,

75
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,894
he held the position of the news press director the longest.

76
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,564
The one who looks like a baby bird?

77
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,384
Wow, that's amazing.

78
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:39,834
What kind of people do you think these two have become?

79
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:44,904
I wish they could have

80
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:48,614
started over from this point onward.

81
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:53,264
They've felt pain and suffered a lot, so now

82
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:58,664
I hope they can live the kind of life they long for.

83
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:07,074
They will.

84
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:15,744
The surgery went well, and both of them will recover like before.

85
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:18,764
Many things will have changed already.

86
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,564
Return and check for yourself.

87
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:25,664
What kind of family awaits you.

88
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:36,594
So, I want to buy you a meal.

89
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:38,354
Do you have money here?

90
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:41,294
You have to lend me some, but I want it to be my treat.

91
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,204
I'll pay you back when we return. Okay?

92
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:47,234
Buy me tomorrow. So I can look up some expensive restaurants.

93
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,124
Yoo Seop.

94
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,194
Senior.

95
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,844
What exactly happened?

96
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,314
I couldn't get in contact with you for a long while.

97
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,214
And now you show up like this?

98
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,824
Does it make sense? Let go!

99
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,894
Does this make sense?

100
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:38,004
How could you send away a kid like that without any evidence?

101
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,124
Those bastards. You know what kind of bastards they are!

102
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,904
Without saying a word to me!

103
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,804
Don't be ridiculous, punk!

104
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:50,704
Would such a caring uncle arrest his own nephew and bring him in here? Baek Hee Seop?

105
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:52,634
Why? Is that different from this?

106
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,124
Oh, I see!

107
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,184
If you had caught the murderer, it would've helped your track record.

108
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:58,594
But it's a pain in the neck to get involved with a protestor!

109
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:01,334
You already have a record. Right, punk?

110
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,664
- Wait, wait! 
 - Hold on!

111
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:09,054
Anyway, I know you're just trying to look out for yourself.

112
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,384
Don't overreact, Baek Dong Shik!

113
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,854
It's embarrassing for both of us, you asshole!

114
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,754
You!

115
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:17,704
Whoa, come on!

116
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:19,444
- Get off! 
 - Hold him!

117
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:20,804
 What are you all doing?

118
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:23,714
- Wait. 
 - Get up.

119
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:25,004
What's going on?

120
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:32,514
Oh, things just got a little heated during our meeting.

121
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,820
What a disgrace!

122
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920

123
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,994
Two people just died in this town.

124
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,524
I've been taking you all out to dinner and drinks every day.

125
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:48,664
Yet you pathetic human beings are fighting among yourselves

126
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,764
while many people are shedding blood and tears after losing their families!

127
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:55,204
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

128
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:57,524
I'm really disappointed today.

129
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:02,984
And as for Baek Hee Seop...

130
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:07,044
Don't you dare put your hands on one of my students like that ever again!

131
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:09,000
Got that?

132
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,460

133
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,654
Geez.

134
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,954
Chief, we're sorry—

135
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,534
Yes...

136
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,774
Goodbye!

137
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,564
- Geez. 
 - Shit!

138
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,454

139
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,154
What are you doing?

140
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,004
What's that?

141
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:18,684
Well... I don't know.

142
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,204
It's twisted breadsticks.

143
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:33,034
Kyeong Ae really liked these.

144
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,004
Dinner's ready. Let's go inside, Ok Ja.

145
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:05,384

146
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,804
He came back for real this time!

147
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:16,844
- Who did? 
 - Our hero.

148
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,874
I see...

149
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,054
I only have...

150
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:30,764
two conditions.

151
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:34,654
- Out of nowhere? 
 - I usually prefer to eat one meal in the evening.

152
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:40,264
The menu should be grilled cheese toast, and I'd like it between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.

153
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:44,114
Second, no interruptions other than that.

154
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:47,434
I hate losing my flow when I'm focusing on something.

155
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,684
- Okay. 
 - This is on the premise

156
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,744
that it's true you can do this in five seconds.

157
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:09,894
5, 4, 3, 2...

158
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,384
Okay, I'll fix it for you.

159
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:24,354
Whoa. You're acting pretty high and mighty.

160
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:29,264
Once I open the hood, you'll be begging me to let you fix it.

161
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,914
I have two conditions as well.

162
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:40,394
First. No matter what you see here, you can't speak of it to anyone else.

163
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:48,114
Second. You will only go in and out of the garage so that my housemate doesn't feel uncomfortable.

164
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,564
I'm doing it for free, and you're giving me conditions?

165
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,594
What is this?

166
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:04,364
Why? Is something different?

167
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,084
Well, this battery...

168
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:13,384
What do you think? Is it worth it for you to fix it?

169
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,874
Yes. Hyung.

170
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:58,684
Now that we started fixing the time machine,

171
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,064
we have to try to finish everything we can before we return.

172
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:07,754
Catch the ones we need to catch. Save the ones who need to be saved.

173
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,654
For now, the last victim in 1987...

174
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:14,354

175
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,714
Ta-da! Guess how you do this one?

176
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:22,104
Okay, I'll do it for you. I'll play with you.

177
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,864
- You have to do it like this. 
 - Oh, yeah!

178
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:27,774
Then I have to do this.

179
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:30,934
Oh, she's here! Hae Kyeong!

180
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:34,844
 Kim Hae Kyeong, 12th grade in Class 1 at Woojeong High School.

181
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:39,434
Although we ran out of suspects over there, maybe it's better this way.

182
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:45,144
It means we can advance by taking a different path that doesn't overlap with the police.

183
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:50,914

We know someone they overlooked.

184
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:01,224
By chance, do you still think it's not Go Mi Sook?

185
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:02,824
Because it's only a novel?

186
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:06,034
The only thing that pointed out Kim Hae Kyeong as a victim was...

187
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,654
There was nothing specific written here.

188
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,604
Was there anything else Go Mi Sook said about Kim Hae Kyeong?

189
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,404
There is.

190
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:22,244
She told me how she was going to write about the third victim.

191
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,514
I'm trying to lose weight right now!

192
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,154
You gained weight!

193
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,194
- I did lose weight, you know. 
 - You gained.

194
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,294
Geez, whatever.

195
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,344
 The main character...

196
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:38,154
 So, Go Mi Sook...

197
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:41,514
- You made it. 
  - She said she liked her.

198
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:42,784
Yeah.

199
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:46,654
 Go Mi Sook also knew this full well.

200
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:49,184
Okay!  Now that everyone's here, I'll show you.

201
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:55,644
- Ta-da! 
 - Wow!

202
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,454
My mom has a side job these days.

203
00:18:57,454 --> 00:19:00,014
She said they give her 20 won for placing the ribbon.

204
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,594
But when they sell it, they go for 3,000 won.

205
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,414
Talk about inflating the price!

206
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:09,604
So I picked up a few. You can all wear one.

207
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,774
Are you crazy? Wearing the same thing. It's not like a set or anything.

208
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,764
That's tacky.

209
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,254
What do you think?

210
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,504
Is it pretty?

211
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:26,964
Wow...

212
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:31,064
Mi Sook, it looks like it's 9,000 won when you wear it!

213
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:33,174
Let me try!

214
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,964
Looks like there's one extra.

215
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:44,664
- I'll wear one. 
 - I was going to give you one anyway, Unni.

216
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:46,584
So pretty!

217
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,094
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - Oh, goodness.

218
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:51,474
- Unni! 
 - Unni!

219
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:57,044
- What do you think? Does it look like 10,000 won? 
 - No, it looks like 1,000 won.

220
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,824
You've gained weight.

221
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,194
Let's talk.

222
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:10,624
What are you going to do now?

223
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:11,974
About what?

224
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:17,774
Seems like Baek Hee Seop was released.

225
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:22,684
That's good.

226
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:27,854
I told him not to do anything from the beginning.

227
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,974
He didn't listen to me.

228
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:36,444
Because of that brother of his.

229
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:42,034
I thought he was going to go blabbering so I tried to kiss him, but

230
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,324
he was taken away in the end.

231
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:47,354
But I think it turned out better this way.

232
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:50,484
This is buying me time.

233
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:54,124
It didn't heal completely yet.

234
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:56,864
His hand.

235
00:20:57,544 --> 00:21:00,974
 M-Mi Sook's friend!

236
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,304
 P-Please...

237
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,574
 Call her! Please!

238
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:08,144
 That her brother's hurt!

239
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,154
Are you...

240
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:16,954
really going to frame your brother?

241
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:22,394
Why do you keep asking me? You're getting on my nerves.

242
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:30,524
Since Kim Hae Kyeong knew her secret and acted nervous,

243
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,604
Go Mi Sook felt annoyed by her.

244
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,284
Then, she happened to run away from home.

245
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,194
It's true that she ran away from home.

246
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,354
She even wrote a letter in her handwriting.

247
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:40,954

248
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:45,294
There was nothing to worry about since she ran away like that.

249
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:50,444
She told Go Mi Sook that if she doesn't run away with her to Seoul, she will reveal her secret.

250
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:55,364
- That's why... 
 - By "secret," you mean... that she was the culprit?

251
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,854
Yes.

252
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:02,914
Then let's just keep that in mind for now.

253
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:04,484
"Just keep that in mind"?

254
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:07,134
There are things I found out as well.

255
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:10,454
The reason Kim Hae Kyeong ran away from home.

256
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,084

What a great night!

257
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:17,384
 - Oh, that's good! 
 - Cheers!

258
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,654
The drill instructor?

259
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:22,754
My homeroom teacher?

260
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:26,034
Why would we talk about him here?

261
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:32,944
He liked Kim Hae Kyeong's mother.

262
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:35,774
And she felt the same about him.

263
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,404
 - Here! 
 - Yes.

264
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:42,224
 - Two more beers. 
 - More beer?

265
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,824
 - I'll bring you more. 
 - How is business these days?

266
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:47,584
 - Let me hold you. 
 - Oh, my gosh!

267
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:50,144
 Oh, my gosh! Please stop!

268
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,084
 Stop right there!

269
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,804
 - What the heck? 
 - What's going on?

270
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,754
 - Let go! Let go of me! 
 - Wait.

271
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:12,534
 But still! How could you mess up my husband like this? And you're a teacher.

272
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:13,964
 I'm sorry.

273
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:18,434
 I'll pay for your medicine. Could you please leave before Hae Kyeong comes home?

274
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:22,384
 So you do have some shame in front of your daughter?

275
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,654
 The audacity to play around with your daughter's teacher.

276
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,334
 Don't speak so rudely like that! She doesn't deserve that.

277
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:32,104
 Please, let's go! Mom!

278
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,194
 - Please? 
 - Come on!

279
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:37,444
 Geez!

280
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:59,594
 When did you get here?

281
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,154
 Did you eat?

282
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:08,214
 You made kimchi soup again that's not on the menu.

283
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,684
 What homeroom teacher likes.

284
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:15,294
 I want to eat seaweed soup.

285
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,214
 What?

286
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:19,934
 Oh, yes. I'll make it for you tomorrow.

287
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,824
 Only make seaweed soup.

288
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:26,594
 If you make kimchi soup again, I'm really not coming home anymore.

289
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:36,464
You don't actually mean that she ran away because of kimchi soup?

290
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:39,694
I guess you could say that.

291
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:46,054
So, Kim Hae Kyeong likes seaweed soup, and the drill instructor likes kimchi soup.

292
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:49,384
But because her mom ultimately chose kimchi soup...

293
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:52,764
That's how Kim Hae Kyeong misunderstood the situation.

294
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,954
Actually, for the sake of her daughter,

295
00:24:55,954 --> 00:25:00,934
she told him not to come anymore and cooked kimchi soup for the last time.

296
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:07,314
But what's important to us is what happened after she ran away. Right?

297
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:08,994
Not the reason.

298
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,184
If it was before, yes.

299
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:17,124
Since we thought things like the time and place where she ran into the culprit were important.

300
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:22,804
But now, I don't want to leave out any possibilities.

301
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:26,114
No matter what variance occurs, I don't want her running away from home.

302
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:31,094
But what if this is the last chance for us to run into the culprit?

303
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,674
There will be other ways.

304
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:40,474
Before that, we need to make sure we save her.

305
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:52,394
If it was just a misunderstanding, she could easily change her mind about running away.

306
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:56,184
"Mom chose you and not the drill instructor.

307
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:58,774
It was seaweed soup, not kimchi soup."

308
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:02,114
We just need to show her this fact.

309
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:11,584

310
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,620

311
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,304
- What do you think? 
 - It looks good on you.

312
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:27,924
Oh, goodness. Are they the four princesses, or what?

313
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:33,717
Why are they wearing the same headband? All pink, too? So tacky.

314
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:40,374
Did she like pink?

315
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,584
Well, what about you? Are you a rice cake bar or what?

316
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,944
How can you make such a comparison...

317
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:50,684
Anyway, what would good-looking people know?

318
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,494
All right.

319
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:09,874
Are you proposing today?

320
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:13,844
Yes, today is a great day.

321
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:16,484
Don't you think you're being too optimistic?

322
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:19,014
Haven't you thought about getting rejected?

323
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:23,454
No, I haven't. I will make sure she doesn't reject me.

324
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,574
You might have heard already, but

325
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:32,914
it's bad enough that people gossip about her running a bar alone as a woman.

326
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:36,194
But now that she's involved with me, the gossip's doubled.

327
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:40,174
I can't prevent my heart from having those feelings.

328
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:46,274
So I've decided just to end those rumors.

329
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:49,874
For the mother and daughter to not hear those things anymore,

330
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:53,344
I want to be a protective fence for them.

331
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,150

332
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,944
Hello.

333
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:11,980

334
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,534
Goodness.

335
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:18,544
When will he ever grow up?

336
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:22,214
What is he wearing? Is he a chalk or something?

337
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:26,424
I heard he got into a fight with a parent at a bar last night.

338
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:30,334
He got into a fistfight with a parent because he's dating another parent...

339
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:32,564
Goodness.

340
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:35,654
Should I just fire him as soon as possible?

341
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:39,374
You know you're not going to. You only talk like you are.

342
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:44,884
You're right. How could I fire family? Right?

343
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:48,774
Yes.

344
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,940

345
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:13,234
Hey, I heard your dad was humiliated yesterday.

346
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:15,984
Are your dad and Kim Hae Kyeong's mom really having an affair?

347
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,854
Hey, what if Hae Kyeong hears?

348
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,304
Kim Hae Kyeong went to the convenience store.

349
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:24,904
Hey, be careful. Her mom is really beautiful.

350
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:26,424
Do you want to die?

351
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:30,144
Kim Hae Kyeong's mom has a thing with the homeroom teacher.

352
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:35,424
I guess she's not even embarrassed, luring different men, and now she's even with the homeroom teacher.

353
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:37,704
- What? 
 - Oh, my goodness.

354
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:40,554
She can't live without a man, can she?

355
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:50,004
- Hey, be quiet! 
 - Quiet!

356
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:54,194
That's all right. Sit down.

357
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,874
Page 58.

358
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:19,734
Did you see my mom luring men? How does that work?

359
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:24,354
How would I know that? But I saw it. I'm telling you, I saw it!

360
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,484
Kim Hae Kyeong!

361
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:30,044
That's enough.

362
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:31,854
- That's enough! 
 - Let go!

363
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:34,564
- You come back here! 
 - I told you that's enough, Kim Hae Kyeong!

364
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:37,384
Think of your mom and get a hold of yourself!

365
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:41,264
This is none of your business! Stay out of it!

366
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:45,154
You're a teacher. Is my mom running a bar the best you could do?

367
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:47,524
You punk!

368
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:05,420
Hae Kyeong!

369
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:14,764
I'll be back.

370
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,000

371
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,260

372
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:05,872

373
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:08,037
No, that's okay. Go inside.

374
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,827
What?

375
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:13,957
Go inside. Go.

376
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:22,047
You just wrote a letter to your mom, didn't you?

377
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,867
H-How do you know that?

378
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,717
Look at the way you're dressed.

379
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:30,097
That's what runaways look like.

380
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:32,577
Go inside and bring it back here.

381
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,637
Should I bring it?

382
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,012
Oh, geez.

383
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:48,117
"Mom, I really hate that I was born as your daughter.

384
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,857
You must feel that way, too.

385
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:52,717
So let's not see each other until we die.

386
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:56,887
- Let's live our separate..." 
 - Oh, stop reading it!

387
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,377
I only read it nine times.

388
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,067
If you left this behind,

389
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:05,647
your mom would be heartbroken after reading this a thousand times in her life.

390
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,577
Why? It's hard for you already?

391
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:12,187
Where are we going?

392
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:17,567
You won't want to go home right away.

393
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:22,287
You're supposedly running away, so you should at least get some fresh air.

394
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:26,157
Oh, here it is.

395
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,037
Get on.

396
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,717
Teacher.

397
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,097
Teacher.

398
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:03,657
What?

399
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:07,797
I was wondering if I could leave early.

400
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,787
- My reason is... 
 - You can go.

401
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,047
Thank you.

402
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,387
Sit down.

403
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,517
This is a one-day field trip.

404
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:36,137
Looking at the 300-year-old tree.

405
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,377
What's so special about it?

406
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:48,137
Do you know how long 300 years is?

407
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:53,847
There must have been many floods and droughts throughout that time.

408
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:58,707
But it's still here, withstanding it all without being swept away.

409
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,647
All those years.

410
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:03,927
All trees are like that.

411
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:09,297
Well, probably because they're trees.

412
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:13,337
But what about people?

413
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:18,537
I know a little about that.

414
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,777
Someone who lived like this tree.

415
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:32,887

416
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,697

417
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:38,187
Thank you.

418
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,137
Thank you.

419
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:49,407
- Here. 
 - Yes.

420
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:52,827
- Oh, you gave this to me last time. 
 - Thank you for taking it.

421
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:55,917
- Thank you so much. 
 - Yes.

422
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:05,897

423
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:14,577
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

424
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,717
Thank you.

425
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,077

426
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,127
Senior, thank you for the meal.

427
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,857
 - Thank you!  
 - I'll treat you again next time.

428
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,597

429
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:52,227

430
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,507
Goodness. Goodness!

431
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,697
Are you all right, ma'am?

432
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:04,437
Let's get up.

433
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:11,027
Thank you.

434
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,237
Is it really all right not to go to the hospital?

435
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,847
Oh, I'm all right.

436
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,687
Thank you.

437
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,757
But you should still rest...

438
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,367
While I'm resting...

439
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:36,817
what if my daughter comes during that time?

440
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:42,537
What if she comes after hearing that I'm here looking for her

441
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:48,467
and then leaves disappointed when she can't find me?

442
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:53,147
Others tell me that she's probably dead, but...

443
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:58,147
I don't believe that.

444
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:00,277
I...

445
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:03,757
only believe the letter...

446
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:07,487
my child wrote for me.

447
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:13,437
I believe she hates me so much and despises me

448
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:18,737
and that's why she's hiding and living somewhere.

449
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:24,897
I really hope she is.

450
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:29,087
I hope she continues to live well like that.

451
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:32,297
Then before I die,

452
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:39,147
just once... even if it's just once...

453
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:41,977
it would be nice...

454
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:43,917
to see her face again.

455
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:50,237
I'd tell her that her worthless mother is sorry.

456
00:38:51,317 --> 00:38:53,077
But...

457
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:57,917
I really... really...

458
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:01,987
missed her so much.

459
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:17,667
 She spent 40 years like that.

460
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,967
In that same spot.

461
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:24,027
Regardless of rain or snow.

462
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,417
And then she passed away in the end.

463
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:31,967
Without ever seeing her daughter's face again.

464
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:35,867
I wasn't going to stay away for that long.

465
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,587
I know.

466
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:39,487
But why?

467
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,257
Why are you running away?

468
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,087
Didn't you get in a fight because of your mom?

469
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:46,767
Just hate the person who talks nonsense.

470
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:49,667
Why hate the person who's the target of that nonsense?

471
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,857
When you don't even hate her.

472
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:02,107
Soon Ae?

473
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:08,007
Yoon Young.

474
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,647
How did you get to come now?

475
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:16,467
What about school?

476
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:19,567
I left early. I thought I'd find you like this.

477
00:40:20,227 --> 00:40:21,797
Did you eat?

478
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:27,337
I'm okay.

479
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:32,987
There's no one here in our house, right?

480
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:36,467
Yes. Did your parents both go somewhere?

481
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:42,117
They went to the police station because of sister's corpse.

482
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:47,767
We need to have a funeral, so to find out what's taking so long.

483
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:02,597
Baek Hee Seop has been safely released.

484
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:11,947
Where is he now?

485
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:16,587
How is he?

486
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:20,567
Is he hurt anywhere?

487
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:25,107
Do you want to see him?

488
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:44,452

489
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:15,307
Why did you guys come here?

490
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:21,557
I only want to show you when I'm handsome, that's why I wanted hrivacy.

491
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:23,997
You mean privacy...

492
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:29,197
Because I hurt my head...

493
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:32,317
Why didn't you say anything?

494
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:36,677
If you had told them you were with me, they wouldn't have taken you away!

495
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:40,747
But that's your hrivacy!

496
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:46,347
I mean, privace!

497
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:48,597
You idiot.

498
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,497
You can't even remember what I just told you.

499
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:15,042
Soon Ae.

500
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:22,897
There's nothing you did wrong.

501
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:28,087
When you lose someone you love,

502
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:30,367
it always becomes like that.

503
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,867
"Would things have been different if I did this?"

504
00:43:35,627 --> 00:43:38,227
"Or if I had done that?"

505
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:43,787
Everything seems like my fault.

506
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:50,977
But that's not it.

507
00:43:51,877 --> 00:43:55,927
There's nothing you did wrong that night.

508
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,697
You know I saw it myself.

509
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:00,262
There was nothing.

510
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:11,027
♫  Susan, I love you  ♫

511
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:17,767
♫  Without regrets, I love you  ♫

512
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:23,827
♫  Susan, I can't forget you  ♫

513
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:30,437
♫  Susan, the one more precious than my life  ♫

514
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:36,867
♫  Susan, the chilly winds are blowing  ♫

515
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:42,977
♫  Susan, as dusk approaches  ♫

516
00:44:42,977 --> 00:44:47,427
♫  Where are you right now, all lonely?  ♫

517
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:49,417

518
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:56,032
♫  Why don't you come to me?  ♫

519
00:44:56,032 --> 00:44:59,092

520
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:07,007
Hurry up and go inside.

521
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:10,397
Go and see what your mom made for you.

522
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:27,107
Oh, my baby's here.

523
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:28,767
You didn't eat, right?

524
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,347
I made you seaweed soup.

525
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:33,137
Come here.

526
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:35,447
Sit down and eat.

527
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:44,457
I don't know if it tastes all right.

528
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:48,247
Let's see.

529
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,547
Here.

530
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,597
Didn't you make kimchi soup?

531
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:02,807
What?

532
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:06,687
Oh, yeah. I made that, too.

533
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,117
But he didn't come.

534
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:10,807
He said he wouldn't come by anymore.

535
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:13,787
I was going to tell him not to come anymore.

536
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:16,067
It's true.

537
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:19,067
I was going to tell him that today, but...

538
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,517
he said he's not coming anymore.

539
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,427
That's fine.

540
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,387
All I need is you, Hae Kyeong.

541
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:38,927
 Even if you don't run away now, you'll leave her soon enough.

542
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:42,277
 When you turn 20, you'll be independent and go off to college.

543
00:46:42,277 --> 00:46:45,237
 You'll date, work...

544
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:50,547
 and before you realize it, your mom will be old and alone.

545
00:46:50,547 --> 00:46:52,717
 Only waiting for you.

546
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:55,337
 Isn't that too much of a burden for you?

547
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:02,487
 Even the things that made you annoyed and angry up close

548
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:06,957
 will all become sad when time passes and

549
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,377
 you look from afar.

550
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:13,357
 That's how it is.

551
00:47:14,317 --> 00:47:16,637
He didn't come because of me.

552
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:20,857
My homeroom teacher slapped me earlier today.

553
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:22,557
That crazy bastard!

554
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:26,037
I badmouthed you, Mom.

555
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:29,257
That's why he couldn't come.

556
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:37,787
Tell him to come by again.

557
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:43,347
Honestly, I don't like seaweed soup that much, anyway.

558
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,957
Eat up.

559
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:04,457
 - Is it good? 
 - It's yummy.

560
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:12,452

561
00:48:18,384 --> 00:48:21,514
Some truths...

562
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:25,154
may be bound to arrive in the end.

563
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:30,224
Even if they've traveled far and for a long time,

564
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:33,744
they will still reach the person.

565
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:41,534
There was one thing... about my mom that I really didn't understand.

566
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:45,734
She always said she hated him, but she'd prepare a huge spread for Dad's birthday

567
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:48,034
and worry that I wouldn't show up.

568
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:53,034
I used to wonder, "What's so great about him that she couldn't let him go?"

569
00:48:55,104 --> 00:48:59,874
But after seeing them today, I could understand a little bit.

570
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:04,998
During the most difficult time in her life,

571
00:49:05,698 --> 00:49:09,008
he comforted her by her side.

572
00:49:18,418 --> 00:49:21,398
Did you see that they sell eels for 2,000 won?

573
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:26,098
When you pay me back, be sure to consider inflation.

574
00:49:26,658 --> 00:49:28,028
Here.

575
00:49:31,648 --> 00:49:35,788
You should've taken me to a nicer spot. I wanted to buy you an expensive meal.

576
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:40,198
Later on. In the future, you can.

577
00:49:40,198 --> 00:49:42,088
Oh, yeah!

578
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:44,878
I know a great place.

579
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:48,658
Let's meet there one day.

580
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:52,858
I'm not the kind of person who just goes anywhere.

581
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,168
Yeah, you seem like it.

582
00:49:57,168 --> 00:50:02,468
I know you like places where heartless people who don't enjoy the sweet and salty go.

583
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:08,418
Good ingredients, mild, healthy, expensive foods, and tasteless foods.

584
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:10,738
I see.

585
00:50:10,738 --> 00:50:12,928
You know me well.

586
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:18,488
Just wait. Well, about 34 years.

587
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:25,228
Here is the eel.

588
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:28,058
Thank you.

589
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:32,228
All right.

590
00:50:32,228 --> 00:50:33,978
Try it.

591
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:38,328
Spicy, salty, and sweet. A dish you know who really loves!

592
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:53,158
It's really good!

593
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,058
Please enjoy.

594
00:50:57,078 --> 00:50:58,668
Do you want to try one?

595
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:01,768
You won't have one? Yeah, you won't.

596
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:06,498
I'll eat it all.

597
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:35,568
Be careful. You might fall doing that.

598
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,668
It's really refreshing!

599
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:42,268
This is what's nice about the countryside.

600
00:51:44,288 --> 00:51:47,048
All right. Come out now.

601
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:13,748
Did you see that just now? My sense of balance?

602
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:18,258
I saw it. I saw it, so come out now.

603
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,598
If you fall there, you'll crack your head.

604
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:23,698
Wasn't once enough?

605
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:29,118
Can't you come in just once? It feels really good.

606
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:32,238
No, I'm never going in.

607
00:52:32,238 --> 00:52:35,108
Why not? Just once!

608
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:38,318
I don't want to.

609
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:49,908
♫  No matter what anyone says, no one knows my heart  ♫

610

But I don't want to.

So indifferent.

627
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:53,748
Very consistently indifferent.

628
00:53:53,748 --> 00:53:58,798
I knew it the moment you were asking if I'd be comforted if you were gone.

♫  If you would see me at some point  ♫

♫  Fill up my embrace with hot and dark nights  ♫

634

What a menace. That's going to be a problem.

640
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:02,128
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

641
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:05,488
Someone was playing in the water for some time.

642
00:55:13,568 --> 00:55:16,798
Geez, you scared me. When did you come in?

643
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:19,728
I even knocked. Eat.

644
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:23,158
Thank you.

645
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:33,158
What time is it?

646
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:35,698
10:00 p.m.

647
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:38,048
What, 10:00 p.m.?

648
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:41,028
Oh, no! The movie's at 9:30 p.m.!

649
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:43,978
- Movie? 
 - Yeah.

650
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:47,218
What was it? "O-Our Happy Youthful Days"?

651
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,168
Where did I put it? She told me not to be late!

652
00:55:50,168 --> 00:55:52,868
I'm going!

653
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,128

654
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:06,028
You collected all these?

655
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:08,108
Oh, yeah. Just...

656
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:12,508
All the movie tickets from when we were dating.

657
00:56:12,508 --> 00:56:14,988
I didn't want to just throw them away.

658
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:17,068
With Mom?

659
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,148
Yeah. You know...

660
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:26,668
What was the first movie we saw together again?

661
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,548
"Our Happy Youthful Days."

662
00:56:29,548 --> 00:56:31,428
I didn't get to watch it because I fell asleep.

663
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:34,748
I get sleepy whenever I watch a movie.

664
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,318

665
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,348

666
00:56:56,458 --> 00:57:01,858

667
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:05,978
 Why did I come... here?

668
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:09,298

669
00:57:38,428 --> 00:57:41,858
 What would I do even if I saw anything?

670
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:45,128
 So what if I found out who it was now?

671
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:11,698
 What kind of person was she?

672
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,178
My mom.

673
00:58:15,178 --> 00:58:20,678
Grandpa, what kind of person was my mom?

674
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:25,648
Your mom left town the night she gave birth to you.

675
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:30,248
Even when your cheeks turned red from crying,

676
00:58:30,248 --> 00:58:33,298
she left without even holding you once.

677
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:36,188
She thought you were a stain on her life.

678
00:58:36,188 --> 00:58:41,188
So... don't be curious or wonder about her from now on.

679
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:48,988
 - Oh, that was good! 
 - Yes, it was.

680
00:59:32,548 --> 00:59:35,818

681
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:12,648
 Some truths may be bound to arrive in the end.

682
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:27,218

683
01:00:27,218 --> 01:00:30,418
 Even if they've traveled far and for a long time,

684
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,538
 they will still reach the person they're supposed to.

685
01:00:47,988 --> 01:00:49,998
Mr. Yoon.

686
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:53,708
Hello.

687
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,088
 Then, why now?

688
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:15,738
 How can it be you?

689
01:01:22,118 --> 01:01:29,028

690
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:35,998
♫  When everything seems far away  ♫

691
01:01:35,998 --> 01:01:41,808
♫  In that passing hour  ♫

692
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:51,338
♫  Holding the hand reaching out to me  ♫

693
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:54,528

694
01:01:54,528 --> 01:01:56,508
 - Did you see the bookstore on the way? 
 - Of course, I did!

695
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:59,338
 I was so shocked to hear Go Mi Sook is a novelist!

696
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:02,688
 I was wondering why women who like books were that way.

697
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:06,008
 I can't stand the way they act like they're special.

698
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:09,818
 All this time, the biggest question for me was this sentence.

699
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:12,108
 "A woman who reads is dangerous."

700
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:14,228
 This could be a kind of warning.

701
01:02:14,228 --> 01:02:17,038
 Don't lie even in front of me!

702
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:19,108
 I'll tell them everything.

703
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:21,808
 Soon Ae, why are you being so annoying?

704
01:02:21,808 --> 01:02:25,418
 Keep acting up, and you'll end up like your older sister.
