1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,630

2
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:07,414

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:09,790

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:18,280

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,354

6
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,464

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,504

This is a really good item, right?

8
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,964
Oh, of course!

9
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:40,954
As long as you take good care of it, it will last 100...

10
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,094
I mean, 200 years easily.

11
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,374
Good. It should.

12
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,624
Since my grandson will use it in the future.

13
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:50,814
What do you mean, your grandson? Oh, Yeon Woo!

14
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:53,314
Is Yeon Woo marrying someone?

15
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,964
- By chance, he didn't get her pregnantâ€” 
 - Hey! Come on!

16
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:58,634
Don't say such a thing! No, that's not it.

17
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,364
If it's not, then what?

18
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:04,034
Actually, I had a dream a while ago.

19
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:06,834
I'm walking down a foggy road, and then

20
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,724
I come across that old underpass in the mountains in the back.

21
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:16,874
Then suddenly, out of that dark underpass, a huge tiger this big emerges roaring!

22
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:19,174
But then he comes into my arms and lays there.

23
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,784
That's a good dream, isn't it?

24
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:26,384
So I want to put dibs on the dream as my grandson's conception dream.

25
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:32,684
Wow! I don't know when it will be, but it looks like he'll be a very smart grandson.

26
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:36,854
I'm buying it now in preparation for celebrating the first time I meet him.

27
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:40,714
I wonder when I will actually get to meet him.

28
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:43,534
Oh, I'm so curious!

29
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,424
Wait a minute! Wait!

30
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,214
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,424
Why?

32
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:20,704
Detective, it's not what you think.

33
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,864
Move. You'll get hurt.

34
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,284
Please! No!

35
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:29,984
I-I explained to you earlier, didn't I?

36
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:34,174
He told me to go get you, so how could he have killed anyone?

37
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:37,384
- That doesn't make sense! 
 - Didn't you hear me say to move!

38
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,384
Yoon Young, it's all right.

39
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,354
It's all right.

40
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Please let me talk to her for a minute.

41
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:55,524
She has to be on her own while I'm away. She's family.

42
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,004
You have three minutes.

43
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,974
You trust me, right?

44
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,384
Of course. Why do you even ask that?

45
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:28,494
By the time I arrived, the murder had already been committed.

46
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:34,744
I think while he tried to save your mom, he ran into the culprit.

47
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,854
What should I do?

48
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,314
What do I need to do?

49
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:45,314
I'll return soon, so don't worry.

50
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,764
For now, go to your mom's place.

51
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:53,624
You have to be with people in the safest place possible.

52
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,304
And by any chance,

53
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:02,414
can you drive?

54
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:07,544
Do you know... how to drive?

55
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:13,144
Why are you asking me that?

56
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:17,324
You said you'll return soon!

57
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:21,614
Why are you asking me that right now?

58
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,314
In case.

59
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,744
Just in case, I...

60
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,584
There's no such thing as "Just in case."

61
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:36,644
I told you what kind of future I want.

62
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:41,714
No matter what happens,

63
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,764
I'll wait for you at our house.

64
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,254
By myself.

65
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:49,464
Terrified.

66
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,694
So hurry back.

67
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,004
Don't get hurt anywhere.

68
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,504
I'll do that.

69
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:07,644
I'll be sure to do that.

70
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:29,524
Geez, look at this brazen guy!

71
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:30,734
That's enough.

72
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:34,784
There's clear evidence, so no need to drag it out trying to get a confession out of him.

73
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:38,634
Let's wrap up what we have and send him to the prosecution first thing in the morning.

74
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:43,134
 - Yes, sir!  
 - Geez! Finally, this nightmare is over!

75
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,294
Come here! Over here! Shit! What is this?

76
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:14,674
Geez! This is driving me crazy!

77
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,894
You said you caught the culprit!

78
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,444
You said he was the one, and you got him!

79
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,214
So why did this happen again?

80
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,814
And why my child again?

81
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,154
What if something worse had happened to her?

82
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,854
- Dad. 
 - Geez!

83
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,910
That's enough.

84
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,220

85
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:50,374
 It's bad enough that he got to our Kyeong Ae...

86
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:55,424
 When I see him, I'm going to tear him up!

87
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,990

88
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:05,144
 Oh, my baby. What do we do?

89
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,964
 Soon Ae baby...

90
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,234

91
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:29,934

92
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,664
Just a moment.

93
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,624

94
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:56,434
A Bong Bong Cafe matchbox was found in Lee Soon Ae's possession.

95
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,374
There was a note inside it as well.

96
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:02,254
The sentence, "A woman who reads is dangerous," as well as the handwriting.

97
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:07,014
I'm sure of it. It's exactly the same as the ones he wrote before.

98
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:13,744
 Go Mi Sook was not the culprit. She was a witness.

99
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:19,044
 The culprit is a man, and the only person who knows his face is

100
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,144
 Go Mi Sook.

101
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:30,064
 It seems that the guy at the abandoned house really was the culprit.

102
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,804
Yes, right.

103
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:36,204
Call me as soon as the student Lee Soon Ae wakes up.

104
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:37,604
All right.

105
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,124
Yoon Hae Joon.

106
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,044
Between the night of the 16th and early morning of the 17th,

107
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:59,634
when Lee Joo Young and Lee Kyeong Ae were murdered,

108
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:04,504
where were you, and what were you doing?

109
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:11,454
What's going on?

110
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,764
Who is the culprit?

111
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:17,764
Who is it?

112
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,944
Why are you asking me that?

113
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,434
Another person died again.

114
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,814
This time it's a male student.

115
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,744
Someone in your grade from the same school.

116
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:32,274
A perfectly healthy guy died in an abandoned house. You know why?

117
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:35,224
Because if he didn't, Lee Soon Ae would have died.

118
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:39,654
What are you talking about?

119
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:43,914
I'm saying the real culprit almost killed Soon Ae!

120
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,884
And he died while trying to save her! All because of you!

121
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:49,644
Why is that all my fault?

122
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,724
If only you had reported it honestly in the first place.

123
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:06,684
If only the police hadn't wasted time arresting the wrong person because of your lies.

124
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:09,584
This wouldn't have happened.

125
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:17,304
I don't know what you heard from whom, but...

126
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,734
I don't know anything.

127
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,384
Cut the bullshit and just say it.

128
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,834
Who is the culprit!

129
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,584
Who do you think you are, telling me what to do?

130
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:38,750
Who the hell are you that you keep showing up and interfering with my life?

131
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:45,534
In any case, your plans are...

132
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:49,234
all ruined now, Go Mi Sook.

133
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,554
They arrested the Korean language teacher.

134
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,214
What?

135
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:01,304
Now they might blame him for everything.

136
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,034
What are you talking about?

137
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,534
I'm saying everything got tangled up.

138
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:14,234
How could Go Min Soo have killed anyone if he was in custody the whole time?

139
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:19,484
The police will need to find a new culprit and of all people!

140
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:33,094
Go Mi Sook, I know why you did it.

141
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:35,114
But this isn't right.

142
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:38,764
You're putting too many people in danger.

143
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,724
I'll help you find another way.

144
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,864
So just help us this one time.

145
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,764
Just tell us who the culprit is, and...

146
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,204
Let go.

147
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:52,584
I don't need any help from you.

148
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:55,244
I don't know anything, so just go.

149
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,304
I already know you showed up at Lee Kyeong Ae's murder scene.

150
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:08,374
I'm asking about before that.

151
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,774
Where were you, and what were you doing?

152
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:15,904
I was with Yoo Beom Ryong. Even back then.

153
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:22,854
Yoo Beom Ryong had called me.

154
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,334
Back then, too.

155
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,704
 Mr. Yoon, she's dead.

156
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,524
 She's dead.

157
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,954
 In the end, it became like that.

158
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,094
He was looking at Lee Joo Young's dead body?

159
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,794
He was terrified and called me, his homeroom teacher.

160
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,784
He was afraid to go to the police.

161
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:52,204
 They say she's a commie.

162
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,884
 If they find out that I saw her twice and didn't even report it...

163
00:12:55,884 --> 00:13:00,474
You know very well why he was that afraid of being mixed up with

164
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:04,424
Ms. Lee Joo Young. With your nephew's situation and all.

165
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,094
If you're thinking about putting all the blame

166
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,154
on Yoo Beom Ryong right now...

167
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:15,904
I'm just answering honestly since you asked about my alibi.

168
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,734
Yoo Beom Ryong is not the culprit.

169
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:24,134
You can tell just by looking at the handwriting. That goes the same for me.

170
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,824
You'll get a better picture when you go to the school.

171
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,924
He couldn't have possibly forged

172
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:33,544
his writing for all the past exams, assignments, and everything else.

173
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,394
Then, what is this?

174
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:47,644
Why was this in your pocket?

175
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,664
I picked that up.

176
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,614
Are you playing games with me right now?

177
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:59,504
I know it's a damn twisted situation.

178
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,074
But you know there are many ways to check.

179
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,394
Like my handwriting,

180
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,704
and asking Lee Soon Ae.

181
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,014
Hear her out when she wakes up.

182
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:12,234
Who she was running away from.

183
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:15,894
Why Yoo Beom Ryong had to die there.

184
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:19,944
I'm so curious. It's driving me crazy!

185
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,874
Whenever I ran into you,

186
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:32,434
I thought you were suspicious numerous times.

187
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,544
So I'll take this opportunity to find out once and for all.

188
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,834
Why you were at all those places.

189
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,514
Look forward to it.

190
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,114
It will be tough to get out of it this time.

191
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:49,274
 I know it doesn't make any sense, but

192
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:54,644
 you seem like someone who came on purpose to save me, Mr. Yoon.

193
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:55,514
 Thank you.

194
00:15:55,514 --> 00:16:00,554
 Oh, I was going to give that for Soon Ae's tuition! Seriously...

195
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,244
 Soon Ae, it's your teacher.

196
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:12,504
 Mr. Yoon! I'm being chased by the culprit!

197
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,414
 Beom Ryong, wake up! Beom Ryong!

198
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:22,334
 No matter what happens, I'll wait for you at our house.

199
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:25,134
 So hurry back.

200
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,184
 Don't get hurt anywhere.

201
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:29,154
 I'll do that.

202
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,614

203
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:29,034
Who is he? He's been here crying since last night.

204
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,724
The one who went on our rooftop...

205
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,084
What?

206
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,214
Then he's the punk who...

207
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,374
Goodness!

208
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:39,044
Just leave him alone.

209
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:41,674
He had suffered because of us.

210
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:45,724
He was arrested even though he was innocent.

211
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:51,474
He kept his mouth shut to protect our Soon Ae.

212
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:54,334
I don't think he ate anything all day, either.

213
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,934
Who does he think he is, starving himself?

214
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:04,244
Who are you to starve yourself because of Soon Ae?

215
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:08,074
They said her shock was too great,

216
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:12,444
but there's nothing wrong with her, so she'll wake up soon. Okay?

217
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,144
Go ahead and eat.

218
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,864
Geez.

219
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:32,284
I don't think I can swallow the food.

220
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,324
Soon Ae's still lying there like that.

221
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:38,034
How scary...

222
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,424
and terrifying it must have been for her

223
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,634
that she can't even wake up!

224
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:47,234
That bastard.

225
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:51,794
When he's caught, he better watch out.

226
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,934
Then you have to eat more, punk!

227
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,674
You're too skinny for a guy!

228
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,394
Come on.

229
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:01,134
Ah.

230
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,734
Ah!

231
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,024
Eat like this. Hurry!

232
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:11,894
Come on now. Hold your chopsticks!

233
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,880

234
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,344
Come out.

235
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:56,170

236
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,894
What is this?

237
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,914
What happened?

238
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,344
Your identification, resume, and teacher certification.

239
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:35,384
They're all fake.

240
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,304
I'm asking you what's going on.

241
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:41,324
Just in case, I searched all your prior jobs and addresses you jotted down.

242
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:46,394
But... there were no signs of anyone named Yoo Hae Joon having been there.

243
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:51,824
In fact, there wasn't even a record of you ever being born!

244
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:54,454
Do you know what this means?

245
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:58,084
Do you know this is a more serious situation than murder?

246
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,264
Tell the truth while I'm giving you a chance.

247
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:12,984
I want to turn you and Baek Yoon Young over for espionage charges.

248
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:16,554
But I'm trying to hold back and hear you out.

249
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:20,074
Because of the debt I owe you.

250
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:23,354
 You're wrong, Uncle.

251
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:30,514
 You probably don't know since you never came to visit me at the hospital.

252
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:34,554
 But if it wasn't for that teacher,

253
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:37,984
 I don't know what would have happened to Brother and me.

254
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:42,804
 He came by every day just to tap our shoulders.

255
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:47,194
 He seemed more like a guardian.

256
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:51,754
 A guardian that my brother and I no longer have.

257
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:55,074
Instead of a dimwitted and foolish uncle like me,

258
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,954
my nephews...

259
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:01,374
Since I owe you for protecting those poor kids, all this nonsensical stuff...

260
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:06,284
I brought over the suspicious things I don't even need to question you about.

261
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,764
Talk!

262
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:16,434
Explain in a way that will help me understand!

263
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:21,354
If I do, will you believe me?

264
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,944
Everything.

265
00:23:28,944 --> 00:23:34,014
If I tell you honestly, will you believe me?

266
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,634
What?

267
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,914
I have something to show you.

268
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:43,204
Also, I don't at all consider it as a debt.

269
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:47,134
But if that's how you see it, then let me see those benefits

270
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,524
just this once.

271
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:55,364
I would like you to bring Director Yoon Byeong Gu to my house.

272
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:56,672
Right now.

273
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,062
What's the meaning of this situation?

274
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:01,802
Oh, well... that is...

275
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,772
Oh, gosh.

276
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,452
Please come this way.

277
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:19,092
All right.

278
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,612
Yes.

279
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:51,932
What is all this...

280
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,970
Wait!  What is this?

281
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,872

282
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:03,422
How do you have an article from 1988?

283
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,672

284
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:21,432
This is the address I wrote down. Why is it here?

285
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,362
I thought you'd believe me only if you saw it yourself.

286
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,142
That...

287
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,222
I came from the future.

288
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:48,882
I came from a distant future, but we are closer than you think.

289
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:55,202
Director Yoon Byeong Gu is the father of my father.

290
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:58,872
And your nephew Baek Hee Seop's future daughter

291
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,562
is Baek Yoon Young, who is living with me now.

292
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:05,522
Although you've run into her a few times already.

293
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:19,512
So you're saying, you came here in a time machine?

294
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,542
Yes.

295
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:26,292
Because the wrong culprit was arrested here,

296
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,492
you ended up dying.

297
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:33,432
So that's why you came here to catch the culprit yourself.

298
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,312
Is that it?

299
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,802
Yes.

300
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:45,662
I'm sorry, Director Yoon. We can get going now.

301
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:47,562
I believed such a crazy bastard, and

302
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:50,812
made you listen to this nonsense in the middle of the night.

303
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:54,592
All right, get up. Get up, you bastard!

304
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,522
A bastard like you should be sent to the NSA or to the mental hospital!

305
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:00,702
I'll definitely send you to one of them, so...

306
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,702
Goodness! T-That... T-That...

307
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:07,852
Could you please show that to me?

308
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,782

309
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,712
O-Oh...

310
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,522
then...

311
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:46,542
are you really... my grandson?

312
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:51,062
Yes.

313
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:54,262
Dong Shik. Dong Shik!

314
00:27:55,362 --> 00:28:00,772
Director Yoon, what are you doing? Are you actually believing this nonsense right now?

315
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:03,092
I mean, it's just that...

316
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:06,552
I know how crazy this seems, but...

317
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,792
That's the watch I bought yesterday at the jewelry shop in town.

318
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:13,102
They told me it was a rare piece that came from abroad.

319
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:16,052
I spent a lot of money on it so I could give it to my grandson later.

320
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:18,542
And that handwriting... I wrote that.

321
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,722
It's exactly the same thing I had engraved in the back.

322
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:25,852
Come on, how could I not recognize my own writing?

323
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,202
Where is it?

324
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:33,242
Didn't he steal it from you?

325
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,752
I received it this afternoon.

326
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:40,542
But you arrested him last night, didn't you?

327
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:45,672
I don't know what's going on, either.

328
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,042
But when he said he was my grandson,

329
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:56,492
I do feel loving toward him in an odd way.

330
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:07,672
No.

331
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:09,702
No, Director Yoon.

332
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:11,722
This doesn't make sense whatsoever.

333
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:16,542
We have to arrest him again immediately!

334
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:43,092
Soon Ae.

335
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,402
Soon Ae.

336
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:50,532
Soon Ae, do you know who I am?

337
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:52,622
I'm Yoon Young.

338
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:54,562
Soon Ae.

339
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:03,092
Oh, Mom! Mom...

340
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:07,552
Soon Ae! Thank you! Mom...

341
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:10,392
Yoon Young.

342
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:15,532
Gosh! Gosh, Soon Ae!

343
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:17,362
Mom.

344
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,762
Are you awake now?

345
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:21,042
I'm sorry.

346
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,082
Why are you sorry?

347
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,992
It's okay. You're awake now, so it's okay.

348
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:28,032
It's okay.

349
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:30,602
It's all right.

350
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:33,002
It's all right, my baby.

351
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:34,802
Mom.

352
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,082
Soon Ae.

353
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:58,142
Did you, by any chance, see the culprit's face?

354
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:10,132
No.

355
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:13,572
Mr. Yoon, the teacher who lives across from your house...

356
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,602
It's him, right?

357
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:21,412
What are you talking about?

358
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,342
Are you saying Mr. Yoon is the culprit?

359
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,092
No way. That doesn't make any sense.

360
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:53,212
â™«  You, who came to me like a coincidence  â™«

361
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:59,552
â™«  Do you remember the first day we met?  â™«

362
00:31:59,552 --> 00:32:06,642
â™«  Everything seemed unfamiliar when our eyes met  â™«

363
00:32:06,642 --> 00:32:12,440
â™«  With only our awkward smiles  â™«

364
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:21,552
â™«  When flowers bloom in spring, and rain falls in the summer  â™«

365
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:26,142
Thank you for returning to me safely.

366
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,862
â™«  Even though I didn't know at first  â™«

367
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:34,872
â™«  You, who came to me like fate  â™«

368
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,552
I'm sorry.

369
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:42,090
I'm the one who's sorry.

370
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:06,502
Do you think... we looked like relatives just now?

371
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:12,202
Not exactly...

372
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:19,132
But it's all right.

373
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,902
I told them everything anyway.

374
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:30,142
But did you know I was home?

375
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,962
Soon Ae woke up.

376
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:42,332
She told the detectives everything that happened that day.

377
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:46,962
And who saved her.

378
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:54,082
Mr. Yoon was the one who came to help me.

379
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,022
Let's go.

380
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,912
Yes. I got it.

381
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:05,642
Pardon?

382
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:10,712
No.

383
00:34:11,702 --> 00:34:14,012
There was nothing particularly suspicious.

384
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,382
Yes.

385
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,592
Thank you, Dong Shik.

386
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,422
It's not because I believe him.

387
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:26,012
Since you kept begging me, so for now...

388
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:28,502
But this is not enough.

389
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,752
I need something more definitive.

390
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:36,972
You saw the search for divided families on TV, right? 
  (Families separated during the Korean War)

391
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:40,182
I heard they do this at times.

392
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:41,942
Did it hurt?

393
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:43,862
It's just taking some blood.

394
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,192
Although I don't know what the results will be.

395
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:48,502
We have to know.

396
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:53,102
If the results come out wrong, I'll send you off to either NSA or the mental hospital.

397
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,872
All right. All right.

398
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,622
I released you because of Director Yoon. Not because of you.

399
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:01,782
I don't believe any of the absurdity.

400
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:04,172
So I'll keep my eyes on you until the results come out.

401
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:07,452
Don't you dare think about doing anything foolish. Just stay home.

402
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,840
You can't go to school, either.

403
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,360
I'll go and check often. Got that?

404
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,082
Well...

405
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:24,802
Never mind. Gosh. Well...

406
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:29,722
Who did our Hee Seop marry?

407
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:34,942
My mom is Lee Soon Ae.

408
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:36,822
Lee Soon Ae. Lee Soon Ae.

409
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:40,352
So you're saying the bus terminal's Hyeong Man is...

410
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,432
Oh, I see.

411
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:54,892
T-Then, you knew who I was from the beginning?

412
00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:56,962
I found out after I arrived here.

413
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:00,712
I didn't know my dad had any older relatives in his life.

414
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:02,822
Why not?

415
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,922
How could you not know about me?

416
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:10,242
It seems he wasn't in touch with you anymore.

417
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:13,172
He never told me about you, either.

418
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,070
Let's get going.

419
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,620

420
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,632
That bastard.

421
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:40,402
He said he doesn't believe any of it, and yet...

422
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:42,682
he looks pretty hurt, doesn't he?

423
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:44,552
Yes, he does.

424
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:49,832
You really didn't get hurt anywhere. Right?

425
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,592
You're not hiding an injury from me because it can't be seen. Right?

426
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,342
He wasn't like that.

427
00:37:00,502 --> 00:37:07,382
I was so worried that something might've happened to you.

428
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:21,222
I bet I was even more scared.

429
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:24,462
I was worried you'd be in danger because of me.

430
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,992
That I had ruined everything.

431
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:31,712
Although I feel like that a little bit already.

432
00:37:37,782 --> 00:37:39,372
I will catch him no matter what.

433
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:46,232
I will make him pay fully for all his crimes so far.

434
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:49,332
We're really close now.

435
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:51,142
We found out the person who knows the culprit.

436
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:57,102
And at least one detective is on our side.

437
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:05,552
Our side?

438
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,542
I don't think so.

439
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:17,022
He says surveillance, but it will soon become cooperation.

440
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:23,032
Half of him believes us already, and the other half will soon follow.

441
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:24,622
How?

442
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:30,292
There's no way he can beat the person who knows the future.

443
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:38,492
Hey!

444
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:41,372
Give me one.

445
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,762
What's up with the newspaper?

446
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:57,612
If today is June 7th, the article on building new highways must be on the front page.

447
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:03,962

From Daejeon to Jinju. From Cheongju to Sangju.

448
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:08,402

From Cheonan to Nonsan. I think that's what they said.

449
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,762
You came to keep an eye on me. Right?

450
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:15,522
 The catcher Kim Jong Min came in.

451
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,362
 Here is the first throw! The first base caught it. Tag!

452
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:20,692
This is quite stifling.

453
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,522
I can't even go outside.

454
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,602
 Now, the foul ball. It's high.

455
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:32,152
All these games bore me to death since I know all the results already.

456
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,172
 The third base.

457
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:35,872
Pintos 5. Lions 4.

458
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,932
Pintos' victory.

459
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:40,570
 Pintos win!

460
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,192
 The game is over!

461
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:48,992

462
00:39:58,102 --> 00:40:01,292
â™«  Jjarabbabba you are beautiful  â™«

463
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:04,542
â™«  Jjajjara jjarabbabbabba  â™«

464
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,802
â™«  Jjarabbabba you're so dependable  â™«

465
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:10,882
â™«  Jjajjara jjarabbabbabba  â™«

466
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:14,132
â™«  Jjarabbabba don't be shy  â™«

467
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:17,482
â™«  Jjajjara jjarabbabbabba  â™«

468
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,562
The red thigh band wins 3-2 with a comeback win.

469
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:24,560
â™«  Jjajjara bbabbabba  â™«

470
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,902
How about you just take a chance and believe me?

471
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:50,202
You know we don't have much time right now.

472
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:57,082
The culprit who murdered three people is still roaming around even as we speak.

473
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:20,122
In any case, I'm not supposed to be here.

474
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:26,082
Even if we catch the culprit, there's nothing more I can do from that point.

475
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:29,522
Detective, you have to take care of the rest.

476
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:34,962
I'll share with you everything I know.

477
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:40,362
So from this point onward, why don't we try to work together?

478
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:44,612

479
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:52,266
Are you saying Go Mi Sook lied?

480
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:58,536
Instead of reporting the real culprit, she planned to frame her older brother.

481
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:05,526
I did think Go Mi Sook was strange, but how could she do that to her family?

482
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:12,976
Well, not that I should be saying anything like that.

483
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:16,146
Didn't you do that because you really wanted to catch the right person?

484
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:22,536
You believed that the real culprit needs to pay for his crimes even if he is your family.

485
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:30,366
I know you went to see Baek Hee Seop and Baek Yoo Seop while they were in the hospital.

486
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,606
 Excuse me.

487
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:35,366
 Hello.

488
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:43,156
If things had unfolded originally, their situation would've been much worse.

489
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:45,706
Baek Hee Seop lived his life

490
00:42:45,706 --> 00:42:50,616
hating himself and the world due to what happened to his older brother.

491
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:55,226
And you, Detective, you lived your entire life guilt-ridden.

492
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:59,036
In a way, successfully solving this case

493
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:02,526
could be an opportunity to change your future, Detective.

494
00:43:03,236 --> 00:43:06,076
The same goes for me, too.

495
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:23,786
So you're saying, let's try our best together? Is that it?

496
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,566
We'll find out if you're crazy or not when the test results come out.

497
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:36,386
Maybe it's because we talked too much. I feel like I've gone crazy, too.

498
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:42,836
Then... should I meet Go Mi Sook first?

499
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:51,806
Man, I guess he's helpful as a dad, after all.

500
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:58,676
Dad? We don't know that yet!

501
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:01,206
- Gosh... 
 - Dong Shik, is that you?

502
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:06,146
- What brings you here at this hour? 
 - Oh, Dong Shik.

503
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:10,986
Please let me go outside for a bit with Mr. Yoon.

504
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:13,566
Oh, well. That's...

505
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:17,356
I beg you, Dong Shik.

506
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:24,866

507
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:27,536
He said I can't leave no matter what.

508
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:32,486
On the condition that I'd stick by you the whole time.

509
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,806
You know how trustworthy I am.

510
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,436
I mean, your grandpa is.

511
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:46,726
Why are you so surprised? I'm the one who feels awkward.

512
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,266
You must be used to it by now.

513
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:54,746
If I say "Hae Joon," you should say "Yes, Grandpa..."

514
00:44:57,086 --> 00:44:59,006
Gosh! My goodness!

515
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:03,476
This feels... so strange.

516
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:08,156
While we are at it, why don't we try calling each otherâ€”

517
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:09,556
Please have some.

518
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,106
Yes.

519
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:30,876
I always wanted to drink soju like this with my grandson.

520
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:33,406
You've accepted it already, even without the results yet.

521
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:35,846
Those results are for other people.

522
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:38,636
I can recognize my own bloodline.

523
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,196
That suits you perfectly.

524
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,236
Here, show it to me.

525
00:45:50,236 --> 00:45:52,156
Come on.

526
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,556
If you look over here,

527
00:46:02,556 --> 00:46:06,736
I had something engraved for you in my handwriting.

528
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:11,026
"Tempus fugit, amor manet."

529
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:13,490
Do you know what it means?

530
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,416
"Time flies, but love endures."

531
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:19,986
You know it well!

532
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,096
Just as expected!

533
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:26,856
But why did you write something creepy like this?

534
00:46:28,926 --> 00:46:30,776
Does it seem that way?

535
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:39,926
Well, I thought it'd be nice for you to look at that when life gets difficult.

536
00:46:39,926 --> 00:46:44,716
Thinking, "My grandpa really loved me,

537
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:52,186
preparing a gift like this even before I was born while waiting for me and bought it for me."

538
00:46:57,996 --> 00:47:04,706
As time passes by, even after I leave this world,

539
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:09,386
the love for my grandson would last 100 or 200 years.

540
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:15,166
I was hoping that love would continue to protect you.

541
00:47:27,256 --> 00:47:31,796
Anyway, who is Yeon Woo's partner?

542
00:47:33,606 --> 00:47:35,526
Wait, then, are you saying...

543
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:40,466
Bong Bong Cafe's Chung Ah is your mom and my daughter-in-law?

544
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:41,996
Really?

545
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:44,336
Whether it's true or not, walk straight ahead!

546
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:45,926
Walk straight...

547
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:48,246
Hey! Wait, wait. It's here!

548
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:52,746
- This is where your mom is! 
 - Quiet...

549
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:54,986
- Be quiet. 
 - Let's go up and see.

550
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:57,616
Come on, let's go!

551
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:02,946
Let's see what your mom is doing right now. Just take a peek with grandpa.

552
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,006
Oh, gosh! What's there to see? Let's just walk straight home.

553
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:08,276
Come on, let's see!

554
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,836
Gosh! Walk straight! Straight.

555
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:12,926
We should go see...

556
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:18,456
So easy for you to call yourself grandpa!

557
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:20,476
You darn gramps.

558
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:28,056
Drink in moderation! Moderation.

559
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:31,556
You'll suffer from high blood pressure later. Okay?

560
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:47,816
I was just a darn gramps to you, wasn't I?

561
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:55,996
My precious baby...

562
00:48:57,636 --> 00:49:00,076
How dare he...

563
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:25,940

564
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:39,860

565
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,556
You won!

566
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:17,996
Everything is free today.

567
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:22,346
You just won as the 20,000th customer at Bong Bong Cafe.

568
00:50:23,176 --> 00:50:24,996
How ridiculous...

569
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,076
I'm serious, though.

570
00:50:27,076 --> 00:50:30,736
I know I shouldn't talk to you unnecessarily or give you menu recommendations,

571
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,506
but I can't do that to my 20,000th customer.

572
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:38,306
Sit down. I'll make you a ssanghwa tea. Okay?

573
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,806
Why are you sitting here?

574
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:10,246
Well...

575
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:17,556
I'm using "20,000th customer" as an excuse to talk to you.

576
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:21,046
With you, Yoon Hae Joon.

577
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:26,576
Out of all those names, how could you be named Hae Joon?

578
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:30,416
Did your boyfriend tell you my name?

579
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:36,866
Why did you look at me that way when we ran into each other at the movie theater?

580
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,116
What? How did I look at you?

581
00:51:41,116 --> 00:51:45,106
Then you ignored me completely for a while after that.

582
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:50,456
Is this an interrogation?

583
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:52,746
No, it's not like that.

584
00:51:57,856 --> 00:52:02,166
Eating too much of a good thing isn't good since it makes me nauseous.

585
00:52:03,776 --> 00:52:06,606
This is my tenth ssanghwa tea.

586
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,576
Why can't you have it anymore?

587
00:52:11,096 --> 00:52:12,986
Since that's the last one.

588
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,586
You're the last customer.

589
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:18,996
The last one?

590
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:25,976
I'm going to close this cafe now.

591
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:30,616
I'm going to leave this town.

592
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:43,216
You're leaving this town?

593
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:48,436
Yeon Woo, no...

594
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:53,046
How about your boyfriend? Does he know this?

595
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:55,716
Of course, he doesn't know.

596
00:52:55,716 --> 00:52:58,096
I'm telling you, especially.

597
00:52:58,096 --> 00:53:00,226
Why me?

598
00:53:00,226 --> 00:53:01,906
I don't know.

599
00:53:01,906 --> 00:53:04,346
Maybe you were destined to hear it.

600
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:06,426
That's why you came right at that moment.

601
00:53:06,426 --> 00:53:10,296
Knowing that I'm itching to divulge a secret?

602
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:15,346
What's your reason for leaving?

603
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:24,616
If you wanted to know that, too, you should've been friends with me sooner.

604
00:53:24,616 --> 00:53:26,646
It's too late now.

605
00:53:26,646 --> 00:53:29,536
I should start cleaning up now.

606
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:42,900

607
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:47,986
Why is she leaving already?

608
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:57,620

609
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:04,436
When did you get here, Hyung?

610
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:08,136
Just now.

611
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,666
It's quite late.

612
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:17,046
Is it? I was so focused that I lost track of time again.

613
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:21,626
Since someone forgot to get me a toast again...

614
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:24,976
Oh, sorry. You didn't eat dinner, right?

615
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:29,376
No, that's all right. I can't think well when I'm full.

616
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:35,906
It was tough, huh?

617
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,296
Being falsely accused like that.

618
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:41,826
I heard you saved someone.

619
00:54:41,826 --> 00:54:44,736
You were actually a good person.

620
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:47,576
I didn't even know that.

621
00:54:48,276 --> 00:54:53,006
Well! I should go see my girlfriend.

622
00:54:53,006 --> 00:54:55,176
You're going to see your girlfriend now?

623
00:54:55,176 --> 00:55:01,026
Yes. I've been spending so much time here that I haven't seen her much lately.

624
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:04,446
I think she might be mad at me because of that.

625
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:06,996
I'll hurry over to get some brownie points. I can do that. Right?

626
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:09,076
I'll have my toast next time.

627
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:21,886

628
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,290

629
00:55:57,656 --> 00:56:00,576
Did you meet your girlfriend all right last night?

630
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:03,766
Yes. We enjoyed a nice date for the first time in a while.

631
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:06,086
Is that so?

632
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:08,206
E-Everything is okay, right?

633
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:10,066
Yeah, just as usual.

634
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,186
How come? Should there be something?

635
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:16,136
No, I was just asking.

636
00:56:16,136 --> 00:56:19,566
What in the world? That's so random.

637
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:23,116
Here.

638
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:25,006
Thank you.

639
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:29,746
They really brought a lot.

640
00:56:29,746 --> 00:56:33,986
Seriously. I don't know why they brought so much.

641
00:56:33,986 --> 00:56:35,436
I'm really all right.

642
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:38,306
I guess they wanted to console you, at least in that way.

643
00:56:38,306 --> 00:56:41,066
So you can shake it off and get back on your feet.

644
00:57:13,506 --> 00:57:16,486
Are you feeling better?

645
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:18,266
Yes.

646
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:26,106
I heard you were falsely accused and went through a lot because of me.

647
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:30,086
Soon Ae, I'm sorry I didn't find you sooner.

648
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:32,896
Oh, no.

649
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:37,926
If it weren't for you, he would've caught me right away.

650
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:42,426
When I saw your face on that dark and scary road,

651
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:45,856
I suddenly thought, "I survived!"

652
00:57:45,856 --> 00:57:49,046
You have no idea how relieved I was.

653
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:58,636
So how did you get out?

654
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:03,756
Because now I can.

655
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:15,076
You must have had many visitors.

656
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:18,286
Yes. Many townspeople came by.

657
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,266
And you know how our homeroom teacher is.

658
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:26,426
He brought over a crowd of students every night, and they were all so loud.

659
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:30,866
Instead of feeling rested, it felt so chaotic.

660
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:11,490

661
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:36,916
Since when was this here?

662
00:59:53,136 --> 01:00:00,660

663
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:24,676
 The culprit has been here.

664
01:00:29,006 --> 01:00:32,876
 Perhaps to remove the traces of his failure.

665
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:52,020

666
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:59,476
â™«  When flowers bloom in spring, and rain falls in the summer  â™«

667
01:00:59,476 --> 01:01:05,796
â™«  The time we spend together becomes more comfortable

668
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:14,096
â™«  Even though I didn't know at first, you, who came to me like fate  â™«

669
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:18,340
â™«  My heart that looks at you  â™«
