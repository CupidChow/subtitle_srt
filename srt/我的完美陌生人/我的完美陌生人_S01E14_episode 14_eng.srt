1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,900

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,593

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,143

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,633

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,830
That shameless and horrible bastard! How could he show up here?

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,620
How dare he threaten her with such a note!

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,800
I should have seen that shameless bastard myself!

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
Please calm down and get in the car, Mr. Lee.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,110
Geez! What a shameless bastard!

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,600
Yoon Young, get in the car.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,740
Let's go to our house for now. Okay?

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,090
Okay.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,260
What a crazy bastard.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,200
He's an extremely daring guy.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,050
He even strolled in here to give a warning, huh?

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,960
This means he's not scared of whether he'll get caught or not.

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,940
Is that how you see it?

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,820
I see it as the opposite.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,360
He feels he's in a tight spot now. He's scared he'd get caught.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,170
He's trying to keep her mouth shut by threatening her this way.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,230
It's the first time he failed while trying to murder someone.

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,540
He's now panicking at the thought of his victim still being alive.

23
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,840
But how come there are two detectives?

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,530
- What? 
 - Is there a more important case than this in this town?

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,230
How come only two detectives rushed over after receiving the call?

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,700
Well, that's...

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,460
I guess the police don't want to make a big deal out of it.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,300
This time, too.

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,130

Does it make sense for just the two of us to go?

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,300
 It wouldn't be enough if we were all dispatched!

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,440
 They said the culprit came by! The culprit!

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,170
 Who says it was the culprit?

33
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,840
 - What did you say? 
 - What if it's just a guy playing around with a note?

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,920
 How can you conclude that it's the culprit?

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,750
 Don't make a scene and go there quietly.

36
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,560
 Just bring that note to me right away. I'll check it myself.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
 Got it?

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,300

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,470

40
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,380
 He's throwing a fit, telling us to catch him somehow. What can we do?

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,150
 Forget the Police Commissioner...

42
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,830
 His current position is precarious, so he can't give it more time.

43
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,580
 Then what can our chief do?

44
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,910
 To make Go Min Soo the culprit since he's in custody already.

45
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,470
 Then, we make it seem like Go Min Soo killed Lee Joo Young and Lee Kyeong Ae, and the others are by someone else?

46
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,720
 That's right!

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,400
 Then we've at least got one case sorted out.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,760
 Even though we didn't find it on Yoo Beom Ryong,

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,380
 there was evidence on the female student Lee Soon Ae.

50
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,290
 The same handwriting. "A woman who reads is dangerous." This.

51
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,470
 Exactly. So as long as there's no note, it all makes sense.

52
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,020
 Then, even that note found in the patient's room today...

53
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,760
 It shouldn't have been there.

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,480

55
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,610
Detective, thank you very much for bringing us home.

56
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,160
No, it's nothing.

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,460
In any case, you can't tell anyone about what happened tonight for now.

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,480
Since it could interfere with the investigation.

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,250
Do you understand what I mean?

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,850
Of course!

61
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,850
Detective, all I ask is that you just catch that culprit, please!

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,910

63
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,890
Why are you just leaving?

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,310
The culprit could've been one of the people who visited the patient's room.

65
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,250
How come you don't ask who came by?

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh, that. There's a separate process for that. If you wait a little while...

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,240
Until when do we wait?

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,770
What are your plans from now on?

69
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,830
She even received a threatening note from the culprit.

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,460
You're not just going to send her home, and that's the end of it. Right?

71
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,370
Well, as for that... I'll go check at the police station.

72
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,020

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,540

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,410

(After the scheduled show air-time)

75
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,300
Where have you been? You said you would return soon.

76
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,420
I thought I could only face you after I came up with a plan.

77
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,750
Are they inside?

78
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,690
Let's talk inside.

79
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,550
You mean the news?

80
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,590
Yes. Broadcasting what happened last night.

81
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,310
After I left the hospital last night, I walked all over town.

82
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:51,210
But it was too quiet as if the police and townspeople had no idea what had happened.

83
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,940
That silence is not a safe situation for Soon Ae right now.

84
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,130
She even received a threatening note from the culprit.

85
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,840
But there isn't even a single policeman guarding this house.

86
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,770
Now, it's time for a major public investigation.

87
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,550
The police have to launch an active investigation.

88
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,270
If the police aren't willing to do that, then we will make them.

89
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,550
The surest way to achieve that is by going on the news.

90
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,940
If we go public with the incident first, then the police will have to act.

91
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,410
Once the police become active, then the culprit won't dare to approach Soon Ae easily.

92
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,350
As of now, this is the safest way to protect Soon Ae and catch the culprit.

93
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,920
But...

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,290
doesn't that mean we have to reveal Soon Ae's face on TV?

95
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,040
Like those interviews with the victim?

96
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,770
I understand your concerns.

97
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,070
We must keep her face and voice anonymous.

98
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,630
I know journalists who would do that for us.

99
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,510
I trust you, Mr. Yoon.

100
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,030
However, even if they do that for us,

101
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,060
other people won't recognize her, but the culprit will know.

102
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,320
Since this concerns my child,

103
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,440
I feel like this could become more dangerous.

104
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,050
Honestly, I don't really want to do that.

105
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,920
I never cooked a meal for you, Mr. Yoon. Have I?

106
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,900
I always wanted to make you a meal.

107
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,270
But since I prepared unexpectedly today,

108
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,700
please excuse us for not having too many side dishes.

109
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,340
Go ahead, child.

110
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,650
Yes.

111
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,400
Regardless of what happens,

112
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,270
even if...

113
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,880
such a heartbreaking event happens to my child,

114
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,980
a mother's heart longs to feed her family

115
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,580
no matter what.

116
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,380
Mr. Yoon, I know you're not my son,

117
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,080
but I still consider you as our family.

118
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,860
Otherwise, how could you think of us, care for us,

119
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,120
worry about us, and help us all this time?

120
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,150
As you said, it's someone else's business.

121
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,290
It's all someone else's business.

122
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,770
So, if you say that the news is really important,

123
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,880
I want to believe you.

124
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,840
As long as our Soon Ae's life is not in danger.

125
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,120
Do you think you could do that?

126
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,460
Honey.

127
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,450
Do you know what the police told us the most thus far?

128
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,140
"Calm down." "Stay quiet."

129
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,450
So, has anything been solved that way so far?

130
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,640
If we sit still out of fear, what about our Soon Ae?

131
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,810
How long will she have to live in hiding like that?

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,410
 I want to do it. The news.

133
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,700
I also want to do it.

134
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm not the one who did anything wrong.

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,660
The one who should be afraid is the culprit, not me.

136
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,390
I know it must be tough for the family.

137
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,480
Thank you for doing this important interview.

138
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,570
Focus on the family members.

139
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,570
- Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! Straighten your shirt. 
 - Yes.

140
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,210
You have to blur out her face and completely change her voice.

141
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,240
They must be curious about the assailant's face, not the victim's.

142
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,100
Of course.

143
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,420
It would be good if there was anything we could actually show.

144
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,500
The police took the matchbox and note from last night. Right?

145
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,330
Yes. We submitted everything.

146
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,360
All right. We'll just go ahead with what we have.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,190
Mr. Kim, let's start the interview.

148
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,390
What are you doing over here?

149
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,350
And what about you? What are you up to over there?

150
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,940

151
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,990
How can you expose the case that the police are investigating to the media so recklessly?

152
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,740
Without any evidence.

153
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,800
But are you allowed to sneak evidence like this?

154
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,360
If it stayed there, I don't know when it'd disappear.

155
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,020
You were right.

156
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,690
Well, why would a person from the future lie about that?

157
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
But still, I didn't expect us to be that bad.

158
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,900
There's one more thing that disappeared.

159
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,990

160
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,580
 When Lee Soon Ae ran away from the abandoned house,

161
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,790
 she had a note in her pocket. That disappeared.

162
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,810
You know what that means, right?

163
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,120
That's why you called them. Those TV people.

164
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm never going to let it get covered up.

165
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,280
There's going to be a shit show.

166
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,400
Chief! Chief!

167
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,080
- Chief! 
 - What?

168
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,300
The Seoul Broadcasting Station is going around to cover the incident...

169
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,310
The whole town's talking right now.

170
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,100
Seoul Broadcasting Station?

171
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,710
One, two, three, go.

172
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,380
In the town of Woojeong Village, which was selected as a "Crime-free village" for five years in a row,

173
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,470
there were a total of three murders in the past month.

174
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,430
 The town will become noisier and noisier.

175
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,950
Last May, the killer who brutally murdered two women

176
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,940
left behind a unique mark on each of the women's bodies.

177
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,540
One of them is a note written by him and left in this matchbox.

178
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,390
It's from the cafe that young people frequent the most in town.

179
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,460
Due to these facts, the police believe

180
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,090
the culprit may be a young man from this town who frequents Bong Bong Cafe.

181
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,900
The suspect could be among the cafe customers...

182
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,880
 Everyone will be talking about the culprit every day.

183
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,620
 The culprit will definitely be looking at what's going on from somewhere.

184
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,280
While the town is anxious due to the culprit being loose out there,

185
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,300
the surviving victim of an additional attempted murder on the 4th

186
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,280
was threatened by the culprit again.

187
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,410
This news has shocked the whole town.

188
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,420
As soon as I saw this handwriting,

189
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,050
I felt as though the culprit was watching me by my side.

190
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,130
But the police are still not taking any action on the matter.

191
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,070
H-How could that be possible?

192
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:14,820
Our police will try their best to protect the victim, and...

193
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,220
 The situation will start changing slowly.

194
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,410
If you see anyone suspicious during your patrol, be sure to report it to me.

195
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,510
Hello.

196
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,450
We'll stay right here and guard your house 24/7. You can rest assured.

197
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,320
One month has passed since the investigation started. And there isn't any progress?

198
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,480
Well, of course not!

199
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,310
We already have a very strong suspect in custody.

200
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,910
We plan to send him to prosecution soon, and...

201
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,390
 If the situation doesn't change, we have to change it.

202
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,730
People can rest assured.

203
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,530
It seems they're trying to turn Go Min Soo into a culprit, even if it means covering it up.

204
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,610
As long as he remains in custody,

205
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,400
it would be difficult to conduct a proper investigation.

206
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,450
What about Go Mi Sook? Do you have anything yet?

207
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,710
What are you talking about exactly?

208
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,390
Detective, I've never lied to you.

209
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,880
Go Mi Sook,

210
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,230
do you even realize how dangerous it is to deceive the police?

211
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,350
If you tell me the truth now, I'll overlook your mistake.

212
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,130
But this is the last chance I can give you.

213
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,730
When we find the real culprit later, then

214
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,660
I can't say how big of a punishment you'll face.

215
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,230
Do you think it's easy to turn in my only brother as a murderer?

216
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,770
I finally told you after hesitating and agonizing hundreds of times a day over the guilt of reporting my family member.

217
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,040
But if you suspect me like this...

218
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,090
I really saw him.

219
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,870
My brother by the river that night.

220
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,130
Even if we find evidence that Go Min Soo isn't the culprit,

221
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,210
she'll deny it.

222
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,340
Since that's her last escape.

223
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,400
We can't just wait for that answer.

224
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,050
The more the reporters pressure them, the faster the police will try to come up with an answer.

225
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,370
Well, if it was according to our method,

226
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,250
we could get a confession out of him in a few days.

227
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,990
Even if the guy's trash, we can't frame him for a crime he didn't commit.

228
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,130
That would only help the culprit.

229
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,170
How can we get him out...

230
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,240
when Go Min Sook isn't budging at all?

231
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,160
By chance,

232
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,960
do you think I could meet him?

233
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,300

234
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,640
Someone will stand guard.

235
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,140
Finish it in under five minutes, no matter what.

236
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,570
On the night of the 16th,

237
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,230
do you remember running into me?

238
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,410
 Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

239
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,590
 He won't die.

240
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,200
 I-I-I think it's broken!

241
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,550
I'm trying to get you out of here right now.

242
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,480
Don't try to make up stuff. Try to remember

243
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,960
what you did and where you were after that.

244
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,840
Are you going to tell the police

245
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,730
about Lee Kyeong Ae?

246
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,900
That night,

247
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,060
you had hurt your hand.

248
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,970
How did you treat it?

249
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,980
Did Go Mi Sook help you?

250
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,650
Mi Sook?

251
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,800
 Shit!

252
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,770
 Hey, I'm so thirsty.

253
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,200
 Go and get me something to drink.

254
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,510
 Huh?

255
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,670

256
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,980
I feel like we took a taxi of some sort, and went to the hospital.

257
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,730
But I kept falling asleep, so...

258
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,850
Mi Sook would know where we went.

259
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,490
Taxi?

260
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,110

261
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,050
Here!

262
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,790
Good evening.

263
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,330
I'm Detective Baek Dong Shik. I spoke with you earlier.

264
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,160
You said you drove them from the night of the 16th to the morning of the 17th?

265
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,580
Yes.

266
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,770
By chance, was it them?

267
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,710
It's the alibi for Go Min Soo, whom the police claim is the prime suspect.

268
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,820

269
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,320
Wow!

270
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,130
Even if you're an informer, how did you manage to find stuff like this?

271
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,260
Are you really a Korean language teacher?

272
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,280
I don't think so.

273
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,110
He looks like one of us.

274
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,120
How many minutes do you think this will air?

275
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,740
To be honest, we came here thinking it would be one minute and 30 seconds.

276
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,020
But once we came, it turned to 3 minutes, 5 minutes...

277
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,100
We kept wanting more. Seems like there's a lot to cover.

278
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,560
Then, how about 20 minutes?

279
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,840
20 min—

280
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,840
I don't think Mr. Yoon doesn't know much about news, but

281
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,790
there's a basic format.

282
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,170
If we cover an incident for 20 minutes, people will—

283
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,000
Will they become tired of it?

284
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,510
I don't know very well, but

285
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,920
I'm sure the general audience would also want

286
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,930
to see in-depth coverage.

287
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,380
Don't all journalists have that kind of ambition to report such a story?

288
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,420
Hey, isn't that what you always wanted to try?

289
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,240
Twenty minutes each. Two segments.

290
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,250
Yes, it's true. But... how could I...

291
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,900
You just push for it.

292
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,580
Do you think that's possible?

293
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,350
I think so.

294
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,470
 Wow, the broadcasting world has improved so much!

295
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,890
 During my time...

296
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,990
 The time is 1989.

297
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,120
 Let's do two 20-minute weekend news and do an in-depth report.

298
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,350
 I was so green, and I just pushed for it.

299
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,910
 Aren't you tired of talking about "In my time..."

300
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,180
 Hey! Do you how groundbreaking that was in the history of our station?

301
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,780
 That punk...

302
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,580
 Could someone please remove the person who made groundbreaking history here?

303
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,430
 Anchors need to be like that!

304
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,860
 Fearless. Undaunted.

305
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,820
 He's so cool!

306
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,230
Can I do it?

307
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,940
If you do it, I think you'll make groundbreaking history.

308
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,930
- Do you think so? 
 - Pitch it to the director.

309
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,290
The name seems to be an alias, and

310
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,840
it states that the person was admitted on the night of the 16th to the 18th.

311
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,880
At this rate, Go Min Soo isn't it.

312
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,670
It's your responsibility to make sure...

313
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,700
he's totally not it, all you journalists.

314
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,440
However, we discovered that Mr. Go, the prime suspect in custody in the investigation,

315
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,160
has an alibi during the time of the incident.

316
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,940
Roll the camera as soon as the chief comes out.

317
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,460
Hey, he's coming out! Shoot!

318
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,250
Chief! Chief, can we interview you?

319
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,650
Is it true that Mr. Go, the prime suspect, has an alibi?

320
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,010
How do you know that already...

321
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,220
How will you conduct the investigation from now on?

322
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,180
Have you secured other suspects?

323
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,510
In the midst of local residents appealing for countermeasures against the crimes,

324
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,670
the only way police can dispel the distrust

325
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,390
 and renew the trust of Woojeong Village citizens,

326
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,720
 would be through responsible investigation.

327
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,780
What?

328
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,570
What's wrong?

329
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,030
Can I go somewhere for a bit?

330
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,320
All right. Go ahead.

331
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,060
I'll be right back.

332
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,370
Mi Sook!

333
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,420
What are you doing standing there? Let's go.

334
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,280
I said, what are you doing?

335
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,340
Hey, Go Mi Sook.

336
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,330
Who is this?

337
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,720
It's good to see you! It's been a while, hasn't it?

338
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,730
Why?

339
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,580
Did you forget we were supposed to meet today?

340
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,980
What's this? You're friends now?

341
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,067
That's good.

342
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,127
Let's all go inside, then.

343
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:30,597
Do you want to go back as soon as you got released?

344
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,967
Aren't you coming?

345
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:48,407
I'm going out for a bit.

346
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,077
All right.

347
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:01,207
I'm in a good mood today, anyway.

348
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,737
Go ahead.

349
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:05,047
I'll see you later at home.

350
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:44,687
Why did you help me?

351
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:04,827
Because of that necklace.

352
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:09,227
The necklace that you keep touching whenever you're nervous or annoyed.

353
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:14,277
And my useless habit of noticing things like that first.

354
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,817
That's the only reason.

355
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:27,807
How does it feel...

356
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,757
now that Go Min Soo is out?

357
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:46,147
Only now are you crying.

358
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:50,867
You didn't feel anything when other people were suffering.

359
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:55,247
Even as you watched the teacher dying here

360
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:58,517
by this cold riverside with no idea whatsoever.

361
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:03,267
Even as you watched your classmate suffer in pain when she lost her sister,

362
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:07,737
you only thought about using that to your advantage.

363
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,077
And now, you're crying?

364
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,820

365
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:05,347
Wait a minute.

366
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:13,527
I'm just going to take this one out.

367
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,717
Is it something important?

368
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:19,107
Why does an unmarried woman have baby's clothes?

369
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:21,647
Goodness! Baby's shoes and clothes...

370
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:23,227
Why so many?

371
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,397
Is someone having a baby?

372
00:32:25,397 --> 00:32:28,317
Oh, it must be a son!

373
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,307
I don't want to...

374
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,457
throw this away.

375
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:37,797
Please take everything else.

376
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:39,967
All right.

377
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,270

378
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:06,757
I called you because I was worried and curious about how things are going.

379
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:09,997
The whole town is talking. Are things all right?

380
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,767
Your grandson created that situation.

381
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:21,417
You should've stopped him if it'd be dangerous.

382
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:26,100
What if he draws attention for causing such a commotion as an outsider?

383
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,497
But thanks to him, many things got resolved.

384
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:32,137
Soon Ae was able to receive protection,

385
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:36,407
and he prevented an innocent person from being framed.

386
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,307
You've done enough, then.

387
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:43,427
The rest is up to the police.

388
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,977
Are you listening to me right now?

389
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,557
 Goodness! Baby's shoes and clothes... why do you have so many?

390
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:52,987
 Why so many?

391
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:55,037
 Is someone having a baby?

392
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,337
 I don't want to...

393
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,897
 throw this away.

394
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,577
 Please take everything else.

395
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,687
Look, my grandson!

396
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,347
Oh, yes.

397
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,937
Yes, I understand.

398
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,937
Do you mean that?

399
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:16,087
You won't interfere with anything dangerous and stay still. Okay?

400
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,937
Yes, and I have a favor to ask.

401
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:21,137
Oh, yes. What is it? Tell me, tell me.

402
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:26,167
Soon Ae probably didn't receive proper treatment due to the sudden discharge from the hospital.

403
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:30,497
I'm hoping she can be somewhere safe with her family. Not in this town.

404
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:33,677
Yes, yes. That was bothering me anyway.

405
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:37,297
I'll look into a good hospital in Seoul right away.

406
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,617
I'll send over the police officers as well.

407
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:41,037
All right.

408
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,547
Also,

409
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:46,877
may I borrow a car?

410
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,707
Yoon Young.

411
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:59,477
Were you waiting for me?

412
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,177
What's this car for?

413
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:07,107
I'll take your questions on the way.

414
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,397
Since it will take some time.

415
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:11,847
Are we going somewhere?

416
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:13,717
Somewhere pretty.

417
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:23,687
Get in.

418
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:32,477
Wow!

419
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:36,037
How do you like the ocean from 1987?

420
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:40,647
It does look slightly bluer...

421
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:43,047
Am I imagining it?

422
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:46,387
Then check when you return later.

423
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,817
I have tons of things to check.

424
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:56,167
So, what made you think about coming here?

425
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:01,407
I realized that I brought you out this far,

426
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:05,847
and haven't shown you beautiful scenery not even once.

427
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:12,717
Ever since I got the time machine, I've lived as though I was chased by time.

428
00:36:12,717 --> 00:36:18,857
Running around here and there, trying to change things based on what I know.

429
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:23,787
Actually, thinking about what I want to do at this moment,

430
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:26,277
where I want to be, and with whom.

431
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:29,727
I haven't thought about those things.

432
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,107
So now that you thought about them,

433
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:37,777
you wanted to see pretty things with me?

434
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:41,677
I think so.

435
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:44,990
What else?

436
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,570
What else?

437
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:56,277
Ordering something sweet and salty that you-know-who likes, and watching her enjoy it.

438
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,697
What else?

439
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:02,037
Finding out what she likes and doesn't like,

440
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:06,677
and listening to all the little things until I'm so sick of it.

441
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,117
I like everything you said, but...

442
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,987
should we try sampling those things a little bit at a time?

443
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:24,837
♫  When flowers bloom in spring, and rain falls in the summer  ♫

444
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:32,657
♫  The time we spend together becomes more comfortable

445
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:35,897
The epitome of sweet and salty truly is tteokbokki.

446
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,877
Next stop?

447
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:45,027
Used book store! The smell of old books is nice.

448
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,837
I like the feeling of turning over a faded yellow page,

449
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:53,407
and it's good to look for old rare books as a treasure hunt.

450
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,407
What else?

451
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:59,327
Friday at 3:00 p.m.

452
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:03,057
You know the feeling of owning the world three hours before you go home?

453
00:38:03,057 --> 00:38:05,637
I used to cover the weekend news, so...

454
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:11,377
- You used to work over the weekend. 
 - Yes.

455
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:14,077
Then you must have Mondays.

456
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:18,947
Sunday 9:00 p.m. That's exactly when I start to be in a bad mood.

457
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:22,467
That's exactly when I go on TV.

458
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,427
I'll like it from now on.

459
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:33,107
♫  When flowers bloom in spring, and rain falls in the summer  ♫

460
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:34,827
This must be an eatery from 1987.

461
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:37,587
The bar rice cake is chewy and delicious.

462
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:40,727
Have a bite.

463
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:44,107
I have one, too. I'll eat mine.

464
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,987
Bus No. 540.

465
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:54,417
When I'm depressed, I sit at the bus stop, and

466
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:59,117
just get on any bus and sit there without thinking.

467
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:05,557
After going around once, and looking out the window, I somehow feel better.

468
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:10,927
But out of those, Bus No. 540 has the best views.

469
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:14,697
I should keep that in mind. What else?

470
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:16,377
What else?

471
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:21,017
Let's end here for now.

472
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:23,907
Since it was just a sampling.

473
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:28,807
Now, I really want to...

474
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:32,067
listen to what you want to tell me.

475
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,737
That's why we're here, aren't we?

476
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:40,937
We didn't even finish everything, so there's no way we just came here on a whim.

477
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:45,287
What is so difficult to say that you brought me all the way here?

478
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:51,977
No matter what I do, you trust me. Right?

479
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:55,117
What is it?

480
00:39:56,237 --> 00:40:00,557
I can't tell you in detail what I'll be doing right now.

481
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:03,487
But I promise nothing bad will happen.

482
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:07,897
So don't worry and wait for me.

483
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,267

484
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,817

485
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:28,777

486
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:38,837
Are you leaving now?

487
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:43,257
Yeah.

488
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:45,037
Oh, really?

489
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:52,417
Wait...

490
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,360

491
00:40:56,807 --> 00:41:01,877
By chance, could you just walk me to the bus station?

492
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,647
It's dark, so it scares me a little...

493
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:12,047
I saw the news people filming here and there.

494
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:14,657
I heard you gave them the lead.

495
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,707
That you met the reporters to give them some information.

496
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,997
The word is all over the place.

497
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,197
And it's not even your business.

498
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,937
Aren't you afraid?

499
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:27,577
It's because it is my business.

500
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:32,417
Living in a town where such a bastard roams around

501
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:36,827
means someone I know will continuously be in danger.

502
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,147
There are many people I want to protect.

503
00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:44,977
You're a good person.

504
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:50,027
But your mom wouldn't think that way.

505
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:04,417
Did I get nosy for no reason again?

506
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:11,497
Sorry. It's just that if my son puts himself in danger to protect someone else,

507
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,527
I'd be so worried for him.

508
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:17,037
I don't think I ever asked you what you thought.

509
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:21,527
All right. I'm sorry.

510
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:26,167
I guess I have those kinds of thoughts a lot these days.

511
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:48,327

512
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,030

513
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,777
What is that you're holding onto?

514
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,107
The things I collected...

515
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:22,187
for the baby inside me.

516
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:28,847
I made some myself, and some I bought because they're pretty.

517
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:40,307
Isn't this shoe really cute?

518
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,447
How is it so small?

519
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:47,327
It looks smaller than my palm.

520
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:53,017
It feels strange thinking how he'll walk around in these.

521
00:43:55,017 --> 00:44:01,227
Only someone who's eagerly waiting for her baby keeps those things. No?

522
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:10,477
Of course, I waited.

523
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:13,337
I decided on his name already.

524
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:16,717
"Hae" means to meet, and "Joon" means joyful.

525
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:19,927
The person I'll be happy to meet.

526
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,547
Hae Joon.

527
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:24,487
Weren't you surprised because it's the same name?

528
00:44:25,937 --> 00:44:28,357
I was, too.

529
00:44:28,357 --> 00:44:31,257
Well, I guess the name's meaning could be different.

530
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,587
I really wanted to meet him.

531
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:41,777
The precious child I made with the one I love.

532
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:49,507
If such a child looked into my eyes with his twinkling eyes...

533
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,477
How beautiful would they be?

534
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:00,917
If you're thinking that,

535
00:45:02,587 --> 00:45:04,727
why are you leaving?

536
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:13,717
Because I'm not sure anymore.

537
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,560

538
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:40,117
I'll go now.

539
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:42,507
Thank you for walking me here.

540
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:44,117
All right then.

541
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:46,747
Take care.

542
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,490

543
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,200

544
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,410

KSBC 9:00 p.m. news begins now.

545
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,030
 Tonight, we have a special report to focus on two incidents

546
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,280
 contrary to the usual format.

547
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,150
 A two-part report will examine one incident per part, in-depth and in detail.

548
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,330
 The first report covers the serial murder case that took place in

549
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,280
 the town selected five years in a row as a crime-free town.

550
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,440
Hey!

551
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,570
That's the news where they came and took videos of our town. Right?

552
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,740
Yes, that punk who put notes in matchboxes.

553
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,720
Gosh...

554
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,900

555
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,620
 In Woojeong Village, the town selected five years in a row as a crime-free town in Woojeong county,

556
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,590
 three murders in total took place last month.

557
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,860
 Last May, the culprit who brutally killed two women

558
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,650
 left a unique mark on each dead woman's body.

559
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:57,310
 One of them was this matchbox, which contained a handwritten note with his message.

560
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,250
 This matchbox is from a cafe most frequented by young people in the town.

561
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,170
 Due to these facts, police believe

562
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,980
 the culprit is a young man from the same town who frequents Bong Bong Cafe.

563
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,120
 They conducted an investigation to find

564
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,930
 possible suspects among the cafe customers but without success.

565
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,300
 While the town is anxious due to the culprit being loose out there,

566
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,840
 the surviving victim of an additional attempted murder on the 4th

567
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,640
 was threatened by the culprit again.

568
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,740
 This news has shocked the whole town.

569
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,630
 As soon as I saw this handwriting,

570
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,970
 I felt as though the culprit was watching me by my side.

571
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,780
Goodness! How can there be such a creepy guy!

572
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,840
Seriously!

573
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,890
Is that really someone from our town?

574
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,880
What?

575
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,600
What if he's here now?

576
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,010
 Goodness! Don't say such terrible things! This is a peaceful place!

577
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,750
 - I mean, it could happen. 
 - What are you saying?

578
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,630
 - Gosh! Don't even say such horrid things! 
 - Oh, my goodness!

579
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,610
 Next, we'll report exclusive information that the

580
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,710
 news crew acquired from an eyewitness.

581
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:09,040
 The corresponding witness is an additional witness along with the surviving victim.

582
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,320
 The witness provided an important tip that is meaningful in catching the suspect.

583
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,230
 We ask that the viewers also pay close attention and listen carefully.

584
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,120
I'm Yoon Hae Joon, the Korean language teacher...

585
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,920
at Woojeong High School.

586
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,740
 I'm also the eyewitness to the incident that occurred on the night of the

587
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,850
 third murder at this abandoned house.

588
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:44,410
 At the time, I chased the culprit toward the mountain in the back of the town.

589
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,060
Mr. Yoon interviewed, too?

590
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,640
They said they would cover my face, but

591
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,460
why are they showing Mr. Yoon as is?

592
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,590
 At the time, the culprit was wearing a black cap and black jacket,

593
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,340
 and the back of his shirt was ripped in a vertical direction.

594
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,820
Is it all right for Mr. Yoon to show his face like that?

595
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,490
I know. They covered everyone else's face but why Mr. Yoon...

596
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,110
Brother.

597
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,640
- Brother? 
 - Yeah?

598
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,830
What are you thinking about so deeply?

599
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:47,230
I'm just... a bit... angry.

600
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:51,360
 Finally, is there any other information you can provide for us?

601
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,540
 During my pursuit of the culprit,

602
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,690
I personally saw the culprit's face.

603
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:03,910
If I see the culprit again, I will definitely be able to recognize him.

604
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,350
- Please go to Woojeong Village in Gyeonggi Province as fast as possible. 
 - Yes.

605
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:50,160
 Now that we've vacated both houses, we just need to wait until tomorrow night.

606
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,760
 Do you really think that punk will show up?

607
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,610
 If he saw the news, he will definitely show up.

608
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,140
 He will find it difficult to resist, knowing someone saw his face.

609
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,520

610
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,560
Who is it?

611
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,810
What are you doing here?

612
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,070
What you said on the news earlier.

613
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,600
That you saw the culprit. It's a lie, isn't it?

614
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,620
What did you say?

615
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,800
What if the real culprit shows up after hearing that?

616
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,790
Why do you put yourself in danger like this?

617
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,990
Let's get out of here for now.

618
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,040
How did you know?

619
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,610
That it was a lie.

620
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,970
How do you know that I didn't see him?

621
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,600
How are you so sure?

622
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,680
Because if you saw him, there's no way you wouldn't know him.

623
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:53,290
There's no way... you could've said what you said.

624
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,130
You know who it is?

625
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,440
You know the culprit?

626
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:26,070
Earlier in that box, there were things like this, too.

627
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:31,300
The child will be born during the cold season.

628
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,420
I wanted these to keep him warm.

629
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,580
I made them myself.

630
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:51,050
By any chance, can you recognize what this is?

631
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,620
They all belong to me.

632
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,830
The yarn that he used to tie up all those people

633
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,120
and matchboxes from the cafe,

634
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:15,240
they're all mine.

635
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,110
You don't know how much...

636
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,290
I wanted to see my Hae Joon's face.

637
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,870
But I don't know what to do.

638
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,450
That man...

639
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,430
That bastard...

640
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,390
Do you mean... that person...

641
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,180
Are you saying the child's father...

642
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,280
is the culprit?

643
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,440
I-Is that why you're leaving?

644
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,600
Because I'm scared.

645
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,280
It's horrific.

646
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,400
I can't stand to be near such a human being.

647
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:33,160
That's why I'm not even sure about the baby I was earnestly waiting for.

648
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,650
I can't bring myself to wait anymore.

649
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:45,440
Now... I don't want to meet him.

650
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,060
It's terrifying to know that...

651
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,570
he's that man's child... and scary.

652
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,040
What is he doing here?

653
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,950
Why is he here?

654
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,560
Yoon Yeon Woo!

655
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:52,010

656
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,800
♫  Standing alone here where there's no light  ♫

657
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:09,620
♫  When you cry over even a small difficulty  ♫

658
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:16,710
♫  Putting your warm hands on my tired shoulders  ♫
