1
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,130

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,860

3
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,190
Oh, this is the car that broke down last time. Right?

4
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,120
Wow, it's all fixed now!

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,150
Yes, yes.

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,780
Goodness! That's good! Good!

7
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,950
Looks like you were on your way somewhere. Then, go safely!

8
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:13,160

9
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,480

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,850
How bad is our situation right now?

11
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,910
Well, this is a new situation for me so...

12
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,340
What if we're stuck here forever?

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,190
What? We can't go home?

14
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,270
No, that's not it.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,290
Don't worry. I just need to fix it. I can fix it.

16
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,660
I just need to fix it. Just need to fix it.

17
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,470
Just need to fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it.

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,750
Let's just go home for now.

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,960

20
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,920
Up until now, I didn't think it was necessary to ask you this.

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,970
Since the existence of a time machine itself sounded like nonsense.

22
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,120
I didn't really think about who or how it was made. Even if it came out of a magic lamp.

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,490
I was just going to think, "Oh, that's how it works," and let it go.

24
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,980
But it's not something you made. Right?

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,450
Then, where did it come from?

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,030
I picked it up.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Oh, you picked it up.

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,060
Time machine.

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,640
You picked up a time machine.

30
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,350
Picked up a time machine.

31
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,760
He says he picked up the time machine.

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,270

33
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,290
Hyeong Man.

34
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,270
Don't you dare call his name.

35
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,770
We don't have reasons to see you anymore, so please go, Director Yoon.

36
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,210
Please go!

37
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,630
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm really sorry.

39
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,060
I was wrong.

40
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,660
Because I didn't raise my child right.

41
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,920
I caused you to lose...

42
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,750
your precious child. That precious child.

43
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,350
No matter how hard I tried,

44
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,450
I know full well that I cannot turn things back nor console you.

45
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,140
I will live the rest of my life in atonement.

46
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,690
Not a moment will I feel at ease.

47
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,910
I will live in agony.

48
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,940
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,010
Do you really think you can do that?

50
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,930
Can you really... live the rest of your life in agony?

51
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,640
Yes, I will.

52
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
I will live that way.

53
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm truly sorry, Hyeong Man.

54
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,210
I hope your rotten bastard of a son and your entire family

55
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,510
will live in agony forever.

56
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:01,597
But no matter how much my child may be a piece of trash,

57
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:11,590
I know how difficult it is to be open about my child's faults.

58
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,710
I do appreciate you doing that.

59
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,930
But still, it's a relief that there's a home to return to.

60
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,100
Shall we just get drunk?

61
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,880
Tonight's a lost cause, anyway.

62
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,120
- Please enjoy. 
 - Yes.

63
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,310
I thought he fixed it all, but that wasn't the case.

64
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,020
It's not all bad.

65
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,670
Well, even if we return immediately,

66
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,520
we'd have to go to work right away.

67
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,150
At least if we're here,

68
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:43,620
we don't have to worry about waking up in the morning at 6:30, 6:35, and 40.

69
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,750
We don't have to snooze the alarm every five minutes.

70
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,900
This isn't bad!

71
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,580
I can see more of my mom in her youth.

72
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,410
We can breathe cleaner air.

73
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Salted grilled eel is only 2,000 won, too.

74
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,180
You don't even have 2,000 won.

75
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,070
Are you drawing a line between us now?

76
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,360
You have it!

77
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Actually, I'm running out of all the money I brought with me, too.

78
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,440
It's because I wasn't planning to stay here this long.

79
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,270
I didn't have plans to get stuck here, either.

80
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,960
Lottery.

81
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,150
Didn't you memorize any winning lotto numbers?

82
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,640
What do you think?

83
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,940
Damn.

84
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,320
You're uselessly honest.

85
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,540
That's all right.

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,090
We are both alive and well.

87
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,360
Despite all this, we know the future.

88
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,030
We'd make a lot of money, at the very least.

89
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,650
How could we possibly starve?

90
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:25,150
But, actually... how can you pick up a time machine?

91
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,530
In a world where it's hard to even pick up a 500-won coin.

92
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,970
That's a question for me, too.

93
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,190
How did you pick it up?

94
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,730
It was on a very rainy day.

95
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,000
 You are off course and will be redirected.

96
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,600
The navigation happened to be broken that day.

97
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,170
The windows fogged up from the rain.

98
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,880
I was roaming around for a while, lost on an unfamiliar road.

99
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,620
That's when I saw it in front of me.

100
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,250
In front of that overpass.

101
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,040
It was just there, as if it was abandoned?

102
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,720
Even the door was wide open.

103
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Not only that, there were even instructions saying things like,

104
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,790
"Go through that overpass you see ahead of you."

105
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,290
"You see ahead of you... "

106
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,870
That sounds like it was written as if they were waiting for someone to find it.

107
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,930
Now that I think about it, that's not the only strange thing.

108
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,620
The day we ran into each other.

109
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Remember when you asked me about making a phone call?

110
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,290
 This isn't the kind of car that just bumps into things.

111
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,390
 By any chance, were you on a call?

112
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,760
 You were. You sure were on the phone.

113
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,040
 When you do that while driving, it's highly likely to get into an accident. Right?

114
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,910
But what's strange about that?

115
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,290
Actually, I did receive a phone call that day.

116
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,970
 Yes?

117
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,270
 What did you say?

118
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,080
 From beginning to end, this is something only you can resolve.

119
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
 Excuse me?

120
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,530
At the time, I was so out of it that I just thought it was a strange call.

121
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,750
But when I think about it, it feels like he knew what he was talking about.

122
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,250
Who could that have been?

123
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,050
Not sure...

124
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,310
Are you all right?

125
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,820
You're walking a little funny.

126
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,530
I have to be all right.

127
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,480
We don't even have insurance here.

128
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,120
That's not the first time I've heard that.

129
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,770
"I have to be okay."

130
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,000
"It will become ambiguous if I die here."

131
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,460
I was really at a loss back then.

132
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,230
But now, I honestly don't feel as bad.

133
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,090
Since I'm with the person I want to be with.

134
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,950
If...

135
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:10,520
Even if we don't find a way to return and are stuck here forever,

136
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,110
I think I will be all right.

137
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,650
As long as I'm with you.

138
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,570
Really?

139
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,220
What about you?

140
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,910
Me?

141
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,570
What's the use of saying it?

142
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,860
Of course, I'd hate it.

143
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,180
That's not what you told me last night.

144
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,770
- About what? 
 - You said you'd be all right.

145
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,570
You said you'd be fine staying here forever if you were with me.

146
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,010
I thought you were piercing the back of my head.

147
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,980
How many hours have you been watching me?

148
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,260
Oh, I was just curious how things were going. Just curious.

149
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,610
If you're just curious, you sigh every time I tilt my head sideways?

150
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,770
Only I was sincere. Only me.

151
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,330
I meant what I said, too.

152
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,190
But if we can, it would be nicer to be together in 2021.

153
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,190
Enjoying the benefits of modern civilization.

154
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,250
I'm sorry! I won't look anymore!

155
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,950
But can you leave the door open just a little bit?

156
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,810
All right.

157
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,750
All right. I'll go inside.

158
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,080
I'm going inside.

159
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,110

160
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,940
They say this book is popular these days.

161
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,530
Oh, really?

162
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,860
- Oh, it looks interesting! Right? 
 - Yeah.

163
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,180
- Should we read it? 
 - Yeah, let's.

164
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,100

165
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,890
 Thank you. Please come again.

166
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,570
 - Thank you! 
 - Sure.

167
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,710
Well...

168
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,670
I read it, and it was good.

169
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,030
You write well.

170
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,040
Could you sign the cover later?

171
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,040
Are you feeling better?

172
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,540
Yes. I'm all right now.

173
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,290
That crazy bastard. He should've been caught sooner.

174
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,100
But how come you don't come to school even though you're out of the hospital?

175
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,950
Is it because of us?

176
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,370
No, it's not like that.

177
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,220
I should go to school from now on.

178
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,090
Hurry back.

179
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,990
The teacher and the other kids are waiting for you.

180
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,960
Thank you.

181
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,300
Then, let's see each other at school.

182
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,310
I'll see you at school, Soon Ae.

183
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,640
I used to be so scared whenever I heard, "See you at school" before.

184
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,580
But I think it's really all right now.

185
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,970
That's a relief.

186
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,510
I have a present for you.

187
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,600
It's a published copy!

188
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,260

189
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,320
Lee Soon Ae.

190
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,560
Your name is printed officially.

191
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,950
Please sign it.

192
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,830
I did already!

193
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,000
Open the cover.

194
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,590

195
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,300
 My closest friend.

196
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,510
 For my one and only Y. Dear Yoon Young.

197
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,140
Thank you.

198
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,080
Thank you so much.

199
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,590
This is the best gift I ever received in my life.

200
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,770
Do you even know what you're doing?

201
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,200
If so, I probably would've fixed it already. Right?

202
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,190
How are things going?

203
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,300
We'll move with the rest of the procedure without any difficulty.

204
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,910
It seems Director Yoon also told your dad to

205
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,350
accept everything and receive his punishment.

206
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,500
Director Yoon is having a really hard time right now.

207
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,940
What do you think he needs right now?

208
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,530
His family.

209
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,490
But now, he doesn't have anyone.

210
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,410

211
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,530

212
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,790

213
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,970

214
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,340
You shouldn't leave your front gate open like that.

215
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,060
Hae Joon.

216
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,160
Didn't you see what people did outside?

217
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,460
What if someone comes in and tries to attack you? It's dangerous.

218
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,610
Could there be anyone more dangerous than my son in this town?

219
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,650
I thought you had left.

220
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,530
I thought you became disgusted by the horrific family you have here

221
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,420
and just left without saying bye.

222
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,330
I was going to do that. Only if I could.

223
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,990
I'm grateful you didn't do that.

224
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,430
I wanted to see you one last time.

225
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't you hate me?

226
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,120
You're going through something you don't need to because of me.

227
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,890
You don't even know how much more you'll have to endure.

228
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,510
I thought perhaps you might think that.

229
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,160
That's why I wanted to see you one more time.

230
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,520
To tell you that I'm all right.

231
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,160
In fact, I feel grateful.

232
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,890
I really wanted to tell you that.

233
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,620
Thanks to you, I can make things right from now on, at least.

234
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,260
I'm really sorry.

235
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,750
To show you this shameful side of me.

236
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,220
I was wondering how many years

237
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,780
I would have to wait to tell you this.

238
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,340
But it's a relief that we can move up 30 years like this.

239
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,280
What a relief.

240
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,710
Where are you coming from?

241
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,600
I just went to see someone.

242
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,090
Why do you look so down?

243
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,910
We can...

244
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,190
skip 30 years in a blink of an eye.

245
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,710
But it occurred to me that

246
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,090
there are people who need to live through each and every day of those 30 years.

247
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,630
You went to see your grandpa?

248
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,060
I'm not saying I regret what we did.

249
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,400
I know. I understand, too.

250
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,340
This might be an opportunity.

251
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:02,150
Although we can't return right away, it means we have that much time to spend here.

252
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,910
How about you spend the time you couldn't spend together here?

253
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,750
The time I couldn't spend together?

254
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,100
The time you wanted to spend together but wasn't able to.

255
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,680
Now, you can only see each other if you skip 30 years ahead.

256
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,490
So why not make at least one memory for him to hold onto?

257
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,700
Do you like fishing, by chance?

258
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,970
I know a good place, but it would be better to go with someone.

259
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,830
Do you know what my dream used to be?

260
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,160
I wanted to have a normal job and a normal life.

261
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,830
And when I retired, I wanted to go fishing like this.

262
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,410
Live idly like that. By myself.

263
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,260
By yourself?

264
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,920
Without a family? Without any children?

265
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,560
Probably.

266
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,700
I guess you'd feel that way.

267
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,150
Thinking, "What good is family to me anyway?"

268
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,150
But now, I feel a little differently.

269
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,500
I feel it would be nice to have someone by my side.

270
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,660
Talking about trivial things and taking care of each other.

271
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,500
I want to try living like that, too.

272
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,120
Oh, yeah! You must live like that! You can definitely live like that!

273
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,580
You think I can?

274
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,440
Of course, you can!

275
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,830
Hey! If only you decide to live like that,

276
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,020
I will do anything I can to help you live like that!

277
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,250
Then please, do me a favor.

278
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,900
Favor?

279
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,330
Cut down on your drinking sooner than later. If you don't want to live on medicine.

280
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,400
You should eat regularly at mealtimes.

281
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,190
And after eight years, be sure to get your annual checkup consistently.

282
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,230
Sure.

283
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,020
I could enjoy my life talking about trivial things if only I didn't have worries.

284
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,840
Other than good things for me, is there anything...

285
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,350
Anything you'd like me to do for you?

286
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,610
You can take me fishing once in a while.

287
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,800
I tried it for the first time when my senior took me after I got hired. It suits me.

288
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,690
I wished I had known sooner about this great thing.

289
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,290
If you like it after trying it today, you can bring me out here more.

290
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,210
What's really fun is night fishing. We can cook ramen, too.

291
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,670
 Here we go!

292
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,720
 Have some.

293
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,390
 Thank you!

294
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,730
 Blow on it.

295
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,050
That sounds good! Good!

296
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,810
But would that one thing be enough?

297
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,650
That would be more than enough for me.

298
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,400
Whoa! Hey, Hae Joon!

299
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,810
Grandpa, I told you! You have to wait!

300
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,310
I'm telling you, it just moved!

301
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,920
It didn't move! Fishing is about waiting. Put that down quickly.

302
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,890
Okay.

303
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,080
We're going way over there and back. Okay?

304
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,730
The last one buys tteokbokki!

305
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,750
Then, start!

306
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh, man! What a cutie pie!

307
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,320
Hey, what are you doing?

308
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,960
I can't.

309
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,900
What? Say it louder!

310
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,300
I don't know how to ride it!

311
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,020
Just leave me here, and you guys go!

312
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,780
Humanly speaking, does it make sense that you can't even ride a bike at your age?

313
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,280
What did your dad do instead of teaching you this?

314
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,250
My dad couldn't ride, either.

315
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,860
His legs aren't in good condition.

316
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,470
Oh, really?

317
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,930
If...

318
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
his legs were okay,

319
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,740
do you think my dad would've wanted to teach me things like this?

320
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,040
There's no dad in this world who wouldn't want to.

321
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,470
I'm sure it must've pained him to even watch other dads teach their kids.

322
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,320
He was probably like, "I want to do that for her. I want to teach her..."

323
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,580
Don't worry.

324
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,880
I'll teach you instead.

325
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,500
Here! Put your foot on the pedal. Try it.

326
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,970
Then, have no mercy and just step hard on it!

327
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,930
Even if you shake and feel like you'll fall, don't stop, just look ahead and keep going! Okay?

328
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,350
What if I really fall?

329
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,130
I'll be right behind you! No need to worry!

330
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,900
All right, we're going!

331
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,520
You'd better not let go suddenly! D-Don't let go!

332
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,610
♫  A new day begins  ♫

333
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:54,160
♫  Even if many things change in time  ♫

334
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,010
♫  But you know, things have not actually changed that much, even still  ♫

335
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,690
Oh, man. What do we do about her terrible reflexes...

336
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,200
♫  I'm the same here  ♫

337
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,160
You should have stayed close and held her up.

338
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,410
How could you just let her go?

339
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,790
You have to raise them strong from the beginning so they learn properly.

340
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,070
What do you mean, raise them strong?

341
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,820
Hey, what if this scars?

342
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,860
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

343
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,550
You better be!

344
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,320
I'm so upset!

345
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,120
- Was it your fault? 
 - Yes, it was my fault.

346
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,170
 I was wondering why it felt so unfamiliar...

347
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,380
 and I realized I'd never had this kind of time before.

348
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,790
- Are you sorry or not? 
 - I'm sorry.

349
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,560
- Are you sorry or not? 
  - Does that mean in my altered future,

350
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,800
 will I have some more memories like these?

351
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,330
♫  Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, the frogs are singing  ♫

352
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,750
♫  Son, wife, and grandson, everyone is together  ♫

353
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,790
 I hope it's like that.

354
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,900
 I really wish that could be true.

355
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,260
Hey, Yoon Young.

356
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,290
Do you want a bite of the bar rice cake?

357
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,490
- It's okay, I can... 
 - Come on!

358
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,620
I'll give you one.

359
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,560
- Say, "Ah." 
 - He's saying sorry. Accept it.

360
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,510
I said I'm really okay.

361
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,500
How is it? Isn't it good?

362
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,100
It's tastier when I feed you. Right?

363
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,390
It's just tasty.

364
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,610
The rice cake is so chewy and tasty!

365
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,670
Who's that lurking around Mr. Yoon's house?

366
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,630
I told you not to come by for a while. Why are you here...

367
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,420
How can I not when I know you're having a difficult time?

368
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,950
I've received so much help from you all this time, Director Yoon.

369
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,160
Let's go inside.

370
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,380
Yes. Thank you.

371
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,450
Will you let me know before you leave?

372
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,150
Yes, I'll do that.

373
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,170
All right. Then I'll wait for you.

374
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,590
Yes. Please go inside.

375
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,360
Gosh.

376
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,970
What should I do with that? Seriously?

377
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,220
In the end, this is how we meet.

378
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,840
Who are you?

379
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,370
Oh, I'm disappointed.

380
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,990
I thought you'd recognize me right away.

381
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,160
You don't remember my voice?

382
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,270
"From beginning to end, this is something only you can resolve."

383
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,630
The overpass. The phone call.

384
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,790
 What did you say? Hello?

385
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,340
 From beginning to end, this is something only you can resolve.

386
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,330
I knew you'd remember!

387
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,270
You're smart. You solve the Rubik's cube in five seconds. Right?

388
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,680
You know who I am?

389
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,330
How could I not know?

390
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,170
Your my dad.

391
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,610
What?

392
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,650
I missed you, Dad.

393
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,320
But you broke the time machine I gave you. Didn't you?

394
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,000
- Did you enjoy fishing with your grandpa? 
 - Yes.

395
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,860
Next time, I'll go with you.

396
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,450
I can ride a bicycle now, too.

397
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,430
The scenery was really nice today.

398
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,980
I want to go there with you.

399
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,880
Is the place not there in 2021?

400
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
It'll probably be there.

401
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,920
By chance, did you fix it?

402
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,350
Probably.

403
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,970
Had I known, I shouldn't have said I'll see them tomorrow.

404
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,330
It doesn't have to be right now.

405
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,260
No, it's okay.

406
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,040
I'm a nonexistent person here anyway, so

407
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,600
I should disappear one way or another.

408
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,440
I'll see them again soon when I return.

409
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,190
How do you feel?

410
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,610
Do you think you'll really be okay returning now?

411
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,250
How did you... know I was here?

412
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,690
I'm sorry for my sudden visit.

413
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,860
I won't tell anyone else you're here.

414
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,850
I'll forget it, too, after today.

415
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,020
Can I sit down for a bit?

416
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,890
When the baby's born, will you really send him off to Director Yoon?

417
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,710
Yes.

418
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,540
I told you I would.

419
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,790
Because you're terrified and scared of that baby?

420
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,850
That's right.

421
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,120
All right.

422
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,380
Then, have a good life.

423
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,810
Don't live with any guilt.

424
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,220
Forget everything and live well.

425
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,230
I know your situation very well.

426
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,610
I can see how it would be terrifying and scary.

427
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,680
If it's too hard, it's all right to live without ever seeing him.

428
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,120
I understand.

429
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,010
Director Yoon is wealthy and a good person.

430
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,730
He will be good for the child, too.

431
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:35,260
He will grow up in a nice home with everything he needs.

432
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,660
He will live like that.

433
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,330
Without any hatred or resentment toward his mom.

434
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,150
I'm sure he'll be able to live like that.

435
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,370
Lies.

436
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,910
How could he not resent me?

437
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,500
How could he not hate me?

438
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I abandoned him.

439
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,500
In the end, I'm a mom who abandoned her child.

440
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,970
Please believe me.

441
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,470
You said we even have the same name.

442
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,590
That child will have similar thoughts as I do.

443
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,080
Do you really think...

444
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,950
he would?

445
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,410
Thank you very much...

446
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,410
even for bringing me into this world.

447
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,370
That's what he will think.

448
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,730
Do you feel better?

449
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,870
Yes.

450
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,030
I let go of the person who abandoned me.

451
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,750
But in a strange way, I feel at peace.

452
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,980
Then we can really return now, can't we?

453
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,480
Yes.

454
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,080
So, you really did fix it properly this time. Right?

455
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,880
We don't have to greet the village foreman again. Right?

456
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't think so.

457
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,250
Because a truly qualified person showed up this time.

458
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,770
Did someone come by?

459
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,900
The person who called me at the overpass.

460
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,560
The person who built this time machine.

461
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,350
I had a hard time believing it at first, too.

462
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,970
Because I thought his existence was entirely impossible.

463
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,060
 No way.

464
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,140
 - How could... 
 - You mean, how could you have a son?

465
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,280
 For a person who died in 2022?

466
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,690
 But actually, you didn't die.

467
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,790
 Well, you almost did.

468
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,010
 But in the end, you survived.

469
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,700
 There was a huge hole there that you overlooked, Dad.

470
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,750
 And the one that emerged from that hidden future...

471
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,390
 was me.

472
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,980
 I wanted to give you one more chance, Dad.

473
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,170
 An opportunity to make a second choice.

474
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,040
 But... you made it in the end, Dad.

475
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,710
There had been a hidden future for me.

476
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,190
And all this started thanks to that future.

477
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,030
So, who was that?

478
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,750
That's a secret.

479
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,670
Are you really going to do this?

480
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,460
Let's go.

481
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,200
Now, we're here.

482
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Right.

483
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,140
Thanks to the person whom I don't even know, I'll be able to return.

484
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,050
There were some great moments, though. Right?

485
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,990
There were many moments I felt grateful for.

486
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,640
Thanks to you.

487
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,650
But when we return, do you think everything will have changed?

488
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,390
What if nothing changed?

489
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,040
Let's hurry up and find out!

490
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,800
Are you ready?

491
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,380
Yes. See you in the future.

492
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,580
All right. I'll see you 34 years later.

493
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,970

494
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,510

495
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,390
- Yes? 
  - Hae Joon, did you arrive all right?

496
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,990
You waited a long time, didn't you?

497
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,730
Grandpa, I arrived all right.

498
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,580
Yes.

499
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,590

500
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,120

501
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,250
Go on and take it.

502
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,140

503
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,810
Hello?

504
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,030
Is it really you, Mom?

505
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,880
 That's how we safely arrived in the future.

506
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:04,000
 Our present has changed in so many ways.

507
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,580
The house...

508
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,010
changed.

509
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,250

510
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,770

511
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,120

512
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,620
Yoon Young!

513
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,120
You little brat!

514
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,900
Goodness! Where did you go? Huh?

515
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,680
I went to see you, Mom.

516
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,310
What? W-What is she talking about?

517
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,410
 My mom and dad, who waited for me while I disappeared suddenly

518
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,000
 - for one month.  
 - Gosh, we were so worried!

519
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,160
 They looked exactly the way they did in my dreams once.

520
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,660
- You troublemaker. 
 - Gosh, don't hit her!

521
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,110

522
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,200
 The person who waited for me for over 30 years

523
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,720
 didn't forget his promise to me.

524
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,720
 Hae Joon.

525
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,990
 At last...

526
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,100
 I finally met the author of my dreams

527
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,060
 and became her editor.

528
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,210
Mom, I think it would be better to remove that sentence.

529
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,920
I don't want to.

530
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,430
If you'll interfere that much, write your own novel.

531
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,690
You're being stubborn again. Your stubbornness is growing.

532
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,780
That's right! Write your own novel.

533
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,150
Honey.

534
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,900
Should I give it to you or not?

535
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,110
Here you go.

536
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,620
It's fun!

537
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,310
Hey, don't do that!

538
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,940

539
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,980

540
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,210
 And then...

541
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,150
Dad! Quiet, that's enough now.

542
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,250
 I became someone who likes 9:00 p.m. on Sundays.

543
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,700
 Hello, everyone.

544
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,160
 This is KSBC 9:00 p.m. news.

545
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,520
 The prosecution investigating Songhan Group's Chairman Cho's embezzlement case

546
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,190
 conducted search and seizure of the headquarters and eight subsidiaries today.

547
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,530
He really looks like him.

548
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,030
 The main suspicion is that they embezzled company funds...

549
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,610
Hee Seop!

550
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,090
Yes, Brother!

551
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,040
You're here!

552
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,060
How come you seem down?

553
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,050
Well, you know...

554
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,280
 - About 4 billion won that Chairman Cho...  
 - Dad!

555
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,450
♫  No matter what anyone else says  ♫

556
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,910
 Here is Reporter Ki giving us details.

557
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,290
♫  I wish it would reach you  ♫

558
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:18,240
♫  Enough, enough, without being greedy  ♫

559
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,770
♫  Since I can gaze at you  ♫

560
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,200
Let's go.

561
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,180
Walking here like this feels so unfamiliar, doesn't it?

562
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,820
Doesn't it feel nicer?

563
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,340
We can hold hands anywhere we want.

564
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,780
We can talk about anything, too.

565
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:43,190
But didn't your parents say anything when they saw my face?

566
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,020
Why wouldn't they?

567
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:50,740
Whenever they watch the news, they talk about how you look and sound exactly like their old high school teacher.

568
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,060
They're so fascinated.

569
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,500
They should suspect their daughter, too.

570
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,110
Of course.

571
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,280

572
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,690
 Let's try it.

573
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,570
 Oh, wow! The bar rice cake looks so good!

574
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,930
 - Have one. 
 - Oh, my.

575
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,170
 Here you go. Please eat.

576
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,900
 Oh, my!

577
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,410
 It tastes exactly like the one we had long ago!

578
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:23,160
 Remember that day we went biking with Yoon Young at the park?

579
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,450
 Even then, we had...

580
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,770
 Your mom has a friend she can't forget even after 30 years.

581
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:40,510
 That's why I named you after her.

582
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,520
 Gosh.

583
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,440
 Oh, dear.

584
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,660
 But as you grow older, you look even more like her!

585
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,140
 How could such a thing happen?

586
00:54:55,140 --> 00:55:01,680
 Oh, maybe you were thinking a lot about that friend when you had me. Then that could happen.

587
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,380
 - Really? 
 - Could that be?

588
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,810
 Gosh...

589
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,490
You're saying they believe that?

590
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,820
What would happen if they didn't?

591
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,780
That the teacher and friend they had 34 years ago still look the same.

592
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,800
They might think we time-traveled or something.

593
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,900
 A while ago, I happened to run into that person by chance.

594
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,180

595
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:45,180
 Thank you to the Time-Turner Team ⌚!

597

 Thank you to our amazing Chief Segmenter bepina!

598
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,590
 Thank you to our wonderful Chief Editor kakashiandme!

599
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,780
 Thank you to all our language moderators and their teams!

600
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,690
 And last not least thank you to all our viewers! ♥

601
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:15,740
 Do you regret anything you did?

602
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,380
 I do.

603
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,890
 I should've just said good things were good.

604
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,370
 That painful things just hurt.

605
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:29,240
 I'm just envious of some things.

606
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,430
 It would've been better if I had been more honest, too.

607
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,190
 I couldn't do that.

608
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,920
 Because it was already too late.

609
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,400
 Maybe I'll just have to keep hanging around people,

610
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,150
 and live like that.

611
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,720
 There's no such thing as too late.

612
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:06,250
 Even this present time... is the past for you in the future.

613
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,950
 Is that right?

614
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,950
 I don't know what her present is like,

615
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,490
 but I thought that perhaps...

616
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:40,320
 she became a little more honest now.

617
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,740
 And I still...

618
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:50,180
 continue to live thinking about my past and future.

619
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,150
 Good night.

620
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,970
 - I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Okay, it was so fun today.

621
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:11,120
 But can I see my mom's face up close just once?

622
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,760
 Later. It'll be awkward if you see her now.

623
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,360
 Why?

624
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,630
 It's boring if you know the ending already.

625
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,820
 Our dating life.

626
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:35,410
 I guess we cross paths with whoever we are meant to.

627
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,050
 Since Mom and Dad met here again,

628
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:43,340
 and in the end, fell in love, too.

629
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,990
 That person you know over there. What does she like the most?

630
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,890
 Just give me a hint since you know already.

631
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,980
 So I'll know what kind of gifts I should get her later.

632
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,670
 You, Dad.

633
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,100
 Mom loved you the most in this world, Dad.

634
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,390
 And she really liked one stem of a flower

635
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,730
 you bought her occasionally.

636
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,420
What's this?

637
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,230
A present.

638
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,910
I like it.

639
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,210
I really like it!

640
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,440
Isn't it too simple?

641
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,530
To be so happy over something so small?

642
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,880
What would I do receiving a present from my present?

643
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,600
That's true.

644
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,370
Present!

645
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:11,980
So, is the time machine done now?

646
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,600
There's only one more chance left to go somewhere with it.

647
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,430
Wherever that may be.

648
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,400
By the way, did you know tomorrow is May 16th?

649
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,230
Are we thinking the same thing?

650
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,100
What if...

651
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:37,550
What do you think if we go and return just one more time?

652
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:42,280
I think I can do it right this time.

653
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,830
Shall we go just one more time?

654
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,010
For certain this time!

655
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:09,280
♫  When I spend the time feeling empty  ♫

656
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:16,340
♫  as though everything will grow further away  ♫

657
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:24,480
♫  The one who held my hand when I reached out  ♫

658
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,240
♫  It must be my love  ♫

659
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:57,220
What if a variable occurs?

660
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,370
The future will probably find us.

661
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,660
Since we'll be together, no matter what.

662
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,460
We didn't happen to meet each other.

663
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,910
We were destined to meet each other.

664
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,800
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

665
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,950
Are you ready?

666
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,270
Yes.

667
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,020
Let's go.

668
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,520

669
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:34,650
♫  Please hear me out for a little while  ♫

670
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:44,950
♫  Your gaze that is like the starlight has stolen my heart  ♫

671
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,850

672
01:02:51,680 --> 01:03:01,010

♫

673
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:14,150
♫  The entire world is painted white by your fateful love  ♫

674
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:26,450
