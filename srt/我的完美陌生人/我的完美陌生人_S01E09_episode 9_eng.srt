1
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,094

2
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:58,236

3
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:01,017

What do you mean he's not the culprit?

4
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,877
We clearly heard his confession!

5
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,043
Yes, we did.

6
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:15,293
Responses that didn't match the questions at all.

7
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:19,833
What I asked him earlier was "why."

8
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:22,803
 What is this?

9
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,483
 Why did you hide this here?

10
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:29,103
But out of nowhere, he answered that it was his.

11
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,463
 This is mine.

12
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:35,033
No matter how nervous he was, would anyone make a confession without

13
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,213
trying to explain the item that was found in his own room?

14
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:40,333
Even if he really did it himself.

15
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,483
Oh Bok's Dad!

16
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,893
Let go of this!

17
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,433
I'm going to kill that bastard!

18
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,683
- Dad, you can't say things like that! 
 - What are you trying to do?

19
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,083
Just let go of me!

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,783
- I'll go and... 
 - Just a moment.

21
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,883
What's going on?

22
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:56,703
They say Detective Baek arrested his own nephew.

23
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,973
That punk...

24
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,513
That punk killed our sister...

25
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,753
Let go of me, both of you!

26
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,323
- I'm going to tear his face apart! 
 - Geez!

27
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,303
- Dad! 
 - Let go of this.

28
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,933
- Let go! That punk... 
 - It's not him!

29
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,803
It's not Hee Seop!

30
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:16,203
It's definitely not him!

31
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,003
This...

32
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,053
Is this true?

33
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:34,985

34
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,103
How?

35
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,743
How?

36
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,743
Of all people...

37
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:44,073
You?

38
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,943
You!

39
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:50,383
How can you kill a person, punk!

40
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,113
What do you mean kill?

41
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:01,833
What are you saying...

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,283
You can't back out of what you said now!

43
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:08,043
All the evidence points to you, punk!

44
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,883
 That matchbox.

45
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,003
 And the note.

46
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:27,213
 - Boo! 
 - Boo!

47
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,773
 Wow, Hyung! What is all this?

48
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,453
 Oh, it's nothing.

49
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:40,643
 Looks like you need to clean up your room.

50
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,793
 Come out for dinner.

51
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,143
No...

52
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,103
No, that's not it.

53
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,713
It's not me!

54
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:55,955
If it's not you, then what's all this?

55
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,715
Huh?

56
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:01,863
Whose blood is this?

57
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:26,033
Last night, Hee Seop came by the house.

58
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:32,513
Remember, he saved us yesterday at Motel Woojeong.

59
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:34,723
Motel?

60
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:37,213
He came because he was worried.

61
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,113
When he's the one who got hurt.

62
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:46,463
 My gosh! Look at these cuties!

63
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:49,983
 - What? Are you guys dating? 
 - Excuse me?

64
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,833
 Oh, dating? That would never happen!

65
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:57,923
 I just thought she might've been very shaken up tonight.

66
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:01,103
 I was worried about Soon Ae.

67
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,833
 Yes.

68
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,523
 Hurry up and go.

69
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,003
 You said you have someone to meet.

70
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,633
 I'm going.

71
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,783
 Gosh, it's always the quiet ones.

72
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,393
 Hey!

73
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:24,113
 You better be good to my sister.

74
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:30,653
 Don't go around fighting with this cute face! You got that?

75
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,383
 Yes, I understand.

76
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:34,133
 Good.

77
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:38,223
 Why don't you get going?

78
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,503
 - And come home early. 
 - Yes.

79
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:44,753
 If you don't, I'll get in big trouble with Mom and Dad.

80
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,653
 All right.

81
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:50,133
 This sister will disappear for you.

82
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,133
 Have a great time!

83
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,013
 I'm off!

84
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:56,943
 Come home early!

85
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,283
 Yes, Miss!

86
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:06,753
 Why is Lee Kyeong Ae... like that?

87
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,773
 - Your wound... 
 - Whoa, yes.

88
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:24,093
 Is it okay?

89
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,823
 It's okay.

90
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:29,993
 I can just put on some soybean paste later. 
  (Old wive's tale for healing wounds)

91
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:36,343
 Since I saw that you're okay, I'll just get going, then.

92
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:41,293
 We have a lot on our rooftop.

93
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,163
 Soybean paste.

94
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,763
Rooftop?

95
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,183
Rooftop?

96
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,343
Our rooftop?

97
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:55,673
You were together at that time of night?

98
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,293
Exactly what time?

99
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,543
And do you also remember how long you stayed together?

100
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:11,203
Well...

101
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:15,203
he said he would wait with me until Sister returned.

102
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:20,893
So he was with me all night until the sun came up.

103
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:23,133
So there's no way Hee Seop could be the culprit—

104
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,873
What you just told us, does anyone else know?

105
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,593
No.

106
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:34,983
It should stay that way.

107
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:41,073
From now on, forever.

108
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:43,943
Then... what about Hee Seop?

109
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:46,213
Who the hell cares about that punk Hee Seop?

110
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,843
You haven't even known him for long!

111
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,503
But you're calling a guy's name so affectionately!

112
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:54,163
Don't you know what people are whispering about your sister?

113
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,323
That night!

114
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:59,093
Why would she have gone all the way to that abandoned house?

115
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:02,993
She went to drink and meet guys!

116
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:07,453
Don't you know that's what people are gossiping about her?

117
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:13,203
What if they hear that the second daughter spent the entire night with a guy on her rooftop?

118
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:19,333
Dirty rumors spread like wildfire in a small rural town like this!

119
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,303
You!

120
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,803
Must you have your mom hear that, too?

121
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:25,933
Dad!

122
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:30,143
If he's not guilty, he will be released.

123
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,453
So, none of you should

124
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:40,863
never... utter that story.

125
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,613
Mr. Yoon.

126
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,943
I know it's shameless of me,

127
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:58,873
but please, I am begging you.

128
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:18,835

129
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:24,563
Man, he won't open his mouth! What a dumbass!

130
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,263
Hey!

131
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:30,293
You got this blood splattered here while you were killing the victim. Right?

132
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:35,403
When you cracked open Lee Kyeong Ae's head last night at that abandoned house!

133
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:37,953
Answer me, punk!

134
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,033
I'll do it.

135
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,723
How could you do that? You're family.

136
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,443
It will be heartbreaking.

137
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:48,293
Besides, that's not even legal.

138
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,363
Hey! Make him talk.

139
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,613
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

140
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,273
Hold him.

141
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,723
Let's go.

142
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,485
Come here.

143
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,235
Punk!

144
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,713
While you were talking earlier, you said she was meeting someone. Right?

145
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,433
When Kyeong Ae was leaving that night.

146
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,513
Yes.

147
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:20,963
But... she said he was really nice.

148
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:25,233
She said he had saved her that day.

149
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,833
 You already suspected who it was, didn't you?

150
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,873
 If it wasn't the right confession,

151
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:39,353
 there was only one reason why Baek Hee Seop would do that.

152
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:43,993
 Of course, the person Dad wanted to protect was not Mom.

153
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,133
 Are you hurt anywhere?

154
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:50,443
 The last person Lee Kyeong Ae went to see that night.

155
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,283
 Baek Yoo Seop, the one with the blue cap.

156
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:56,813
 Once again, Dad was trying to protect his older brother

157
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:59,703
 that he had been devoted to all his life.

158
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,583
They asked about Hee Seop earlier, and now it's Yoo Seop?

159
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:10,543
I'm really grateful that you saved our Yong Woo last time, Mr. Yoon.

160
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,643
But why do you keep bothering our family?

161
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:15,793
Don't you know there's a family who's suffering more than you right now in this town?

162
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:19,733
Solving the case is my husband's job.

163
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:23,543
It's because I have something I want to ask you personally.

164
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:29,863
- You would have had to call anyway regarding Baek Hee Seop's news. 
 - If only I could see him.

165
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:33,833
I heard it's been over three days since he was seen at the boarding house.

166
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,443
This happens pretty often.

167
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:42,203
Even though he's attending such a good university in Seoul,

168
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:47,463
he's working at the factory from time to time to take his brother with him one day.

169
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:49,093
 Uncle?

170
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:52,093
He takes such good care of his younger brother.

171
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:54,553
Even through all that,

172
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:58,573
he comes down every weekend to see each other.

173
00:12:58,573 --> 00:13:03,063
So, would he even have time to sleep at the boarding house?

174
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,933
Oh, gosh! My head hurts.

175
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:10,843
Where is the boarding house located?

176
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,423
They said it was near the school.

177
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:15,733
They said somewhere in the Sillim neighborhood...

178
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,013
Sillim neighborhood?

179
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:24,333
So, Uncle was a student at Seoul National University?

180
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,303
Seoul National University...

181
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,823
Third year in the Department of Korean Language and Literature.

182
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,673
 We have a student teacher who will be with us for a month.

183
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,403
 Ms. Lee Joo Young.

184
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:37,493
 She is currently a senior at Seoul National University's Korean language and literature department.

185
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:40,243
Same school. Same department.

186
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:46,333
That means he had been in contact with the first victim.

187
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:51,393
No one could have suspected anything since they all hid everything about him.

188
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:55,293
Dad even got arrested in his place to protect his older brother.

189
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,643
And Grandpa looked the other way because he feared the townspeople's gossip.

190
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:02,913
Thanks to them, only Baek Yoo Seop was able to hide well.

191
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:05,553
But even so,

192
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:09,153
how come it was never even mentioned?

193
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,413
It was mentioned.

194
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,383
Very briefly.

195
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,513
Once. As though in passing.

196
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:19,243
 Stand up straight, punk!

197
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:23,103
 Hey! Wake up! Hurry!

198
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,893
 Just get up, okay?

199
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:28,073
 Come on, I told you to stand up!

200
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:31,113

201
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,533
 Shit!

202
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,903
 Come on, get up...

203
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,403
 Come on, say something!

204
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:38,473
Squad Chief!

205
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:41,443
Officer Kim said he picked this up near that abandoned house.

206
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:43,113
- Near the abandoned house? 
 - Yes.

207
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,653
Should I submit it as a piece of evidence?

208
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,583
What is this?

209
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:49,433
Wow, it looks like a necklace.

210
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,573
You try it on!

211
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,173
Well, this can go over my head...

212
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,533
Hey!

213
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:04,893
You said he confessed earlier.

214
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,143
Hee Seop. Hee Seop!

215
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,833
Are you all right?

216
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,663
Hee Seop.

217
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:21,653
What's going on?

218
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,773
Hey, Baek Dong Shik!

219
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,733
What are you doing?

220
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,183
Hee Seop, wake up.

221
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,323
This.

222
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:30,833
This!

223
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,513
It's your brother's, right?

224
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,693
It's Yoo Seop's, right?

225
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,003
Tell me the truth, man!

226
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,123
T-This is mine.

227
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,663
Hey, look at this crazy idiot!

228
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,453
He didn't speak when he took a beating. And now he's finally opening his mouth!

229
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:49,633
I lent it for a short while, but it's been a while since I got it back.

230
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,793
This was mine from the beginning.

231
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:54,023
No, it's not Dad's.

232
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,423
I'm sure of it.

233
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:03,443
Ever since I was little, Uncle said it was his and wouldn't let me touch it.

234
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,903
Baek Hee Seop will argue that it's his.

235
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:10,203
They'll believe him, too.

236
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,333
If things go according to how it was, he will be released no matter what.

237
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,993
But because of his confession, we don't know what will happen this time.

238
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,873
We have to find Baek Yoo Seop as soon as possible.

239
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:23,123
So, we just have to find him?

240
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:28,383
You said it would be difficult to prove the murderer with the necklace anyway.

241
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:31,413
Since it's ambiguous as to when and where he dropped the necklace.

242
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:36,443
That's why I'm going to look for one in advance.

243
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,173
A piece of lost evidence.

244
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:45,103
 That shirt from earlier

245
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:49,193
 could've been a much more important piece of evidence.

246
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,493
- Officer Kim! 
 - Goodness, Detective!

247
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:57,173
Hello.

248
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,783
- Your wife is doing well? 
 - Yes, of course.

249
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:02,263
 During a time when forensic science was unfamiliar,

250
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,873
 only if a small mistake...

251
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,553
 hadn't ruined everything in an instant...

252
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,693
Oh, geez!

253
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,563
 Contaminated evidence.

254
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:31,253
 As if it wasn't bad enough that they couldn't find any supporting evidence,

255
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:36,203
 they totally lost it altogether once the investigation ended.

256
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:40,993
 In a way, they even shattered all hopes for future possibilities.

257
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,793
 But this time will be different.

258
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:50,363
 As long as we salvage that evidence,

259
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:54,593
 Baek Yoo Seop won't be able to hide anywhere.

260
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:08,563
It's dangerous to drive with something like this.

261
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,403
What's going on?

262
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,863
Oh, that's the one, isn't it?

263
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,343
Detective Lee said he forgot to give you this.

264
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:19,273
He said to place that in this bag since it's important.

265
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,803
Yes.

266
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,313
Drive safely.

267
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:38,833
Yes.

268
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:50,183
 I'll find Baek Yoo Seop before the results come out.

269
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,163
 I'll search the school, factory, boarding house, and

270
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:55,563
 anywhere else he might be.

271
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:58,955

272
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,243
The Sillim neighborhood in Seoul.

273
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,193
 Dad!

274
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,143
 Dad!

275
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:09,823
 Dad! Please, open the door!

276
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,413
 This is not right!

277
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:18,053
What other people say is not important.

278
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:26,793
Hee Seop won't... say anything about me to anyone.

279
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,973
 Dad...

280
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:32,943
 Dad, I hate myself.

281
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:36,543
 I had no idea this was going to happen to Sister.

282
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,443
If only I had stopped her from going out,

283
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,863
this would not have happened to her.

284
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:51,783
I should have... stopped her then.

285
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:00,243
I feel like it's all my fault.

286
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:05,213
I'm such a horrible person, and

287
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,653
 I hate myself so much.

288
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,453
 But, Dad,

289
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,453
even if we...

290
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,863
even if we lost Sister,

291
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:27,483
turning a blind eye to someone else taking the fall,

292
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,213
that's not right.

293
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,003
That's really the wrong thing to do...

294
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,603
Yoon Young, please help me.

295
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,869
Where are you going right now?

296
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,249
To the police station.

297
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:56,739
I need to tell them the truth if he's still in jail.

298
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:59,639
Hee Seop must be so scared by himself right now.

299
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,410
We have to hurry.

300
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,849
Just stop.

301
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:08,789
This is not the time for you to step forward.

302
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:10,499
What do you mean?

303
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,359
All the adults will take care of everything.

304
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,839
- So if you just wait and... 
 - Which adults?

305
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:24,177
The kind of adult... who handcuffs his nephew without knowing the full story, and

306
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,320
causes the rumor to spread throughout town? That kind of adult?

307
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,360

308
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:32,922
You have someone like Mr. Yoon, and I have my mom and dad.

309
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:38,332
I wouldn't do this if he had people who would stand up for him no matter what.

310
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:41,312
But Hee Seop doesn't have anyone!

311
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:45,572
I have to go.

312
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,372
Just stay still if you don't know anything.

313
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:51,962
Do you think the police are stupid?

314
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,742
The reason Baek Hee Seop ended up that way

315
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:59,282
- is his fault, too! 
 - What do you know!

316
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:01,182
I have to go.

317
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,242
Let go!

318
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:07,892
Please, let go!

319
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,712
I'm saying I have to go.

320
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,252
I have to go!

321
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:35,042
I promised him.

322
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,022
I promised him.

323
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,439
 You're really going to put soybean paste on me?

324
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,429
 That's what we decided.

325
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,629
 Show me your face.

326
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:23,079
 Gosh, but... I think I'll look really funny.

327
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,629
 It's going to smell like poop.

328
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,559
 Come on now!

329
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,529
 Hurry!

330
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:37,889
 You can't open your eyes.

331
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:40,519
 Y-Yes. I got it.

332
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,060

333
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:18,709
 Idiot, who would actually put soybean paste on their face in this day and age?

334
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:21,059
 Oh, geez.

335
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,649
 You dropped...

336
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,009
 the honorifics.

337
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,109
 You don't like it?

338
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,799
 I like it.

339
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,079
 Because I like it... I'm scared.

340
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:57,849
 I'm afraid that you'll...

341
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,179
 become someone very precious to me.

342
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,669
 Then why?

343
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:09,699
 Because I lose people easily.

344
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,219
 My mom and dad.

345
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,329
 Even my older brother.

346
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:21,739
 When I love and treasure them,

347
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,209
 they all leave me.

348
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,849
 Whenever I think of something

349
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:51,129
 lonely or scary,

350
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,689
 I imagine a small door.

351
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,929
 A small door?

352
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,979
 Yes.

353
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:09,969
 There's a small door in my heart.

354
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:16,199
 Behind that door... is someone who always waits for me.

355
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:27,589
 So whenever you feel lonely or scared, close your eyes and imagine that door.

356
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:34,459
 Then I'll always wait for you behind that door.

357
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,039
 You just have to open the door.

358
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,549
 Really?

359
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,939
 Yes.

360
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,609
 Oh, my goodness.

361
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,559
Get a hold of yourself, Lee Soon Ae.

362
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:35,079
You're mistaken if you think Bae Hee Seop cares for you as much as you care for him.

363
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,689
You know nothing. How dare you say that?

364
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:44,679
Soon Ae!

365
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:50,589
- I'm disappointed in you. 
 - Go ahead and be disappointed.

366
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,829
It's much better for you that things end this way now.

367
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:16,319
I'm telling you. I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

368
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,689
My mom and dad saw it with me, too.

369
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:23,729
Remember when we went on the school picnic, there was a cute guy who played the guitar really well?

370
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:29,289
I saw him handcuffed like this, and trembling with a sorrowful look in his eyes.

371
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,179
You're talking about him?

372
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:33,549
- Yeah, yeah, that's him! 
 - Oh, gosh.

373
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,509
Oh, my goodness! How can that happen?

374
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,659
- He doesn't look like the type, does he? 
 - That's what I mean!

375
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,769
Oh, my goodness.

376
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:45,949
- Gosh, he must be so scared... 
 - What an idiot.

377
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:49,719
He's making things complicated.

378
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,219
Okay, your homeroom teacher won't be here for a few days due to personal reasons.

379
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:14,959
So in the meantime, don't cause any trouble and focus on your studies.

380
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,529
Who's not here yet over there?

381
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,249
That's the murderer's seat.

382
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,659
Hey, you immature kids!

383
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:31,069
Nothing is certain at this point, so how dare you make such an accusation against your fellow classmate!

384
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,739
My dad said that no one in our town would do something terrible like that.

385
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,969
But Baek Hee Seop is a transfer student.

386
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,219
He came from far.

387
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:43,269
His uncle is a policeman, and he even arrested him.

388
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:45,039
So, isn't it pretty obvious?

389
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,589
 Mom...

390
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:11,499
 Mom! Mom!

391
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,569
 Mom! Mom!

392
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,319
 My mom! Mom!

393
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,889
 - Mom! 
 - Miss!

394
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,629
 Is there an adult?

395
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,519
 Wait a minute.

396
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,969

397
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,859
 Where were you all day today?

398
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:18,499
 Something came up with your uncle...

399
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,699
 Why?

400
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,779
 Even this time,

401
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,539
 Dad chose his older brother.

402
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,209
 No matter how sad Mom is,

403
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:42,469
 no matter how much his life becomes twisted, once again...

404
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,399
 we are pushed aside...

405
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,499
 when it comes to Uncle.

406
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,449
 Just the way it's always been.

407
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,740

408
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,570

409
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,370

410
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,479
Seoul is a pretty big place.

411
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,839
Even if his younger brother was arrested in his place,

412
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,589
he will look the other way and hide.

413
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,139
It would be weirder if you found him easily.

414
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:05,029
We were wrong.

415
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,909
Baek Hee Seop wasn't trying to cover up...

416
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:11,599
the murder.

417
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,569
Something was strange.

418
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,689
Even before we arrived, even without a confession,

419
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,799
Baek Hee Seop was still a suspect.

420
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,099
He said both the shirt and the lock were his, but

421
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,889
that he never committed murder.

422
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:32,629
Someone determined to take the blame denies committing the crime?

423
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:38,289
Well, that's because... he thought the evidence would be too ambiguous, so to get out of it...

424
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,679
No, that's not it.

425
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,499
He really wasn't the one.

426
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,290
I asked the same question to everyone I met there.

427
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,389
When was the last time you saw Baek Yoo Seop?

428
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:06,719

429
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,059

430
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:21,519
 I really don't know.

431
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,699
 Just because I live in the same boarding house doesn't mean I know everything.

432
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,319
 We don't know anything.

433
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:31,510
 Don't ask us.

434
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,729
 That night...

435
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:42,669
 even though I saw them clearly drag him way in the front that night,

436
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,399
 I couldn't do anything.

437
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:48,379
 I didn't even dare follow him.

438
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,449
 He was bleeding a lot.

439
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,099
 I don't know if he was able to run away okay after getting injured like that.

440
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,979
 No one has heard from him since that day.

441
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:07,619
 I'm so worried about him.

442
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,059
Half of them pretended not to know, and

443
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,829
half of them told me their stories.

444
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,879
On the night of the 16th,

445
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:17,569
they all saw Baek Yoo Seop.

446
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,319
On top of that, it was in the middle of Seoul.

447
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,789
Wait! Then, what about my dad?

448
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:27,539
If it wasn't Baek Yoo Seop... then what's going to happen to my dad now?

449
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,679
But at least, that shirt will help us.

450
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,579
What the police want can't be found there.

451
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,019
But still.

452
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,699
But what if?

453
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:52,929
Let's see...

454
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,649
The blood stain on the shirt is

455
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:59,539
blood type A.

456
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:00,899
Type A?

457
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:03,649
Hey, what's the victim's blood type again?

458
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:05,189
Lee Joo Young is blood type O, and

459
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,859
- Lee Kyeong Ae is type B. 
 - Then what about this punk?

460
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:12,489
- He's type O. 
 - What?

461
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,179
What is this?

462
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:15,849
Then whose blood is this?

463
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,999
Oh, man!

464
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:22,139
- Hello, everyone. 
 - Hello.

465
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,249
You're all working very hard.

466
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:26,799
Who...

467
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,129
We are your family from Seoul.

468
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:31,929
I already called the chief.

469
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,459
Was the message not relayed to you?

470
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,839
Oh, yes, yes.

471
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:41,949
Why the hell did you waste time on this? It's probably not his blood, anyway.

472
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,559
Right, Hee Seop?

473
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,009
What is this?

474
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,429
What do you think?

475
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:51,789
I'm arresting university punks who committed crimes worse than murder.

476
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:02,389
Hey, Hee Seop.

477
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,149
You have to go with us now.

478
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:14,339
We're looking for your brother, Baek Yoo Seop.

479
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,539
You punk.

480
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,569
You knew we would be coming, didn't you?

481
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:24,009
- Hey! Hey, where are you going? 
 - Hold on.

482
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,669
Hey! Okay, I got it. I got it.

483
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,509
I got it! Let go of me for a second!

484
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,429
Okay, I'm just going to talk.

485
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:30,929
Hey, assholes!

486
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,449
Hey! Hee Seop!

487
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,279
Hee Seop! Don't worry!

488
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,879
Hey! Hee Seop!

489
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,609
- Okay, that's enough. 
 - They can't do that!

490
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,149
Hey, you punks!

491
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:41,159
Hey, you punks! Hee Seop!

492
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,399
Hee Seop!

493
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:44,729
Hey, Hee Seop!

494
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:46,799
Hey, you assholes!

495
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,149
Wait here.

496
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,220

497
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,780

498
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,739
Dad...

499
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:04,639
Dad...

500
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:09,939
Baek Yoo Seop.

501
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:13,329
Baek Yoo Seop.

502
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:16,679
Baek Yoo Seop.

503
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,939
Baek Yoo Seop.

504
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,589
 I brought all your belongings, Dad.

505
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:31,169
 So you can just live here as you want!

506
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:35,399
 Did you even come once while Mom was in the hospital?

507
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,299
 - But here! 
 - Over there,

508
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,079
 you are there.

509
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,589
 So that's what I mean.

510
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,149
 We don't need you, either, Dad!

511
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,109
 We're sick of it!

512
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,009
 Just in case...

513
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:58,729
 Just in case you show up late,

514
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:01,739
 we keep waiting even though we know you won't show up!

515
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,649
 That's what I hate more than anything!

516
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:05,619
 I'm scared.

517
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:07,619
 I'm scared, Hee Seop.

518
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,389
 Hee Seop.

519
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,339
 Let's hide.

520
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:15,639
 Hee Seop.

521
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,999
 Hee Seop, let's hide.

522
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,579
 Hee Seop...

523
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,190

524
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,490

525
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,780

526
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,090

527
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,709
They keep going around the same route?

528
00:42:46,388 --> 00:42:48,398
Hee Seop...

529
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:55,054
Where is Hee Seop right now?

530
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,344
You punk!

531
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,104
You punk!

532
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:06,634
Hey! Stop!

533
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:40,304
Where is... our Yoo Seop now?

534
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:50,224
Hee Seop,

535
00:43:50,224 --> 00:43:52,644
it hurts, doesn't it?

536
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:55,014
Let's take the easy way.

537
00:43:55,974 --> 00:43:58,004
I don't know!

538
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,974
I told you I don't know!

539
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:11,464
Then, I'll help you remember.

540
00:44:21,984 --> 00:44:24,164
What do you mean murder?

541
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,704
Who?

542
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,954
Who died?

543
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:31,334
How could things go down like that?

544
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:34,544
That shirt belongs to me.

545
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:37,424
Hee Seop... Hee Seop knew everything already.

546
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,554
He already knew what I did earlier that night!

547
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,844
Hee Seop...

548
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:18,154
That night...

549
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:23,004
After he escaped,

550
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:27,584
your brother came to see you.

551
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:29,814
Right?

552
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:43,154
That never happened!

553
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,644
Hee Seop.

554
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:47,754
Hee Seop.

555
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:50,544
Hee Seop. Yes...

556
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:53,274
Do you know what kind of place this is?

557
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:56,364
The kind of place you can't even imagine.

558
00:45:56,364 --> 00:46:00,164
This is completely different from a rural police station!

559
00:46:00,164 --> 00:46:06,174
So if things go wrong here, no one will ever know what happened to you. Got it?

560
00:46:12,274 --> 00:46:14,464
But I-I...

561
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,404
- I-I... 
 - Huh?

562
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:17,534
Yeah?

563
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:19,624
I'm ignorant, so...

564
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:24,024
I don't know what that means.

565
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:28,474
Oh, how tiresome. Tiresome.

566
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:30,474
Tiresome!

567
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,864
So now, do you remember?

568
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:44,184
Are you going to tell us or what?

569
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:46,304
I guess not yet! Let's go!

570
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,324
 Brother?

571
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:02,654
 What happened?

572
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:11,004
 Hee Seop!

573
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:12,714
 Brother!

574
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,484
 Brother...

575
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:26,974
 Hee Seop...

576
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,574
 Yes?

577
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,500
 Oh, what... w-what is this?

578
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:35,804
 I'm asking you, what is this?

579
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:41,034
 Brother, did you protest again?

580
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:45,894
 D-Did you?

581
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:48,294
 I'm sorry, Hee Seop.

582
00:47:49,794 --> 00:47:51,544
 I'm...

583
00:47:52,424 --> 00:47:54,624
 I'm sorry.

584
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:57,674
 I told you not to do that kind of dangerous thing anymore!

585
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,054
 I told you not to ever do that again!

586
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,350
 Where did it go?

587
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,444
 You bastard.

588
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:26,084
 You idiot!

589
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,284
 Did you forget everything?

590
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:32,574
 Huh?

591
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,774
 Did you forget about all this?

592
00:48:36,574 --> 00:48:38,174
 If I had forgotten,

593
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:42,794
 would I be doing this, Hee Seop?

594
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,064

Mom! Dad!

595
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:47,124
 Something terrible is happening!

596
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:50,864
 - There are gunshots in the streets, and people are dying! 
 - What?

597
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:54,794
 Yoo Seop must've eaten something wrong, dear.

598
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:58,254
 It's not even summer yet, and you must be having a heat stroke.

599
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,634
 I'm serious!

600
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,844
 Gosh, come in. Stop saying nonsense.

601
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:03,464
 Jin Seop's mom!

602
00:49:03,464 --> 00:49:05,804
- Goodness! Jin Seop's mom! 
 - What?

603
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:08,294
 I think you need to go to the city hospital!

604
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:10,244
 - W-Why? 
 - What?

605
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:12,074
 What are you talking about?

606
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,564
 So many students in that school were shot while protesting,

607
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:20,314
 and they're covered in straw bags left and right and pushed aside!

608
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:24,204
 Jin Seop goes to that school, doesn't he?

609
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,714
 Oh my god!

610
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,554
 Mom!

611
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:28,894
 Mom.

612
00:49:28,894 --> 00:49:33,424
 Your dad and I will be right back.

613
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:36,654
 We'll go and find your brother.

614
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:40,134
 Don't come outside no matter what, all right?

615
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:42,124
 Mom...

616
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:44,274
 If anything happens,

617
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:48,504
 Yoo Seop and Hee Seop,

618
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:53,314
 have pity on each other...

619
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:57,734
 and the two of you should take good care of each other

620
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:00,604
 and live a good life. Okay?

621
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:02,274
 Mom...

622
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:05,874
 You promised me, okay?

623
00:50:05,874 --> 00:50:07,804
 - Mom! 
 - Mom!

624
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,544
 - Mom! 
 - Mom! Mom!

625
00:50:10,544 --> 00:50:12,874
 - Dad! 
 - Mom!

626
00:50:12,874 --> 00:50:15,144
 - Dad! 
 - Mom!

627
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:57,004
 How could I forget that day?

628
00:50:57,894 --> 00:51:00,034
 Hee Seop.

629
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:05,204
 How could I forget those gunshots?

630
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:10,274
 Then, what about the promise we made with Mom?

631
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:12,464
 How am I going to live if this happens to you?

632
00:51:12,464 --> 00:51:14,484
 Then, what do we do?

633
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,384
 Huh?

634
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:20,774
 Mom,

635
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:22,864
 Dad,

636
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:25,444
 our older brother,

637
00:51:25,444 --> 00:51:27,614
 we lost them all.

638
00:51:27,614 --> 00:51:29,974
 What do I do...

639
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:32,524
 when I feel such injustice and resentment?

640
00:51:35,374 --> 00:51:39,174
 There's a fire inside me.

641
00:51:39,174 --> 00:51:43,804
 How can I live quietly when there's a fire inside me? How...

642
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:59,904
 How can I live...

643
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:09,604
 I just found someone I like, too.

644
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:14,154
 I didn't even get to treat her nicely yet...

645
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:33,594
 Hurry up and take off your shirt.

646
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:35,234
 Okay?

647
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:38,234
 I'm going to make sure you don't get caught.

648
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:41,934
 - Hee Seop. 
 - Just hurry up!

649
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:51,594
 Do you think I can live if I lost you, too?

650
00:53:01,204 --> 00:53:03,154
 Hee Seop.

651
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:14,084
 My poor child...

652
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:16,184
 My pitiful child...

653
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:18,674
 What do I do...

654
00:53:20,104 --> 00:53:21,704
 Yoo Seop...

655
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:24,054
 Hee Seop...

656
00:53:24,054 --> 00:53:28,704
 have pity on each other...

657
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:33,084
 and two of you should take good care of each other

658
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,124
 and live a good life. Okay?

659
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:40,234
 You must survive, okay?

660
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:48,234
Mom...

661
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:53,114
I'm so scared...

662
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:21,164
I am the one they are looking for.

663
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:24,164
Please.

664
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,804
Please.

665
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:31,554
Please take me to my brother.

666
00:55:00,874 --> 00:55:02,804
Let's go inside.

667
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:06,514
Yoon Young.

668
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,750

669
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,710

670
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,224
You're saying he's here?

671
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:36,114
Inside here?

672
00:55:36,114 --> 00:55:37,564
Yes.

673
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:39,994
I saw him with my own eyes.

674
00:55:40,724 --> 00:55:42,344
I'll bring him.

675
00:55:42,344 --> 00:55:43,964
No.

676
00:55:43,964 --> 00:55:45,634
That's not a good way.

677
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,364
I have an idea. Don't worry.

678
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:49,664
Just wait here.

679
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:52,654
There's no good way in this situation.

680
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:55,714
If anything happens to Hee Seop in my place,

681
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:59,704
I can no longer... I can no longer live.

682
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:04,124
If my way works and Hee Seop is released,

683
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:08,074
then could you please take good care of him?

684
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:15,624
It's dangerous, so wait here.

685
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:30,550

686
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,710

687
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:55,680

688
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:05,180

689
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:14,600
♫  The footsteps that slowed down before we knew it  ♫

690
00:57:15,424 --> 00:57:21,290
♫  The tired look as you stand on the road  ♫

691
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:25,420
♫  In the end  ♫

692
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:37,420
♫  What were you looking for again that you didn't even know it was here  ♫

693
00:57:39,174 --> 00:57:45,060
♫  Are you still wandering?  ♫

694
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:56,920
♫  At the end of a tiring day, you stand still  ♫

695
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:05,380
♫  Standing alone here where there's no light  ♫

696
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:14,114
♫  When you cry over even a small difficulty  ♫

697
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:17,694
♫  Above my tired shoulders  ♫

698
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,344
Are you all right?

699
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:31,400
♫  Without any words, pulling me into your arms  ♫

700
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,614
I'm all right.

701
00:58:36,734 --> 00:58:39,564
I did something wrong

702
00:58:39,564 --> 00:58:43,924
so isn't it reasonable to receive punishment?

703
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:46,784
What did you do wrong?

704
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,740
I must've done something wrong.

705
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,700
That must be why...

706
00:58:56,544 --> 00:59:00,044
everything turned out like this.

707
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,900
If I didn't,

708
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,000
why would any of this happen?

709
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,560
If I didn't, then why...

710
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:20,820
why would something like this happen to us?

711
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,100
But...

712
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:30,354
do you know what I did wrong?

713
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:33,554
Do you know what we did wrong?

714
00:59:33,554 --> 00:59:35,584
Do you know?

715
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:38,884
 Who am I?

716
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:43,730
 And where is this place?

717
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:54,194
♫  Without any words, pulling me into your arms  ♫

718
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:58,920
 After traveling this far in time,

719
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:03,250
 what kind of answer should I give you?

720
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,930

721
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:15,874
 I'm here without knowing anything like a fool.

722
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:18,614
 Right here,

723
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:22,700
 in your darkest hour,

724
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,700
 I'm here.

725
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:29,680
♫  ...pulling me into your arms  ♫

726
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,350

727
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:41,324
♫  The way you mean something to me  ♫

728
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:47,684
♫  Am I someone who means something to you, too?  ♫

729
01:00:47,684 --> 01:00:57,554
♫  No matter what anyone else says, without care  ♫

730
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:59,454

731
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:00,954
 You collected all these?

732
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:03,414
 All the movie tickets from when we were dating.

733
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:04,424
 With Mom?

734
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:07,454
 What was the first movie we saw together again?

735
01:01:07,454 --> 01:01:10,034
 "Our Happy Youthful Days"

736
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,464
 I didn't get to watch it because I fell asleep.

737
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:18,004
♫  I think of your face  ♫

738
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:20,754
 Mr. Yoon.

739
01:01:20,754 --> 01:01:24,344
 Hello.

740
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:29,364
♫  I ended up staying up all night  ♫
