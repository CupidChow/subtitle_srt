1
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,673
   

2
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:47,373
   

3
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,680
Credit

4
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:16,873
 When I look back, it was a really strange night. 

5
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,133
 You are off course and will be redirected. 

6
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,123
 Searching for your route. 

7
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:35,193
 It's rare for one thing after another to go wrong like that. 

8
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:39,123
 The damn weather, crazy navigation, 

9
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:41,263
 and a broken cell phone. 

10
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:44,303
   

11
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,273
 That's when it appeared in front of me. 

12
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:46,413
   

13
00:02:55,203 --> 00:03:00,163
 In it, I found instructions for a time machine. 

14
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:04,953
 That's right, the time machine in novels and movies. 

15
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,903
What's this?

16
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,923
 I worked in the press department for seven years. 

17
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:14,903
 For someone who worked with facts, it seemed too fantastical. 

18
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:20,723
 I did not give a damn about becoming the main character of such a fantasy. 

19
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,823
 But there was a variable. 

20
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:28,093
 That darn curiosity. 

21
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:41,473
   

22
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:42,963
   

23
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,093
   

24
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,473
   

25
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,953
 The year 3089. 

26
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,523
 What did I see out there? 

27
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,463
 That is not what is important. 

28
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:34,793
 It's what happened after. 

29
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:39,453
   

30
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,253
   

31
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,060
   

32
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:12,123
 What did I see out there? 

33
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:16,973
 What was it that I saw? 

34
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,173
What did you see there?

35
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,253
Not sure.

36
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:46,863
Anyway, my life also completely veered off course after that.

37
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:51,473
Since I'm sitting here rambling to you guys.

38
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:57,943
He seems like a crazy man, Oppa.

39
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:02,423
Don't you feel bad for him? Let's just listen to his story.

40
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:06,083
Are you holding onto what I gave you earlier?

41
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,973
Yes.

42
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:12,033
I will pay for it later, so eat whatever you want.

43
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,113
- See you in 15 minutes. 
 - Okay.

44
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:18,933
 We tell ourselves to make it a great village filled with kind people. 

45
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:22,453
 More teenagers are using hallucinogenic substances 

46
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,693
 From inhaling glue and butane gas to varnish and benzol. 

47
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,963
 They're now new hallucinogenic substances. 

48
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,393
   

49
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:33,023
   
   

50
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,193
 You all worked so hard 

51
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,173
 taking good care of the elders. 

52
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:40,513
- Let's sit down. 
 - Goodness!

53
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,193
 Have a drink. 

54
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,263
Attention! Everyone!

55
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:50,553
As you all know, our Woojeong Village

56
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:56,883
has been selected consecutively for five years as a crime-free town!

57
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:04,333
Clean water and peaceful neighborhoods!

58
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,043
Isn't this a wonderful place to live? Isn't that so, everyone?

59
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,953
Yes!

60
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,473
Let's drink to that!

61
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,673
He acts as though he has won an award.

62
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:17,243
He always likes to step forward. That moron.

63
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:20,053
- Gosh. He looks good up there. 
 - Yeah, right.

64
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:25,093
The person responsible for making this place a great place to live in!

65
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:29,483
That lantern in our village that everyone respects!

66
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:35,543
I introduce to you Principal Yoon Byeong Koo, also the chairman!

67
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:39,053
Oh, no, no. Why are you doing that? I told you not to!

68
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,183
Don't do that!

69
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,173
Say a few words!

70
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,603
Thank you!

71
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:50,453
There is nothing I did.

72
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:56,593
First. It is due to all the good-natured Woojeong villagers here.

73
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:02,143
Second. Just like their parents, our kids are raised so well...

74
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:04,143
I don't think so.

75
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:17,173
It's because you hardly know each other but trust blindly that you are faced with a tragedy.

76
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,153
 What is he talking about? 

77
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:20,603
 What? 

78
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:25,533
In about thirty seconds, after you hear shouting in the mountains behind there

79
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:29,933
you will see six juvenile delinquents fleeing in different directions.

80
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:35,043
They have all inhaled glue and three of them are girls from this town.

81
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,953
- What is he talking about? 
 - Our kids sniff glue?

82
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,153
No way!

83
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:43,393
A reporter who already obtained this information is on his way here now.

84
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:45,043
- R-Reporter? 
 - What? Reporter?

85
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:48,503
He will arrive in five minutes, so we have four minutes and thirty seconds.

86
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,233
We have to take care of this within that time.

87
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,403
Who the heck are you? You look like an outsider.

88
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,393
How dare you say such a ridiculous thing about our town?

89
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:59,493
Woojeong High School 12th grade, Class 1, Kim Hye Kyeong.

90
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:02,133
T-That's my second child's class.

91
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,433
- Same class, Yi Eun Ha. 
 - Our Eun Ha?

92
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,533
Our cute baby?

93
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:10,033
- Also, same class, Park Yoo Ri. 
 - Wait...

94
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,533
That is my granddaughter.

95
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,413
Are you all going to be okay?

96
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:18,013
According to the laws regarding the use of hallucinogenic substances...

97
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,133
- W-What was that sound? 
 - What was it?

98
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:23,303
- W-Was that a person's voice? 
 - Yes.

99
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,693
Thirty seconds have passed already.

100
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,063
Since it concerns our children,

101
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,203
let's believe him.

102
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,483
It is not me.

103
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:54,903
I did not do anything.

104
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,323
Drink.

105
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:03,073
The water here is still clean.

106
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:11,553
But... who are you?

107
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,773
You almost fell over the cliff over there

108
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:17,943
and ended your life at the age of 19. I am the one who changed that.

109
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,893
Wow.

110
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:24,093
You are so good-looking!

111
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,423
Hey!

112
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,273
- Hey, you! 
 - This crazy wench!

113
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:31,463
You crazy girl! What have you done?

114
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,013
- Oh my god! 
 - Come to your senses!

115
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:35,283
This girl...

116
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:38,173
Pull yourself together!

117
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:42,063
Dad! It hurts!

118
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,623
Go faster!

119
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:48,833
- What are you doing? 
 - Grandma. Grandpa.

120
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,743
What are you doing?

121
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:52,203
- What is this? 
 - What happened?

122
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,653
- Pay attention! 
 - Look here!

123
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,733
Do you want me to push you?

124
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,633
You are the one who coaxed the kids to sniff glue.

125
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,643
You can pretend to be in danger there.

126
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,893
But other kids were the ones in real danger.

127
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:21,730
I don't want to help a punk who almost got two perfectly fine kids killed. So just say the word.

128
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,983
I will push you over.

129
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,023
Who the hell is that asshole?

130
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:28,103
You'd better get lost!

131
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,813
   

132
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,163
Oh, wait! Wait!  What's going on?

133
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:59,343
Goodness!

134
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,933
- Goodness! 
 - Oh, thank goodness!

135
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,323
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - They're okay!

136
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:17,323
Is life difficult because your mom is different from others?

137
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,133
What?

138
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,193
What the hell do you know...

139
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:28,403
Even if you're different like this, your mom only lives for you.

140
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:35,553
So don't ever do this with other kids. Got it?

141
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,853
I am tired of this, too.

142
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:49,113
Even without you, I have a lot of people to save in this town.

143
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,413
- Goodness gracious! 
 - Wow!

144
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,363
- Oh, my goodness! 
 - You are a hero!

145
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,553
Thank you! Thank you!

146
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,263
   

147
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,663
   

148
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,897
Let me go, Dad!

149
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:09,487
This little wench!

150
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:16,463
 This is news on serious social issues of recent days of juvenile delinquents. 

151
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,393
We heard that students are sniffing glue at this location.

152
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,103
Geez, where are they talking about?

153
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:30,053
- Get a hold of yourself! 
 - Gosh!

154
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,903
We do not know how to thank you.

155
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,283
It just happened once.

156
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:38,083
For young students, instead of pushing them away,

157
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,083
we need to hold them close and guide them.

158
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,813
Isn't that our duty as adults?

159
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:47,193
Oh, my goodness! I feel as though you peered into my heart.

160
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,493
But how did you know all that?

161
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,623
The thing about 30 seconds and five minutes...

162
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:55,303
- You even knew the exact times! 
 - I know.

163
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,283
- Wow! 
 - Mister!

164
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,353
Young Ho! Young Soon!

165
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:02,163
You dropped this earlier when you left.

166
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:04,003
Oh, I did?

167
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,043
   

168
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,183
It could've been terrible.

169
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,603
It looks like I dropped this.

170
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,793
Oh! My goodness!

171
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,283
Teacher Yoon Hae Joon?

172
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,343
You are a teacher?

173
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:20,453
Oh, yes.

174
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:23,783
He is moving from Seoul to our town.

175
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,993
Oh, really?

176
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:31,963
Oh, in that case, by any chance, have you found a new position here?

177
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,933
No, not yet.

178
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:39,243
There happens to be a position open at the school I run.

179
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:41,383
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

180
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,883
What a coincidence!

181
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,763
I teach Korean!

182
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,893
- Oh, yeah! 
 - Yes!

183
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:54,143
 That is how my pretend life started there in 1987. 

184
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,250
   

185
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,673
   

186
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,393
 - I see him! 
- There! 

187
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:08,033
 - Move! 
 - Go! Go! 

188
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,533
 Go! Go! 

189
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,753
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

190
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:19,503
 I became a teacher I never desired to be before. 

191
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:25,373
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

192
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:31,133
 I even moved into a house in a rural town I never wanted to live in before. 

193
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:42,263
♫  Your gaze that is like the starlight has stolen my heart  ♫

194
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:46,433
♫  I hope it becomes a fateful moment  ♫

195
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,870
   

196
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,390
   

197
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,713
 I spent an entire month like that. 

198
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:13,333
   
 Why did I have to take it that far, you ask? 

199
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:20,653
The serial murder case in Woojeong Village in 1987.

200
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:27,133
Back then, thirty-four years ago, the people you killed were still alive. Over there.

201
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:31,633
No, I did not kill them.

202
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,603
I know.

203
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,713
What?

204
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,983
That's why I am going there to find the real killer.

205
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,913
That is how you and I will both live.

206
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,723
What do you mean?

207
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,333
You will be released tomorrow morning.

208
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,833
I will see you in Woojeong, then.

209
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,393
I will let you know the meaning of it all.

210
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:08,203
So until tomorrow morning, be sure to stay alive.

211
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,613
   

212
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,333
   

213
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,133
   

214
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,733
   

215
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,023
   
 Yoon Young, where are you? 

216
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,153
 You are on your way, right? 

217
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:17,273
 I know it's your day off, but she only wants you. 

218
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,223
 I am almost there. 

219
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,933
 I knew I couldn't take a day off anyway. 

220
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,913
   

221
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,393
What now?

222
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,093
Another video? What is it?

223
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,883
 You know... 

224
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:57,443
 It's from when you were little and sang so cutely. 

225
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,213
 I am afraid I will lose that old recording. 

226
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:04,283
 So you can transfer it to a USB or something, right? 

227
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,593
Okay, I will do it next time.

228
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,763
 You said you would do it over a year ago. 

229
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:11,243
Not like I am not doing it on purpose.

230
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,243
 Are you still busy these days? 

231
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,443
 It must be so tough for you. 

232
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:19,013
 But you will come home today even if it's late, right? 

233
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,363
Today?

234
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:43,073
Do we have to make a big deal of Dad's birthday every time?

235
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,113
Has he ever brought flowers on your birthday?

236
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:51,333
We're lucky if he even comes home.

237
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:56,293
You always make dinner, and it ends up being just the two of us!

238
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,463
Your dad is busy. That's why.

239
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:01,243
Doing what?

240
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,653
Drinking and fighting with other people?

241
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,283
Oh, don't be like that!

242
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:11,883
I'll prepare many delicious dishes. Like your favorite, japchae.

243
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:15,223
Don't go through the trouble. I'm not going.

244
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:21,223
I'll send some money. Go out and buy some clothes, and walk around.

245
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:25,463
Don't be so frustrated and rewatch old videos.

246
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,493
Bye!

247
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:33,483
So you're asking why all the murderers in my novels are women?

248
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,993
Well, I'm not sure...

249
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:40,003
But I guess it's not strange that an old woman is writing novels?

250
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,813
As some men in the world commit murders wherever they are,

251
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:49,653
some women commit such hideous murders as well.

252
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:55,523
Of those cases, I choose to write about certain stories I know more about.

253
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:59,523
Then, shall we ask the next question?

254
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:04,923
This is the first novel released in 1987 titled "Small Door."

255
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:09,683
Out of all your books, this is the only one where no murderers appear.

256
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:13,023
There it is. Your favorite novel, Yoon Young.

257
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:19,003
Yes. That's the novel I love to hate that dragged me into this hell.

258
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:22,983
You wrote this when you were merely 19 years old.

259
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:26,113
Isn't it boring to talk about the past?

260
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:32,833
More than that, I would like to introduce the most important person to me right now.

261
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,203
Over there, in the back.

262
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:38,393
Do you see the gorgeous woman standing there?

263
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:44,323
She's my editor-in-charge, whom I mentioned earlier and my soulmate.

264
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:49,183
The main reason for my success is thanks to her hidden efforts!

265
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,130
Thank you.

266
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,853
Damn it! Who came up with all those questions?

267
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:03,053
I can't even write these days, and he dares to ask such moronic questions!

268
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,733
Why the hell did he bring up that old novel and start blabbering?

269
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:09,763
I've got many books that sold over a million copies, and he's still bringing up that book!

270
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:12,723
Gosh, you're talking about it like it's someone else's book.

271
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:18,343
Out of your fans, do you know how many became followers since that first novel?

272
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:21,643
Among them, I am that number one fan.

273
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:24,033
If it weren't for your lines from the novel, I'd be...

274
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,733
Hey!

275
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,683
Do you think I want to listen to your story?

276
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:30,623
Shall we go to the workroom?

277
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,883
Gosh, I need to relieve my stress.

278
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:41,343
Yes?

279
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:45,213
My daughter! What?

280
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,003
We will leave now.

281
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,403
What a rude girl.

282
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:01,853
Who asked for money? I just wanted to see her face.

283
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:06,873
Do you think I'm watching videos because I don't have money?

284
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:08,633
Geez.

285
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,333
Goodness...

286
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:17,043
Whoa, expensive!

287
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,923
Hello.

288
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,613
You waited a long time. I'm sorry.

289
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,653
- Would you show us size 36? 
 - Okay.

290
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:54,063
- What about the restaurant? 
 - I made a reservation at the place across the street.

291
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,843
It'll be perfect timing if you go as soon as In Ah arrives.

292
00:23:56,843 --> 00:24:00,163
I sent a location link to Professor Park.

293
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,683
Did you read the introduction I sent you?

294
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:07,853
Can't you see my dark circles?

295
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:11,483
I stayed up all night reading because it was so good!

296
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,113
What a relief.

297
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:16,123
I guess it won't get shredded this time.

298
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,963
You're dissatisfied with my sentences.

299
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:22,213
Oh, no!  What are you saying...

300
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:25,003
The responses are good only when you edit it...

301
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:27,753
so I don't really have complaints, either.

302
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:34,013
Editing is something anyone can do.

303
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:39,713
Of course. Everything originated from you.

304
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:41,563
Give them to me.

305
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:46,053
This novel will do really well. I have a good feeling.

306
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:53,093
They say good shoes take you to good places.

307
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:57,363
Then, where are you planning to go in those shoes?

308
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,333
 Don't push! 

309
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,733
 It's a 50% sale! 

310
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,833
Mom?

311
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:31,133
 - Let go! 
 - Oh, my gosh! 

312
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,213
It's like street bargain shopping.

313
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:37,803
What's all the fuss over such cheap items?

314
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,353
 - I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine. 

315
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,253
Such pathetic lives.

316
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,323
 - How much is this? 
 - I need size 39. 

317
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:49,793
You shouldn't lose your dignity even if you don't have much.

318
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:53,523
Before you get old, keep that in mind.

319
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:54,863
 Mom! 

320
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:56,303
Hey!

321
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:58,993
Unni, have you been well?

322
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:02,083
What are we eating? I'm so hungry.

323
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,903
You must be starving following my mom around.

324
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,583
Your dad must be waiting. Let's hurry.

325
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,433
Let's go, Unni. Let's catch up after we eat.

326
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:16,163
 - Oh, it's cheap! 
 - Let me see! 

327
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,593
 - Gosh, don't push! 
 - Let's see. 

328
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,243
Geez...

329
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:58,893
Mom!

330
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,703
Mom!

331
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,893
Mom!

332
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:10,683
Mom!

333
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,033
Oh, my gosh! Are you crazy?

334
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,983
Aren't you scared? There are cars coming!

335
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:31,423
So you couldn't hear me calling?

336
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:35,453
Oh, I was calculating in my head how much I spent today.

337
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,673
Okay! Don't be mad.

338
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:39,033
I'm not mad.

339
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:42,263
Oh, good! Try these on.

340
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:43,763
What is it?

341
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,823
Quickly. If they don't fit, I need to exchange them.

342
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:53,763
Should I put them on for you?

343
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:57,213
No, no! Ow!

344
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:58,623
Oh, gosh!

345
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:02,823
- I said I'll try them on later! 
 - Gosh...

346
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:06,083
- Put them on. 
 - Oh, okay! I'll do it.

347
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:11,073
- Is that good? 
 - Yeah!

348
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:13,573
They fit perfectly. Right?

349
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:15,163
Is it because my daughter is pretty?

350
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:17,533
There's light beaming from the shoes!

351
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:21,023
They say you have to wear good shoes to go to good places.

352
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:26,253
There's no such a saying. That's stupid.

353
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:30,563
Hey! These were not cheap!

354
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:34,503
I didn't buy them from where you saw me earlier. I bought them at an expensive store!

355
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,903
These are really nice ones!

356
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:39,323
That's not what I'm...

357
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:44,273
Did I ask you to buy these?

358
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:47,393
I gave money for you to buy your clothes. Did I or not?

359
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,633
I have nowhere to wear them, though.

360
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:53,083
That's why! That's why, don't go around—

361
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,083
- This. 
 - What?

362
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,103
How many times did I tell you to throw this out?

363
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:00,893
Why are you still wearing this dirty old thing over ten years old!

364
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,503
Look at everyone.

365
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:05,723
Who is wearing something like this today? Just look!

366
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,793
Geez, I shouldn't have bought that for you.

367
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:12,223
I got it. My ears hurt. Don't yell.

368
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:15,213
Are you that embarrassed?

369
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:26,503
Since you mingle with successful and smart people every day,

370
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:29,983
your mom must look like a joke to you.

371
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,973
Why are you talking like that now?

372
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:42,093
But for me, even if you wear dirty shoes and a scarf, I would never pretend like I didn't see you.

373
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:49,653
For me, no matter what you wear and what you do, I would never ignore you. You know that?

374
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:51,933
I won't...

375
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:57,493
I won't play with you, either.

376
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,943
Mom!

377
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:06,093
 Back then, 

378
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:09,183
 if only I hadn't sent Mom off like that. 

379
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,823
Oh, really.

380
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,293
 Would everything be different? 

381
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,263
I'm not going to play with you, either.

382
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:19,953
- Do you need a bag? 
 - Yes.

383
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:26,213
 I thought there would always be time to make it up to her. 

384
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,793
   

385
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,043
   

386
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:36,113
   

387
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,173
 Yes? It's mom. 

388
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:52,953
 Did you eat okay? 

389
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,893
 It's Mom. 

390
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:57,133
 Mom is... 

391
00:30:57,133 --> 00:31:00,933
 someone who always waits for me. 

392
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,503
Mom!

393
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,940
   

394
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,183
   

395
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,443
Hello?

396
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:39,423
Yes, that's right.

397
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,863
 But Mom... 

398
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:46,873
 My mom... 

399
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,810
   

400
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:06,223
There seems to be a suicide note.

401
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:16,213
Mom.

402
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,033
Mom!

403
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,303
Mom!

404
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,413
 Before then, 

405
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:42,113
 had I ever imagined a world without my mom? 

406
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,233
Mom.

407
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:54,013
Mom!

408
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:57,243
Mom!

409
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,213
 Now in this world, 

410
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:05,323
 "Mom!" 

411
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,853
Mom!

412
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,783
 even if I call out like that, 

413
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,503
 there was no one to respond. 

414
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,174
   

415
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:30,304
   

416
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:40,617
You still can't reach your father?

417
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,397
I don't know why she came here.

418
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:46,907
This place called Woojeong Village,

419
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:52,307
I've never heard of it.

420
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,411
It's pretty far from home, too.

421
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,491
   

422
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,117
We still need to investigate, but...

423
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,297
can you take a look?

424
00:35:06,297 --> 00:35:08,887
Looks like she wrote this for you.

425
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:19,277
   

426
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:20,417
Dad.

427
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:22,187
Yoon Young, is that you?

428
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,177
Your dad caused a mess again!

429
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:25,997
This time, I can't let it go.

430
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:28,617
Do you know how many plates he's broken?

431
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:30,397
What's going on?

432
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:33,367
Oh, my gosh! Don't do it there!

433
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,027
 I can't stand this! 

434
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:37,217
 My gosh! 

435
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:40,607
Could you please send me your account number and the amount?

436
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:43,557
Including all the damages up until now.

437
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,507
I'll send it to you now.

438
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:56,497
I was worried you wouldn't... I mean, you couldn't come.

439
00:35:56,497 --> 00:35:58,477
But what a relief.

440
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:12,727
You. Who are you exactly? What did you do?

441
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:15,597
You have to ask the right questions.

442
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:20,307
Are you asking how I knew you weren't the killer from 34 years ago or

443
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:25,927
how I knew you were going to hang yourself the night before being released.

444
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,947
I already gave you the answers last night.

445
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:33,847
You expect me to believe that ridiculous story?

446
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:37,287
You really expect me to believe you went there and came back?

447
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,287
Geez.

448
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:47,927
Because I rotted away in prison for 30 years, you see me now as a fool who doesn't know the times!

449
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:59,317
Exactly 16 years from now.

450
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:04,637
That's how long I was going to work like crazy and retire early

451
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:09,757
and go fishing, read, and lead an idle life in a town like this.

452
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:13,357
To live like that was my dream.

453
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,567
That's the route I chose for myself.

454
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:25,157
 So, the 16th year from now on... 

455
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:29,027
 I just wanted to see if my small and simple dream had come true. 

456
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:30,957
   

457
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:35,357
   

458
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,827
But...

459
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:40,907
it didn't.

460
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,757
It didn't come true.

461
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:49,267
I had already died much sooner.

462
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:57,497
A year from now, the year I turn 35, I will die.

463
00:37:57,497 --> 00:38:02,157
If you're asking what that has to do with you, that's because...

464
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:09,797
the culprit who killed me was the same killer in the 1987 Woojeong serial murder case.

465
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:11,567
What?

466
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,227
W-What does that mean...

467
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,397
   

468
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,221
   

469
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:36,827
   

470
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:39,927
    
 This is the mark of the criminal from 1987.

471
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:46,827
This was found even at the scene of my murder.

472
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,707
That's why the police immediately looked for you.

473
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:52,057
But you were...

474
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,917
already dead before me.

475
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,727
That you didn't kill anyone.

476
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:03,747
That you couldn't live with the injustice anymore.

477
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:08,837
Yesterday, on the night before your release, you hung yourself in that cell.

478
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:12,337
No way... How?

479
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,427
How do you know?

480
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:18,727
It doesn't make sense that someone like that would kill me.

481
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:27,087
That's why I decided to believe you.

482
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,977
What do you think?

483
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:31,837
Can I do that?

484
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:43,647
Can we catch the real culprit?

485
00:39:45,137 --> 00:39:49,857
We have to. That's why I caused the lapse of flow.

486
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:58,337
That's the only way you and I can live.

487
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:41,857
 Yoon Young, 

488
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:45,227
 I'm sorry I said some hurtful things earlier. 

489
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:46,847
 I won't... 

490
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:52,397
 I won't play with you, either. 

491
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,957
 Ever since you left home, 

492
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,237
 Mom! 

493
00:40:57,237 --> 00:41:00,377
 I felt like you were drifting further away from me. 

494
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,687
 So maybe I just wanted to throw a tantrum. 

495
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:12,317
♫  Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, the frogs are singing  ♫

496
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:15,477
♫  Son, wife, and grandson, everyone is together  ♫

497
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,847
♫  No one is listening when they sing through the night  ♫

498
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:20,827
 Lately, I think a lot about those days. 

499
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:26,317
 When you were little, you would sing "Ribbit, Ribbit," the frog song. 

500
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,647
 I'm going to play with you forever, Mom. 

501
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:32,727
 Even when you become an old grandma, I'll play with you every single day! 

502
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:35,107
 So you have to play with me too, okay? 

503
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:40,327
 That small mouth with sweet chatters, pretty hands... 

504
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:43,037
 No, no, no! 

505
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:46,627
 Oh, no! 

506
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:57,207
 If, by chance, I'm able to travel back in time, 

507
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,637
 I would... 

508
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:04,437
 definitely return to those days and hold them one more time. 

509
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:07,837
 Your small and pretty hands. 

510
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:13,227
 Yoon Young, I didn't forget. 

511
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:16,037
 If only I could, 

512
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:21,807
 I want to play with you forever until I'm an old grandma. 

513
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:25,177
 WIth love, Mom. 

514
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:59,117
   

515
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:09,347
   

516
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:22,117
"Book?"

517
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,097
"Danger..."

518
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,427
Yoon Young.

519
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:05,707
Why didn't you answer Mom's calls?

520
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:09,657
Her last three calls were to you.

521
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:13,617
You just ignored her again, didn't you?

522
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:17,677
Let's go. Let's not stand here.

523
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:20,017
Let's go to your mom.

524
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,557
Where is Mom?

525
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:27,457
How are you going to Mom?

526
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:31,137
- Yoon Young. 
 - Dad,

527
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:36,127
do you know why I worked hard to live on my own?

528
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:41,817
I hated seeing you and Mom together.

529
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:44,747
That's why.

530
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:47,147
You fight whenever you're together.

531
00:44:47,147 --> 00:44:49,787
When you fight, you leave the house.

532
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:53,917
Then Mom waits.

533
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:58,387
I was so sick and tired of seeing that every day. That's why I ran away.

534
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:03,307
Even though I knew Mom would be alone in the end.

535
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:07,107
But Mom still said she missed me.

536
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:13,197
She said if she could go back in time,

537
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:17,597
she said she still wanted to see me like a fool.

538
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:26,677
I...

539
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,827
I want to turn back time, Dad.

540
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:37,307
If I could go back to the past,

541
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,457
I would go far back.

542
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:44,117
So that I could make Mom

543
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,317
not love...

544
00:45:48,197 --> 00:45:50,857
you or me.

545
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:55,227
Not being fooled by a person who makes her lonely...

546
00:45:56,227 --> 00:45:58,797
or tricked into having a family.

547
00:45:59,617 --> 00:46:01,927
I want her to be happy by herself.

548
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:06,157
So that she will live a long life.

549
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,627
I will make her live.

550
00:46:12,157 --> 00:46:14,697
But I can't do that.

551
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:21,277
There's no way to do that!

552

553

♫  I also act like that to you  ♫

555
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:35,287
 I'll buy you something nicer. Let's go to the department store! 

556
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:38,287
 Expensive doesn't mean nicer. 

557
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:40,857
 This is perfect for me. I like it! 

558
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,457
 The color looks good on you. 

559
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:46,997
 My daughter is buying me this with her first paycheck from her part-time job! 

560
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,977
 With these little hands. 

561
00:47:48,977 --> 00:47:52,707
 Gosh, I don't want her to waste her money, but she insists! 

562
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:54,437
 They're not little. Come on! 

563
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:57,087
 My daughter goes to that college over there. 

564
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:59,137
 She said she'd give me a tour. 

565
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:03,027
 Thanks to my daughter, I got to go inside a college. 

566
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:05,637
 - You must be so happy. 
 - Yes! 

567
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:13,697

We spent the whole night studying at your place. Got it?

650
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:39,531
I don't really want to lie, though...

651
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:41,291
Hey!

652
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:45,481
Do we really have to take her?

653
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,441
Of course!

654
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,021
She has to be an accomplice to stick to the story.

655
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,631
She told the truth and said she wasn't with me last time.

656
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:55,521
My mom almost beat me to death.

657
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:06,181
How can I die before I marry my Hee Seop!

658
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:12,061
Okay.

659
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:16,591
But are we taking her like that?

660
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:19,681
Of course not. We would all get rejected at the entrance.

661
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,591
Oh, my gosh! This...

662
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:24,361
What do we do with this?

663
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,971
What do we do?

664
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:36,821
Wait a minute, so you're saying it's 1987?

665
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:38,901
If you're very sick, go to the hospital, Noona.

666
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:41,841
Don't disrupt me at work here.

667
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,931
Are you kidding me?

668
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:45,861
You can only push me so far.

669
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:48,911
I told you I'm in no mood to joke around.

670
00:59:49,831 --> 00:59:53,741
Is this a movie set or something? What's the exact location?

671
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:56,981
So, this is Woojeong Village.

672
00:59:56,981 --> 01:00:01,261
I-I don't know what you mean by a "set."

673
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,051
That's fine.

674
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:07,461
I can look it up myself.

675
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:14,351
W-What is that?

676
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:21,441
   

677
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:23,721
Does the internet not work here?

678
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:31,831
The internet doesn't work here?

679
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,751
Oh, what?

680
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,100
- There's no connection? 
 - Punch what? 
  (Sounds like "getting beat up") 

681
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:42,631
What kind of town is this?

682
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:48,821
Bye, Noona! Don't come back here!

683
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:51,740
Wow, I dodged a bullet.

684
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,450
   

685
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:57,941
- This way, right? 
 - Right.

686
01:00:57,941 --> 01:00:59,831
Let's go!

687
01:01:02,401 --> 01:01:04,651
This way.

688
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:08,991
Geez!

689
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:12,181
Look where you're going!

690
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:14,371
Yes, I'm sorry.

691
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:29,690
   

692
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,891
♫  Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, the frogs are singing  ♫

693
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:53,381
♫  Son, wife, and grandson, everyone is together  ♫

694
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:56,951
♫  No one is listening when they sing through the night  ♫

695
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:11,131
Mom.

696
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:18,571
Mom.

697
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:52,491
Well... I'm sorry. I'll explain everything.

698
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:56,471
Excuse me?

699
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,681
You must be in shock already, but

700
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:02,721
the situation is worse than you think.

701
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:06,531
We just...

702
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:10,601
arrived in 1987 and...

703
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:13,281
there's no way...

704
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:15,071
to return.

705
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,851
We are trapped here.

706
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:26,991
Really?

707
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:29,281
Yes.

708
01:03:31,648 --> 01:03:35,991
Don't be too scared. I'll somehow...

709
01:03:35,991 --> 01:03:37,914
Then...

710
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,964
Really?

711
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,991
Well...

712
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,911
You're laughing?

713
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:29,630
team credits

714
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,921
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

715
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,711
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

716
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:42,251
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

717
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:47,831
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

718
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:52,941
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

719
01:04:52,941 --> 01:04:54,981
   

720
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:57,131
 Is this really true? 

721
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:59,411
 Mom is alive right now? 

722
01:04:59,411 --> 01:05:01,161
 - Mom. 
 - Gosh! What are you doing? 

723
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,161
 Are you going to hit me? 

724
01:05:03,161 --> 01:05:05,841
 Mom, why are you being like that? Why would I hit you? 

725
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:08,761
 Starting right now, we're cracking down on minors! 

726
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:11,071
 What are you girls doing here? Come out right now! 

727
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:13,461
 - She's not a student at our school. 
 - Yeah, you! 

728
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:15,031
 Don't pretend like you don't know! 

729
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:17,701
 Are you here on vacation? Why did you go into a club? 

730
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:20,691
 Suddenly, he just looked at me here and then... 

731
01:05:20,691 --> 01:05:21,974
 By the way, what's your name? 

732
01:05:21,974 --> 01:05:24,474
 I'm Baek Hee Seop. 

733
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:30,131
   

734
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:38,391
Where are you coming from at this late hour?

735
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:41,391
Woojeong Village.

736
01:05:42,391 --> 01:05:44,421
Woojeong Village?

737
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:49,271
Did you say Woojeong Village was your hometown?

738
01:05:50,248 --> 01:05:52,381
Why did you go there all of a sudden?

739
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,321
There was...

740
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:58,881
something I needed to finish off.
