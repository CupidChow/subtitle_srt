1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,760

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,320

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,820

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,930
You're asking who I am?

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,260
Who do you think I am?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,180

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,970

8
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,826
What does that mean?

9
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:40,526
I'm wondering who you were hoping I'd be when you came here.

10
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:46,676
If you really wanted to know who I was, you should have gone to the police.

11
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:49,306
"You found that in our house.

12
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:53,686
And there's an even stranger object in our garage.

13
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,306
He's very suspicious."

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,266
You should have asked the police to investigate.

15
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:04,856
You could have done that, but you came to me in the end.

16
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,366
Perhaps you couldn't.

17
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,956
Am I right?

18
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:18,816
- Hey! 
 - Do it quickly!

19
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,486
- Let's go! 
 - Shit!

20
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:22,226
- He's here! 
 - Where?

21
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:25,236
- Hey! 
 - Get up!

22
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,506
Man, we finally caught him!

23
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:36,296
Look here! What is going on?

24
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:40,816
What are you doing right now?

25
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,686
I found it!

26
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,496
We found them all.

27
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:02,566

28
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:06,716
But you don't think that I'm the one.

29
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:13,296
You are hoping I'm not the one.

30
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:18,686
So you can find out what you're really curious about.

31
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:25,256
That's why you came to me and not the police.

32
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:32,556
If you really need an answer, my response is no.

33
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:35,526
I can't explain everything right now, but...

34
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:39,586
I didn't do anything you're suspecting me of doing.

35
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,456
I don't believe you.

36
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,606
Oh, yeah?

37
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,586
I can't help that.

38
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,466
But...

39
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:02,376
if you keep quiet about that, you can continue to fix this car.

40
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:05,066
What's that got to do with this right now?

41
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:10,586
Because if you keep at it, you might find out

42
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,816
who I am yourself.

43
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,716
What all that might be.

44
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,686
What's wrong? Did something happen?

45
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,046
What were you two talking about?

46
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,776

47
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,986
It's my fault.

48
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,586
I should've been more careful about letting him inside the house.

49
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,996
Don't worry.

50
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:53,536
Returning it to us means he'll keep quiet for now.

51
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:58,706
Although it's probably because of the car, and not me.

52
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,886
Are you okay?

53
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,206
Do you want to go for a walk?

54
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:21,636
It's not like we have a lot of time, but still...

55
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:25,356
We probably have enough time to get some fresh air, though.

56
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,496
Meeting one's family,

57
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:13,276
especially...

58
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:18,926
meeting your family you don't know very well

59
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:21,386
is not an easy thing.

60
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:32,206
Even though you're a senior when it comes to time traveling,

61
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:36,406
I'm slightly more of a senior when it comes to dealing with family here.

62
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,286
I know it's more fearful and...

63
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:52,526
more jarring than we imagined.

64
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:57,256
Meeting your mom here was like that.

65
00:06:57,256 --> 00:07:03,946
And all sorts of things happened while you keep running into your dad.

66
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,206
Your mind is a mishmash, isn't it?

67
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:26,106
But about the matchbox, I'm glad it was your dad and not anyone else who found it.

68
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:32,346
I don't think he let it go simply because of the car.

69
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,176
I feel like, although he couldn't explain it in words,

70
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:43,446
there was definitely a part of him that wanted to trust you.

71
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:46,146
Perhaps...

72
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:49,136
Principal Yoon really favors you, too.

73
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,936
He must've been swayed by something.

74
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:58,586
"I sense my grandson's aura from this stranger" or something like that?

75
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,896
I understand you're trying to console me, but...

76
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:07,956
- you keep getting things wrong. 
 - Huh?

77
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:10,896
"I sense my grandson's aura."

78
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:16,186
If he felt that way, he would have despised me by now.

79
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,216
Although he was the only family I lived with,

80
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:28,556
he treated me like he hardly saw me. He treated me like I didn't exist.

81
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,136
How come?

82
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:37,646
Who knows? What could he have hated so much about me?

83
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:44,766
But why was he the only family? Didn't you live with your dad?

84
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:52,596
I don't know if he was in shock after my mom left, but he returned to America.

85
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:58,236
He continued to study and became a professor there.

86
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,806
He lived there his entire life.

87
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:06,076
He came to see me during breaks. So maybe I saw him twice a year?

88
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:12,246
Even then, he said he had to do some research and returned after a short while.

89
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:21,266
He was a kind person, but he wouldn't just want to trust someone.

90
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:24,336
I don't think he'd thought of me so affectionately.

91
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:31,856
Was that TMI?

92
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,386
You must've been lonely.

93
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,846
All those times spent believing

94
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:54,156
that no one loves you.

95
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,486
But you know what?

96
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:15,796
I do think of you affectionately.

97
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:25,766
I believe I think of you that way.

98
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,036
In that dream I had...

99
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:51,726
we returned to the future after fixing the time machine.

100
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:16,216
Everything was exactly as I had imagined it would be.

101
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,826
 "Single Soul"?

102
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:21,256
 - It's easy. 
 - Your eye sight is pretty good!

103
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:23,566
Everything was great.

104
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,086
But then,

105
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,696
you weren't there.

106
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,336
I looked all over, but you weren't there.

107
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:38,056
You, as a person, did not exist...

108
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,936
at all in that world.

109
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,716
You disappeared even without a trace.

110
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:50,486
So I keep getting lost searching for you, and that's how I wake up.

111
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,506
That's the nightmare I have these days.

112
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,976
Even though I know it's a silly dream,

113
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:02,956
it terrified me to share something so scary...

114
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,796
and sad out loud.

115
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,676
A future without you.

116
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:20,926
What I want is a future with you in it.

117
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:26,026
I will take you to the eateries I know.

118
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,926
Walk along new paths together.

119
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:38,136
Talking about silly things... not scary but everyday things...

120
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,856
I think that's what I'd like to do with you.

121
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:51,296
♫  The way you mean something to me  ♫

122
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:55,186
Would this be a wrong consolation, too?

123
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:58,876
♫  Am I someone who means something to you, too?  ♫

124
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:04,656
♫  No matter what anyone else says, without care  ♫

125
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,286
Do I...

126
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:11,416
need to think of it just as consolation?

127
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:20,276
♫  During night while dawn enters  ♫

128
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:21,406
No.

129
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:27,536
♫  I think of your face  ♫

130
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:35,686
♫  I remember your clear smile  ♫

131
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:40,176
I thought only I dreamed of a future like that.

132
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,956
So I was going to ignore it until the end.

133
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,046
♫  One day, by your side  ♫

134
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:55,066
♫  If a long, long night falls on you  ♫

135
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:04,336
♫  Without saying a word, I'll sit close to you  ♫

136
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:09,516
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

137
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,620
♫  When everything seems far away  ♫

138
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,746
I know we don't have much time, but...

139
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:24,026
let's just think that time stopped for a short while.

140
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:32,946
♫  Holding the hand reaching out to me  ♫

141
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:39,116
♫  I'm sure it was my love  ♫

142
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:48,146
♫  Let us walk this path together  ♫

143
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:52,486
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫

144
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,016
 Why aren't they here yet?

145
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:56,896
 This is so exhausting.

146
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,266
They're coming! Coming!

147
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,200
 - There! There! 
 - Here they are!

148
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,430

149
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,626
- Come on! 
 - Get out!

150
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:13,666
- Hey, let's go! 
 - Here we go.

151
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,486
 Don't push!

152
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,056
Is he really the culprit?

153
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:19,946
You also found the matchbox and red yarn from the crime scene?

154
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,646
Why are you jumping the gun? He's just a suspect.

155
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:25,026
I heard he's pretty much the one. Right?

156
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,736
Since you arrested him personally.

157
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,456
Well, that's true, but...

158
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,976
Just wait.

159
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:33,886
Stop writing articles shitting on our chief.

160
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:37,716
Oh, of course! He must be promoted as planned!

161
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:40,046
Taking advantage of this crisis. Right?

162
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,846
- All right, all right! 
 - Move out of the way!

163
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,296
 - One step back! 
 - Don't push!

164
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,266
Yes, yes. That's right.

165
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,496
Yes, it seems they're here now.

166
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:56,146
- Sit, sit! 
 - Yes, I'll wrap it up ASAP.

167
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,556
Min Soo, so you're the culprit?

168
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,596
You punk.

169
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,006
Yes.

170
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,576
- Yes. 
 - Gosh...

171
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,806
How much did he drink that he's so out of it and fessing up so easily? 
  (Easily sounds like "alcohol" in Korean)

172
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,166
He's so out of it and responding like this?

173
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,756
Chief, it's because he's drunk that everything's coming out!

174
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,156
Mi Sook...

175
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:29,496
My little sister. Where is Mi Sook?

176
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:35,416
Hey, let him sleep for now.

177
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,206
When he comes to his senses, get his confession, and wrap it up ASAP.

178
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,516
- Yes! 
 - Hey!

179
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,976
Wake up, you punk!

180
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,306
Man, we can go home now.

181
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,746
Geez!

182
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,386
Chief!

183
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,376
I have something to say.

184
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,456
We found the matchbox, but the note wasn't there!

185
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:58,586
He must have ripped a piece of paper and written it right there.

186
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,466
The important point is that the matchbox was there. Right?

187
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,346
The fact that he prepared them ahead of time.

188
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:09,466
I saw this notebook in Go Min Soo's room.

189
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,446
- His handwriting is totally different! 
 - Are you the one analyzing?

190
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:14,856
Besides, would you have written it like you normally do if it were you?

191
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:17,536
He probably scribbled on purpose.

192
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,526
We need to investigate this more thoroughly!

193
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,336
Hey, Baek Dong Shik!

194
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:25,166
We have a girl who saw him in person! What's there to think about?

195
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,876
And other than you, what idiot would turn in their own family?

196
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,866
Testimony from a credible witness and even evidence.

197
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,376
This case is closed!

198
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,856
I used to think you were such a hot shot.

199
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:43,926
But you've been going nowhere ever since I passed you up.

200
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,576
Well!

201
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,416
I won't disappear.

202
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:12,486
Let's catch the culprit, save your mom and future me,

203
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,446
and return together.

204
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:24,576
And play with me for a long time.

205
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,476
Grandpa!

206
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:35,506
- Gosh. I wasn't sure since it was dark. 
 - Hello.

207
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,206
"Grandpa"?

208
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,556
Are you talking to me?

209
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,546
There was a phone call from grandpa?

210
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:49,716
Oh, we should go inside and call him back.

211
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:52,496
We're going to head inside now.

212
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,196
Wait!

213
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,466
So...

214
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,626
Mr. Yoon...

215
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,956
Our Soon Ae...

216
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:09,796
became a novelist.

217
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:12,436
That's a big deal, right?

218
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:14,746
Oh, my gosh! Of course!

219
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,896
It's a huge deal!

220
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:18,726
Yes.

221
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:21,196
It's good news.

222
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:24,496
But I don't have anywhere to boast about it.

223
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,036
I'm afraid people will judge me.

224
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:30,116
For smiling about this when we lost our first child.

225
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:33,486
But you should still celebrate the things that deserve to be celebrated.

226
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,046
Congratulations!

227
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:38,026
You must be so proud.

228
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,386
Thank you.

229
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:45,956
I'm thinking maybe I should let my second child continue to study what she wants.

230
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,516
Yes!

231
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:51,046
Definitely!

232
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,456
We'll go inside now.

233
00:19:57,456 --> 00:20:00,456
Yes. Get some rest.

234
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,396
Gosh...

235
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:16,386

236
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,196

237
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,196
Go Min Soo...

238
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,306
He might have been arrested by now.

239
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:47,206
If he's already arrested, it would be difficult to get him out right away.

240
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:53,396
Since the police won't give him up so easily.

241
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:58,006
Especially when the eyewitness is a family member.

242
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,706
Who would be suspicious of that?

243
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:08,236
For them to release him, we will need clear evidence of the real culprit.

244
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:15,706
 Go Min Soo was badly hurt merely hours before the incident.

245
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:18,946
 But he totally disappeared exactly after that moment

246
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,516
 until he was arrested after healing completely.

247
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:27,696
 Go Mi Sook couldn't have planned all that by herself.

248
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:40,116
 If that was all part of Go Mi Sook's plan,

249
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:43,616
then that means she took care of all that

250
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:47,976
even keeping injured Go Min Soo hidden from everyone

251
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:50,676
immediately following the murder incident?

252
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:56,036
It was probably a very busy night for Go Mi Sook.

253
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:59,156
Wouldn't it be good if

254
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:04,046
a real eyewitness came forward instead of the fake one?

255
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,566
Kim Hae Kyeong.

256
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,826
She must be very frightened.

257
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:16,146
If Go Mi Sook's novel is true, then she must have seen something.

258
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,236
But we don't know how things will change now.

259
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,926
I wasn't sure all this time, but now

260
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,726
we really saw Go Min Soo get arrested.

261
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:34,116

262
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:41,006
I saw her by the river that time.

263
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,896
Her hands were tied with red yarn.

264
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,356
They're saying it was found in Mi Sook's brother's room!

265
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,546
I read in the papers that there's even an eyewitness!

266
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,236
While he was killing them!

267
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:55,326
Oh, my gosh! I feel sorry for Mi Sook, too!

268
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:58,696
She said it was horrific and was scared, too!

269
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:00,686
And that was all her brother's doing!

270
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:05,306
Hey, we should actually feel sorry for Lee Soon Ae. Not Go Mi Sook.

271
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:10,846
She stole Soon Ae's novel and her brother even killed her sister.

272
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:15,316
But still, I feel bad for Mi Sook.

273
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:18,066
That poor thing...

274
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,136
Oh, my gosh! Seriously!

275
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:38,076
I didn't even say anything. I just came for some fresh air.

276
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,726
You come and sit in my mom's restaurant every day.

277
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:44,366
I clearly told you I don't know anything!

278
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:46,556
What have you heard that you keep following...

279
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:49,136
All right, all right. I won't ask you anything.

280
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,726
I'm not trying to bother you.

281
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:55,876
Well, if you're too scared to go to the police, you can come to me.

282
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:58,016
No matter what it may be...

283
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,386
Don't talk to me.

284
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,506
I said we're not friends anymore.

285
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:40,796
You're dating Lee Soon Ae, huh?

286
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:44,366
- Shit... 
 - No, no.

287
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:47,366
It's not because I have any complaints.

288
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,796
Could you just give this to her?

289
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,476
This belongs to Lee Soon Ae.

290
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:03,546
I wanted to give it to her myself, so I got it from our homeroom teacher.

291
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:11,836
But... I don't think she'd want to see me.

292
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:21,330
I think I've become such a terrible person.

293
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:43,566
You can live differently from this point onward.

294
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:50,406
If you don't want to become a terrible person, think of it as your last chance.

295
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,366
Chance?

296
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,866
I said you don't have to walk me there.

297
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:50,906
Why skip school for this?

298
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:56,276
The doctor told me to practice walking a lot when I got discharged.

299
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:59,936
It's boring going home alone. So, it worked out.

300
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:02,036
You're going home, right?

301
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,766
Yeah.

302
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:19,406
Then let's take a walk around the neighborhood on our way!

303
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,066
Did Lee Soon Ae leave early?

304
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:43,306
Yeah.

305
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:45,756
Did she say it's that hard for her?

306
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,966
Well, her sister died.

307
00:27:49,786 --> 00:27:52,606
For the remaining family members,

308
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:56,206
their biggest hope would be to

309
00:27:56,206 --> 00:28:01,226
catch the real culprit and make him pay for his crime. Right?

310
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:04,166
- But that already happened, so why... 
 - Hey!

311
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,496
They must still feel disturbed.

312
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:10,176
Try to be a little more thoughtful.

313
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,726
 Shall we go around one more time?

314
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:12,796
Since we're skipping anyway, shall we have some fun?

315
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:15,246
How about the roller skating rink?

316
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:17,396
No, thanks.

317
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:22,956
Oh! Then should we go to the arcade?

318
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,086
Do you know the whack-a-mole game?

319
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:28,006
The mole looks super cute that it hurts a little to hit him.

320
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:31,086
But you'll feel better after whacking him a bit!

321
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:33,886
No, it's okay.

322
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:44,416
Then... do you want me to hug you?

323
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,376
That wench!

324
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:50,066
I just want to go home today.

325
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:54,026
My mom is by herself.

326
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,286
I'll go home now.

327
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,540

328
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:10,736
After hearing the news this morning that Go Min Soo was arrested,

329
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:16,026
my mom just did the dishes without a word.

330
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:21,366
She brought out all the dishes and kept washing them until I left.

331
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:31,586
She's probably doing a mountain of laundry by now, too.

332
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:36,396
And cleaning all our rooms, from Oh Bok's to mine.

333
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:39,176
She does that when she's having a hard time.

334
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,376
Whenever I think of my mom,

335
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,616
I become anxious and scared.

336
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,086
All right, hug me once.

337
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:15,596
Mom!

338
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,126
Mom?

339
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:22,126
Mom!

340
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:36,306
I'm feeling hungry now after my long nap.

341
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:38,286
Shall I make tteokbokki? Your favorite?

342
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:40,006
Oh, yeah!

343
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,066
The publisher sent you something.

344
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,736
A rough copy or something?

345
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:49,336
They said it's your book, so I just peeked out of curiosity.

346
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:01,206

347
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:06,336
Your sister would have liked it!

348
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,646
 Dad.

349
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:34,786
 Yes?

350
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,766
 That Mr. Yoon...

351
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:39,536
 Yes. What about Mr. Yoon?

352
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:43,196
 I heard he's not from our town.

353
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:46,606
 What kind of person is he?

354
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,156
 Well...

355
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,626
 He's an odd one.

356
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,786
 What's odd?

357
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:03,756
 So, I mean... he saves people.

358
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:05,566
 What?

359
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,226
 So, even on the first day I met him,

360
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:13,476
 there was an incident with our students sniffing glue.

361
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,926
 And a student almost fell off the cliff.

362
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:18,206
 Oh, man. She almost died.

363
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,566
 But all of a sudden, he jumped forward and saved her.

364
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,266
 Whoa, he was so admirable!

365
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:28,676
 Then another time, we had a fire in our town.

366
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:32,176
 Oh, my goodness! My heart was pounding at the time.

367
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,646
 Oh, yeah! You know Mr. Dong Shik, right? His kids were in that house!

368
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:40,746
 But once more, Mr. Yoon saved them!

369
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:44,326
 Whoa, they say he was so cool!

370
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,786
 That's not it.

371
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:52,386
 He appears out of nowhere and saves people, and then disappears.

372
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:59,146
 If you think about it, saving someone in your lifetime is not an easy feat.

373
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:04,516
 Those opportunities don't often come our way in the first place. Don't you think so?

374
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:08,076
 So are you saying he's odd or cool?

375
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:17,236
 I'm saying he's oddly... cool.

376
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:21,366
Who is he, exactly?

377
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:33,556
I don't think we're getting through to Kim Hae Kyeong.

378
00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:38,426
We can't force her to tell us, so we have to find another way.

379
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,386
Excuse me.

380
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:46,406
Mr. Yoon.

381
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:49,786
Yes. Right.

382
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:20,586
I really didn't want to tell you.

383
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:23,046
I know.

384
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:30,566
Because she asked me to keep it a secret.

385
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:35,296
I want to protect her.

386
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,116
You do?

387
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:44,236
But I don't know what's right.

388
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,536
It's me.

389
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:59,056
I'm the one...

390
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:03,936
who took Go Mi Sook to Go Min Soo that night.

391
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:12,166
 Is anyone there? Anyone?

392
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:15,446
 There's someone here!

393
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:18,386
 Please help me!

394
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,606
 Please!

395
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:27,496
 Oh, M-M-Mi Sook's friend!

396
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:30,366
 Please call her! Please!

397
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:33,726
 Tell her! Her older brother is hurt!

398
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,356
 That he can't even walk!

399
00:36:36,356 --> 00:36:39,566
 Tell Mi Sook to come and help me!

400
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:41,456
 Please!

401
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,646
 Crazy bastard.

402
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:46,076
 I should really kill him.

403
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,886
 J-Just don't come out.

404
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:51,546
 I called just in case, but

405
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,646
 I'll just tell him that I didn't tell you.

406
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:57,326
 - If you tell him you didn't know... 
  - Forget it.

407
00:36:57,326 --> 00:36:59,566
 I'll go, so just wait.

408
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:14,276
 If she finds out later, Mom will blame me.

409
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:22,246
 I'm so sick of cleaning up after that bastard.

410
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:25,106
 Should I beat up that bastard for you?

411
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:32,336
 - What? 
 - He can't even get up right now.

412
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:36,286
 Should I go and beat the shit out of him right now?

413
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:03,136
 Be quiet.

414
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:06,726
 Don't even breathe.

415
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:27,166
 No, we have to report it.

416
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,046
 Mi Sook, we have to report it!

417
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:33,366
 I told you we can't.

418
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,826
 This is a huge opportunity.

419
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:41,616
 Get a hold of yourself!

420
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:45,676
 This is not right. A person died!

421
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:48,067
 They're already dead anyway.

422
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:52,127
 If we report it, will they come back to life?

423
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,476
 But still...

424
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,486
 They still have to catch the culprit.

425
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:59,406
 Who?

426
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:03,236
 You saw their face?

427
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,106
 You didn't see them, though.

428
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,526
 Did you see them?

429
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,626
 You saw who it was?

430
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:52,216
 Mi Sook...

431
00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:00,566
 Look at me.

432
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:04,076
 This is what my brother...

433
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:08,366
 that piece of trash Go Min Soo did to me.

434
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:15,841
 He chose areas like these where people can't see or suspect anything.

435
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:22,336
 Hae Kyeong, I'm so afraid that anyone will see my body.

436
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:31,386
 I'm so afraid people will find out...

437
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:39,936
 how pathetic my family is and how insignificant I am to them.

438
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,896
 Hae Kyeong.

439
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:50,166
 Please help me.

440
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:54,506
 We can end Go Min Soo this way.

441
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:57,666
 I'm confident I can. Okay?

442
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:00,736
 You saw it, too. Right?

443
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:04,376
 But the real culprit could be caught, too.

444
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:07,286
 Then what will you do then?

445
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,436
 That punk won't get caught.

446
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:22,966
 Hae Kyeong, he won't get caught.

447
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:50,456

448
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,376
What did Kim Hae Kyeong say?

449
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,506
What's wrong?

450
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:33,556
It wasn't Go Mi Sook.

451
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:39,476
Go Mi Sook was not the culprit. She was a witness.

452
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,936
She was a real witness.

453
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:46,136
She only wrote in her novel what she saw.

454
00:42:47,326 --> 00:42:53,736
The culprit is a man, and the only person who knows his face is Go Mi Sook.

455
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,496
Yes.

456
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:19,326
 Mr. Yoon.

457
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,116
Yoo Beom Ryong?

458
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,896
What's going on?

459
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:30,106
Mr. Yoon.

460
00:43:34,706 --> 00:43:37,616
Mr. Yoon, I'm so scared.

461
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:42,096
Say it clearly. What are you talking about?

462
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:45,846
 Soon Ae...

463
00:43:45,846 --> 00:43:47,866
 Lee Soon Ae is...

464
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:50,396
Go on.

465
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,236
Tell me, quickly!

466
00:43:57,316 --> 00:44:01,176
 I think something happened to Soon Ae.

467
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:04,036
What did you see?

468
00:44:04,036 --> 00:44:08,046
When, where, and what did you see that you're saying that?

469
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:14,756
I left school early and went up to the mountain behind the village.

470
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:19,146
To give the student teacher's ring to the principal.

471
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,216
 No, no! That's not it!

472
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:41,536
 I heard the student teacher's grave is up there, so I'm on my way there.

473
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:45,236
 I'll go now. Sorry.

474
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:52,316
 Really. I really just passed by like that. But then...

475
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,666
 Soon Ae!

476
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:10,416
 Soon Ae!

477
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:14,026
 I couldn't find her anywhere!

478
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:16,366
 Soon Ae!

479
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:20,806
I called Soon Ae's house, and they said she was not home yet.

480
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:26,076
I called the police, too, but...

481
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:33,216
they said they caught the culprit, so nothing should happen.

482
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:35,866
 They said she probably just went out.

483
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:40,876
But, Mr. Yoon,

484
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:42,916
I think...

485
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:46,086
Don't say any nonsense, and just stay right there.

486
00:45:46,086 --> 00:45:48,066
I'll be there.

487
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:03,746
Your mom disappeared.

488
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:10,116
She was last seen on the mountain behind the village where they scattered Lee Kyeong Ae's ashes.

489
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,726
You have to let the police know.

490
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:21,436
Finding Baek Hee Seop and going to Detective Baek Dong Shik will be faster.

491
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,576
Do you think you can do that?

492
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,876
It's probably nothing serious.

493
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:22,467

494
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:39,308
Baek Hee Seop!

495
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:47,598
- What are you doing here? 
 - Soon Ae.

496
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:52,628
Soon Ae! Soon Ae is...

497
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:39,238
 Soon Ae!

498
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:44,438
 Soon Ae!

499
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:54,628
Hee Seop, what are you doing here...

500
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:56,148
Uncle, please help us.

501
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:59,038
We think something happened to Soon Ae.

502
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:02,198
 Soon Ae!

503
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:06,428
 Are you here by any chance?

504
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:20,848
Soon Ae!

505
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:26,398
Are you all right?

506
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:29,298
Let's get out!

507
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:30,478
Let's run away!

508
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:32,838
Hurry, and get out!

509
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:41,358
Lee Soon Ae, get up!

510
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:49,478
Soon Ae, it's your teacher.

511
00:51:49,478 --> 00:51:51,278
Mr. Yoon!

512
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,918
I'm being chased by the culprit!

513
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:09,098
Soon Ae, do you think you can wait here?

514
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:15,298
Yes.

515
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:01,420
Soon Ae!

516
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,960
Soon Ae!  Soon Ae...

517
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,408
Oh, my gosh. Soon Ae.

518
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:11,818
It's okay. It's okay.

519
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:16,328
But Go Min Soo is the culprit! What's going on?

520
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:19,288
Soon Ae, are you all right?

521
00:53:22,148 --> 00:53:23,868
Hey, you, listen to me!

522
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,808
Take the kids to the hospital first. Quickly!

523
00:53:25,808 --> 00:53:27,318
Everyone.

524
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:29,078
Let's go.

525
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:31,298
 One, two, three.

526
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:33,578
I'll carry her.

527
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:07,820

528
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:28,020

529
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:35,090

530
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:08,258
Yoo Beom Ryong.

531
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:12,438
Beom Ryong!

532
00:55:12,438 --> 00:55:14,238
Beom Ryong, wake up! Beom Ryong!

533
00:55:14,238 --> 00:55:16,988
Wake up! Yoo Beom Ryong!

534
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:12,188
 But, Mr. Yoon,

535
00:56:12,888 --> 00:56:14,888
 I think...

536
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:20,628
 I want to find her no matter what.

537
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,538
 Please help me.

538
00:56:23,538 --> 00:56:26,718
 Earlier on the mountain,

539
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:30,378
 I saw how Soon Ae looked at me.

540
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:33,788
 Her eyes were full of fear.

541
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:41,378
 It makes me feel like I've become a terrible person.

542
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:48,148
 Mr. Yoon,

543
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:55,658
 perhaps, this might be an opportunity for me. Right?

544
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,738
Freeze! Raise your hands!

545
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:48,398
Raise your hands and come down, you bastard!

546
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:39,520

547
00:58:44,618 --> 00:58:46,688
You bastard...

548
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:14,910

549
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:28,768
♫  The footsteps that slowed down before we knew it  ♫

550
01:00:28,768 --> 01:00:30,598

551
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:32,728
 - Who's the culprit? 
 - Why are you asking me that?

552
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:34,018
 Another person died.

553
01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:37,858
 A boy in the same school and grade as you. A perfectly healthy boy died at the abandoned house.

554
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:40,128
 If he didn't, Lee Soon Ae would've died.

555
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:41,318
 Come out.

556
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:44,448
 Your identification, resume, and teacher certification were all forged!

557
01:00:44,448 --> 01:00:47,368
 I searched all your prior jobs and addresses you jotted down.

558
01:00:47,368 --> 01:00:50,810
 But there wasn't even a record of you ever being born.
