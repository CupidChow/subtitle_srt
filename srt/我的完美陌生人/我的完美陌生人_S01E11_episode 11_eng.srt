1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,520

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,490

3
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,044
Oh, no! My corn!

4
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:19,864
- What do I do? 
 - Mr. Yoon.

5
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,634
- The corn is not the problem right now! 
 - Are you all right?

6
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:23,844
Your poor delicate body...

7
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,964
Are you hurt anywhere?

8
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,774
- Shit, this guy... 
 - Hey!

9
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:34,814
What are you looking at?

10
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:37,964
- What? 
 - You should apologize when you bump someone.

11
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:41,474
Why are you giving attitude to the innocent bystander? Why?

12
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,824
Can't you see he got wet?

13
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,644
So why was he blocking the pathway?

14
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,824
The old guy couldn't even move aside for a lady!

15
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:49,184
You don't even know him, and you're calling him "old guy"!

16
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:50,704
Apologize and go, man!

17
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:53,254
Who are you to raise your voice at me, bitch?

18
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,654
Why the hell are you getting involved? Who are you?

19
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,904
- I should just... 
 - Hyung!

20
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:00,334
What's going on?

21
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,364
Is this Yeon Woo?

22
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,494
Hey, man!

23
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:07,364
I thought you were in America! When did you return?

24
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:08,954
Sang Sook, introduce yourself to him.

25
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:11,844
- His father is our building landlord, and— 
 - Hyung.

26
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:13,274
Before that, apologize first.

27
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,874
What?

28
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,284
You yelled and called her a bitch.

29
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,713
To my girlfriend.

30
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,213
What?

31
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:23,804
Oh...

32
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:26,084
I see.

33
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:28,334
And he's a close hyung to me, too.

34
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:31,794
His clothes really got wet.

35
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,514
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:38,024
Ah, yes.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm sorry. Sorry.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,394
Mr. Yoon.

39
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,134
I'll get going then.

40
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,874
Oh, all right.

41
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,394
That's right.

42
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:51,274
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, I've been good.

43
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:53,794
What have you been up to?

44
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:56,924
Just doing this and that.

45
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:01,134
 Your mom left town the night she gave birth to you.

46
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:05,044
 Even when your cheeks turned red from crying,

47
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:07,904
 she left without even holding you once.

48
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,804
 She thought you were a stain on her life.

49
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:15,774
 So, don't be curious or wonder about her from now on.

50
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:31,744

51
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,184
It was really strange.

52
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:39,604
He just stood there, staring at me.

53
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,131
At first, I wondered what that was about.

54
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,281
Then suddenly, I felt a little sad.

55
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:54,534
My chest tightened... and started throbbing...

56
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:58,364
Are you saying you fell for another man?

57
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:02,124
I'm being serious right now.

58
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,261
I guess he has that effect on people.

59
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,521
I felt a little weird, too, when I first saw him.

60
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,951
I mean, should I say even before I met him?

61
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:19,821
My dad had told me he wanted to introduce me to someone.

62
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,721
He said his name was Hae Joon.

63
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:26,591
His name is Hae Joon?

64
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:32,141
Do you remember? The letter you wrote when I was in America...

65
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,261
When we get married and have a baby...

66
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,601
We would name him Hae Joon.

67
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,771
Oh, is that why?

68
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,961
I feel close to him.

69
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:48,111
But he's strange.

70
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,401
 No wonder. I didn't like her from the beginning.

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,480

72
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,871
 Did you eat?

73
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,811
 Do you know me?

74
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,431
 I could get to know you starting now.

75
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,281
 Since it's your first time, I'll give you ssanghwa-tang. 
 (Traditional Korean medical tea)

76
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,561
 I make the best.

77
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:58,051
 My gosh, are you crazy?

78
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,041
 Why are you breaking the egg? Don't you know how to drink that?

79
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,951
 What do you care how I drink it...

80
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,671
 Wait. I'll make you another one.

81
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,161
 No, it's okay. That's okay!

82
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:13,491
 I can't tolerate people not eating it right...

83
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,461
 Here. This is how you're supposed to eat it.

84
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,731
 - Open your mouth. 
 - No, no, no. I'll eat it myself.

85
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:20,511
 Gosh, it's fine. I'm holding it for you already so eat comfortably.

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,651
 - I don't feel comfortable. That's why! 
 - Come on, eat... whoa!

87
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,471
 Well... there...

88
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:45,671
 I think I'll be coming to this cafe often in the future.

89
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,581
 Oh, really?

90
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,291
 So...

91
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:58,331
 I hope there won't be any unnecessary talking, touching, or meddling from now on.

92
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:00,221
 I don't need menu recommendations, either.

93
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:03,201
 Be as indifferent as possible. Like a stranger.

94
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,951
 Well, we are strangers anyway.

95
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,361
 I got it. I'll try my best.

96
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,090
 Okay...

97
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,200

98
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,360

99
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:25,111
She does whatever she wants like that.

100
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:28,771
That's why she left her child, too.

101
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,671
She's a stranger to me anyway. Just a stranger.

102
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:54,881
 After that night, time went by fast.

103
00:06:54,881 --> 00:07:00,301
 But surprisingly, everything remained the same in the town.

104
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:08,751
How the heck are you handling this case?

105
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:14,101
Two weeks passed, and there were no suspects, let alone the culprit.

106
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,350
Does that even make sense?

107
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,831
Huh?

108
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:23,811
"The Incompetent and Irresponsible Woojeong Police Chief..." Shit...

109
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:28,581
"Surprised by his lack of qualification ahead of the review for the promotion of Gyeonggi Province police chief."

110
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,221
Hey, Yong Gi!

111
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:35,951
Are you determined to shit on my future? Huh?

112
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,981
My apologies!

113
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:44,081
My future path is your path.

114
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,561
Get a hold of yourselves and bring me results.

115
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:53,881
Arrest a bastard and bring him to me within a week! No matter what!

116
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,731
Don't do anything stupid, either.

117
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:03,371
What are you doing? Hurry up and get out!

118
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,771
You need to investigate!

119
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:29,701

120
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:47,071
Where are you coming from?You should've woke me up. We could've gone together.

121
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,311
You had another nightmare?

122
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:54,801
What kind of nightmare is it that you have it all week?

123
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,021
Are you really not going to tell me?

124
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,931
Where did you go?

125
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,621
Baek Yoo Seop.

126
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:13,741
He was discharged from the hospital today.

127
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,141
I also wanted to talk to him while I was there.

128
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,641
So Uncle must know everything now, too.

129
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,821
Who the murdered victims were in this town.

130
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:01,691
 I know you have nothing to do with the murders.

131
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:06,951
 But the one who had the most point of contact with the victims

132
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,631
 was you. Not Baek Hee Seop.

133
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,651
 Is there anything you can tell me?

134
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:25,511
The reason Lee Joo Young returned to town was because of Baek Yoo Seop.

135
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,661
They wanted to leave together.

136
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:32,641
The reason she came to this town in the first place was also because of Baek Yoo Seop.

137
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:37,431
It seems their relationship was more than just senior and junior.

138
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,161
Then, why didn't they leave?

139
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:45,811
Because the anniversary of his parents' passing was a few days later.

140
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,711
If they avoid the police and leave, they didn't know when they could return.

141
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:54,531
So he wanted to spend at least that day with his younger brother Baek Hee Seop.

142
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:58,941
That's why they decided to hide in this town just for a few days.

143
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:05,071
But it just so happened that the place they hid was the abandoned house.

144
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:09,011
- You mean... 
 - That's right.

145
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:13,281
The same abandoned house Lee Kyeong Ae was found.

146
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:21,821
I think they were looking for us even on the night the incident took place.

147
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,561
 Are you all right?

148
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:32,441
She must've secretly followed Baek Yoo Seop the day she disappeared.

149
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,741
 We've been here...

150
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,481
In any case, the three of them became friends, and

151
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,341
Lee Kyeong Ae kept their secret.

152
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:07,271
 After she heard about our situation, she said she wanted to help us somehow

153
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,621
 and asked if we needed anything.

154
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,111
 Maybe...

155
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:16,401
 she came by to give us that.

156
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,561
 Only if I hadn't gone to Seoul then...

157
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:22,451
 If we didn't miss each other...

158
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:27,721
 I could have protected both of them.

159
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:39,001
The biggest question for me all this time...

160
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,151
was this sentence.

161
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,561
"A woman who reads is dangerous."

162
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,021
What could this mean?

163
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:55,061
Why did the culprit write this specific sentence and leave it with all the victims?

164
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,861
Lee Joo Young did have a book with her.

165
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:10,261
But that was only Lee Joo Young.

166
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:21,541
Lee Kyeong Ae didn't have one.

167
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,201
That's what I thought, too.

168
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:28,451
But that night, the reason Lee Kyeong Ae went to the abandoned house was because

169
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:34,081
she was bringing the one item that Baek Yoo Seop and Lee Joo Young told her they needed.

170
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,661
Guess what it was?

171
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,681
So it was a book.

172
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,260

173
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:55,841
In that case, the victims really do have something in common.

174
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,131
They all had a book with them.

175
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,941
This might be a kind of warning.

176
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,961
But where did the book go?

177
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,491
How come it wasn't at the scene?

178
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,800
If the culprit cared enough to write a note like this, he might have taken the book with him.

179
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,981
Although we don't know why.

180
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:40,831
Hyung! I know we agreed on those conditions...

181
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:47,741
and I know I'm only supposed to go to the garage.

182
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:53,871
Why the heck are you breathing like that?

183
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:58,171
I think I'm going to die. Number two. A big one. Big one.

184
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:01,511
- Wait. 
 - Oh, no!

185
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,481
Yoon Young, let's move all that.

186
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,330

187
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:20,931
Where is it?

188
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,470

189
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:02,381
He's like that sometimes.

190
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:05,611
I forgot that he has a weak stomach.

191
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:08,291
We can do it like this.

192
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,951
He's here almost the whole day.

193
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:14,281
Not letting him use the bathroom would be too harsh on our hero.

194
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,271
But why do you think it was a book?

195
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,921
"A woman who reads is dangerous."

196
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,201
Of all people, I'm the one who reads and publishes those books.

197
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:34,341
Do you really think this is all a coincidence?

198
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:41,731
In the end, my mom wanted to be a writer and Go Mi Sook was one, too.

199
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:48,341
I keep thinking that maybe all this is not merely a coincidence.

200
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,161
 What are you going to do for me?

201
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,591
 What?

202
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,621
 I mean, I'm paying for your tuition.

203
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,211
 So what will you do for me?

204
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:40,090
 You stole this from Dad, though.

205
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,901
 Well, isn't stolen money still money?

206
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:46,461
 Giving me attitude... Give it back! Dad!

207
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,641
 What should I do for you?

208
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,621
 My name.

209
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:58,381
 Well, when you become a novelist in the future,

210
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:03,241
 include my name somewhere in your story.

211
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,771
 What the heck?

212
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:07,771
 What do you mean? That's a big deal!

213
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:15,001
 At best, people live for a hundred years and die.

214
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:18,231
 But books last thousands and tens of thousands of years!

215
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:23,031
 So, if you write my name there,

216
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:27,721
 "Lee Kyeong Ae once lived in this world!"

217
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,531
 That will remain forever!

218
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,911
 You like that?

219
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,381
 Why wouldn't I?

220
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:39,401
 Hey, even a thousand years later, this whole world will recognize me, Lee Kyeong Ae.

221
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:44,011
 Your older sister will definitely become a famous person one day.

222
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:45,231
 Are you laughing?

223
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,121
 Hey! Even your Korean teacher said I have potential!

224
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:54,351
 Even if I don't become Miss Korea, he said there are ways for me to be on TV.

225
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:58,421
 Soon Ae, when I become immensely famous,

226
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:04,441
 I'm going to leave my traces all over the place!

227
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:10,991
 "Everyone! Here in Woojeong Village, the oldest daughter of Lee Hyeong Man and Park Ok Ja,

228
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:19,241
 Lee Kyeong Ae lived a very fun life!"

229
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,641
 Like this!

230
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:25,031
 So you have to write my name. Okay?

231
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,381
 Why aren't you answering me?

232
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,961
 All right! All right!

233
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,761
 - Where are you going? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

234
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:41,661
♫  The scenery will be beautiful  ♫

235
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:48,851
♫  Let's promise forever  ♫

236
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:55,981
♫  We'll be together like a blue summer  ♫

237
00:19:55,981 --> 00:20:02,571
♫  Please forget the past hurts  ♫

238
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,420

239
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,919
Hey, did you stop by the bookstore on the way?

240
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,489
Yeah, I saw it! I was so shocked to find out that Go Mi Sook is a novelist!

241
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,779
 Oh, wow. That's incredible.

242
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,419
 Hey, hey! Did you hear Go Mi Soo became a novelist?

243
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,479
 Really? Really?

244
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,469

245
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:53,279
 Dear Y, whenever I become lonely... I only imagine and...

246
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,829
 I'm not welcomed anywhere...

247
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:59,339
 My secret small door that's hidden somewhere...

248
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,359
 I lost it!

249
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,859
 I didn't anticipate this timing.

250
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,599
"Congratulations!

251
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,029
A genius high school novelist is born!

252
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,059
New book release of the year! Newcomer of the year!

253
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,459
Unexpected occurrence in the publishing industry!

254
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,459
A 19-year-old high school female student novelist is born!

255
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:21,419
A genius girl who appeared like a comet in the literary world! Go Mi Sook!"

256
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:27,349
Are you saying that Go Mi Sook is our school's Go Mi Sook?

257
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:30,519
Yes, the Go Mi Sook in my class! Yes, it's true!

258
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,219
The newspapers want interviews later,

259
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:36,739
asked if it was all right for the journalists and publishers to come to the school.

260
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,629
They can, right? Yes?

261
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,409
Oh, wait. Should I apply some mousse to my hair or what?

262
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,609
In any case, how come she never gave us a heads-up until the book was published?

263
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,979
She did a great job of hiding it!

264
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,489
Imagine my surprise when she brought that in.

265
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,660

266
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,759
No way.

267
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,069
How?

268
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,939

269
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,619

270
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,339

271
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,129
I wanted to realize my mom's dream.

272
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:53,119
I heard there was a time she wanted to write a novel.

273
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,039
My mom also.

274
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,869
She was a great literary woman!

275
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,609
Since she's my university junior.

276
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,889
Oh, my gosh! Then that talent came from your mom!

277
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,869
- Seems like it! 
 - No, it's not!

278
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,919
My daughter is much better than me!

279
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,109
It's my first novel, so I have a long way to catch up to my mom.

280
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,259
But still, I hope it will be a special gift for her.

281
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,959
It's my mom's birthday soon.

282
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,869
- Wow, I see! 
 - Oh, really?

283
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:28,409
- Congratulations! 
 - How are you so close to each other?

284
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,799
Talk about quite a gift!

285
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,809
In Seoul, the response on the first day at the bookstore was so remarkable that

286
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:38,679
- there's already talk of it being a bestseller! 
 - Oh, really?

287
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,539
Wow! That's great news!

288
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:44,939
This is also a very happy occasion for Woojeong High School.

289
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,819
This is the first since we started the school.

290
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:53,859
If I had known earlier, I would have put up huge banners!

291
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,389
Go Mi Sook.

292
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,139
Let's talk.

293
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,709
How could you do something like that?

294
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,149
Tell me. Why would you?

295
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,419
How could you steal it?

296
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,639
What do you mean, steal?

297
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:40,059
- What are you talking about? 
 - My novel!

298
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:44,869
Don't even lie so shamelessly in front of me like that!

299
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:47,339
What do you mean, your novel?

300
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,259
I really have no idea what you're talking about.

301
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,399
Mi Sook, please.

302
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,829
You're having a hard time these days, aren't you?

303
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:05,109
But still, you can't go around saying things like this.

304
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,749
Just because you helped me with a few writing assignments,

305
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:11,829
you feel like what I wrote is yours? Something like that?

306
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,129
I didn't know you were this bad of a person.

307
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,459
I'm not going to remain silent.

308
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:28,529
I'll tell them everything.

309
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:33,319
I'll tell them everything you made me do for you.

310
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,529
Soon Ae, why are you being so annoying?

311
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,939
Now I have to do something more.

312
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,719
What a hassle.

313
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,729
Do you...

314
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,919
have evidence?

315
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:10,949
A notebook that disappeared?

316
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:15,669
Does anyone even know that you wrote it?

317
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:24,579
You won't make it anyhow.

318
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:28,499
So just stay still.

319
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:34,709
Don't create a ruckus and end up like your sister, Soon Ae.

320
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,049
Okay?

321
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,149
I wondered why girls who like books

322
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:15,639
were all like that.

323
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,779
What?

324
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,549
They always act like they're the main characters.

325
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,219
Pretending to be smart and worldly.

326
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,399
Just because they read a few words on paper.

327
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:31,499
I can't stand how they think they're so special.

328
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,239
But now that I've tried it,

329
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,389
it's fun.

330
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,469
Soon Ae, it's not too late.

331
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,549
We can definitely turn things around! Okay?

332
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,739
Go Mi Sook was right.

333
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:20,559
In the end, who would believe me if I say that without any evidence?

334
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,089
The notebook is gone, and the novel has been published already.

335
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:33,850
The only person who saw me write it was my older sister.

336
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:39,259
But my sister is...

337
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,729
Why are you giving up without even trying?

338
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,399
Just because Go Mi Sook says it won't work, then it won't?

339
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,679
If Go Mi Sook says it's not true, everyone will say it's not.

340
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,049
If this situation gets any bigger,

341
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,179
my parents will find out, too.

342
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,279
My parents aren't...

343
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,509
the kind of people who will be proud of me for writing a novel.

344
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,479
They will just struggle more.

345
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,779
Only if I give up,

346
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:51,409
only if I can let it go...

347
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,379
then it will seem like nothing ever happened.

348
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:07,169
That might be better for everyone.

349
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:14,559
 That's why... you gave up, Mom.

350
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,129
 But you can't.

351
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,729
Lee Soon Ae, pay attention.

352
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,729
Are your parents the only family you have?

353
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,059
Oh Bok and Sis, too.

354
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:36,089
I mean, you only have Oh Bok and Sis?

355
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,639
Is there anyone else?

356
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:45,009
Let's imagine that there is.

357
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:50,369
That person loves your novel the most in this world.

358
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,799
And that person wishes that the novel she loves most

359
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,079
will have your real name printed on it.

360
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:05,059
And with the novel you wrote, you'll become a great novelist.

361
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,709
You'll read as many books as you'd like.

362
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,819
Listen to all the music you want.

363
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,719
Sip on hot coffee.

364
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:20,609
Just like that... live the life that you want without...

365
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,729
giving up on anything else anymore.

366
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:35,539
She could be hoping desperately for you... to live a life like that.

367
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,339
All right?

368
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,909
Come in.

369
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,399
- Good luck. 
 - Where are you going?

370
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,819
Soon Ae.

371
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:33,679
Do you know the Band Hallasan that sometimes performs at that Moonlight club?

372
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,119
Even though they're known as a copycat of the guys of the Band Baekdusan...

373
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,759
I really respect those guys.

374
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,179
Especially the drummer.

375
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:53,039
One day, that guy faced a huge crisis.

376
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,099
What kind of crisis?

377
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:03,439
Urgent poop.

378
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,189
Will he die or relieve himself?

379
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:09,279
He had to make a decision at that moment.

380
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,149
The guy then looked around the room.

381
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:17,499
Nothing would really happen even if he stopped the performance in a town club.

382
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:23,979
But he performed to the end for the sake of his audience.

383
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:27,069
He let himself go? On the spot?

384
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:28,949
Yes!

385
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:35,639
What's the moral of this gross story?

386
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,559
Once you start something, you need to finish it!

387
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:55,669
Soon Ae, that novel is yours. Right?

388
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:59,419
Then you have to protect it with your life!

389
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,069
I'm cheering my arms off in front of you.

390
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:06,579
How can you give up?

391
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,569
How can you forget about me here?

392
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,059
You wench!

393
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:29,229
- Mom. 
 - Why wouldn't I be proud of you?

394
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:32,309
- What? 
 - You know when your sister...

395
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:36,399
wanted to become Miss Korea or a singer,

396
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,109
do you know how much I regret not encouraging her once?

397
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:53,519
Stay strong and good luck!

398
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,099

399
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:14,149
Let's go!

400
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,189
What's going on?

401
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:28,109
How many people have you told?

402
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,789
If you have been wronged, you have to spread it like wildfire.

403
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:36,199
That's how the bad bitch gets punished.

404
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:44,939
 That road was a pretty familiar one for me.

405
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:51,739
 Because it was the publishing company I'd be working for about 30 years later.

406
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:56,509
 Even though it was the first time going with my mom.

407
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:15,769
 And there... I found the face I'm very familiar with.

408
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,309
The real writer of the novel is here.

409
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:23,109
Shall we discuss this properly?

410
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:30,359
It really isn't true. They're scheming together right now.

411
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,769
What are you trying to do? This is no ordinary situation.

412
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,689
The book has been published already, and

413
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:39,079
bookstores nationwide are selling copies with my name and picture.

414
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,089
If this becomes bigger, are you prepared to take responsibility?

415
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,779
Do you have evidence?

416
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,479
Your parents are already pretty devastated right now.

417
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:54,399
Are you okay with creating a ruckus like this?

418
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:59,609
Senior, let's talk when the attorney arrives.

419
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:02,509
The culprits always ask for evidence.

420
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:08,649
If the evidence you speak of is the notebook you stole, we don't have it.

421
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:14,709
But do you think only one notebook is needed to write a novel?

422
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,629
It's a novel I've been writing for two years.

423
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:35,849
You'll see the sentences I wrote and erased,

424
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,069
my scribbles on which meaning to give certain words,

425
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,089
the chapter I left out...

426
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,569
It has everything.

427
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:46,819
You'll know when you see it.

428
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:49,229
You'll know it. Really.

429
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:52,049
She made that up after reading the notes of my novel.

430
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,219
If you ask me, I can answer everything.

431
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:57,269
Ask me anything about the novel.

432
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,739
I can answer everything.

433
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:05,669
But you can't, Go Mi Sook.

434
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,809
Senior, what are you doing?

435
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,169
She said I'll know if I look at it.

436
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,089
Then I should look at it.

437
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,219
And I'll have to ask her.

438
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,869
I'm curious about many things, too.

439
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:40,559
Mom.

440
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,389
Mom!

441
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:57,369
Yes, I plan to pull the ones that were distributed off the shelves.

442
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,779
All the interviews with the author have been canceled.

443
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:05,139
No, we will republish it as soon as possible.

444
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:08,439
No, the story won't change.

445
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:11,709
Only the author's name and the book cover will be switched out.

446
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:13,319
Yes, yes.

447
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:16,719
We'll schedule another interview, then.

448
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:20,329
Yes. Thank you.

449
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:26,149
 On the first page of the reprinted novel with my mom's name on it,

450
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:30,149
 she requested for the following sentence to be included.

451
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:36,009
 I dedicate this book to Lee Kyeong Ae, the oldest daughter of

452
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:39,629
 Lee Hyeong Man and Park Ok Ja from Woojeong Village.

453
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:45,579
♫  The loneliness below countless stars on a chilly night  ♫

454
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:50,950
 And I also found out a small secret.

455
00:39:52,799 --> 00:40:01,059
♫  No matter who I say it is, they would not understand this feeling  ♫

456
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:03,589
There's one thing I'm curious about.

457
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,379
In the "Letter to Y," who is "Y"?

458
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:18,519
♫  Since I can gaze at you  ♫

459
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,669
The name...

460
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,439
of the friend I really want to meet one day.

461
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:32,659
♫  Fill up my embrace with hot and dark nights  ♫

462
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,779
 She said...

463
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:39,679
 it was the first initial of the name she wanted to give her daughter in the far future.

464
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,709
 Like the "Y" in Yoon Young.

465
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:47,809
♫  If you tell me that  ♫

466
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,579
♫  If you do  ♫

467
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,839
Thank you, Yoon Young.

468
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,179
I was able to get my novel back all because of you.

469
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:58,059
Me, too.

470
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,329
All because of you.

471
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,819
♫  Where there's an end  ♫

472
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:14,029
♫  If you would see me at some point  ♫

473
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:18,329
♫  I think I can endure thanks to that  ♫

474
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:22,519
♫  Give me this night  ♫

475
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,149
♫  Fill up my embrace with hot and dark nights  ♫

476
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:29,889
 Truly.

477
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:34,009
 It was truly a happy day.

478
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:40,559
 I don't think I've ever had such a perfectly happy day in my life.

479
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:46,939
♫  That you love me, those painful words  ♫

480
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:50,859
♫  If you tell me that  ♫

481
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,037
Mom!

482
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,507
Mom!

483
00:41:57,507 --> 00:42:00,320
If you'll do something so ignorant, why even read books?

484
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,090
I should rip them all up!

485
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,873
Mom, I was wrong!

486
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:06,913
A gift for me?

487
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:11,023
You'll realize my dream for me?

488
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:13,303
What a joke!

489
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:19,643
It's my shame that I kept a stupid daughter like you!

490
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:21,433
You know that?

491
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,983
Mom!

492
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:31,443
Mom! Mom!

493
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,430

494
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:46,693

495
00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:49,403

496
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,893
What are you doing here?

497
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:12,463
I thought you fell into a deep sleep.

498
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:16,203
Not again.

499
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:28,093
Can I sit next to you? I'm scared.

500
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:42,883
It's a little better now.

501
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:05,943
I thought you'd be tired and sleep deeply after traveling to Seoul.

502
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:08,063
And good things happened, too.

503
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,713
That's what I mean.

504
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:14,753
I was thinking the same thing.

505
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,283
My six years of suffering

506
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:25,023
under Go Mi Sook's power trip definitely all washed away as if I drank a hundred shots.

507
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,703
But that nightmare won't go away.

508
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:34,013
What is it actually about?

509
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,313
You'll keep it a secret to the end?

510
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:46,443
It feels like it happened one day pretty recently.

511
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:51,913
We returned to the future after fixing the time machine.

512
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:58,493
Mom and Dad were all there, changed in the way I had imagined.

513
00:45:58,493 --> 00:46:01,073
Everything looked really good.

514
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,743
Everything looked good. So, what's wrong?

515
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:06,123
But...

516
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:16,273
It's nothing.

517
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,993
You'll just end the story like that?

518
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:22,113
Oh, it's just a meaningless dream.

519
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:26,503
No fun, no meaning. It's all over the place, like a weird movie.

520
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:28,063
I see...

521
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:37,333
I saw a real movie recently.

522
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:43,253
I saw my mom there, too.

523
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:47,693
It felt strange.

524
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:50,763
To face someone who abandoned me.

525
00:46:56,773 --> 00:47:01,893
In 1988. One year from now.

526
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,133
The person who will leave as soon as she gives birth to me.

527
00:47:09,373 --> 00:47:15,513
You're talking about... something real and not a dream, right?

528
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:17,983
Shall we just say it's a dream?

529
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:25,513
If she really wanted to find me, she easily could have.

530
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:28,803
The world is not that big.

531
00:47:29,573 --> 00:47:33,243
Even if there wasn't a time machine, she totally could have.

532
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:38,453
She could have at least found out where and how I was living.

533
00:47:39,013 --> 00:47:41,363
But she didn't.

534
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:45,163
She didn't look for me. Not even once.

535
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:49,893
That was her choice.

536
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:56,383
She wanted us to live this life as strangers to each other.

537
00:47:57,123 --> 00:48:00,333
That's what she wanted from me.

538
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:06,283
So I've been living fine up until now.

539
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,753
But this car just brought me...

540
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,693
Is that just an excuse?

541
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:22,823
You know you just wanted to see her once.

542
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:33,213
I saw her. So it's really the end.

543
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:39,053
I'll just say maybe I was just dreaming for a short while.

544
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:44,363
That's what I'm supposed to do here anyway.

545
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:50,393
Not interfering in the lives of people whom I shouldn't interfere with.

546
00:49:02,213 --> 00:49:04,113
About the dream...

547
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:11,003
To be honest, in my dream...

548
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:20,763
Well... can I talk to you for a second...

549
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:22,453
Hyung?

550
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:28,343
You want to talk about something?

551
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:29,983
With me?

552
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:34,173
What kind of crazy shit are you going to tell me now?

553
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:35,903
Huh?

554
00:49:45,203 --> 00:49:47,373
Do you remember?

555
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:52,373
The summer I was 13 years old.

556
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:59,323
For the first time, you beat me in your room.

557
00:50:01,823 --> 00:50:07,663
Lucky for me, Mom saw it happen.

558
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:12,773
How sad she must have been that day.

559
00:50:13,453 --> 00:50:17,353
She lived her whole life getting beaten up by her husband.

560
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:25,953
And now she had to watch her only daughter getting beat up by a punk like you.

561
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:31,073
What the hell are you talking about, crazy bitch?

562
00:50:34,153 --> 00:50:38,653
But was it because she was so sad?

563
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,163
She just ignored it and walked by.

564
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:47,793
Right?

565
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:57,033
There were countless times after that.

566
00:50:57,033 --> 00:51:00,223
Am I the invisible man?

567
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,683
Even though I yelled...

568
00:51:03,863 --> 00:51:07,073
and cried, saying I was in pain and agony,

569
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:10,203
I was just...

570
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:15,183
a nobody in that house, Brother.

571
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:20,303
That's why I wanted to show Mom.

572
00:51:21,603 --> 00:51:24,523
I wanted to show Mom.

573
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,983
Is your hand all healed now?

574
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:36,303
What?

575
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:52,143
Since you keep drinking...

576
00:51:57,563 --> 00:52:00,413
it takes this long for it to heal.

577
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:04,713
 Are you crazy?

578
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:07,553
 What took you so long!

579
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:10,153
 Go report it.

580
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:14,313
 It's raining so hard, and you didn't bring anything?

581
00:52:14,313 --> 00:52:17,353
 Did you bring it?

582
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:25,213
 Hey, do you think Mom will let you off easy if you do this to me?

583
00:52:25,213 --> 00:52:29,203
 Hey! Hurry up and help me up!

584
00:52:34,553 --> 00:52:37,913
 Gently, gently...

585
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:44,753
 Really!

586
00:52:46,843 --> 00:52:49,403
 I said it hurts!

587
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:51,920
 You'd better be careful!

588
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,733
 Got it?

589
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,573
 What the hell.

590
00:53:17,683 --> 00:53:24,393
 Does that hand... hurt a lot?

591
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:29,273
 How much does it hurt?

592
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:41,960
My hand...

593
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:11,963
Why? What is it you want to talk about?

594
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:15,433
Oh, you see...

595
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:19,893
sometimes when I look at this car,

596
00:54:19,893 --> 00:54:23,613
I get a strange feeling.

597
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:27,953
I know this doesn't make any sense. I know, but...

598
00:54:27,953 --> 00:54:33,813
I feel like I'm looking at an object that's not supposed to be here.

599
00:54:38,213 --> 00:54:41,333
No, never mind. Never mind.

600
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:47,083
Well, that doesn't matter anyway. Right?

601
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,413
What do you mean?

602
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:24,873
Detective.

603
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:29,123
I have something to tell you.

604
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:36,083
Could you please keep everything

605
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,523
I tell you from now on secret?

606
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:47,073
I might get killed if anything gets out.

607
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:52,953
No matter what you tell me, you won't get hurt.

608
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,963
I promise.

609
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,913
About the incidents that happened in town...

610
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:07,583
I saw...

611
00:56:11,443 --> 00:56:13,593
the culprit.

612
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:20,603
I saw him kill her with my own eyes.

613
00:56:22,363 --> 00:56:24,623
My brother.

614
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:38,403
I heard... there were murder cases in town.

615
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:43,313
They say the victims had...

616
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:51,583
a matchbox from my girlfriend's cafe and a written note.

617
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:02,373
By any chance, is this one of them?

618
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:08,600

619
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,893
I wasn't trying to look on purpose.

620
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:24,120
When I was going to the bathroom earlier today...

621
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:30,730

622
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,163
I picked it up when I saw it.

623
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:41,023
But why...

624
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:45,593
Why is that here with you, Hyung?

625
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:54,863
What's going on?

626
00:57:54,863 --> 00:57:57,223
Hyung, is it really yours?

627
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:02,973
Calm down and listen to me.

628
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:10,963
W-Who are you? What's going on?

629
00:58:10,963 --> 00:58:12,223
I said listen to me.

630
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:16,003
Who... Who the heck are you?

631
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:32,930

632
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:40,663
♫  One day, by your side  ♫

633
00:58:40,663 --> 00:58:46,683
♫  If a long, long night falls on you  ♫

634
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:56,023
♫  Without saying a word, I'll sit close to you  ♫

635
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:58,083
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

636
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,293

637
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:03,583
 - Mr. Yoon. 
 - Yoo Beom Ryong?

638
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,163
 Mr. Yoon.

639
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:07,993
 I think something happened to Soon Ae.

640
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:10,553
 Get a hold of yourself! This is wrong!

641
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,303
 She's dead already, anyway.

642
00:59:15,183 --> 00:59:16,483
 Can we revive her now?

643
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:24,393
♫  Holding the hand reaching out to me  ♫

644
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:25,790
 We won't get caught, Hae Kyeong.
