1
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,070

2
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:52,093

3
00:01:55,026 --> 00:02:02,466

4
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,223
I know.

5
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:11,153
How ridiculous it sounds that I need to do something

6
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:14,393
in the time I was suddenly fallen into, but...

7
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,554
but...

8
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,783
Let's go out.

9
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,133
It's chillier in here than outside.

10
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,921
So let's go out for now.

11
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,711

12
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,781
Anyway, I don't think we'll be returning tonight.

13
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,281
Come out after you change.

14
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:46,551
Go Mi Sook and my mom knew each other?

15
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,921
Even in the same class.

16
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,261
What about the novel? What exactly happened?

17
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,891
 No one else really likes me.

18
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:03,051
 That's why...

19
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,001
 That's why...

20
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,741
 I want to die.

21
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:17,921
 I never imagined my mom had a time like that in her life.

22
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,471
 But was there more?

23
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,361
 My mom's other moments that I didn't know about.

24
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:27,491
 There was a time I dreamed of becoming a novelist.

25
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:29,491
 What's the story about?

26
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:33,111
 Can you give me an autographed copy, too?

27
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,401
 You're going to read it?

28
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,671
 That's okay.

29
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:41,621
 How much of my mom's life have I missed?

30
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,011
No.

31
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,151
I can change everything here.

32
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,391

33
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,891
How does she have this?

34
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:30,221
 I don't think I can go back just yet.

35
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,971
 There's something I need to do here.

36
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:41,051

What do you plan to do there?

37
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,001
 Do you remember these people?

38
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,961
 May 14th and 16th, 1987.

39
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,871
 The two women who died one after another.

40
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,981
 And the woman who disappeared on the 20th and hasn't been found to this day.

41
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:05,921
 Yes, they were all women I knew or had seen around the neighborhood.

42
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,441
 And you never killed them?

43
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,431
 I really didn't!

44
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,481
 If only those damn investigators didn't frame me back then.

45
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:19,791
 I feel wronged. Please believe me.

46
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:25,351
 Yes. And this...

47
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,951
 is the list of prime suspects at the time.

48
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:31,691
 Including you, there are a total of three people.

49
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,041
 Do you remember the other two men?

50
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:39,711
 Yes. Since our town is so small.

51
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:45,341
 Then from now on, tell me everything you remember about

52
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,991
 these six people, including yourself.

53
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,541
 Even very trivial things are fine.

54
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:56,371
 My memories are from so long ago that I'm not sure how accurate it will be.

55
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:58,841
 It's just for reference, so don't worry.

56
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,841
 I'll go directly to the sites to check for accuracy.

57
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,761
 This is a case without much-remaining information or evidence.

58
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,231
 That's why I'll be getting as close to them as possible,

59
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,511
 and watching their every move.

60
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,241
 Then I would have to wait.

61
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:23,781
 Until right before the incident occurs.

62
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:36,381
 Where do you think more than half of these six people belonged at the time?

63
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,591
 Belonged... Belonged...

64
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,451
 At school.

65
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,171
 School?

66
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,591
 I'll start there.

67
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,651
I need to get into school.

68
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,561
To school. I need to go there.

69
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,091
Oh, my gosh! Hot!

70
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,101
- Ow, it's hot! 
 - Are you crazy?

71
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,621
Ow, it's hot!

72
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,881

73
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,481
    But is there really a reward if you catch a spy?

74
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,961
Yes. Did you see anyone suspicious?

75
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:22,501
Of course, every person I see is suspicious.

76
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,071
Look, look at that older girl.

77
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,651
Goodness! I even know how many spoons her family has.

78
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,551
She's just a crazy nut.

79
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:39,441
You know. I'm talking about unfamiliar faces and unfamiliar ways of speaking.

80
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,401
Like they came from a different world.

81
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,791
Yes, an unfamiliar face and a different world.

82
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,931
That's right. And they don't know this place, or what day, month, and year it is right now.

83
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:51,921
- Yes, if they don't know. 
 - Right.

84
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:57,121
Or they keep blabbering something strange while carrying a strange device.

85
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,851
Strange...

86
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,591
I saw someone like that yesterday!

87
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,541
Oh, right. I'm sure you did. I guess you do every day.

88
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,661
I can see well because I have good eyesight.

89
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,821
Who's that?

90
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,531
I asked who it was, you punk.

91
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:17,881
Do you think you're making sense right now? School?

92
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,381
Not even as a teacher but as a student?

93
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,551
Is that something so shocking?

94
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,931
To the point of not knowing how hot something is?

95
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,771
Ow!

96
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:37,111
Well, I'm sure you'll see what I mean, but...

97
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:41,331
if I remove my makeup, you can't really tell my age.

98
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,411
So I can easily look three years younger.

99
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,901
I don't think that is likely convincing.

100
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,211
Did you forget where we are?

101
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,831
It's hot, so drink slowly.

102
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:08,191
I didn't forget. It's 1987.

103
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:12,781
We can't return for now anyway.

104
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:16,661
You said it's safe to have an identity.

105
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:20,411
Since you did it, can't I do it too?

106
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,631
Give me that hand.

107
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,841
Don't you think the order is wrong?

108
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,431
There's no order. You can just apply whichever hand first.

109
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,881
You're not talking about that.

110
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:43,791
Is it because of what you need to do here?

111
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:49,231
Then you need to explain that to me first.

112
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:06,101
Who would come at this hour?

113
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,111
Is it really okay to do this?

114
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:15,801
He's a teacher at Woojeong High School. If Chairman knew...

115
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,541
He's close with the chief, too.

116
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,361
Why is Detective Baek Dong Shik here?

117
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,541
Stay here a moment. I'll go outside.

118
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,951
What's going on at this hour?

119
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,501
I'm Detective Baek Dong Shik with the Woojeong Police Department.

120
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,731
We are here to check something. Excuse us.

121
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,921
Wait.

122
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:11,131
You forgot to explain what's going on.

123
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:15,841
Do you think that's necessary right now?

124
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:19,171
You should at least try calling Chairman.

125
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,911
Moon Night's Young Nok is always talking nonsense, but...

126
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,711
you might get into a lot of trouble.

127
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,841
Let's see your ID.

128
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,341
Properly this time.

129
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,581
- Yes? 
 - Didn't you hear me?

130
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,151
We have a report that you're a suspicious person.

131
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,861
So, show me your ID.

132
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:57,701
I lost it the other day.

133
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,241
If you're that careless,

134
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:16,191
there's no other way to prove your identity.

135
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:21,381
Well then. Let's go to the station.

136
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,051
T-To the police station?

137
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:26,421
- Follow me. 
 - T-To the police station?

138
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,661
Follow me!

139
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:44,451
Are you crazy? Are you relying on Chairman to save you?

140
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:47,741
I understand you're desperate for this case due to your performance record.

141
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:52,381
But I'm trying to help you from wasting your time.

142
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:56,091
She has a definite status, and I can prove it.

143
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,721
If you want, I can prove it to you.

144
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:08,291
You're saying she has a clear identity?

145
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,531
Yes.

146
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:12,691
She's...

147
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,241
She's...

148
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,441
a student at Woojeong High School, 12th grade, Class 1.

149
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,041
 Yes!

150
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,711
 What are you saying?

151
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,881
 Come on!

152
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:53,051
 Oh, look at her!

153
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:57,031
- Hi! 
 - How's it going?

154
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,611
When was I born?

155
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,731
Oh, that's right. 1965. 650515, 22..

156
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,581
Hello, teacher!

157
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,941
Oh, hi, Mi Seon! Or was it Mi Sook?

158
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:37,661
- It's Mi Seon. 
 - Oh, yeah.

159
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:45,781
I'm really sorry, but... what was my resident ID number after 63?

160
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,971
Wait, time out.

161
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,361
Come here.

162
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:53,591
Why, why? We are almost at school! Where are we going? Why?

163
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:56,991
- Just come here for a second. 
 - Why?

164
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,921
Why here?

165
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:08,091
You do realize how dangerous this situation is. Right?

166
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:12,051
If anything goes wrong, either of us will see an ambiguous end.

167
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:15,431
I know. I felt it yesterday.

168
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,301
I'm going to school, so nothing goes wrong.

169
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:18,861
You should say what's actually happening.

170
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,621
You're going there for your own plan.

171
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:25,261
Considering the critical nature, I admit I totally lucked out.

172
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:29,841
"Totally lucked out." You need to watch how you say stuff like that!

173
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:35,111
All right. I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

174
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,361
It's my first time to time travel, that's why.

175
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,031
That's what I mean.

176
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,511
Why go to school when you're time-traveling for the first time?

177
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:50,561
I have my reasons. Like you do.

178
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,541
You didn't think I knew?

179
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,461
For someone who can time travel freely,

180
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:01,216
why would he settle down in a house in another time

181
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,986
and pretend to be a teacher with a daily commute?

182
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:06,061
The daily commute is...

183
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,651
terrible even in the present life.

184
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:18,461
Well, I'm sure there are personal reasons for

185
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,931
telling such serious and dangerous lies.

186
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:26,671
But I won't ask what they are.

187
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,441
So you mean, "Don't ask me mine if you won't tell me your reason." Right?

188
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,091
Correct.

189
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,401
Let's just do what we need to do.

190
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:41,201
And I won't try to put you in a difficult situation like last night.

191
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:46,201
At least until we return, we are in the same boat.

192
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,071
You're only going to school.

193
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,371
As soon as school is over, you go straight home.

194
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,831
Try your best not to stand out and stay quiet.

195
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,991
If you disrupt anything I do, school is over for you.

196
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,691
At any given time.

197
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,451
Agreed.

198
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:06,631
But do you think that detective will come by again?

199
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:09,241
Not sure.

200
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,521
Shall we go for now?

201
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:14,461
Let's go.

202
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,891
Oh, right, right.

203
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,701
Oh, don't worry about things like that.

204
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,271
Don't worry.

205
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:40,351
That could happen when young people work together.

206
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:44,591
Just bring me a bottle of makgeolli later.

207
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,461
You should think of your lonely friend whose son lives far away, man.

208
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,911
All right.

209
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,721
Bye, Chief Kim.

210
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,451
Goodness! Sorry, sorry.

211
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:58,001
My phone call took a little long, didn't it?

212
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:00,021
All right.

213
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:03,571
I'm really happy today.

214
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:06,711
We have our first transfer students since the school was established.

215
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:10,401
What's more, two of them on the same day!

216
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:12,941
They even slightly look alike.

217
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,551
- No way! 
 - We do not look alike!

218
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:26,151
You may have met at the club some time ago, but make a formal introduction.

219
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:29,341
This is Mr. Yoon.

220
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,591
Also, if you look carefully—

221
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:34,031
No, we don't look alike.

222
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:44,721
Anyway, he will be your nephew's teacher from today onward.

223
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,361
 Dad is his nephew?

224
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,101
 Then I'm also related to...

225
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,021
Please take good care of him.

226
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:56,291
Detective Baek Dong Shik is a very capable man.

227
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,261
Thanks to men like him, our town became such a great place to live.

228
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,901
We need to always be grateful.

229
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,741
I should be the one asking you to take good care of us.

230
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:14,231
Why did such a capable person act that way last night?

231
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,741
Oh, I'm sorry, Chairman.

232
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:20,821
That's fine. I'm sure you didn't know we are family.

233
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,461
He's the teacher, and you're the parent.

234
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:26,221
So we are all Woojeong High School family.

235
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,751
So from now on, let's all get along nicely. All right?

236
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,741
Second skull!

237
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,711
Wow, we are all meeting here with the first skull, too!

238
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,674
This is so amazing!

239
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:43,784
Dad, the two skulls at the same time...

240
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:54,942
So it seems like you don't have a father, either.

241
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,152
Don't talk to me.

242
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,742
I mean, as a transfer student,

243
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:13,172
if you came to school with your uncle-in-law, it's totally obvious.

244
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:21,352
Some fathers don't even show up even if they're around.

245
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:25,012
Throughout elementary, middle, and high school...

246
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:29,652
A father who never came to the entrance ceremony, graduation, or sports events.

247
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:31,962
Get into fights while drunk,

248
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:36,282
he missed all the important events in my life.

249
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,102
My dad was that kind of person.

250
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,632
What kind of dad is that?

251
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,922
Wow.

252
00:21:43,922 --> 00:21:47,692
It's so weird hearing that come out of your mouth.

253
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:54,222
Hey, but what is elementary school?

254
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,242
Grade school.

255
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,482
Oh, that's what it's called!

256
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,922
E-Elementary grade school.

257
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:07,012
Hey, if you're here,

258
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,432
is Soon Ae also...

259
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,682
Hey!

260
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:15,542
- I told you yesterday. Right? Stop showing interest! 
 - Wait, wait, wait.

261
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,132
Hey, hey, hey! I told you yesterday too!

262
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,852
To mind your own business!

263
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,992
Ow, ow, ow!

264
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:25,671
Hey, you girl, let go!

265
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,861

266
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:36,692
Didn't you say your niece-in-law was mild-mannered?

267
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:42,462
Oh, she said she would be.

268
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,132
 - You know that. Right? 
 - No, really.

269
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,042
 - Wow! 
 - Is that it?

270
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,182
 - Hey, look at this! 
 - I dropped this.

271
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:53,402
 - Oh, here it is. 
 - That's right!

272
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,832
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - My hand!

273
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:11,372
Are you okay?

274
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:13,572
Goodness.

275
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,372
Class President.

276
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,792
Attention!

277
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,422
Bow!

278
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:31,152
 Hello.

279
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,792
Come in.

280
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:47,952
This is Baek Yoon Young, who will be joining our class from today onward.

281
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,372
She took some time off from school due to family matters.

282
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:51,672
She's an older classmate to you guys.

283
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:54,192
There's no such thing as an older classmate.

284
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,692
We are all friends if we're in the same class.

285
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,982
That's right.

286
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:01,932
Well, you girls can decide that on your own...

287
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,712
Wait, no.

288
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:06,602
Kim Hae Gyeong, Lee Eun Ha, Park Yoo Ri.

289
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:09,732
Kim-Lee-Park trio, act accordingly.

290
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:13,442
You better not get caught mistreating our transfer student!

291
00:24:13,442 --> 00:24:15,312
- Yes. 
 - Geez...

292
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,612
You're 12th graders

293
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:19,672
with no hope.

294
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:21,222
Oh, geez.

295
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:23,622
Except for our Lee Soon Ae.

296
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,842
There's an empty seat there. Go sit there.

297
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,952
Yes.

298
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,482
That's it for now!

299
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:38,592
 Thank you.

300
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,762
 - Hey, come here! 
 - That punk!

301
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:10,002
Sit down.

302
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:13,102
Everyone, this is our new transfer student.

303
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:15,302
Introduce yourself freely.

304
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,992
I'm Baek Hee Seop.

305
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:33,812
What?

306
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,172
- That's it? 
 - Yes.

307
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,122
To say a lot would be

308
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,642
going against the rock and roll spirit.

309
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,402
Right.

310
00:25:56,402 --> 00:26:00,462
I see that's your concept. We can't violate that.

311
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:04,042
Go sit wherever you want. That's it for now.

312
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,922
Goodbye.

313
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:09,532
 Goodbye.

314
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:17,242
What happened?

315
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,762
I just thought I would stay here a while longer.

316
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,782
Are you happy to see me?

317
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,672
You like Virginia Woolf?

318
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,522
Can I see?

319
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,342
Do you know this book?

320
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:50,762
"If you could give her 100 years,

321
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:56,032
if you could give her a room of her own and 500 pounds,

322
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,002
if you let her speak her mind, and

323
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:03,402
....if she could earn half of what she already wrote

324
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:07,752
she concluded she could write a better book."

325
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:12,312
"If you gave her another 100 years, she would

326
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:14,822
...become a poet."

327
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,182
Fuck!  What shit are you spewing?

328
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:33,322
Hey, good to see you.

329
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:02,022
You really play the guitar well!

330
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:03,822
You can hear this?

331
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:05,462
You put it in the fourth tier of the selector and

332
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:08,322
played the rhythm with the E9 chord!

333
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:12,382
Wow! Your fingers are fast, and you've got a good rhythm.

334
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:15,112
I can't believe I finally met my mate!

335
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,192
Nice to meet you!

336
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:21,142
I'm Yoo Beom Ryong.

337
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:24,852
Look at this crazy guy.

338
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:28,952
Nice to meet you!

339
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,222
Hey.

340
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,965
When someone says, "Good to see you,"

341
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:35,485
shouldn't you respond to that?

342
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:39,802
That's such a childish way,

343
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,192
but since you guys are childish.

344
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:58,162
But what's that?

345
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:11,872
I wonder if she's using it well.

346
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,232
 Follow me.

347
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:14,602
 Yes.

348
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,312
 Come here.

349
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:24,642
 Oh, man. She's bothering me.

350
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:26,632
 Teacher!

351
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:32,782
 Wait a moment. Just a second.

352
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,262
 Why are you acting friendly? You want to die?

353
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:54,732
 I don't have much time, so just listen.

354
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:58,582
 All right, look into the opponent's eyes...

355
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,302
 like this.

356
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,922
 You're doing well!

357
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:10,572
 And then say, "What's that?"

358
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,602
 That's what you do.

359
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:15,662
 Then they would look down, right?

360
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:19,022
 That's when you quickly crouch down.

361
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:21,202
 And hit them like this!

362
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:24,282
 At that time, their nose will bleed and...

363
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:35,622
 Hey, this won't work for you. Okay, just pretend like you're doing that to me.

364
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:38,102
 So I just look down like this.

365
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,282
 Fuck!

366
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:44,112
 Is your skull made of a rock or something?

367
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:51,542
 So what the heck is this?

368
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:55,802
 Shit.

369
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:02,742
 My dad taught me this.

370
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:08,302
 When I entered elementary school, he said if another kid picked on me,

371
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:11,192
 I should get a head start like this.

372
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:13,942
 When I graduated, both of my parents already passed away.

373
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:17,152
 But this is the one thing I learned and

374
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:20,292
 I have been using it very well.

375
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:26,972
 This is what dads want to teach their kids.

376
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,722
 So...

377
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,692
 it's not like your dad missed it because he wanted to.

378
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:35,092
 He probably had his reasons.

379
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:43,902
 - What do you know? 
 - What?

380
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:48,572
 That's so childish as a 19-year-old.

381
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,742
 I don't need anything like that.

382
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,542
 Oh, geez.

383
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,412
Oh, oh! Are you okay?

384
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,602
Oh, my gosh!  You're bleeding!

385
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,522
- Oh! 
 - Geez.

386
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:10,942
Shit.

387
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:15,222
- Are you crazy? 
 - Could you guys please be quiet?

388
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:20,682
It's hard to focus on my reading.

389
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:29,392
I think that's enough.

390
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:36,702
Here comes Prince Five! The Prince Five!

391
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,052
Why?

392
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:13,572
- Attention! 
 - Sit down.

393
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:15,532
Five...

394
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:17,232
Four...

395
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:20,362
What are you counting?

396
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:23,792
We have to enjoy this moment as much as possible.

397
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,332
Three...

398
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,922
Two...

399
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:29,312
One...

400
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,252
What did I tell you to do right after school?

401
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:37,572
 Go straight home.

402
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:42,132
That's right. Straight home.

403
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:44,932
Don't stay out after 10:00 p.m.

404
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:48,572
You can't go to the library to study, either. Just study at home.

405
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,692
If you can't study well, just sleep.

406
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:52,202
Sleep is good medicine.

407
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:55,962
Mountains and rivers are forbidden, even during the day.

408
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:57,592
So just don't go.

409
00:33:57,592 --> 00:34:00,142
Don't go anywhere dark and remote.

410
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:02,112
Don't trust anyone carelessly.

411
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,612
Bad people will approach you with a smile.

412
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:09,442
For now, only deal with school, home, you, and your friends.

413
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:11,832
Just wait a few months until you're 20 years old.

414
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,822
You'll have freedom from then onward.

415
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:17,492
- And... 
 - Can we just start the class, please?

416
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,082
Open your books.

417
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:32,582
During the five seconds before he starts nagging,

418
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,232
he's a prince for those five seconds.

419
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:36,262
Five-second prince.

420
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:37,462
His nickname is Prince Five.

421
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:40,712
Do we have to listen to that every class?

422
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:44,712
- That's terrifying. 
 - He constantly bans us from doing anything,

423
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:47,142
so sometimes he's called Prince Ban.

424
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,432
You can't tell him!

425
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:54,562
But why do you guys keep calling him Prince?

426
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:58,292
How can you not?

427
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:02,652
We will identify the composition motive and use of "Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

428
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:07,872
We will understand the characteristics of the form and expressions in...

429
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:10,692
"Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

430
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:15,122
First, let's discuss the value of "Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

431
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:17,332
As I mentioned yesterday,

432
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:21,162
"Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven" is the very first epic poem written in Korean.

433
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,252
Also, as a representative work in academic and political literature,

434
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:25,512
it holds great value in Korean literature.

435
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:29,442
This work is historically valuable in studying the language used from

436
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:32,851
the end of the Goryeo Dynasty to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty.

437
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:36,731

438
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:40,092
 Hello, teacher.

439
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:46,132
Gosh, you're such an old fart.

440
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,822
I can't stand fighting, either.

441
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:53,502
I told you not to stand out in any way.

442
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:57,892
But on your first day, you act like a UFC fighter.

443
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:01,562
Let's just do what we need to do instead of criticizing each other.

444
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:04,192
That's what I was going to say.

445
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:08,152
Don't stare at me too much during class.

446
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,782
Don't go anywhere after class and just remain in the classroom.

447
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:19,292
I'll come pick you up.

448
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,072
Mr. Yoon.

449
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:23,912
Okay, go on your way then. Go, go.

450
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:26,122
Speaking down to me...

451
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,432
Thank you for earlier.

452
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,272
Your compliment on my writing assignment.

453
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:35,732
Oh, I just said it since you wrote well.

454
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,202
Nothing to thank me for.

455
00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:40,472
I was a little shy to show you this assignment.

456
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:45,332
Do you really think I can be a novelist one day?

457
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:49,262
Of course. Not too far in the future.

458
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:52,082
You may become very famous.

459
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,362
So try your best.

460
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:11,532
So does he know Go Mi Sook?

461
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:16,292
Well, she is a bestselling writer.

462
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:20,612

463
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:24,992
She wasn't in the bathroom...

464
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:28,032
Where did she go?

465
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,902
Did you bring it?

466
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:37,892
Yes.

467
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,662
Well,

468
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:46,602
I corrected the awkward sentences and revised the parts that weren't very clear.

469
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,432
You're working so hard because of my essay.

470
00:38:11,682 --> 00:38:17,352
But... the sentences I wrote were almost all removed.

471
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:28,332
That...

472
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:30,202
It's okay.

473
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,892
Well, that's how I'll get a good final draft.

474
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:37,582
I'm the one who wrote the original work, anyway.

475
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:43,532
Editing is something anyone can do, don't you think?

476
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:48,342
Yes. That's right.

477
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:53,002
Come out after a little while.

478
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,602
Okay.

479
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:17,792
 The responses are good only when you edit them... so I don't really have complaints, either.

480
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:22,672
 Editing is something anyone can do.

481
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:49,672
So this is what you've been doing all along?

482
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,612
I had my doubts, but you're the same person.

483
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:01,732
Do you even know how to write without anyone's help?

484
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:04,012
I've seen it for six years, but

485
00:40:04,012 --> 00:40:09,912
it's surprising you couldn't even complete your own essay without someone's help.

486
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:13,472
If you really think anyone can do it, then you could do it yourself.

487
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:18,262
How can you be so proud even after using someone else's time and abilities?

488
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,732
No, this isn't being proud.

489
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:30,112
You feel it's shameful yourself. That's why you talk about hiding in a place like this.

490
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:37,542
This kind of thing can't remain a secret, at least in this place.

491
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:42,402
Let's go to the Teachers' Office.

492
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,812
Mi Sook, are you okay?

493
00:41:10,492 --> 00:41:12,342
This...

494
00:41:14,512 --> 00:41:16,792
I'm doing this because I want to.

495
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:20,762
The class will start soon.

496
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:22,572
Come along.

497
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,372
Mi Sook, let's go.

498
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:56,432
 What did she do to her that my mom can't say anything?

499
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:59,232
 There is something going on.

500
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,872
I've never seen you before.

501
00:42:10,432 --> 00:42:13,662
Are you in 12 grade, Class 1?

502
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:23,442
Do you know someone named Lee Soon Ae in your class?

503
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:25,262
Soon Ae?

504
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:27,702
What about Soon Ae?

505
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:33,632
Could you give this to her for me?

506
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:38,562
Yoo Beom Ryong!

507
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:49,772
Do you know how suspicious you look right now?

508
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:55,152
Don't you know you're not supposed to be in the girls' classroom hallway?

509
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:57,442
Are you scoffing at school regulations?

510
00:42:57,442 --> 00:43:00,992
N-No, Mr. Yoon. I'm sorry.

511
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:04,422
- Please forgive me just once. 
 - Follow me.

512
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:19,251

513
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:24,812
Bye!

514
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:31,151
 If Go Mi Sook really stole the novel Mom wrote,

515
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:34,352
 today's incident was just the beginning.

516
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:45,942
Geez.

517
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:49,872
She won't be able to sleep well after acting like that anyway.

518
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,222
Why isn't he coming?

519
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:02,622
Telling me not to go anywhere and just wait.

520
00:44:15,632 --> 00:44:17,392
Be careful.

521
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:19,962
What?

522
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,252
Be careful, Yoon Young.

523
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:40,672
Are you really just leaving?

524
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:43,112
For tonight's team dinner, the principal said

525
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:48,172
even if the skies split in two and the grounds crack, everyone must attend.

526
00:44:48,172 --> 00:44:51,702
He usually uses those extreme expressions.

527
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,142
All right, then.

528
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:59,422
What do you know, after being here only a month?

529
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:04,492
But why does the principal like him so much?

530
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:08,002
I'm sorry I'm late...

531
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:11,772
Not here?

532
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:24,532
What?

533
00:45:25,232 --> 00:45:28,722
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

534
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:39,132
Threats only work with people who have something to fear.

535
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:44,252
I don't know if that kind of warning kept Soon Ae around all this time. But listen.

536
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:48,872
All the cowardly things you did up until now and plan to do in the future

537
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:52,192
will no longer happen the way you want.

538
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:55,722
I'm going to stop everything, no matter what.

539
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:04,892
I was right.

540
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,352
Mi Sook!

541
00:46:37,902 --> 00:46:41,102
Where the heck did she go?

542
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:46,131
 That girl who transferred to 12th grade, Class 1.

543
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:53,062
What are you doing, standing here?

544
00:46:53,062 --> 00:46:56,262
Let's go. Mother said you should come home early.

545
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:03,122
I need to stop by somewhere.

546
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:05,042
You should go ahead today.

547
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,562
Hey, Go Mi Sook!

548
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:31,642
Do you think my little sister escaped just now?

549
00:47:33,732 --> 00:47:38,182
Oh, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. I just opened the window for some air.

550
00:47:39,772 --> 00:47:44,872
I'm sorry, but you don't understand Mi Sook's ways at all.

551
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:51,732
If you want to fight your opponent, shouldn't you know them well first?

552
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:58,492
Oh, which way are you going?

553
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:06,102
 Next time, I should write a note to that transfer student.

554
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:09,082
Hey! You said you have a girlfriend.

555
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:13,132
 Hey, don't you know love can change whenever?

556
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:15,922
 Whenever I see pretty girls,

557
00:48:15,922 --> 00:48:19,692
 I bravely send them...

558
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,242
 love letters first.

559
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:25,962
 First, I test the waters.

560
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:28,612
Test what? You can't even take a dump alone...

561
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:31,192
 I should have asked for her phone number...

562
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:34,812
 Geez! If only that darn teacher hadn't shown up!

563
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:45,362
 I'll avoid that teacher and go straight to her tomorrow. I'll be cool.

564
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:46,642
Don't say anything!

565
00:48:46,642 --> 00:48:48,862
 "What's your phone number?"

566
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:53,802
Yeah, it's 53-2355.

567
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:57,352
 53-2355?

568
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,762
 Oh, I've heard that number somewhere...

569
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:03,592
 Hey! That's that darn teacher's number!

570
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:07,522
Yeah, that transfer student lives at my house.

571
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:10,642
Call if you want to see her. I'll answer for you.

572
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:17,272
Hurry up and go home.

573
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:35,202
What do I do?

574
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,138
I know it's a coincidence but what a relief.

575
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:55,177
You didn't have an umbrella.

576
00:49:57,209 --> 00:50:00,792
I can speak casually since you're a student. Right?

577
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,632
I'm 22 years old.

578
00:50:03,782 --> 00:50:05,392
Oh, yeah.

579
00:50:09,288 --> 00:50:13,651
But what did you mean by that earlier?

580
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:17,141
That I don't know Go Mi Sook's ways at all?

581
00:50:19,164 --> 00:50:21,822
You said she threatened you?

582
00:50:21,822 --> 00:50:26,552
If you felt that directly, then there's a high chance that's not real.

583
00:50:26,552 --> 00:50:30,152
It's just a kind of light test.

584
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,852
Test?

585
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:36,292
You know, seeing which button to press to get a reaction.

586
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:38,762
Trying to figure out your weakness.

587
00:50:38,762 --> 00:50:42,132
To see if there are any secret cards to use against you.

588
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:46,152
Until she fully figures out those things, Mi Sook will never attack.

589
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:48,272
And once she does figure them out,

590
00:50:50,229 --> 00:50:51,819
then that's the end.

591
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:03,120
 Threats only work with people who have something to fear.

592
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:08,922
 I was right.

593
00:51:08,922 --> 00:51:10,672
 Be careful.

594
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:13,392
 What?

595
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,592
 Be careful, Yoon Young.

596
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:20,225
You said she's your younger sister, but

597
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:24,065
should you say these things to me? To someone you just met?

598
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,302
Because you look like you're in danger.

599
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:35,802
When you look at one place and rush toward it, you fall into many traps.

600
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:18,037
 Are you okay?

601
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,967
That's why you should have been careful.

602
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:46,607
This will help you come to your senses. Drink slowly.

603
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,910

604
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:22,497
She's driving me crazy!

605
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,387
Don't look at me like that.

606
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:33,687
This is my house. Not anywhere dangerous.

607
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:37,937
It's just that I have a different way of doing things.

608
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:39,467
No big deal.

609
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,787
Let's just have a drink and have a good time.

610
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,887
It's because I like you. Okay?

611
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:56,727
Does Go Mi Sook know you're like this?

612
00:53:57,877 --> 00:54:02,377
Well, she might know or may pretend not to know.

613
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:05,907
You mean this isn't the first time?

614
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:15,687
I just mean you'll be okay soon.

615
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:34,407
Goodness.

616
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:37,517
Looks like you got a cut.

617
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:51,147
I said you will be okay.

618
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,777
How dare you...

619
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:35,547
You asshole!

620
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:40,867
You asshole...

621
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:48,147
Are you all right?

622
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:56,817
Come here!

623
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:22,187
You told me to believe you!

624
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,137
 It's really not me.

625
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,017
 I feel wronged.

626
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:30,697
 Please believe me.

627
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:32,767
 Then let's see each other in Woojeong Village.

628
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,847
 Then I'll let you know what that means.

629
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:38,407
 Stay alive, and you'll see.

630
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:42,107
 I was worried you wouldn't, I mean, you couldn't come.

631
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,747
 But what a relief.

632
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:56,187
Listen to me carefully.

633
00:56:57,217 --> 00:57:00,547
From this point onward, your life will be miserable.

634
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:05,027
I won't take my eyes off of you even for a moment and watch you until the end.

635
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:07,987
If you have to pay for your crimes, no matter what they may be,

636
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:11,357
I'll make sure you pay for every single one of them.

637
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:16,047
So you'll have to live a proper life.

638
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:19,097
Prisoner number 4013.

639
00:57:19,097 --> 00:57:21,247
Go Min Soo.

640
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,657
W-Who are you?

641
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:28,087
Let's take care of that.

642
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:52,777
How did you know I would be there?

643
00:59:15,377 --> 00:59:18,867
 I thought that's where it would happen next.

644
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:22,427
 This is the list of prime suspects at the time.

645
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:24,377
 Including you, there are a total of three people.

646
00:59:24,377 --> 00:59:26,777

647
00:59:28,077 --> 00:59:33,277
 The first suspect in the murder that will take place in three days is Baek Hee Seop.

648
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:47,077
 And the second suspect, Yoo Beom Ryong.

649
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:49,287

650
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:50,207

651
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:55,277
 Third suspect who was identified as the culprit and served 30 years in prison.

652
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:57,677
 Go Min Soo.

653
00:59:58,317 --> 01:00:01,437

654
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:07,147
 Those are the people you met today.

655
01:00:24,627 --> 01:00:26,177

656
01:00:37,397 --> 01:00:39,267
Who are you?

657
01:00:41,217 --> 01:00:43,717
And why are you here?

658
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:51,450

659
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:59,227

660
01:00:59,227 --> 01:01:01,967
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

661
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:04,787
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

662
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:10,387
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

663
01:01:10,387 --> 01:01:16,027
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

664
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:20,180
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

665
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,052

666
01:01:22,864 --> 01:01:25,227
 Two days before the first incident,

667
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:28,154
 one of the suspects was already arrested, and

668
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:31,991
 the other two didn't have any particular points.

669
01:01:31,991 --> 01:01:35,195
 Just when everything was swept into a foggy state,

670
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:37,263
 she arrived.

671
01:01:37,263 --> 01:01:40,547
 The first victim.

672
01:01:40,547 --> 01:01:45,087
 That man knows something.

673
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:48,667
 If, by any chance, she doesn't know what's going to happen here,

674
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,076
 I need to let her know.

675
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:53,457
 Since I don't know what's going to happen from now.

676
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:59,387
