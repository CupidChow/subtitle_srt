1
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:43,957
   

2
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,167
 When I look back, it was a really strange night. 

3
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:51,547
 The damn weather, crazy navigation, 

4
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,427
 and broken cell phone. 

5
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:56,587
 That's when it appeared in front of me. 

6
00:00:56,587 --> 00:01:00,337
 In it, I found instructions for a time machine. 

7
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:03,907
 That's right, the time machine in novels and movies. 

8
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:07,647
 Had I ever imagined a world without my mom? 

9
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,677
 Now in this world, even if I call out "Mom," 

10
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,447
 there was no one to respond. 

11
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,087
 A year from now, the year I turn 35, I will die. 

12
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:18,997
 That's because the culprit who killed me was the 

13
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,857
 same killer in the 1987 Woojeong Village serial murder case. 

14
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,250
 This was found even at the scene of my murder. 

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,240
   
 This is the mark of the criminal from 1987. 

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,630
Credit

17
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:37,227
 Mom. 

18
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:41,307
 We just arrived in 1987 and... 

19
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:43,357
 there's no way to return. 

20
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:46,087
 We are trapped here. 

21
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:49,817
   
   

22
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:26,477
 The presumed crime scene that points to the murder of the missing KSBC's Anchor Yoon Hae Joon 

23
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:30,317
 at a Gangwon Province river has been discovered, shocking the public. 

24
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:35,577
 The DNA test from the blood found at the scene concluded that it belonged to Yoon Hae Joon. 

25
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:38,267
 However, his whereabouts are still unknown. 

26
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:42,317
 There's a suspicion of a murder case without a body. 

27
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:47,057
   

28
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,947
   

29
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,147
Geez...

30
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,057
Geez...

31
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:26,607
 May 9th, 1987 at 10:40 p.m. 

32
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:30,627
 I had just arrived at this place, and 

33
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:33,787
 the only way to return 

34
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,957
 was completely destroyed. 

35
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,937
Oh, this is crazy...

36
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,537
   

37
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,157
Man, today really is...

38
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:26,517
Whoa! Are you all right?

39
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,050
- Your head is also... 
 - Yes, yes, I'm fine.

40
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,657
My goodness!

41
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,587
How many more heads are you going to crack?

42
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,887
I should be more careful from now on.

43
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,660
   

44
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,847
Oh, geez.

45
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:18,057
I'm sorry. I'll explain everything.

46
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,237
Excuse me?

47
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,057
You must be in shock already, but

48
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:27,437
the situation is worse than you think.

49
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:34,887
Well, we just... arrived in 1987 and...

50
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:39,647
there's no way... to return.

51
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,477
We are trapped here.

52
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,727
Really?

53
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,217
Yes. Don't be too scared.

54
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:55,197
I'll somehow...

55
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,897
Really?

56
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,197
Then... Really...

57
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:03,937
Oh, gosh.

58
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,817
Well...

59
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,237
You're laughing?

60
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,467
Did you hurt your head pretty badly?

61
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,547
No, no, I didn't.

62
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,947
- Ow! 
 - Oh.

63
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,987
Are you all right?

64
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,207
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,297
Geez!

66
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,070
   

67
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,547
 Is this really true? 

68
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,717
 Mom is alive right now? 

69
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,307
Welcome!

70
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,777
Hello!

71
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:09,517
This way.

72
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,397
Mom!

73
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,577
   

74
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:32,317
♫  A goddess on a mountain top  ♫

75
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:35,867
♫  Was burning like a silver flame  ♫

76
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,737
♫  The summit of beauty and love  ♫

77
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,607
♫  And Venus was her name  ♫

78
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,317
♫  She's got it  ♫

79
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,167
♫  Yeah, baby, she's got it  ♫

80
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:57,237
♫  Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire, at your desire  ♫

81
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:04,857
♫  Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire, at your desire  ♫

82
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,627
Yoo Ri!

83
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,857
Yoo Ri!

84
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:15,147
Yoo Ri, where is the bathroom?

85
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:17,717
Go find it yourself!

86
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:21,527
- Let's go! 
 - Let's!

87
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,047
♫  She's got it  ♫

88
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:27,487
♫  Yeah, baby, she's got it  ♫

89
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:35,367
♫  Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire, at your desire  ♫

90
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:41,287
♫  Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire, at your desire  ♫

91
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,177
Mom.

92
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,130
   

93
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,587
Mom.

94
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,387
Excuse me?

95
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:46,907
This isn't a dream, right?

96
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,687
Oh, my gosh, what are you doing?

97
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:01,747
It's real...

98
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:05,037
This is real.

99
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,547
It's real...

100
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,177
Mom...

101
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,577
I'm Yoon Young.

102
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,937
Weren't you scared?

103
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,377
How could you do that?

104
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:31,257
How do you expect me to live now?

105
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:36,017
No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

106
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,647
I'm sorry, Mom.

107
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:45,357
It's just that I was embarrassed of myself while I was out today.

108
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:49,817
It's because I thought I looked too shabby...

109
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:52,447
I just didn't want to...

110
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,957
show you because I was too embarrassed.

111
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,077
That's why I did that.

112
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,577
I was wrong, Mom.

113
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:21,447
I thought... there would be more time.

114
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:24,907
That you would wait for me.

115
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:35,537
Gosh, you really look exactly the same, Mom.

116
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,357
By any chance...

117
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,477
Do you recognize me?

118
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,237
Can you recognize me?

119
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,277
Yes.

120
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:13,117
Goodness, our town's treasured person almost died unexpectedly on the streets!

121
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:17,647
- Mr. Yoon! Mr. Yoon! 
 - Stop! Stop hitting me!

122
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,747
He's not all right. Seeing that he's bleeding,

123
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,837
- we need to take him to the hospital. 
 - Yes, yes.

124
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:26,027
Oh, no. That's okay. I need to look for someone.

125
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,337
Goodness! You can't die, Mr. Yoon!

126
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:32,097
- Oh, what do we do? 
 - How can you die after saving all our kids?

127
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:35,697
Don't you remember the glue incident last month? Mr. Yoon!

128
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,317
Hey, this won't do. Carry him!

129
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,947
Oh, yes! Get on my back!

130
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:39,967
No, it's okay.

131
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,617
- Get up slowly. 
 - No, I'm alive!

132
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:42,817
- Just get on my back! 
 - Hold on.

133
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,817
- I'm really okay! 
 - Get going!

134
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:50,447
Tell me. By chance, what?

135
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,047
By any chance...

136
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,497
Yes?

137
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,327
By any chance, did you sniff glue?

138
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,037
What does that mean?

139
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:07,427
Are you going to hit me?

140
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:11,077
I-I just want to go home.

141
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:13,747
Mom.

142
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:17,140
Mom, why are you being like that? Why would I hit you?

143
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,200
Mom. Mom...

144
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,897
Mom, I'm Yoon Young. Mom.

145
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,727
Mom, don't cry...

146
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,177
I'm so sorry!

147
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,677
- What the heck? 
 - What's going on?

148
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,357
Stop moving!

149
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:01,367
Starting right now, we're cracking down on minors!

150
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,267
For those of you who have your ID, take it out.

151
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:08,757
For those of you who don't, turn yourself in and hope for the best.

152
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:21,497
I'm really okay. I can walk.

153
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:23,317
- No, sir. 
 - Stay still.

154
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,417
Go to the hospital first.

155
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,487
- Hey, hey, this way! This way! 
 - Please!

156
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,957
She had bloody red marks on her forehead,

157
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,957
and she wore a red polka-dot scarf around her neck.

158
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,817
- She was very... 
 - Wait! Stop, stop, stop!

159
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,197
Where?

160
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,717
Excuse me?

161
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:41,217
- Director! 
 - Oh, yes, yes.

162
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:44,667
Where did you see her? Where did the polka-dot scarf go?

163
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,680
Yes, over here.

164
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,770
   

165
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,377
Geez!

166
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,677
You can't go in now, though.

167
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,907
Dong Shik is there tonight!

168
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,617
- Dong Shik is there? 
 - Yes.

169
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,457
Thank you for your cooperation!

170
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:05,487
Please have your IDs out and ready.

171
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,537
Raise them higher!

172
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,247
Excuse me. What's going on?

173
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,737
Can't you tell?

174
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:17,557
They're checking IDs.

175
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:18,657
Hurry up and take yours out.

176
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,777
Unless you want to go to the police station with them.

177
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:26,107
Do all the IDs look like that here?

178
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:27,837
Are there different ones?

179
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:31,827
Then you'd be a spy!

180
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:42,547
Oh, you used a very tricky word.

181
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,417
Sorry.

182
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:23,427
What are you punks doing here?

183
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:27,287
- Teacher! 
 - Teacher!

184
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,437
Teacher?

185
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,487
How many times did I tell you to get it together?

186
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:33,647
And high school seniors are clubbing!

187
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:34,957
Come out right now!

188
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:39,147
Teacher! Please forgive us!

189
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,187
- High school seniors. 
 - Please forgive us, Teacher...

190
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:44,007
What are you doing? You get over here!

191
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:48,207
- Teacher! She's not from our school... 
 - Yeah, you!

192
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:51,117
Why are you pretending like you don't know?

193
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:56,917
Teacher!

194
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,997
What the hell are you all doing right now?

195
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,347
 Detective Baek Dong Shik. 

196
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:11,407
    
 Five days from now, right after two murders and one disappearance,

197
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:14,397
 he will suddenly quit his diligent detective life. 

198
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:17,597
 Then leave this town and disappear. 

199
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,167
 For the next 30 years. 

200
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,077
"What the hell"?

201
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:36,127
The teacher wants to take his students, and that's how you put it?

202
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:45,117
Since the police want to take the offender, you shouldn't interfere like that.

203
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:49,857
Instead of trying to scare the tadpoles away by calling them "offenders,"

204
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:54,067
go catch the real criminals.

205
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:56,757
What?

206
00:18:56,757 --> 00:19:01,020
Things got all twisted up because you couldn't do that right.

207
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,750
Just now, what did you just mean?

208
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:16,707
 Dong Shik, you're working hard! 

209
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,047
Director Yoon!

210
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:23,697
Goodness, you have kids at home.

211
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,067
And you're not able to go home even at this late hour!

212
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,967
This won't do!

213
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,537
- I should talk to Chief Kim... 
 - Just look at you!

214
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,347
- This wench must be out of her mind! 
 - Dad...

215
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:37,377
We have to get you home soon.

216
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,957
Please, you should go home.

217
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,087
I'll take you home.

218
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:41,827
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

219
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,147
It's been a while since I rode in a police car.

220
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,827
Yes, yes, let's go.

221
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:48,507
Wait a minute.

222
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,727
Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. at the principal's office.

223
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:55,837
Let's go.

224
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:58,237
- Yes, let's go. 
 - Yes.

225
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,887
- Follow me. 
 - Dad. Dad, Dad!

226
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,057
Dad!

227
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:17,977
Dong Shik!

228
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,687
Yes, coming, sir!

229
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,047
   

230
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,377
Thank you! Have a good night!

231
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,750
   

232
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:57,917
Where are you going right now?

233
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:02,827
To sort out the real problem I missed while taking care of the wrong person.

234
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,147
Can I ask who you are?

235
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:15,107
Are you a little curious about that now?

236
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,047
I couldn't think straight earlier.

237
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,657
And now that the situation is especially very serious.

238
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,747
Does someone who knows how serious it is roaming around like that?

239
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,687
Are you on vacation or something?

240
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,197
Why the heck did you go inside a club?

241
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:33,047
That's because...

242
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:41,227
What about you?

243
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:48,447
Who are you that you know this place and this time? Why does everything seem so natural to you?

244
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,697
Right?

245
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,937
You're the one who hit me with that car.

246
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,787
I don't know how distracted you were that you only figured that out now.

247
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:24,217
But yes. That's right.

248
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:30,807
Follow me. It will be faster if you see it for yourself.

249
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:43,357
So this is not just a regular car, but it's a time machine.

250
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:45,517
You're a time-traveler.

251
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:48,247
And because I was hit by this car,

252
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,447
I came to 1987. Something like that, right?

253
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,517
It's amazing.

254
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,817
"It's amazing"?

255
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:01,257
Even looking at this, you can say that?

256
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:04,657
Isn't it correct to say I didn't create this situation?

257
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:14,787
Why didn't I think of that? Why did I think this was only my problem?

258
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,387
Why did you get hit?

259
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:19,397
What?

260
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,857
What were you doing that you got yourself hit?

261
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:26,677
Is there a way to get hit? Because the driver came and hit me!

262
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:29,237
No, you don't seem to understand very well.

263
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:32,487
This isn't the kind of car that just bumps into things.

264
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:34,797
This becomes very transparent.

265
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:38,677
For the last two months, at least twice a day, every day,

266
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:43,137
I've been traveling back and forth here numerous times, and this never happened.

267
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:46,757
Not only did you get hit, but you even followed me here.

268
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:49,967
So who is the variable here?

269
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,987
Variable?

270
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,927
Does something come to mind?

271
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:07,797
Music. Wouldn't it be music?

272
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:09,267
- What? 
 - That's right.

273
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,857
Yes, it was Sanulrim. 
  (A popular Korean singing group at the time) 

274
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:14,257
It was so loud that my ears hurt even from outside.

275
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:21,167
♫  Spreading silk and satin sheets on my heart  ♫

276
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,617
What does that matter?

277
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,607
By any chance, were you on a call?

278
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,577
No, I wasn't.

279
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:36,447
♫  Do you know how my heart feels  ♫

280
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,447
Yes?

281
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:44,167
What did you say? Hello?

282
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,517
♫  Step lightly and come toward me  ♫

283
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:53,417
You were. You sure were on the phone.

284
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:57,777
When you do that while driving, it's highly likely to get into an accident. Right?

285
00:24:57,777 --> 00:25:01,557
No, this car can't crash into anything, to begin with!

286
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,157
We can't let the insurance take care of it here.

287
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:07,057
What's the point of figuring out whose fault it was?

288
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,367
Geez.

289
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:13,217
I asked, wondering it would help in getting it fixed.

290
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:15,137
Do you also have a place to return to?

291
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:17,517
I hear you're a teacher here.

292
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,257
I guess she didn't usually watch the news.

293
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:35,837
This is just a trip, and the time where you're from is my home ground too.

294
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:42,197
As for a job, it's safe to have a proper identity.

295
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:46,617
You and I shouldn't be here all the same.

296
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:51,317
It means this could be a very dangerous situation.

297
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,807
Especially more for you.

298
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,937
 Hey! 

299
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:59,577
 Mr. Yoon! Are you okay? 

300
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:03,237
Foreman, I'm sorry to bother you at this late hour.

301
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:38,727
For someone who shouldn't be here, he knows practically everyone.

302
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,807
Hello! We're Hallasan!

303
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:10,147
♫  Without thinking too much, should I just say it as it is  ♫

304
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:15,517
♫  Should I just say it as it is  ♫

305
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:18,497
♫  Why didn't I say the words, say the words  ♫

306
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:22,247
♫  Why didn't I say the words, say the words  ♫

307
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,477
Geez!

308
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:32,287
D-Did it crack?

309
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:35,537
I'm okay.

310
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:39,217
No, it's not.

311
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,947
I can't crack three skulls in one night.

312
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:44,177
So, I'll always be careful.

313
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,817
Keep your distance!

314
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:50,217
Keep your distance.

315
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,967
What the heck?

316
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:10,277
Are you all right? You have been walking funny from earlier.

317
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:16,467
I'm okay. I don't even have insurance here.

318
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,617
What about you?

319
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:23,110
I have to be okay. It will become ambiguous if I die here.

320
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:28,477
The death of someone who wasn't even born here.

321
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,627
There's no way to take responsibility.

322
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:45,327
It's like a cure for all diseases. Sweet and salty.

323
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:51,167
Oh, it's the worst!

324
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,517
Geez.

325
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,287
Come in for now.

326
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,417
Drink.

327
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:39,107
You can just continue to live here.

328
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:42,047
Are you cursing me?

329
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:48,167
There's someone like me who doesn't even have a home like this.

330
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:54,507
I'm going to fix the car somehow and just stay here until then.

331
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:58,297
It's dangerous, so I would rather you not go out as much as possible.

332
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,407
Why? What's dangerous?

333
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,147
Didn't you sense it at the club earlier?

334
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:06,957
Do you have an ID?

335
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,537
What about a job?

336
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:10,387
Do you have one?

337
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:13,587
They could think I'm a spy.

338
00:30:13,587 --> 00:30:15,517
I'll be careful.

339
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:21,957
More than anything, you could be a danger to yourself.

340
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:26,287
If you carelessly throw out a seed here, it becomes a tree 30 years later.

341
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:30,907
One thoughtless act can completely change another person's future.

342
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:34,537
I understand.

343
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,117
- Mom! 
 - Get over here!

344
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,277
- You wench! 
 - Let go!

345
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:39,577
Get out!

346
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:42,467
You wench! You went to a club?

347
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:46,247
You're determined to copy your sister and drive me crazy, right?

348
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:48,047
- No, I'm not. 
 - Shut up!

349
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,677
I don't need any of it! Everyone, get out!

350
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:53,147
- Get out! 
 - Geez!

351
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:57,587
Come on, that's enough scolding. How can you kick her out at night?

352
00:30:57,587 --> 00:31:01,627
What? You can go out with her if you have any complaints!

353
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,617
- Mom... 
 - What?

354
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,887
- What's gotten into you? 
 - Mom! Mom.

355
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:08,827
Mom, I'm sorry.

356
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,827
Soon Ae, just suffer for a little while.

357
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:17,377
Geez!

358
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:33,427
The teacher must be home now.

359
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:47,727
Since she calls him "Teacher"... she must be going to school nearby.

360
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,297
Then that means her house must be in this town.

361
00:31:57,157 --> 00:32:00,117
That's why it was Woojeong Village.

362
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,137
Because it was her hometown.

363
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,767
Is that why you came all the way here, Mom?

364
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:47,977
Are you really going to be okay sleeping on this?

365
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:49,837
Yes, it's comfortable.

366
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:53,117
If you need anything while you're here, just let me know.

367
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:56,397
Clothes, food, alcohol, anything.

368
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,667
It sounds like the life I've been dreaming of.

369
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,827
Feeling like a rich jobless person.

370
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:04,847
Take advantage of it while you can.

371
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,167
It won't be for long.

372
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,907
I'm actually really good at fixing machines.

373
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:15,297
That's good.

374
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:21,457
Thank you for today. For everything.

375
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:24,747
You must've been very shocked today.

376
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:27,650
Don't worry too much, and get some rest.

377
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,080
I will make sure you return home in no time.

378
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,267
I'm going crazy.

379
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:51,727
I have no clue.

380
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:27,527
   

381
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:35,737
No matter what happens, I have to send her back before then.

382
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,135
Mr. Yoon!

383
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,935
Mr. Yoon!

384
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,055
Mr. Yoon...

385
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,785
Yes. What's going on this early at 7:00 a.m. on a Sunday, Soon Ae's father?

386
00:34:57,785 --> 00:35:00,175
How is your forehead?

387
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:02,118
Oh, I'm okay.

388
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:04,068
- I see. 
 - Thank you.

389
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,745
Then let's go together.

390
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:07,745
Where?

391
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:12,165
You won't miss the Woojeong Village Family Walking Contest organized by this Lee Hyeong Man, are you?

392
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,805
I even printed your name on the shirt.

393
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:18,245
I don't have a family, and I'm a little busy.

394
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,015
There's one more person just like you.

395
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:22,195
They need a partner too. Let's go.

396
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:24,045
No, no, there's something I need to...

397
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:27,425
Once you go, you'll have fun too.

398
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:34,175
Oh, yay! Perfect timing!

399
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,185
But how do I find Mom's house?

400
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:52,015
Mom!

401
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:54,125
Glue Sister?

402
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,195
Could this possibly be my mom's house?

403
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,055
Wow, this is a miracle!

404
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:12,575
This is a miracle! It's a miracle!

405
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:25,275
Why do you keep following me?

406
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:30,955
Just because... I like you.

407
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:34,595
I'm fascinated.

408
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,835
I wanted to see you.

409
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:58,555
Did your mom pass away?

410
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:03,085
Yesterday, in the bathroom.

411
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:08,105
Is that why you came to stay with your relatives?

412
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:21,905
I'm Lee Soon Ae.

413
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,905
My name.

414
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,040
I don't know if it's because I look like her or because of the glue,

415
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,595
but please don't call me mom.

416
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,735
It's really scary.

417
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:43,315
Then, can I just follow you?

418
00:37:44,435 --> 00:37:46,325
Soon Ae?

419
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:00,095
Soon Ae!

420
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:04,435
Lee Soon Ae!

421
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,325
Soon Ae!

422
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:15,085
   

423
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,685
Do you work here every Sunday?

424
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,375
No.

425
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,175
Usually, Mom and Dad take turns

426
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:47,585
but both of them went to the walking competition today, so I'm covering for them.

427
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:49,485
I see.

428
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:58,085
Are you going to just stay there?

429
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,405
I have to see customers now.

430
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,705
Okay. I won't disturb you.

431
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:05,425
Then I'll just look around a bit.

432
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:51,065
♫  Susan, the chilly winds are blowing  ♫

433
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:57,465
♫  Susan, as dusk approaches  ♫

434
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:04,065
♫  Where are you right now, all lonely?  ♫

435
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:10,560
♫  Why don't you come to me?  ♫

436
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:17,090
♫  Susan, my heart longs to see you  ♫

437
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:23,290
♫  Susan, you know very well  ♫

438
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:30,310
♫  Let go of the misunderstandings from that day  ♫

439
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,345
 Yoon Young! 

440
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:36,935
 Mom, what are you doing here? 

441
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,905
 Your dad went to the hospital in the building next door. 

442
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,895
 We were walking by, and we were so surprised to see you! 

443
00:40:42,895 --> 00:40:44,345
 Are you very busy? 

444
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,275
 - No. 
 - You look so skinny. 

445
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:48,455
 You'll erase my makeup. 

446
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,285
 Is the author coming? 

447
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,765
 Yes. 

448
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,955
 Won't you be late to the hospital? 

449
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:01,575
 There was a time I dreamed of becoming a novelist. 

450
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:03,825
 That's not easy. 

451
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,725
 What's the story about? 

452
00:41:05,725 --> 00:41:09,395
 Can you give me an autographed copy, too? 

453
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,625
 You're going to read it? 

454
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,135
 That's okay. 

455
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,165
 You're not even going to read it. 

456
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:17,435
 Let's get going. 

457
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,195
 Right. 

458
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:21,365
 I can't see very well these days anyway. 

459
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:23,825
 Why bother reading... 

460
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,485
 I'll go, my daughter. 

461
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:27,375
 Eat well. 

462
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,885
 Okay. Bye. 

463
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:54,485
♫  When we break up, I shed tears alone and am heartbroken  ♫

464
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:57,455
♫  When you go, I'll regret it  ♫

465
00:41:57,455 --> 00:42:00,880
♫  Why didn't I tell you?  ♫

466
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:03,815
Oh, man.

467
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:08,815
If only I could find some members, I could quickly form a band.

468
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:10,645
But then again,

469
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:14,515
who has a musical instrument in this small rural town?

470
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,720
   

471
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:26,025
   

472
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:28,595
Thank you.

473
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,125
- Goodness. 
 - See you.

474
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,435
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - All right.

475
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:34,705
   

476
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,855
Did everyone get off?

477
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,105
Yes, they did.

478
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,155
   

479
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:46,685
Man, what's up with the bus not following the schedule?

480
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:54,305
Mom really liked reading, too.

481
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:02,675
If it weren't for us, she would have read as many as she wanted.

482
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:13,845
Wait, this is... not a coincidence.

483
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:17,515
What's the chance that I happened to meet my 19-year-old mom?

484
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:20,755
I'm sure there's a reason...

485
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:25,345
 I... I really want to turn back time, Dad. 

486
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:28,285
 If I could go back to the past, 

487
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:31,015
 I would go far back. 

488
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:38,535
 So that I could make Mom not love you or me. 

489
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,305
 I want her to be happy by herself. 

490
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,845
 So that she will live a long life. 

491
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,345
 I will make her live. 

492
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:51,575
Mom married in 1988.

493
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:55,385
They met a year earlier, so...

494
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:06,145
Now what. The bus from Seoul is so late.

495
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:13,095
♫  Susan, my heart longs to see you  ♫

496
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:19,455
♫  Susan, you know very well  ♫

497
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:26,295
♫  Let go of the misunderstandings from that day  ♫

498
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:32,610
♫  And come back to me  ♫

499
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:40,465
♫  Susan, I love you  ♫

500
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:47,235
♫  Without regrets, I love you  ♫

501
00:44:47,235 --> 00:44:52,565
♫  Susan, I can't forget you  ♫

502
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,025
What bus time do you want to take?

503
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:00,505
Are you all right?

504
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,455
I think...

505
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:07,735
I have to go to the hospital.

506
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,640
   

507
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:18,285
Hey, what's going on?

508
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:22,185
He saw me, and all of a sudden...

509
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:27,365
All of a sudden, it started pounding here...

510
00:45:27,365 --> 00:45:31,415
It felt like 15 drums were pounding at once inside.

511
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:34,215
They kept pounding.

512
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:45,005
Oh, my god...

513
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:51,365
- By the way, what is your name? 
 - What?

514
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:55,755
I'm Baek Hee Seop.

515
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:00,265
What's your name?

516
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:12,035
You're the first skull!

517
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:17,195
What kind of bullshit are you pulling!

518
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,455
I'm going to have a word with you.

519
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:25,815
Soon Ae, go inside quickly.

520
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,365
Come.

521
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:29,665
You're Soon Ae.

522
00:46:30,865 --> 00:46:32,945
Hurry and go inside.

523
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,525
 - What are you doing? 
 - Keep going. 

524
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:39,125
 - What's going on? 
 - Go! 

525
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:43,605
- Why are you doing this to me? 
 - Keep going!

526
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:47,405
They kind of look alike.

527
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,345
They're both so weird.

528
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:21,215
Is your skull okay?

529
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:25,305
Your heart must be fine now.

530
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:27,665
You seem completely normal.

531
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:31,145
Oh, yeah, I am.

532
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:37,235
Are your legs okay?

533
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:40,945
- Try running. 
 - Run?

534
00:47:56,695 --> 00:47:59,015
There's nothing wrong.

535
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,265
When did you start using a dialect?

536
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:06,265
Since I was born, probably.

537
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:08,215
You ask all sorts of weird questions!

538
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:10,275
What's wrong with you?

539
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,045
You.

540
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:19,425
Don't you dare show up in front of Soon Ae!

541
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:22,245
There she is.

542
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:29,285
Gosh, you're working hard today too. Our literary girl.

543
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:33,155
Hey, guys.

544
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:34,545
Come out. We have to go somewhere.

545
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:37,025
If I go now, I'll get in trouble with my mom.

546
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:38,665
Just for a short while.

547
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,795
We'll do something fun at school tomorrow.

548
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,375
We thought we could plan it together.

549
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,605
Plan?

550
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:46,845
Why should I do that?

551
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:50,345
- Who do you think you are, telling me what to do? 
 - I am!

552
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:56,035
Soon Ae's BFF. That's why!

553
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:58,945
BFF?

554
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:02,105
What's that!

555
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:06,565
It means the closest friend in this whole world. Got that?

556
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:09,645
Soon Ae and I are like that!

557
00:49:12,395 --> 00:49:17,305
Hey, I'm sorry about cracking your skull yesterday.

558
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:19,005
Forget it.

559
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:26,855
As long as I'm here, you will never cross paths with Soon Ae.

560
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:28,495
So quit now before it starts pounding more.

561
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:31,645
Why don't you like me?

562
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:45,575
Why?

563
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:55,015
I know who you are.

564
00:49:56,635 --> 00:49:59,435
I know what kind of person you are.

565
00:50:00,485 --> 00:50:04,055
I know how light and insignificant your love is.

566
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,875
I've seen it all.

567
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:11,715
W-What...

568
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:14,715
Who do you think you are?

569
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:17,815
How the heck would you know that?

570
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,685
Hee Seop.

571
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:21,515
Brother!

572
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:29,445
- Uncle? 
 - What happened?

573
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:35,305
You wait and see!

574
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:37,965
I'll make you like me!

575
00:50:39,345 --> 00:50:40,915
Let's go.

576
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:48,645
 One, two, three, four, 

577
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,745
 five, six, seven, eight. 

578
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:54,615
 Two, two, three, four, 

579
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:57,545
 five, six, seven, eight. 

580
00:50:57,545 --> 00:51:00,715
- Leg exercise. 
  - One, two, three, four, 

581
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:03,685
 five, six, seven, eight. 

582
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,495
 Two, two, three, four, 

583
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:09,515
 - five, six, seven. 
 - One more time! 

584
00:51:09,515 --> 00:51:13,825
 One, two, three, four, five, six... 

585
00:51:13,825 --> 00:51:15,638
 Who are you waiting for? 

586
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:18,868
   
 My grandson. 

587
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:22,735
He disappeared here.

588
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:27,485
You don't even recognize him.

589
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:31,635
My grandson disappeared here.

590
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:34,585
Please find him for me.

591
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:37,845
People might think you actually lost your beloved grandson.

592
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,845
All your life, you said you couldn't stand him. What are you doing?

593
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:50,105
 Two, two, three, four, 

594
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:53,155
 five, six, seven, eight. 

595
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:54,945
Mr. Yoon!

596
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,215
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

597
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,535
 Five more minutes. 

598
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,595
Yes, let's go!

599
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,765
 - Hey! 
 - Keep going! 

600
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:19,235
Goodness! Hurry up!

601
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,845
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

602
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:23,715
 Oh, man, this is too much. 

603
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:25,625
 Keep going, keep going! 

604
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,805
I didn't have any expectations.

605
00:52:27,805 --> 00:52:31,405
I'm very happy to participate in this competition this year.

606
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:34,915
For three years, I could only watch and clap in the stands.

607
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:36,845
Yes.

608
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:39,935
I heard this year's prize for third place is a cassette player.

609
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:43,715
We can probably win that much!

610
00:52:43,715 --> 00:52:46,845
All he has is money, but he's so stingy.

611
00:52:46,845 --> 00:52:51,665
For family, I just have a son, but he's studying abroad in the US.

612
00:52:51,665 --> 00:52:56,605
Gosh, my only joy is waiting for him to come home.

613
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,975
Don't act like you liked him that much.

614
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:03,800
What? Why do you keep mumbling to yourself?

615
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:08,565
If you want to win third place, you need to pick up the pace.

616
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:10,785
Third place. That's right.

617
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:14,785
   

618
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:16,915
Mr. Yoon! Mr. Yoon!

619
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:18,735
Let's go together!

620
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,635
 It's a family walk! Mr. Yoon! 

621
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:26,525
Why did you give this to me after being so greedy, Gramps?

622
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:32,265
He needs to get back from America soon to fix my car.

623
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:52,065
I told her not to go out as much as possible, and she couldn't wait one day.

624
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,805
This is quite deliberate.

625
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:56,388
Deliberate.

626
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:57,988
Goodness.

627
00:54:03,495 --> 00:54:05,175
Goodness.

628
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:14,985
   

629
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,395
   

630
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:38,875
Why is this here?

631
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,255
   

632
00:54:56,246 --> 00:54:58,726
Dad and Uncle.

633
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,436
They look very different.

634
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,500
   

635
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,356
No, I can't.

636
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:23,496
Even if it's a joke, that's too much.

637
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:25,816
So, you don't want to?

638
00:55:25,816 --> 00:55:28,896
You can just pretend like you lost it.

639
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:33,846
I can't lie about having something stolen from me when I haven't.

640
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:38,466
And to a classmate. That's a bit too much.

641
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:47,356
You're pretending to be good all by yourself once again.

642
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,150
   

643
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,610
   

644
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:23,256
   

645
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:26,716
Mom,

646
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,996
I know you read my diary entries secretly all the way up to college.

647
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,336
So let's call this even.

648
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:57,786
What I hate most are people who pretend.

649
00:56:57,786 --> 00:57:00,946
Like they don't know anything

650
00:57:00,946 --> 00:57:06,076
about the bad and dirty things that happen in this world.

651
00:57:12,786 --> 00:57:15,926
People exactly like you!

652
00:57:22,196 --> 00:57:24,216
Soon Ae!

653
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:26,136
Soon Ae!

654
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:32,096
Help me!

655
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:36,876
Help me!

656
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:41,876
Soon Ae!

657
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:48,386
Mom!

658
00:57:48,386 --> 00:57:50,886
Oh, no!  What do we do?

659
00:58:34,986 --> 00:58:37,526
Soon Ae, are you okay?

660
00:58:45,346 --> 00:58:47,496
What's wrong with you guys?

661
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:50,926
Your friend fell in the water...

662
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:54,386
Why are you just standing around watching?

663
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:57,546
We thought she was joking around.

664
00:58:57,546 --> 00:59:00,046
Is a person's life a joke to you?

665
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:04,046
Why?

666
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:06,946
Should I joke around?

667
00:59:06,946 --> 00:59:10,906
Who the hell do you think you are! So annoying.

668
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:18,846
Go Mi Sook.

669
00:59:25,506 --> 00:59:26,806
 Dear Y, 

670
00:59:26,806 --> 00:59:32,216
 Whenever I feel lonely, I imagine a small door. 

671
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:37,046
 Where light doesn't seep through, I'm sitting alone. 

672
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:39,076
Why is this here?

673
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,006
 This is the first novel released in 1987 titled "Small Door." 

674
00:59:43,006 --> 00:59:45,696
 This amazing novel. 

675
00:59:45,696 --> 00:59:48,366
 You wrote this when you were merely 19 years old. 

676
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:53,986
 Out of your fans, do you know how many became followers since that first novel? 

677
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:57,286
 Among them, I am that number one fan. 

678
00:59:57,946 --> 00:59:59,666
Right?

679
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:02,536
You're Go Mi Sook, right?

680
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:11,616
How do you know my name?

681
01:00:39,366 --> 01:00:40,996
Soon Ae, are you okay?

682
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:43,586
You sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

683
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:45,816
I'm going home.

684
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:50,326
Okay. Let's go.

685
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,056
Let's go.

686
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:59,216
There's a big hospital at the town's intersection.

687
01:00:59,216 --> 01:01:01,416
My mother is a doctor there.

688
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,896
If she feels worse, please take her there.

689
01:01:03,896 --> 01:01:06,206
I'll tell them to take good care of her.

690
01:01:08,466 --> 01:01:09,596
Let's go.

691
01:01:09,596 --> 01:01:11,416
Come on.

692
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:16,266
Soon Ae, I'm sorry.

693
01:01:17,316 --> 01:01:19,526
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

694
01:01:34,246 --> 01:01:37,076
I'm sorry, Unni. It's because I don't know how to swim.

695
01:01:37,076 --> 01:01:39,600
I caused you trouble.

696
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,830
   

697
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:52,106
Are all those girls from your school?

698
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,056
Go Mi Sook, too?

699
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:56,956
Yes. They're my friends in the same class.

700
01:01:56,956 --> 01:02:01,116
How can they be friends when they were just watching you drown?

701
01:02:08,616 --> 01:02:11,466
You can tell me honestly.

702
01:02:13,506 --> 01:02:16,766
- Do they bother you? 
 - No.

703
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,666
They were just joking around.

704
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,566
Joking...

705
01:02:22,866 --> 01:02:25,726
How can that be joking around, Soon Ae?

706
01:02:27,386 --> 01:02:30,516
Just pretend you didn't see anything, Unni.

707
01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:36,946
But still, they're the only friends I can talk to at school.

708
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:42,206
No one else really likes me.

709
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:48,546
So they avoid talking to me.

710
01:02:48,546 --> 01:02:50,996
So...

711
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:55,146
I have to continue to be friends with them

712
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,286
and it all has to be just joking around.

713
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,266
That's why...

714
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,256
That's why...

715
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:14,666
I want to die.

716
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:35,446
 Hey, Lee Soon Ae! 

717
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,776
What are you doing over there?

718
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:39,896
Hurry up and get inside!

719
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:44,916
Please, you have to keep today's incident a secret.

720
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,640
You should go inside, too.

721
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,960
   

722
01:04:18,176 --> 01:04:20,696
   

723
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:06,646
Have you ever felt that...

724
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:16,146
you recognized someone's feelings much too late?

725
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,346
If I had recognized it just a little earlier,

726
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:27,246
if I had known earlier...

727
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:31,456
everything might have been different.

728
01:05:35,336 --> 01:05:37,696
But not here.

729
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:44,036
But nothing is too late here yet. It's before everything takes place.

730
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:51,046
I'm sorry, but...

731
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:55,546
I don't think I can go back just yet.

732
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:01,446
There's something I need to do here.

733
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,010
Credits

734
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,836
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

735
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:26,646
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

736
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:31,936
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

737
01:06:31,936 --> 01:06:37,486
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

738
01:06:37,486 --> 01:06:42,476
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path, so just come to me  ♫

739
01:06:42,476 --> 01:06:44,406
   

740
01:06:44,406 --> 01:06:46,566
 The school. I need to go there. 

741
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:49,216
 If I remove my makeup, you can't really tell my age. 

742
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:51,316
 Do you think you're making sense right now? 

743
01:06:51,316 --> 01:06:53,046
 Not even as a teacher but as a student? 

744
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:54,136
 Let's look at your ID. 

745
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:56,906
 You're saying she has a clear identity. 

746
01:06:56,906 --> 01:07:00,156
 Yes, she is a student at Woojeong High School, 12th grade, Class 1. 

747
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:01,346
 What happened? 

748
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:02,216
 Are you happy to see me? 

749
01:07:02,216 --> 01:07:04,896
 Look at this shit! 

750
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:08,096
 Your list of leading suspects. There were three altogether, right? 

751
01:07:08,096 --> 01:07:11,176
 I'm going to stay as close as possible to them and observe. 

752
01:07:11,176 --> 01:07:14,600
 I'll start at school.
